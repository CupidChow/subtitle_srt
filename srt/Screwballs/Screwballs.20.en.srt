1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs…

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,871
30TH ANNIVERSARY
OF SOOK'S CAREER

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,873
WAS ONLY AN EXCUSE…

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,542
TO GET THE TEAM
TO LOOK THIS FABULOUS

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,012
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR MILESTONE, SOOK

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,346
PARTY IS OVER

7
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,383
OR SO IT SEEMED

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,620
AN EXCLUSIVE PARTY
IN THE LOTTE WORLD

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,391
I can join you even now.
I'm really outside. See you in a bit.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,126
Where exactly are we?

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,460
Who am I?

12
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,663
THIS PARTY IS AS UNPREDICTABLE
AS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,132
SPECIAL MISSIONS JUST FOR SOOK

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,800
We're going down!

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,301
Woo-jae!

16
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,836
Young K!

17
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,639
YOUNG K UNCOVERED
THE FIRST MISSION'S CODE

18
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,574
INFINITE GIRLS

19
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,411
-Now, let's move on to your next ride.
-Which is?

20
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,347
Before we do that,
can I go empty my stomach?

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,318
Okay, then. Shall we?

22
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,720
Let's go!

23
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:59,659
ALL AMUSEMENT PARKS
OFFER A DREAM-LIKE PARADE

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,495
TO GIVE CHILDREN
HOPES AND DREAMS

25
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,265
JOINING THE PARADE NOW IS…

26
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,133
All right. Let's greet the guests.

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,335
-Hello.
-Hello.

28
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,638
Hey, come on.

29
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,075
Don't worry about Sook, guys.
I'm her bodyguard for tonight.

30
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,778
SHOWING OFF PERFECT TEAMWORK
FOR NO REASON

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,249
A SPLENDID PARADE HANDCART
PREPARED JUST FOR SOOK

32
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,884
Sae-ho.

33
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm keeping Sook safe. Don't worry.

34
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,756
Sure, thanks a bunch, you rascals.

35
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,559
THE GIFT SHOP CATCHES THEIR EYES

36
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,127
-Hello.
-Over here, Young K.

37
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,195
It's for Young-hyun.

38
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,763
A fox headband for Young-hyun.

39
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,465
That's a dog headband, right?

40
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,200
-A puppy, yeah.
-I want the rabbit one.

41
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,968
-I want this one.
-Good.

42
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,503
We're hitting the road again.

43
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,737
Let's get moving!

44
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,040
-Come along.
-What a lovely treat this is.

45
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,176
To think Young K
is pulling the cart for me.

46
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,078
One, two, three, four.

47
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,015
ROLE-PLAYING AS
LOTTE WORLD EMPLOYEES

48
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,420
BLISSFULLY HAPPY

49
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,356
Our next stop is right here.

50
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,958
The pirate ship!

51
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,025
THE PIRATE SHIP

52
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,962
YOU CAN GO HIGHER
AND GET MORE THRILL AT BOTH ENDS

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,931
RELISH
THE EXHILARATING SENSATION

54
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,967
AS THE RIDE
TAKES THE DEEP PLUNGE

55
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,202
Thanks for the ride.

56
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,971
-Thank you.
-We've reached our stop.

57
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,940
I'm impressed by Young K.
He's so strong and solid.

58
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,443
I know. We don't have
anyone like him on our team.

59
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,546
The guys on our team
are on the frail side.

60
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,015
What do you mean?
You have three dedicated bodyguards here.

61
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,851
-All three of us are right here.
-I can easily carry them around.

62
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,053
How cool is that?

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,588
Unbelievable.

64
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,357
I have a question.

65
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,026
It's almost been an hour
since Young K has joined us.

66
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,427
-Already?
-So?

67
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,530
Would you be able to join us
for the final mission?

68
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,899
-I can't miss the pirate ship.
-All right!

69
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,433
MOVED

70
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,269
The mission you'll undertake here

71
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,205
-is "Dance Quiz."
-"Dance Quiz"?

72
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,506
-That's right.
-Okay.

73
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,108
Out of the six of you,

74
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,343
three will get on board the Pirate Ship.

75
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,282
You'll sit in the back row, which can be
exhilarating and scary at the same time.

76
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,853
The remaining three
will go to the area of our choice

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,023
and do a cover dance
of the K-pop idols' choreography

78
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,457
shown on screen.

79
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,293
The three people

80
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,795
will each be shown different dance videos

81
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,465
of the same idol group.

82
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,167
The others must guess the group correctly.

83
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,669
That's a piece of cake.

84
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,170
-Are you sure about this?
-Great.

85
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,805
Wait, there's one more rule.

86
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,874
What makes this game so special

87
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,442
is that the trio on the Pirate Ship

88
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,377
can only see the dancers
at the highest point.

89
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,279
-When we've reached that point?
-Exactly.

90
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,415
ONLY VISIBLE AT THIS POINT

91
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,482
How sneaky.

92
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,285
The whole crew members
are masters at tormenting us.

93
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,654
I'd love to go on the Pirate Ship
because I do dig the ride.

94
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,990
While we'd love to
have Woo-young up there…

95
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,892
-He has to dance.
-Yeah, since he's so good at it.

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,627
I think Jin-kyung should get up there.

97
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,862
Your dance moves
are bound to confuse us anyway.

98
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:50,997
No way.

99
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,832
-I agree.
-I'm a great dancer.

100
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,267
-Oh, no.
-You've got it wrong.

101
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,401
YOU CAN'T DANCE, CAN YOU?

102
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,670
Let's have Jin-kyung take the ride.
I'll stay down and dance.

103
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,939
-But Young K--
-Don't. I won't recognize the dance!

104
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,742
-The issue is that when Jin-kyung dances…
-It's confusing.

105
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,010
…we'll all be so confused.

106
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,346
Jin-kyung and I
won't be able to answer at all.

107
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,048
I swear we'll do our best
with the dance moves.

108
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,452
In that case, Young K, Woo-jae, and I
will go on the Pirate Ship.

109
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,886
I'm not a fan of the Pirate Ship,

110
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,221
-but I'll try to bear it.
-Okay.

111
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,024
-Is there a gift on the line too?
-I'll tell you what it is.

112
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,727
We took in Sook's hobby
while selecting the next gift.

113
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,895
-It's a camping lantern.
-My gosh!

114
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,998
-Let's do a chant.
-Are you all good with your roles?

115
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,233
-Are you good, Young-hyun?
-I couldn't be better.

116
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,969
-Three, two, one. Let's go!
-Let's go!

117
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,905
Please split into two groups
and go to your assigned posts.

118
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,541
Let's go. Good luck, dancers.
You've got this.

119
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,743
Good luck to you too.

120
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,144
Hello.

121
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,412
-Hello.
-Hello.

122
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,650
Won't the tree here obstruct their view?

123
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,652
Are you sure they can see us
at the highest point?

124
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,186
DANCERS HAVE REACHED THEIR SPOT

125
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,155
All right, then.

126
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,356
Ladies.

127
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,924
Please hear me out, team.

128
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,327
Forget about the moves
using your lower bodies

129
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,862
-unless they are the key elements.
-Okay.

130
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,964
But if they are important,

131
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,300
-you should--
-Scream "lower body"!

132
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,802
-But his clip won't be the same as ours.
-All clips are different.

133
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:03,870
Really?

134
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,539
Focus on moving your arms
and make those moves big.

135
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,174
All right, everyone.

136
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,810
Your costars on the Pirate Ship
must get four answers right

137
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,812
before the ride comes to a stop.

138
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,014
What? I thought
there was just one question.

139
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,417
So we have to get four answers right
during the ride.

140
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,651
Can we take a pass?

141
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,219
-That is allowed.
-Okay.

142
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,287
What's our game plan?

143
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,722
Should we all focus on Woo-young?

144
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,790
Well, wait…

145
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,092
-I think Jin-kyung would only confuse me.
-You have a point.

146
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,062
-Can I focus on Woo-young?
-I'll observe what Jin-kyung is doing.

147
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,129
Ready!

148
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,798
It's about to start.

149
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,599
Set.

150
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,335
Go!

151
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,236
DANCE QUIZ BEGINS
TAKE A GUESS WITH THE CAST

152
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,438
May we get the answers right.

153
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,440
Oh, great.

154
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,974
THEY ARE SLOWLY TAKEN UP HIGHER

155
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,010
-Where are they? Oh, there.
-Found them.

156
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,447
-Where are they? Oh, there.
-Found them.

157
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,816
THEY CAN SEE THE DANCERS
AT THE HIGHEST POINT

158
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:50,983
Hit me.

159
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,585
-Do I begin?
-What the…

160
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,487
DANCERS START TO PERFORM AS
THE PIRATE SHIP BEGINS TO MOVE

161
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,722
What the…

162
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,492
THE GROOVY MOVES
SOMEHOW SEEM FAMILIAR

163
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,565
WOO-YOUNG WAITS FOR THE PIRATE
SHIP TO REACH THE HIGHEST POINT

164
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,166
AND DANCES MORE VIGOROUSLY

165
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,901
-EXO!
-EXO!

166
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,803
-EXO!
-I'm gonna growl

167
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,938
That's "Growl"!

168
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,141
THE RIDE TAKES THEM EVEN HIGHER

169
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,210
NOW, LET'S SEE THE NEXT DANCES…

170
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,645
IS SHE MIMICKING A DELINQUENT?

171
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,282
IS THAT AN OLD-SCHOOL SHIMMYING?

172
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,053
THEIR ONLY HOPE IS THE YOUNGEST

173
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,921
Rain!

174
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,923
-Rain!
-Right, that's "Gang"!

175

Rain!

-Rain!
-Right, that's "Gang"!

179
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,831
There we go.

180
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,199
What's this now?

181
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,301
RATHER PROVOCATIVE

182
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,636
What is that?

183
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,271
-The thing with his butt…
-SISTAR!

184
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,339
It's SISTAR!

185
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,074
-SISTAR!
-SISTAR!

186
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,009
Come on. It's SISTAR!

187
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,677
SUNMI?

188
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,780
IT'S GOING HIGHER

189
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,114
-What is it, then?
-What's the answer?

190
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,749
Wait, what are those moves?

191
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,187
IT'D BE WEIRD IF THEY MANAGED TO
GET THE ANSWER FROM ALL THIS

192
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,690
THEY'RE COVERING DANCES
OF A K-POP GIRL GROUP

193
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,392
Wait, what are those moves?

194
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,795
-Don't mind her. Don't consider Jin-kyung.
-What are they?

195
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,696
WE'LL NOW REVEAL THE ANSWER

"DARLING," AND "EXPECTATION"

198
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,803
-Wait--
-Wonder Girls?

199
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,238
THE BUILT-UP MOMENTUM
IS TAKING THEM HIGHER STILL

200
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,873
-What's the answer?
-Just take a pass!

201
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,275
-We'll take a pass!
-Pass!

202
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,910
We're taking a pass!

THE GUYS WILL
ONLY WATCH WOO-YOUNG

210
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,327
It feels like we might take off.

211
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,395
-I love it.
-I'm cold.

212
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,930

NOT JANG WOO-YOUNG,
IT'S JANG WON-YOUNG

218
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,238
What is it?

219
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,973
I don't get it!

220
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,875
We're taking a pass!

221
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,643
-I have no idea.
-Whose dance is that?

222
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,445
WHAT SONG COULD THEY
BE DANCING TO?

223
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,147
MASTERFUL HIP MOVEMENTS

224
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,215
SISTAR!

225
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,850
No, we've already had SISTAR.

226
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,751
-Wait, that's KARA.
-KARA!

227
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,153
-KARA!
-KARA!

228
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,788
Just one more!

229
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,989
Didn't we get four already?

230
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,725
Dang it. We got timed out at three.

231
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,960
-Really?
-Yeah.

232
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,528
END OF THE RIDE

233
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,596
How many did we get?

234
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,064
We got three right.

235
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,198
All right, gentlemen.

236
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,334
You got two answers right.

237
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,401
-What?
-Just two?

238
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,103
-Not three?
-Wasn't the last one KARA?

239
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,171
No, it wasn't.

240
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,006
What's wrong with those dancers?

Can you loosen up a bit, Woo-young?

245
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,216
Do better, Woo-young!

246
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,818
NO ONE EXPECTS MORE
FROM THESE TWO

247
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,555
Could you please assign
the most famous dance to Woo-young?

248
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,459
We've decided not to even look
at Sook or Jin-kyung's dance, you see?

249
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,860
The trio told me

250
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,897
that they've been disregarding
Jin-kyung and Sook's dance moves.

251
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:51,998
-But why?
-How dare they?

252
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,133
I've been busting my butt here.

253
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,470
I've done great recreating
the key points of the dance.

254
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,272
What are the answers we got right?

255
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,439
Rain and EXO?

256
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,208
-Yeah, exactly.
-I see.

257
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,910
What was the answer to the third question?

258
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,311
Girl's Day.

259
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,013
-Girl's Day, huh?
-Gosh, Girl's Day.

OUR APOLOGIES, GIRL'S DAY

261
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,849
I'll tell you the songs too.

262
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,884
"Darling," "Expectation" and "Something."

263
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,587
-So that was "Something."
-So that's what it was.

264
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,155
I was so in the zone

265
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,190
that I barely sensed
the motions of the ride.

266
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,659
Not for me.

267
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,266
OFF THEY GO ONE LAST TIME

268
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,204
THEY SEEM MORE DETERMINED
THAN DURING THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT

269
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,373
We'll get to see them soon.

270

00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,252
IS SHE A SNIPER?

275
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,287
-SUNMI.
-SUNMI!

276
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,355
"Full Moon"!

277
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,057
-SUNMI.
-I think we've got it.

278
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,061
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU, WOO-YOUNG

279
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,228
Whose move was that?

280
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,564
Wait, it's TWICE.

281
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,932
-Isn't it "Cheer Up"?
-Whose was that?

282
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,201
TRY TURNING YOUR EYES

-I can't recall!

-It's aespa!
-It's aespa!

288
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,411
-They got it.
-It's aespa!

289
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,479
That's "Whiplash."

290
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,780
"Whiplash"!

291
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,148
SOOK HELPED THEM OUT THIS TIME

292
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,283
CURRENT SCORE: 2 POINTS

293
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,719

Make a guess already!

298
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,071
What are you waiting for?

299
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,539
-But…
-What's the answer?

300
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,675

-Give us the next one, quick!
-Come on!

310
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,135
THEY GOT 3 ANSWER SO FAR

311
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,170
KARA!

312
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,173

-Yeah, he's got it. It's KARA!

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,241
-That's the song.
-KARA.

315

316
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,612
TWICE!

317
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,946
Whose dance is that?

318
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,181
What on Earth?

319
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,449
THE ANSWER IS NOT
KARA NOR TWICE?

320
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,717
Damn you, Woo-jae!

321
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,285
Watch closely, damn it!

322
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,353
WOO-JAE KNOWS THIS DANCE?

323
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,889
The answer is KARA, no? So that's not it.

324
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,323
-Pass!
-I know the dance.

325
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,525

00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,299
THE WIND MADE HIM
LOSE HIS FAN SPIRIT

330
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,701
Where's this move from?

331
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,270
THE RIDE WILL STOP SOON

332
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,005
Come on, guys! Quickly!

333
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,940
THEY NEED TO GET
ONE MORE QUESTION RIGHT

334
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,709
LOOK AT ME

335
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,776

I think we've done it.

340

Yeah, I bet we did it.

FLOPPING DOWN TO THE FLOOR

342
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,992
That was far from easy.

DANCERS ARE EXHAUSTED

344
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,929
It wasn't easy at all.

345

LIFE HITS YOU HARD, RIGHT?

346
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,701
How many did they get?

347
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,704
I think we got the last one
thanks to Jin-kyung.

348
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,872
All thanks to this move.

349
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,307
Yeah, I caught that too.

350
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,309
But you never know with Jin-kyung.

351
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,578
She could do that exact move
while watching a different dance.

352
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,645
CAUTION IS A MUST

353
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,115
Judging by the director's gait
and the look, we only got three.

354
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,417
If we pulled off the mission,
it's all thanks to Jin-kyung.

355
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,353
His steps tell me that we got three right.

356
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,856
-Gentlemen.
-Did we get four?

357
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,290
What does your gut tell you?

358
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,059
-I'd say we got three.
-We got only three, no?

359
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,727
I'm sure we got four.

360
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,263
At any rate,
your second attempt is now over.

361
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,031
Please come and join your castmates.

362
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,333
Seriously?

363
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,001
So our time on this ride is over?

364
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,337
He wants one more ride.

365
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,405
It's not every day
you have the whole place to yourself.

366
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,975
I don't ever get nauseous, you see?

367
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,343
-Did you have fun?
-Well…

368
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,145
-So?
-We did have fun,

369
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,647
-but we're not sure about the last one.
-Hey, Jin-kyung.

370
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,082
We could say it's up to you.

371
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,150
-Me?
-By any chance,

372
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,052
if we had gotten the last one,
you'd be the hero of the day.

373
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,589
We saw your move at the very end

374
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,224
-and gave our answer.
-Okay.

375
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,360
If it turns out that we got it right,

376
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,828
We'll give you full credit.

377
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,429
-Okay, let's see.
-Really?

378
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,031
If we had gotten it right,

379
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,667
I promise to toss Jin-kyung into the air.

380
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,102
Lift me instead.

381
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,337
-All right. We'll do that for you.
-Sure.

382
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:29,608
So, you guessed SUNMI,
aespa, and 2PM correctly.

383
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,844
You also shouted out an answer
to the final question.

384
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,479
The correct answer to the question is…

385
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,548
WHILE THE OTHERS HALTED
FROM THE EXHAUSTION…

386
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,383
Come on, guys! Quickly!

387
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,450
Cheer up, baby

388
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,086
-TWICE!
-TWICE!

389
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,155
THE ANSWER TO
THE FINAL QUESTION IS…

390
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,223
It is indeed TWICE.

391
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,258
It is indeed TWICE.

392
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,661
COMPLETED THE MISSION
THANKS TO THIS QUEEN

393
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,462
-Hold me up.
-Wait.

394
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,331
-Grab your wrist.
-Are you sure you're okay?

395
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,632
Sure, I can carry Jin-kyung.

396
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,401
-In three, two, one.
-In three, two, one.

397
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,604
She's our hero!

398
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,873
We pulled through thanks to TWICE.

399
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,174
Who knew we'd see this day?

400
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,242
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

401
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,510
-Gosh, Jin-kyung.
-That was insane.

402
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,911
All right, then.

403
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,980
We won the camping lantern.

404
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,082
-Congrats.
-Can we see it? Oh, it's not in there.

405
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,785
We owe a lot to Young-hyun tonight.

406
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,653
Did I really help?

407
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,155
-Sure.
-Of course.

408
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,389
You were incredibly helpful.

409
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,658
-Can you tell us your take on our show?
-Oh, gosh.

410
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,393
I had so much fun tonight.

411
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,162
If you ever hit me up again

412
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,498
when I'm not out of the country,
I'll come running for another fun day.

413
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,868
My gosh.
He's an honorary member of the team.

414
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,769
If by any chance…

415
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,338
Of course, Woo-young has been doing great,

416
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,174
but if you need a guest at your concerts,
we'll be delighted to join you.

417
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,209
-Sure--
-Why would they ever need you, though?

418
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,677
-On concerts--
-That's hardly likely.

419
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,412
-I was just suggesting.
-Sure.

420
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,015
Maybe if we actually release
a song together or something…

421
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,818
Let's let Young K go before we make
more unreasonable demands.

422
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
Okay, then.

423
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,987
-Let's do that.
-All right.

424
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,822
Thank you so much for your time!

425
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,258
WE'RE REALLY LETTING YOU GO
THIS TIME

426
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,260
-I hope to see you again.
-You did amazing tonight.

427
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,361
See you.

428
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,629
-I had fun.
-Thank you.

429
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,965
Let's resume the parade to our next stop.

430
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,033
Again?

431
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,335
Young K was great at pulling the cart.

432
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,371
Trust me to handle it.

433
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,708
OFF SHE GOES ON THE PARADE CART
PULLED BY HER COSTAR

434
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,111
WAIT, IS THAT JIN-KYUNG?

435
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,679
Where are all the guys?

436
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,249
I knew it. No one's up for it
now that Young K is gone.

437
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,818
-Sae-ho is over there on the phone.
-Is he now?

438
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,220
-Where's Woo-young?
-What a mess.

439
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,256
-Woo-jae is getting his hair done again.
-Like I said, it's a mess.

440
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,092
See? We should let the whole world
know about their true colors.

441
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,160
Are we going?

442
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,662
So we're moving?

443
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,829
I'll see you guys there.

444
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,665
LIMPS BACK IN

445
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,732
Are you okay?

446
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,001
-You're so annoying.
-What's wrong with you?

447
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,069
Let's go.

448
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,604
-You are our worst enemies.
-I'm tired too.

449
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,005
Can't I hop on, Sook?

450
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,073
I'm worn out too.

451
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,808
GIVE US SOME SPACE

452
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,777
-Can't I get a ride? My legs hurt.
-Unbelievable.

453
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,679
-I'm just as tired.
-But your legs are fine!

454
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,581
-Are you okay?
-Let me ride the cart.

455
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,584
Look at that rascal.
Come here and take the cart.

456
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,652
I'm recovering, okay?

457
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,021
-We're celebrating my milestone!
-All right, fine.

458
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,958
Are you good, Jin-kyung?
Is it not too tiresome?

459
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,592
It sure is. You can take my place.

460
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,860
IS HE LOOKING OUT FOR HER?

461
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,263
Well, I wanted to tell you
how to position your body better.

462
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,798
-You can take my place.
-Don't hold here.

463
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,733
-Place your hands like this.
-No, that's the wrong idea.

464
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,168
Place your center to the front.

465
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,569
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

466
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,104
-Okay, great job.
-There you go.

467
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,939
Bend your knees a bit.

468
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,007
Hold on.

469
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,776
-Why is it moving so slowly?
-Wait, why am I doing this?

470
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,812
Fine, I'll take your place.

471
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,280
We're almost there.

472
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,716
Come on. I want to help you two
get to the destination.

473
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,051
-Are we getting no more rides?
-I'm hopping on, then.

474
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,022
HE MAY BE CHILDISH,
BUT HE'S GOOD-HEARTED

475
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,790
Let's roll. Give us some…

476
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,227
A DEEP SIGH

477
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,596
TURNS INTO A STATUE

478
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,499
HE'S FOOLING AROUND AGAIN

479
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,767
Don't turn this into a joke.

480
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,136
-He's at it again.
-Bring back Young K.

481
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,404
We need him back.

482
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,139
Enough with the jokes.

483
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,207
It's moving now.

484
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,743
NO MORE PRANKS, OFF WE GO!

485
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,044
-Seriously…
-My mime game rocked, no?

486
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,712
-It sure was.
-You bought me, didn't you?

487
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,381
How am I doing, Sook?

488
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,515
Great.

489
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,217
This is enjoyable.

490
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,452
THIS IS HOW HE LOOKS
WHEN HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING

491
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,456
RUSHING TO THE NEXT SPOT
AT FULL SPEED

492
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,260
Honestly, he's the worst prankster
among my super-tall friends.

493
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,728
He loves jokes too much.

494
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,130
I know. He's at it again.

495
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,931
Wait, isn't he now in his 40s?

496
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,733
WOO-JAE WILL ASSIST SOOK
UNTIL HER 100TH BIRTHDAY

497
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,903
Team, we've met so many guests today.

498
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,805
-Yeah.
-An A-list star was just with us,

499
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,074
-joining you for the rides.
-For sure.

500
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,375
The truth is…

501
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,177
Do we have another guest?

502
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,713
The crew made a special arrangement

503
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,881
to book a certain guest.

504
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,582
-I got chills.
-They waited until this late?

505
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,117
It's 1:00 a.m.

506
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,852
I've been in this industry
for quite some time,

507
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,022
but I rarely request a guest
to be on set by midnight.

508
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,791
-Gosh, I feel bad.
-Considering the late hours,

509
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,726
this person is a true professional.

510
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,027
-Who can it be?
-The thing is,

511
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,595
we have the new season

512
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,998
and Sook's career milestone to celebrate.

513
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,736
So we made a rather tall order to Netflix.

514
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:51,904
TO NETFLIX?

515
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,140
We asked if they could invite
a cast member from their recent hits

516
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,409
-to visit our shoot.
-Seriously?

517
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,811
Netflix's recent hits?

518
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,012
-An actor?
-There are so many.

519
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,380
-Karma.
-Karma.

520
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,948
-When Life Gives You Tangerines.
-Gosh!

521
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,550
The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call…

522
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,120
By the time this episode is released,
Squid Game: Season 3 will be up too.

523
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,188
That's right.

524
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,192
NETFLIX ALSO STREAMED
MANY OTHER INTERESTING STORIES

525
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,795
Our guest tonight appeared

526
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,597
in The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call.

527
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,798
Ju Ji-hoon?

528
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,867
Our guest must be him.

529
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,536
-Please come in.
-What on earth?

530
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,271
Who's that?

531
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,673
IS IT REALLY JU JI-HOON?

532
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,708
-What on earth?
-Who's that?

533
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,445
Code Blue.

534
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,747
A patient requires an immediate operation.

535
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,650
Someone's coming.

536
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,619
WHERE IS THE PATIENT?

537
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,626
-What on earth?
-Who's that?

538
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,161
-Isn't that RADO?
-It is RADO.

539
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,897
What does he have to do with the show?

540
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,098
Because he looks like Ju Ji-hoon?

541
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,435
Is he here as Ju Ji-hoon's look-alike?

542
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,403
-That's just…
-You're asking for an uproar here.

543
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,572
YOU HAD TO CROSS THAT LINE, HUH?

544
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,241
Netflix might actually kick us off.

545
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,509
What do you think you're doing?

546
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,144
Stop kidding around, you folks.

547
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,779
I'm Professor Baek Kang-hyuk
in charge of the Trauma Department.

548
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,682
-Wait, RADO. Did you get a ticket?
-That was funny.

549
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,050
-Just a second.
-Did you get a ticket?

550
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,485
Hello? Yes.

551
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,553
PROF. BAEK TAKES THE CALL
LOOKING SERIOUS

552
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,754
How come you got a downgrade--

553
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,222
Shut it!

554
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,557
You heard me, didn't you?

555
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,192
Shut it!

556
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,260
You heard me, didn't you?

557
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,327
THEY DO LOOK ALIKE

558
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,163
Stop yapping and get a chopper in the air.

559
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,230
WHERE'S THE CHOPPER?

560
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,366
We've got a downgraded version
of Baek Kang-hyuk.

561
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,234
HOW DARE YOU BRING UP
JU JI-HOON? BEATEN-UP JI-HOON

562
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,369
JI-HOON AS A BUDDHIST MONK

563
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,038
-Please welcome Ju Ji-hoon!
-Oh, hello.

564
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,307
He actually called him Ju Ji-hoon.

565
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,177
I'm Professor Baek Kang-hyuk
of the Trauma Department.

566
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,811
You could've made an effort

567
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,780
to wear a wig or something.

568
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,949
-But you came without one.
-I got nervous for a second.

569
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,251
-I thought it might be Choo Young-woo.
-Oh, no.

570
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,854
-Oh, no.
-Why don't you wear this?

571
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,122
-Please don't.
-I insist.

572
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,157
-There's no way Prof. Baek would wear it.
-Still. Go on.

573
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,026
I'M BAEK KANG-HYUK,
DON'T DO THIS TO ME

574
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,093
Hey, tie him up.

575
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,161
PLOP ONTO HIS HEAD

576
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,630
See? It's better now.

577
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,898
-Much better.
-Yeah.

578
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:00,966
AN OPERATION IN PROGRESS

579
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,335
Now he looks the part!

580
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,338
I got a glimpse of the end of my life

581
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,706
-I'm sorry to interject--
-Keep it on.

582
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,007
How did this guy here

583
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,243
manage to hold back
from joining us for so long?

584
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,781
We made a special request to him
to join us for Sook's big milestone.

585
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:16,848
That's amazing.

586
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,116
He's such a loyal friend.

587
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,685
You're incredibly loyal.

588
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,054
-It's way too late, too.
-I wouldn't miss it for the world.

589
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,290
HOT-SHOT MUSIC PRODUCER, RADO

590
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,626
HERE'S THE LIST
OF HIS SMASHING HITS

591
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,961
AND THAT WAS JUST
A FEW OF HIS HITS

592
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,496
HE ALSO PRODUCED
UNBALANCE'S "NEVER"

593
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,966
IT'D BE A SHAME NOT TO INVITE

594
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,500
THIS HONORARY MEMBER
TO SOOK'S PARTY

595
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,835
-How have you been?
-Me?

596
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,670
-Yeah.
-Well, same old, I guess.

597
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,172
We sometimes run into each other

598
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,740
-because we go to the same gym.
-Right.

599
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,041
-So you do see each other.
-We do…

600
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,710
-Often too.
-…and sometimes have lunch together.

601
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,878
Still, I was so startled.
I didn't know you were coming.

602
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,548
I have a story to share too.
I go to gym everyday,

603
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,985
so I know the members there, you see?

604
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,154
I saw this beautiful lady
running on the treadmill.

605
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,856
Then came Sae-ho.

606
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,424
So I said, "Hey, it's been a while."

607
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,594
Then I saw him go up to her
and chat her up like it was no big deal.

608
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,329
RADO then said, "What the hell, dude?"

609
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,430
-He'd do that.
-I was puzzled.

610
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,100
When I asked him what was wrong,
he chided me for talking to her…

611
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,035
-He's a married guy.
-…and making physical contact.

612
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,604
He was right in her face too.
"Did you work out a lot?"

613
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,672
-So--
-I was so startled.

614
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,075
I was so confused by how he treated me,
like I was some bad nutcase.

615
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,777
-I went, "It's not like that."
-I get it, though.

616
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,112
-He went, "Who is she?"
-I get it.

617
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,179
So I said, "It's my wife."

618
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,414
THANK GOODNESS, RIGHT?

619
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,016
So he was stunned by her beauty.

620
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,317
CLEARED UP
THE BIG MISUNDERSTANDING

621
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,752
I was so puzzled, you see?

622
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,154
About what, exactly?

623
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,623
By the thought that's hitting you now.

624
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,825
I'm sure we're all on the same page here.

625
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:34,893
Just how…

626
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,895
REGARDLESS,
WE WISH YOU HAPPINESS

627
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,465
-It's rich coming from you, RADO.
-Woo-jae's got a point.

628
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,001
-Aren't you in a similar situation?
-We heard about your happy news.

629
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,604
-You're not the one to talk.
-You even kept it from us

630
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,439
for such a long time too.

631
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,607
CONGRATS, RADO AND BOMI

632
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,442
But good looks are never my priority.

633
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,077
-What?
-I never focus on appearance.

634
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,545
-Cut it out.
-Geez.

635
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,314
-I knew you'd react this way--
-Let's be real.

636
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,549
Bomi is the one
who doesn't prioritize good looks.

637
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,518
Excuse me?
She's the one who sees beyond that.

638
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,053
She doesn't consider looks at all.

639
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,854
HEH-HEH

640
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,156
How did you meet your wife?

641
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,191
-Good looks are high up in her priority.
-He paid her.

642
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,727
My goodness. That's incredible, dude.

643
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,362
I mean it.

644
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,764
Out of all guests we met today,
RADO makes me the happiest.

645
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,267
-We've met so many friendly faces today.
-Tell me about it.

646
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,535
He almost feels like our team.

647
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,203
-Gosh, RADO.
-He is one of us.

648
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,039
The truth is, he contacted me,
asking when we'd like to have him.

649
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,442
-Really?
-He always keeps us in mind.

650
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,143
There's one more thing
he always reminds me.

651
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,213
Remember the clip of him singing "If You"?
He always tells me its view counts.

652
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,648
So how many views now?

653
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,882
Has it reached a million views?

654
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,250
Come on, you know the answer.

655
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,452
Don't be coy.

656
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,221
-We're far past the five million mark.
-Really?

657
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,623
To be exact, Sook,
we're closer to seven million views.

658
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,725
Just look at him.

659
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,660
He's acting like
he was born for this moment.

660
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,495
Look how bright his eyes are.

661
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,030
He's very hyped up, I see.

662
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,400
-We should make another hit tonight.
-Another one?

663
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,202
Things don't happen if you try so hard.

664
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,770
-Let's keep it natural.
-Natural?

665
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,838
Okay, understood.

666
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,540
We have a special guest, Ju Ji-hoon,
here on the set.

667
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,542
I'll now tell you why we invited him over.

668
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,711
This will also serve
as the explanation of the game.

669
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,980
There are tons of gifts
lined up at the back.

670
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,883
As you can see,
we have prepared a variety of gifts.

671
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,753
THESE ARE EMPTY BOXES, BUT WE'LL
GET YOU THE ITEMS IF YOU WIN

672
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,255
The game is called "Secure the Gift."

673
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,891
Each of you will tackle the game,
and the ones that succeed

674
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,727
will be given the honor
of presenting a gift to Sook.

675
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,096
Hooray. It's my lucky day.

676
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,332
-So they'll win them for me?
-That's right.

677
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,833
We won't have to work hard, then.

678
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,201
Come on.

679
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,836
-You're one of us, remember?
-Oh, right.

680
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,938
Don't forget her big heart, RADO.

681
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,940
-She might actually give it to you.
-That's right.

682
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,542
-How magnanimous.
-That's likely.

683
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,879
-You'll find a door to your right.
-I can see it.

684
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,081
It is made of Styrofoam,

685
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,516
so you can easily crush it

686
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,317
-by running into it.
-I see.

687
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,319
Now, I'll tell you the rules.

688
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,389
The game starts
when the door opens for you.

689
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,491
Please rush toward the gifts,

690
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,795
pick up a gift of your choice,
and return to the door.

691
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,531
Then, smash into the door
and come through while holding the gift.

692
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,466
Your attempt
will then be seen as a success.

693
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,201
We'll give you ten seconds.

694
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,702
-Ten seconds?
-Goodness.

695
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,638
THAT SEEMS DOABLE

696
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,641
There's a penalty
for not meeting the time limit.

697
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,676
-Remember Sook's decoys?
-Sure.

698
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,212
The four decoys
will be waiting behind the door

699
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,915
and give you a beating with toy hammers.

700
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,082
What should I do?

701
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,150
We actually have a plan.

702
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,287
-RADO will play in your place.
-Really?

703
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,222
I took a look at the gifts

704
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,824
and their distance from here.

705
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,360
-You can't get the ones in the back.
-You assumed we couldn't return with them.

706
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,596
But isn't the plunger
right up front too lame?

707
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,664
Right there.

708
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,799
-Can we look around?
-Sure.

709
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,202
-Go right ahead.
-All right.

710
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,971
WE WEREN'T SURE WHAT YOU'D LIKE,
SO WE PREPARED A VARIETY

711
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,207
You needn't bother with toothpaste.

712
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,843
-Let's just skip this section.
-We'll forget about it.

713
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,778
What's your choice, Sook?

714
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,947
I'd love to get that toaster.

715
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,014
Do you need one?

716
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,783
Sure, I don't have one.

717
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,618
-I'd love the beam projector too.
-I'll get that.

718
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,287
I don't have a massager either.

719
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,356
Look. "Showrunner's personal credit card."

720
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,692
Guys, there's actually
"Showrunner's personal credit card."

721
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,027
Does this mean I get to use your card?

722
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,196
Sook. Why don't I upgrade your ride?

723
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,698
MY RIDE?

724
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,800
Do we actually have a vehicle there?

725
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,368
I'll get you that one.

726
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,370
BUT A GIFT IN THE THIRD SECTION

727
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,438
MIGHT ACTUALLY
BANKRUPT THE COMPANY

728
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,007
-Would you like Kia Tasman?
-Sure.

729
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,710
-I'd love that. I dig trucks.
-You would, right? I'll get you that.

730
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,613
I ran a simulation in my mind just now.

731
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,349
It will take 1.5 seconds
to come out through the door.

732
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,351
Running to this point
will take five seconds or so.

733
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,619
-It doesn't seem so bad.
-Yeah.

734
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,354
-We'll manage.
-That only took three seconds.

735
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,155
-It's more than enough.
-Here's the thing.

736
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,057
We'll assign a disadvantage to all of you.

737
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,192
That's more like it.

738
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,628
There's no way you'd hand out gifts
for almost nothing.

739
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,999
For Sook,
we prepared a star item of the show.

740
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,166
It's a pony.

741
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,205
-So the time limit wasn't everything.
-You're breaking our spirits.

742
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,873
-I knew something was off.
-Newspaper delivery.

743
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,941
CHAEBOLS' SPECIAL RIDE

744
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,844
Gosh, why is this so rough?

745
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,045
GUARANTEED TO WORK YOUR THIGHS

746
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,314
SHOULD I GIVE IT ALL UP?

747
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,717
We prepared something unique
for our special guest, RADO.

748
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,853
-Are you familiar with hippety-hop?
-Oh, sure.

749
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,922
You must've ridden one as a child.
The rubber horse.

750
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,323
Oh, I know what it is.

751
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,725
Can I get whatever that'll be most fun?

752
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,427
He doesn't care about the gifts.

753
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,296
-Yeah, you're spot on.
-He cares more about laughs.

754
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,530
-Next, Jin-kyung.
-Yeah?

755
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,899
We prepared a special item for you.

756
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,367
-It's a dinosaur suit.
-A dinosaur what?

757
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,435
A dinosaur suit.

758
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,770
It's a hassle to wear it.

759
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,305
That's it exactly.

760
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,507
As for Woo-young,

761
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,275
you'll wear boxing gloves
and acupressure slippers.

762
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,877
-That doesn't sound so bad.
-It's good.

763
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,178
They won't give him any problems.

764
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,746
-It'd be a cakewalk.
-Okay.

765
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,882
Next, Woo-jae.

766
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,351
Yours is pretty neat. It's simple.

767
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,521
Go pick up a gift without disadvantage.

768
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,258
You only need to give Sook
a piggyback ride before going in.

769
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,693
I HAVE TO CARRY A PERSON?

770
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,797
I dare say the special occasion
calls for extra effort from you.

771
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,198
Now, who wants to go first?

772
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,399
-First off… Woo-young.
-I'll do it.

773
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,467
-Go ahead.
-Let's get it.

774
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,970
Now, Woo-young. You have to wear
boxing gloves and acupressure slippers.

775
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,137
Bring back whatever you want.

776
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,439
I'll get Mon Cher Fresh Cream Cake.

777
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,007
That brat.

778
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,242
-Why would you choose that?
-I'm craving them.

779
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,811
I can buy one for myself.

780
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,279
HUNGRY WOO-YOUNG'S TOP CHOICE

781
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,248
HE'S WEARING HIS GLOVES

782
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,484
AND THE ACUPRESSURE SLIPPERS

783
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,654
Everyone, let me introduce you
to the decoys you saw earlier.

784
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,356
So they were stationed in that getup?

785
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,391
HERE COMES THE DECOY QUARTET

786
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,792
They look so adorable.

787
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,929
I half expected to see burly men.

788
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,597
Welcome, guys.

789
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,200
-No wonder you were confused.
-Please go to your post.

790
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,669
I'm going to take this seriously.

791
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,903
Good luck, Woo-young!

792
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,105
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

793
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,206
Wait, Director.

794
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,641
Can we bring back multiple boxes?

795
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,908
Of course.

796
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,678
I've played a lot of similar games
on Let's Go Dream Team and such.

797
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,346
This is going to be a cakewalk.

798
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,150
LIFE AND SOUL OF SCREWBALLS

799
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,152
THE MAN WITH NIMBLE JOINTS

800
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,956
THE YOUNGEST WITH LUNGS
OF A RUNNER

801
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,224
You've got this, Woo-young!

802
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,392
Good luck!

803
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:43,828
Ready.

804
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,665
Go!

805
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,668
-Pick up some speed, will you?
-What's he doing?

806
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,703
-Pick up some speed, will you?
-What's he doing?

807
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,104
Ten seconds would've passed already.

808
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,440
THE ACUPRESSURE SLIPPERS
TOOK THEIR DAMAGE

809
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,308
-Nine. Ten.
-Your time's up, dude.

810
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,376
EACH STEP IS PAINFUL

811
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,512
-What do you think you're doing?
-Run, will you?

812
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,514
-Seriously, dude.
-Don't overdo it.

813
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,016
-I'm disappointed.
-Go on and run. Don't be like that.

814
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,619
HE PACKS A MEAN PUNCH, AT LEAST

815
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,755
-You failed!
-Seriously?

816
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,757
TOY HAMMER GALORE AFTER
THE TORTUROUS ACUPRESSURE

817
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,025
TEARS

818
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,927
I want to get a piece of him too.

819
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,095
What's his deal?

820
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,463
How could he fail like that?

821
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,799
Even I would be quicker than him.

822
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,768
The slippers hurt so badly.

823
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,605
What was all that about?
All you brought is a box of desserts.

824
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,040
-Hey, Woo-young.
-Come on, Woo-young.

825
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,509
-You had the smallest disadvantage.
-Seriously, dude.

826
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,511
The acupressure hurts real bad.

827
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,746
Who's up next?

828
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,814
SOOK WITH HER PONY

829
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,182
How does she depart with her pony?

830
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,051
She can start riding it from this point
and leave it there when she returns.

831
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,319
Okay.

832
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,821
Great.

833
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,191
You can't possibly succeed
with the pony in under ten seconds.

834
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,760
-It's too difficult.
-Won't it slide all the way across?

835
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,262
-If you need anything…
-It's not as you imagine, RADO.

836
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,364
-It's on wheels.
-It doesn't work that way.

837
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,567
-What do you mean?
-You can see for yourself.

838
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,202
Ready.

839
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,303
ONLY A FEW KNOW OF THE PAIN

840
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,437
Set.

841
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,041
GUFFAW

842
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,447
RADO HAS NEVER SEEN
SUCH A THING BEFORE

843
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,584
GIDDY-UP

844
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,886
BARELY MANAGES
TO GET TOOTHBRUSH SET

845
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:15,954
It's like actual riding.

846
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,222
-You'd have to move like this.
-Sure.

847
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,556
What an uncomfortable ride.

848
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,858
Wait.

849
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,659
I learned something.

850
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,062
This is much more challenging
than you'd think.

851
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,931
It's not easy turning it around.

852
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,767
Nothing is easy, I tell you.

853
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,769
Can't you give us 20 seconds?

854
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,437
Would you like to try again
within 20 seconds?

855
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,505
Sure!

856
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,340
The pony ride
still seems pretty easy to me.

857
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,108
-I suggest you try it later.
-Okay.

858
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,376
Okay, let's do it.

859
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,178
Ready.

860
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,279
Set.

861
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,380
NEW TIME LIMIT: 20 SECONDS

862
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,315
Focus. Gallop!

863
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,383
Go on!

864
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,485
How adorable is that?

865
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,788
-She's so freaking cute.
-Totally, right?

866
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,791
USING THE EXTRA TIME,
SOOK RODE A BIT FURTHER AWAY

867
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,426
Bring it back. Good job.

868
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,494
GOT A FLOOR LAMP

869
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,695
-Good luck.
-You're almost there.

870
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,330
MAKING A BIG C TO TURN AROUND

871
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,732
Gosh, she's an excellent rider.

872
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,767
STRUGGLING

873
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,472
-She's doing her absolute best.
-Your efforts are duly noted.

874
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,374
You're almost there. Go through the door!

875
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,412
You failed!

876
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,715
EVEN SOOK CAN'T AVOID
THE ONSLAUGHT OF HAMMERS

877
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,385
Dang it.

878
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,586
Hold on.

879
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,656
A BIG SIGH

880
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,924
Wait.

881
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,159
Can we have RADO take the pony for a ride?

882
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,861
-Can I try it just once?
-Go ahead.

883
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,796
-I don't see what the fuss is about.
-Try it.

884
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,566
-I mean…
-Surely, it can't be that difficult.

885
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,869
Hold on.

886
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,738
BREATHLESS LAUGHTER

887
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,409
Wait, so mounting itself is difficult.

888
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,476
Okay, I got it.

889
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,378
You'll learn to praise me.

890
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,781
Oh, he's good.

891
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,516
You have 20 seconds.

892
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,584
A GAME CHARACTER?

893
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,785
Let's see how far he goes.

894
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,155
Look at him pulling tricks.

895
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,491
HE'S COME BACK WITH A NEW ITEM

896
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,693
My gosh.

897
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,760
Goodness.

898
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,697
Gosh, he's become a kangaroo.

899
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,633
-Ji-hoon.
-He's so good at this.

900
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,869
-How is he so good?
-That was impressive, Ji-hoon.

901
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,671
-I'll skip the knee pads.
-He doesn't want them.

902
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,206
Listen up, everyone.

903
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,842
I must remind you
that we have zero presents here.

904
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,644
THEY'VE BEEN DEVASTATINGLY
OFF THEIR GAME

905
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,479
-You failed!
-What sort of a milestone party

906
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,681
-has no gifts?
-I'm afraid this game's going to bomb.

907
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:27,886
-Let's hope that RADO will turn it around.
-Yeah, let's do that.

908
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,854
Good luck, RADO!

909
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,523
Since RADO is our special guest,

910
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,259
we'll give him an extra five seconds.

911
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,227
-Good, right?
-He deserves that.

912
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,528
-RADO.
-Yeah?

913
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,330
-Aim high, okay?
-Sure.

914
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,901
HE'LL GO FOR THE THIRD SECTION!

915
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,802
I have a pretty intense workout routine.

916
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,872
But it's not so…

917
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,340
-It's not so what?
-Wait.

918
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,875
Well, it's not that impressive…

919
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:51,943
I expected more, but…

920
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,144
Good work, though.

921
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,747
Ready.

922
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,948
Set.

923
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,850
GO

924
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,553
-He's good.
-He's become a kangaroo.

925
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,422
We should've told him
to take off the stethoscope.

926
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,992
HE OPTED TO REMAIN
IN CHARACTER AS PROFESSOR BAEK

927
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,628
Get us the floor lamp, RADO.

928
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,030
Take off the stethoscope.

929
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,999
-You wanted the beam projector, right?
-Sure! Now, get back here quickly.

930
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,870
I think he can make it.

931
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,438
-Remove his stethoscope.
-I think he can make it.

932
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,906
UNFORTUNATELY, HE DROPS HIS BOX

933
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:22,974
Let me take it off.

934
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,076
-No, just keep going.
-You can make it!

935
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,613
CRASHING IN

936
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,548
WHILE HE DID PASS THE DOOR…

937
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,916
You failed!

938
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,186
-He left the gift behind.
-Hey, the gift! That's the main thing!

939
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,789
-He's out, then.
-You failed!

940
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,258
EVEN THE DOCTOR
CAN'T AVOID THE POUNDING

941
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,260
SPECTATOR TO THE PUNISHMENT

942
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,761
LEFT ALL ALONE

943
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,929
-Think about it.
-Hey, my gift!

944
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,532
Why ditch the gift
after bringing it all the way here?

945
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,733
Why would you leave it here?

946
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,568
Why did you drop it behind you?

947
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,270
You should've taken it with you.

948
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,538
You had to take it with you.

949
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,441
Wait. This just goes to show
how difficult it is to take it with us.

950
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,443
You didn't specify
that I had to bring it in.

951
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,944
-He did do that.
-He told us that.

952
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,813
That's why the crew used big boxes.

953
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,081
THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON

954
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,415
I had to save myself, you see.

955
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,484
You had to save yourself?

956
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,487
It's not as if they'd kill you
if you hadn't made it back there.

957
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,256
This is hilarious.

958
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,527
WOO-YOUNG IS ON THE PROWL
WHILE THE DOOR IS REPLACED

959
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,030
Director. Are you sure
the Kia Tasman box is where it should be?

960
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,033
THE CAMERA CAN BARELY CATCH IT

961
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,706
Can you even see that with your camera?

962
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,010
WE MADE A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT JUST
IN CASE THE TEAM MIGHT SUCCEED

963
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,411
Why don't Jin-kyung have a go next?

964
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,812
Okay.

965
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,214
NEXT UP IS JIN-KYUNG

966
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,450
I'm not exactly getting anything here.

967
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,321
SOOK STILL HAS NOTHING

968
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,590
SOOK…

969
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,892
I'm just doing it for you.

970
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,195
SHE ENDURED THE FRIGHTENING RIDE
FOR SOOK'S SAKE

971
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,601
AND DANCED UNTIL SHE COLLAPSED

972
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,804
IN THE END, SHE'S DECIDED TO GO
OVER TO THE DARK SIDE FOR SOOK!

973
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,539
But that doesn't allow her
to use her hands.

974
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,408
Can she hold onto anything?

975
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,312
The massive predator
emerges from the darkness.

976
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,615
Look at its sharp teeth

977
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,918
-and the menacing glare toward its prey.
-Wait.

978
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,353
I can't see your hands, Jin-kyung.

979
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,121
HERE ARE HER HANDS

980
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,423
Can you grab anything?

981
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,857
She has to wait behind the door.

982
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,727
-Look at her.
-She has to start from behind the wall.

983
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,597
AT ANY RATE, HERE'S THE VICIOUS
SUPER-SIZED DINOSAUR

984
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,201
This is incredible.
I can't believe you brought in this suit.

985
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,603
Goodness, it's really you in there.

986
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,905
Is Jin-kyung really in here?

987
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,973
-Do you think you can grab the gift?
-Jin-kyung.

988
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,442
-Is it really you?
-Yeah.

989
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,811
-How long do I get?
-My goodness.

990
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,612
-I'll give you 15 seconds.
-Where are your hands?

991
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,680
-My gosh.
-Right here.

992
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,748
Fifteen seconds?

993
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,816
How cute.

994
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,350
Allow her to start from here.

995
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,186
BOUNCY

996
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,687
What do you want, Sook?

997
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,155
Me?

998
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,592
Shall I get you that truck?

999
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,893
-The truck?
-Yeah.

1000
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,328
I'll try to get it for you.

1001
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,396
-The truck?
-Yeah.

1002
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,865
Use your tail. Use it to clear your path.

1003
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,502
SO THIS IS HER CRUTCH NOW?

1004
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,237
Ready.

1005
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,606
-She gets an additional 5 seconds, right?
-She gets 15 seconds.

1006
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,707
You've got this!

1007
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,676
Ready. Set.

1008
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,244
GO

1009
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,312
WADDLING

1010
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,148
See? She's fast. I knew she could do it.

1011
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,784
-Go for the truck.
-She's making good progress.

1012
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,352
I knew she could do it.

1013
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,587
RACING TOWARD HER TARGET

1014
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,021
SWISH

1015
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,124
INCREDIBLE CONTROL

1016
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,327
WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE WATCHING?

1017
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,595
She's so good.

1018
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,663
CRACKING UP

1019
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,599
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1020
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,301
THE TARGET IS NOW WITHIN SIGHT

1021
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,972
FLAILS AND MISSES THE ROPE

1022
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,640
Look, she's coming.

1023
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,042
Just push past the other boxes.

1024
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,277
Hurry!

1025
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,778
Don't forget to come in with the box.

1026
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,213
You have to bring it with you.

1027
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,648
-Go in together.
-Keep it in your hands.

1028
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,150
OKAY, GOT IT

1029
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,890
BAM, CRACK!

1030
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,124
RIP, RIP

1031
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,994
FALLS FLAT ON HER FACE

1032
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,496
BARELY MADE HER WAY IN

1033
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,166
WHILE FLOUNDERING
LIKE A LIVE FISH

1034
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,233
You failed!

1035
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,769
She was trying to get through that door
with the gift.

1036
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,272
THE T-REX IS GETTING TENDERIZED

1037
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,574
DANG IT

1038
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,910
Did you see how the head got stuck

1039
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,545
and the neck was bent as she went in?

1040
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,946
-The neck just snapped.
-Are you okay?

1041
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,849
OH, THE SORROWS
OF HAVING A LONG NECK

1042
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:25,917
Professor Baek Kang-hyuk!

1043
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,685
-Wait--
-Professor Baek Kang-hyuk!

1044
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,688
Hold on a second.

1045
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,192
Are you okay?

1046
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,693
TURNS INTO A VET
TO HANDLE THE CRISIS

1047
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,061
Do you experience pain in any area?

1048
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,129
How long do I have to live?

1049
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,864
-Your blood pressure seems fine.
-A few months?

1050
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,332
All right. You're good.

1051
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,135
Shall I give her CPR?

1052
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,937
CPR? He's doing it.

1053
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,104
He's doing mouth-to-mouth.

1054
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,775
WHY WOULD HE PERFORM THAT
TO THE PERFECTLY FINE T-REX?

1055
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,346
-Are you okay?
-Your claws seem fine.

1056
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,914
KILLED BY BAD BREATH

1057
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,049
Please call the chopper.

1058
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,818
Look at the shape she left, Sook.

1059
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,920
Why does it look like this?

1060
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,655
It's shaped like the dinosaur suit.

1061
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,693
She left the exact imprint.

1062
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,294
Jin-kyung went through like this?

1063
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,862
-It looks like a footprint.
-Yeah.

1064
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,030
RESEMBLES A FOSSILIZED FOOTPRINT

1065
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,900
She would've succeeded
if she had chosen a gift placed nearer.

1066
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,702
-That's true.
-She sure could've done it.

1067
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,471
-She could've won the beam projector, no?
-I'd say so.

1068
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,240
She could've easily won that.

1069
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,941
What a shame.

1070
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,844
THE T-REX FINALLY CAME AROUND

1071
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,912
Oh, dear.

1072
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,780
She's struggling badly.

1073
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,649
-Hey, T-Rex.
-Shall we help you out?

1074
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,851
Can we give her another shot
with a ten-second time limit?

1075
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,919
Would you like to try again?

1076
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,187
-Just one more time.
-Okay.

1077
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,356
-You must have regrets too.
-You've got it.

1078
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,292
-You have ten seconds. Ready.
-Just run.

1079
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,593
-Good luck.
-You've got this.

1080
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,262
-Good luck.
-You've got this.

1081
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,564
INTENSE GAZE AND CLAWS
ON THE READY

1082
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:47,732
Ready.

1083
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,904
-She's going even faster now.
-She's fast.

1084
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,673
-Pick up just that one.
-She's moving faster.

1085
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,375
PICKED UP THE GIFT
IN MERE 5 SECONDS

1086
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,710
-Just keep going.
-Go! Go through that door!

1087
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,345
Go! Go through that door!

1088
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,820
SLAMS HER WHOLE BODY
THROUGH THE DOOR

1089
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,991
CRASHING OVER

1090
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,428
CRACKING UP

1091
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,566
PROFESSOR BAEK
IS ON A HOUSE CALL AGAIN

1092
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,903
She's done it,
but the suit's neck got snapped.

1093
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,971
You failed!

1094
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,039
-What?
-Really?

1095
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,141
-So she took more than ten seconds?
-Tell us her record.

1096
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,242
She took 13 seconds.

1097
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,644
-Thirteen seconds?
-I kept count. They're right.

1098
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,879
She failed.

1099
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,348
COME ON, KNOCK IT OFF

1100
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,052
THIS ALTRUISTIC DOCTOR'S
SYMPATHY EXTENDS TO NONHUMANS

1101
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,720
APPEARS FROM THE BACK

1102
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,055
Let's give her one more turn.

1103
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,122
Yeah, let's do that.

1104
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,657
Give her just one more turn.

1105
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,026
-She was so close to making it.
-You still have me, guys.

1106
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,995
-Haven't you taken your turn yet?
-No.

1107
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,663
THEY HAVE ONE PLAYER LEFT

1108
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,964
-I'm still here.
-Ms. Dinosaur.

1109
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,366
Are you okay, Ms. Dinosaur?

1110
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,202
-I'm sure she's fine.
-She's perfectly good. I checked.

1111
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,403
She's getting up like a champ.

1112
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,005
Are you okay?

1113
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,341
-Let's get her out of the suit.
-I'll zip you out.

1114
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,476
-Why did I fail?
-She's done brilliantly.

1115
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,079
-You took 13 seconds.
-Let me zip you out. My gosh.

1116
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,514
It was so hilarious. She didn't do much,
but I kept cracking up.

1117
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,882
The suit is so cute.

1118
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,085
-She looked so adorable.
-The suit made a great spectacle.

1119
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,722
I'm supposed to bring the gift
and crash through with Sook on my back.

1120
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,924
Won't it be better
if I gave him a piggyback ride?

1121
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,160
Come on, Sook.
I'm a sturdy man just like Young K.

1122
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,729
No, let me give you a piggyback ride.

1123
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,796
I'll stand here like this.

1124
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,131
Let's give it a go.

1125
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,066
-I'll carry you.
-Still, Woo-jae should do it.

1126
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,835
-He's too tall.
-This won't do.

1127
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,670
-He's too tall.
-This won't do.

1128
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,738
You little…

1129
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,706
-You weren't cooperating.
-Look here, Sook.

1130
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,108
Here's how we'll do it.

1131
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,175
I'll get here, okay?

1132
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,410
-Okay.
-Let's say I got here.

1133
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,712
I'll jump right in
as soon as you hop onto my back.

1134
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,547
-I don't think that'll work.
-You'd get hurt.

1135
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,216
You could carry her from the start.

1136
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,650
-Excuse me?
-What?

1137
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,686
-What did you just say?
-If carrying her is so rough, that is.

1138
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,354
Why don't I carry you?

1139
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,223
I'll do the carrying part.

1140
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,158
I'll bring a box back
and give Sook a piggyback ride,

1141
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,893
but I want a 15-second time limit.

1142
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,395
-Fifteen seconds?
-Yeah.

1143
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,030
How about 13 seconds?

1144
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,199
Come on. Give him 15 seconds.

1145
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,734
Let's settle for 14 seconds.

1146
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,971
You should know
that carrying Sook on my back

1147
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,205
isn't a mean feat for me.

1148
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,440
Okay. You get 15 seconds.

1149
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,675
-Okay. I got us 15 seconds, Sook.
-We have 15 seconds? Good.

1150
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,477
Please wait next to the mat, Sook.

1151
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,379
Please go behind the door, Woo-jae.

1152
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,281
THEY HAVE SECURED 0 GIFTS SO FAR

1153
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,150
Are you ready?

1154
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,951
-Yeah!
-Let's roll.

1155
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,119
-Good luck!
-Let's go.

1156
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,220
You've got this!

1157
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,725
HIS DIGNITY WAS OFTEN CRUSHED
IN THE PAST

1158
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,693
I wonder why he looks so pitiful.

1159
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,029
GOODBYE, DAYS OF HUMILIATION

1160
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,631
HELLO, NEW ME

1161
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,167
Ready. Set.

1162
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,903
GO!

1163
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,972
Man, he's so fast!

1164
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,775
AN INCREDIBLE SPEED

1165
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,478
SECURES A GIFT IN JUST 4 SECONDS

1166
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,448
GETS SOOK ON HIS BACK QUICKLY

1167
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,950
AND CHARGES INTO THE WALL

1168
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,687
That's a success, right?

1169
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,422
One more.
We're doing it one more time, damn it.

1170
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,790
-That must be a success.
-Are you okay?

1171
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,559
ROLLS OVER

1172
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,328
SOOK'S ROLLING ON THE GROUND

1173
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,498
BUT THIS MAN
ONLY HAS EYES FOR GIFTS

1174
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,600
How did I do? Tell me.

1175
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,537
-That must be a success.
-Are you okay?

1176
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,306
For goodness' sake…

1177
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,974
That little brat.

1178
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,211
-You should've taken better care of me.
-Hold on.

1179
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,745
-So?
-You made it in nine seconds.

1180
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,483
A SUCCESS AT LAST

1181
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,319
-Didn't he throw me on the ground?
-Well done.

1182
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,689
WHAT A WELL-MEANING BRAT

1183
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,692
-I told you I was just as good as Young K.
-You did well.

1184
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,093
-Good job.
-I'm on par with him.

1185
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,161
I'm impressed.

1186
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,863
WAIT…

1187
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,432
Let me get a clip here.
Give me just a minute.

1188
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,000
You can all do your thing.

1189
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,803
I won't be cheap about it.
I only need ten seconds.

1190
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,071
I'll take ten seconds.

1191
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,874
No, I'll get it done in nine seconds.

1192
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,843
Let's settle for 14 seconds.

1193
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,044
BOO!

1194
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,880
-What did you bring back?
-What did you get her?

1195
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:56,981
The beam projector.

1196
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,449
-Where's my gift?
-The beam projector.

1197
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,550
He did take it with him.

1198
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,951
He's done it.

1199
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,486
MY FIRST GIFT

1200
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,688
Wait, you all saw how quick I was, right?

1201
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,790
-Can I try again in the dinosaur suit?
-Try it.

1202
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,326
-You want another go in that suit?
-Yeah.

1203
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,728
Get the massager this time.

1204
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,763
-The massager?
-Yeah.

1205
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,831
Okay.

1206
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,500
I'll wear the dinosaur suit
and get it done in ten seconds.

1207
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,469
Okay. Gosh, I'm impressed.

1208
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,204
-What a cool guy.
-He's on par with Young K.

1209
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,972
-How long did you get?
-I'm as good as Young K.

1210
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,641
Please help Woo-jae get in the suit.

1211
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,310
I'll get you two gifts in total.

1212
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,045
The dinosaur suit is in demand today.

1213
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,113
HIS BID TO BE SOOK'S FAVORITE

1214
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,782
AND SO…

1215
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,652
THIS MAN CHOSE TO BECOME A BEAST

1216
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,054
Why is he working so hard today?

1217
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,122
RETURN OF THE T-REX

1218
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,626
-Putting on the suit itself…
-Looking good.

1219
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:43,794
-He's so fast.
-Great.

1220
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:44,862
AN ASTONISHING SPEED

1221
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,996
-He's so fast.
-Maybe too fast.

1222
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,467
T-REX ATTACKS CIVILIANS

1223
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:51,936
Don't waste your energy, Woo-jae.

1224
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,704
T-REX ON THE RAMPAGE

1225
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,639
-Preserve your energy.
-What's gotten into him?

1226
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,775
You have to start
from behind the door this time.

1227
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,878
Your attempt begins when the door opens.

1228
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:01,946
Ready.

1229
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,682
-Good luck!
-Set.

1230
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,517
WILL HE BE ABLE TO DO
AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS ROUND?

1231
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,585
DOOR OPENED

1232
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,752
Crouch down.

1233
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,588
Crouch down.

1234
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:11,922
DID HE GET STUCK?!

1235
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,293
BUILDS UP THE MOMENTUM
AND DASHES FORWARD

1236
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,461
-My gosh.
-He's so fast.

1237
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,529
INCREDIBLE MOBILITY

1238
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,197
-He's even picked up two boxes.
-My gosh!

1239
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,402
CRACKING UP

1240
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,871
What happened? Did he win two gifts?

1241
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,073
You failed!

1242
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,374
FAILURE

1243
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,476
-How come?
-What happened?

1244
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,577
Tell us his record.

1245
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,112
Why, though? He was like a bullet.

1246
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,313
He timed at 10.88 seconds.

1247
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,249
That's because the suit's head
got stuck at the start.

1248
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,218
I got a bad feeling
from how he acted up too much.

1249
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,254
It was still hilarious
to see the head get stuck.

1250
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,156
-I loved it.
-Woo-jae!

1251
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,793
-Woo-jae.
-Woo-jae.

1252
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,861
OFF THEY GO TO CHECK ON HIM

1253
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,463
-Let's go home now.
-Wait.

1254
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,698
We should totally record him.
Can we get a camera here?

1255
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,734
He looks so miserable.

1256
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,502
-So how is he?
-Are you okay, Woo-jae?

1257
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,372
-You did great, man.
-You totally did, Woo-jae.

1258
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,439
HAGGARD

1259
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,774
Well done.

1260
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,843
-You did your best.
-It was so close.

1261
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:06,910
What's my record again?

1262
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,145
-It was 10.88 seconds.
-Yeah.

1263
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,748
-Dang. If it hadn't been for the door…
-The door ate up the time.

1264
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,783
-We know.
-You should've crouched down low.

1265
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,385
IF ONLY THIS MISHAP
HADN'T HAPPENED…

1266
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,188
HE'S WORN OUT ALREADY

1267
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,157
Good job, Woo-jae.

1268
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,192
SAE-HO DIDN'T PARTICIPATED
IN THE GAME,

1269
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,661
BUT SOMETHING THERE
CAUGHT HIS EYE

1270
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,829
Could I buy the toothbrush?

1271
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,332
-You can take it.
-Really?

1272
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,433
Can I get the cream cake?

1273
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,469
-Feel free to take it.
-Could I buy the toilet paper from you?

1274
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,871
-Oh, sure thing.
-Thank you.

1275
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,507
Woo-young, you can have
the Mon Cher Fresh Cream Cake.

1276
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,475
MON CHER FRESH CREAM CAKE
ON THE HOUSE!

1277
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,612
Since you're giving me the toothbrush,
can you throw in the toothpaste?

1278
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,880
Of course.

1279
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,116
-On that note, let's divide them up.
-Can I get a box of facial tissues?

1280
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,818
-Take whatever you need.
-Can we really?

1281
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:48,886
MARKET OPENED

1282
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,155
ONLY THE GUEST OF HONOR
IS NOT INTERESTED

1283
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,823
Thank you so much.

1284
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,692
Why aren't any of you
taking the show's poster?

1285
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:55,859
You can take it.

1286
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,594
-We even had it framed.
-It's all framed.

1287
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,163
We left it for you.

1288
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,699
-So…
-Is it time for us to say goodbye to RADO?

1289
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,467
-No.
-Really?

1290
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,603
We're making another hit clip
that'll get more views than 7.36 million.

1291
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,738
MUSIC IS A MUST AT PARTIES

1292
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,073
-There's more, then.
-So he's singing?

1293
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,842
-It's Sook's anniversary…
-I can't wait.

1294
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,010
…so we should hear him sing.

1295
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,078
-I'd love that.
-Great.

1296
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,880
-How nice.
-My heart's fluttering again.

1297
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,182
To think RADO's going to sing…

1298
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,218
As a result of this game,
Sook won a beam projector.

1299
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,987
Woo-jae secured it for her.

1300
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,224
Let's give it up for Woo-jae!

1301
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,292
CONGRATS!

1302
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,794
We'll now move on
to the final segment of the day.

1303
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:35,532
Let's celebrate Sook's important milestone
with song and dance.

1304
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,067
-The grand finale!
-That's a lovely idea.

1305
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,402
That's a lovely idea.

1306
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,573
You know it too

1307
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,775
OFF THEY GO TO THE NEXT SPOT
WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS

1308
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,111
ONE HOUR LATER

1309
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,317
I left you behind

1310
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:54,852
SNORTS

1311
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,020
THE TEAM BELTS OUT A TUNE

1312
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,555
USING SOOK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY
AS AN EXCUSE

1313
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,225
THE INTERLUDE IS PLAYING

1314
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,861
AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE
FROM THE TRENDING STAR

1315
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,866
That's a wrap on the special episode
of Screwballs for Sook's 30th Anniversary.

1316
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,467
What on earth is this?

1317
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,470
What have you done to my father?

1318
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,905
I've kept saying this since Beat Coin.

1319
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,540
Let's not get our families involved.

1320
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,709
This kind of stuff makes you choke up.

1321
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,846
