00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
<i>Previously on </i>Screwballs<i>.</i>

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,238
-Wow!
-Welcome.

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,008
-What is this place?
-Welcome.

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,043
<i>She's intimidating on the outside,</i>

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,212
<i>but she makes us cry with her kind words.</i>

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,514
<i>Always in-demand on variety shows.</i>
<i>The trusted variety show master.</i>

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,516
<i>The emotional anchor of </i>Screwballs<i>.</i>

8
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,885
<i>This is Sook's Deconstruction Show.</i>

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,353
IS IT FINALLY MY TURN?

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,690
DECONSTRUCTION SHOW
WITH SOOKMAKASE

11
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,824
-I'll do it.
-What is this?

12
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:25,825
SOOKMAKASE'S 1ST COURSE
ORGANIC SALAD

13
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,061
<i>I got these half-dried sauries</i>
<i>from a very popular place.</i>

14
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,963
<i>There's whelk in my fish cake soup.</i>

15
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,932
<i>We'll get hammered</i>
<i>if we keep sipping it like this.</i>

16
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>Gosh, root crops with this?</i>

17
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,103
<i>They taste amazing</i>
<i>when you pair it with cream cheese.</i>

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,105
<i>There's even lotus root in it.</i>

19
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,173
<i>Today's main dish is eel.</i>

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,308
Look at it. It looks amazing!

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,577
<i>I'm going to eat everything and get sick.</i>

22
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,513
-He was told to fast.
-Really?

23
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,847
Fast completely?

24
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,849
IRRESISTIBLY TEMPTING SOOKMAKASE

25
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,117
WOW

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,054
THEIR EYES OPEN WIDE

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,022
<i>I'll just have explosive diarrhea today.</i>

28
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,657
I'LL JUST HAVE EXPLOSIVE
YOU-KNOW-WHAT TODAY!

29
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm going to clog
all the toilets in Gapyeong today.

30
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,964
AFTER ENJOYING THE TOP-TIER CAMPING FOOD
USING GAPYEONG TOILETS AS COLLATERAL

31
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,000
<i>This is Sook's place.</i>

32
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,435
<i>-It's so pretty here.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,105
This is my second house.

34
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,441
-I saw it on her YouTube channel.
-Yes.

35
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,643
You see, I love camping.

36
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,112
But camp sites have quiet hours.

37
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,447
From nine o'clock,

38
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,048
-you have to be quiet.
-Watch TV quietly.

39
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,949
Yes.

40
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,485
Since my work always ends
around the quiet hours,

41
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,155
it would only cause nuisance,
so I decided to make my own camp site.

42
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,024
That's how I got a place with a yard.

43
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,493
MY OWN CAMP SITE
WHERE THERE ARE NO QUIET HOURS

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,295
She even has a second floor.

45
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,229
-I saw.
-Yes.

46
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,197
It's a unique layout.

47
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,999
Yes, I decorated this space.

48
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,068
When friends come over,
they usually come in threes.

49
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,237
And it would make four including me.

50
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,406
<i>So I thought it would be nice</i>
<i>if we could chat together,</i>

51
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,409
<i>but from our own spaces</i>
<i>and not facing one another.</i>

52
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,244
-You see, I'm an introvert.
-I see.

53
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,814
That's how I ended up making
these spaces for each individual.

54
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,117
I was also worried
there might be someone who snores,

55
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,318
so I created that room

56
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,752
<i>-for snorers.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

57
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,054
<i>-The room for snorers.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

58
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,158
And if two people want to
have a heartfelt conversation,

59
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,059
they can go upstairs.

60
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,927
<i>My goodness. That's so nice.</i>

61
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,295
COZY ROOM FOR 2

62
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,133
<i>The lightings were</i>
<i>carefully selected as well.</i>

63
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,902
<i>Yes, they were chosen</i>
<i>specifically to match the natural wood.</i>

64
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>How pretty.</i>

65
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,738
I thought it would be nice
to go with <i>hanji</i>,

66
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,507
so I chose different shapes for the three.

67
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,876
Gosh. Of the people I know,

68
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,478
she is the best at
spending her money on things

69
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,080
she wants to do.

70
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,882
THE GOAT OF PURSUING HAPPINESS

71
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,918
Let's continue Sook's <i>Deconstruction Show.</i>

72
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,419
It's a group competition from now.

73
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,422
If you succeed in the game
by joining forces,

74
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,058
you may all win the prize.

75
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,728
By the way, since Sook is the star,

76
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,531
-we chose a prize that she'd like.
-Camping equipment?

77
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,065
It's a real prize.

78
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,034
We prepared something epic.

79
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,402
I'm not excited about it at all.

80
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,838
I got my body scrubbed
when I came in first at the bath house.

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,340
<i>-He hated it.</i>
<i>-That was the prize.</i>

82
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,876
<i>They said it was a prize</i>
<i>that was never given on a variety show.</i>

83
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,213
As the eldest member of <i>Screwballs</i>,
Sook has been known for

84
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,082
being understanding and caring
toward the other members.

85
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,718
We prepared this segment
with those characteristics in mind.

86
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,221
-According to the introverted structure…
-Yes.

87
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,989
…that Sook had set up,

88
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,357
you will take your seats.

89
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,693
The game is called Brain Signal.

90
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,861
Is it like telepathy?

91
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,462
Yes, it's kind of like that.

92
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,666
-If it's about telepathy…
-We'll get all of it correctly.

93
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,733
You'd be amazing, right?

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,669
<i>Let me explain the rules.</i>

95
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,804
<i>One person will sit up front.</i>

96
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,942
<i>The remaining four will go</i>
<i>to the four separate beds.</i>

97
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>To the person sitting up front,</i>

98
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,546
<i>we will give a number between one to five.</i>

99
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,815
<i>Then, the person in the front</i>

100
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,317
<i>will give a quiz.</i>

101
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,819
<i>You succeed if the number I gave</i>

102
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,256
<i>and the number of correct answers match.</i>

103
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,758
It may be difficult to come up
with a question on the spot,

104
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,362
so we'll provide example questions
for each member.

105
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,031
-You can pick one from that list…
-Okay.

106
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,901
…or you can come up
with your own question on the spot.

107
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,171
If each members asks three questions,
there would be a total of 15, right?

108
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
Shall we say you succeeded
if you got eight?

109
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,074
Gosh, eight?

110
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,675
Seven.

111
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,411
LET'S NEGOTIATE

112
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,180
If you want us to guess eight out of 15,

113
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,315
that means guessing
more than half correctly.

114
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,717
I bet we can't even get five.

115
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,753
You have seen our ability for years.

116
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,988
Okay, lucky number seven.

117
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,222
Seven.

118
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,157
-We can't even get five.
-Less than half.

119
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,359
We can't even get five.

120
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,328
No, what matters is the quick thinking
of the person giving the quiz.

121
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:27,900
THE PERSON GIVING THE QUIZ MUST GAUGE
THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE 5 PEOPLE

122
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,103
Who would like to go first?

123
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,338
-I'll go first.
-Wait.

124
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,974
I think someone like Woo-jae
should go first.

125
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,909
He can give the quiz strategically.

126
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,578
-He has to watch first.
-Yes, I do.

127
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,013
-I'd like to observe first.
-Yeah.

128
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,781
Just pick someone
who will do badly anyway.

129
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,883
If you think it's you, stand up and go.

130
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,951
Someone who'll do badly.

131
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,552
Is it me?

132
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,453
-No.
-No.

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,554
-No.
-Woo-young can go.

134
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,455
He can go first then.

135
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,991
-I'll go first.
-The viewers haven't seen you in a while.

136
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,795
-Ladies, you can sit in the lower beds.
-Okay.

137
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,163
I'll go up.

138
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,598
THE YOUNGER MEMBERS
WITH STRONG JOINTS GO UP

139
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,468
Wow! This is so nice, Sook!

140
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,736
Isn't it cozy?

141
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,071
I love it up here.

142
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,406
THE 2ND FLOOR IS NICE AND COZY

143
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,374
The mattress is very nice too.

144
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,309
It's so nice.

145
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,209
SATISFIED

146
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,813
-I'll give you some sample questions.
-Okay.

147
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,181
Pick one.

148
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,887
HE STARTS READING
THE LIST OF QUESTIONS

149
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,093
-Come on.
-Seriously?

150
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,594
I had no idea.

151
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,862
What was he doing?

152
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,700
<i>He was using the zoom lens</i>
<i>on his phone to see the questions.</i>

153
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,235
-He is incredible.
-Clever guy.

154
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,503
HOW IS HE SO CLEVER
AT BEING SNEAKY?

155
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,772
I'll tell you how many people
should guess correctly.

156
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,374
Three people.

157
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,477
-Only that many people can get it right.
-Yes.

158
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,346
-And I have to predict that.
-Yes.

159
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,650
Why did he have to sit up there?

160
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,119
Darn. I can't see anything.

161
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,890
LOOKING FOR A QUESTION
THAT ONLY 3 PEOPLE CAN GUESS CORRECTLY

162
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,492
These questions are difficult.

163
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,261
IN DEEP THOUGHT

164
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,863
Excuse me, Woo-young.

165
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,365
Can you hurry up and give the quiz?

166
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,134
Hurry up already!

167
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,937
Oh, my gosh. This is so frustrating.

168
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,271
What is he doing?

169
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,273
-I just might die.
-He's picking a question.

170
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,675
-Still?
-Okay.

171
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,443
OKAY, I'M DONE THINKING

172
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,312
Geez, he is talking even slower now.

173
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,547
Is it because he's sick?

174
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,882
Question.

175
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,617
-Here goes the question.
-Okay.

176
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,988
"Write all the Japanese members
of the group TWICE."

177
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,958
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 3

178
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,061
CONFIDENTLY JOTTING DOWN THE ANSWER

179
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,563
I think quite a few will guess correctly.

180
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,298
Really?

181
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,435
If I write the answer correctly,
the probability increases,

182
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,703
so I won't write it.

183
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,872
Then, write an incorrect answer.

184
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,907
How many members does TWICE have?

185
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,343
How could she ask a question like that?

186
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,612
DOES SHE NOT KNOW?

187
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,380
Wait. I'm getting nervous.

188
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,481
DO I HAVE TO WRITE THE CORRECT ANSWER?

189
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,418
SHOULD I WRITE IT OR SHOULDN'T I?

190
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,119
Show us the answer at the count of three.

191
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,587
One, two, three.

192
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,924
This should be easy.

193
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,992
SANA, MOMO, MINA

194
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,527
-Am I right?
-Of course.

195
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,628
WOO-JAE AND SAE-HO HAVE
THE SAME ANSWER

196
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,329
Gosh, I don't know this one.

197
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,098
SOOK, WHO HE EXPECTED TO GET IT RIGHT,
GAVE THE WRONG ANSWER

198
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,534
OF THE TWO, ONE MUST WRITE
THE ANSWER CORRECTLY

199
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,435
All right.

200
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,403
Woo-young, you got it.

201
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,071
-Wow!
-Wow.

202
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,006
You got it.

203
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,474
HE WROTE THE ANSWER CORRECTLY
AT THE LAST MINUTE

204
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,909
-Really?
-How many was it?

205
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,910
How many had to get it?

206
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,378
-Three.
-Three?

207
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,547
-Wow.
-Only the three of us got it right.

208
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,881
I knew the two of you would…

209
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,916
Who is Sawa?

210
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,018
WHO IS SAWA?

211
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,319
Why on earth did she write "Sawa"?

212
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,021
SHE SAW SOMETHING?

213
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,222
Why did you write that?

214
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,057
Isn't there a member called Sawa?

215
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,826
There's a member called Sawa?

216
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,061
-Isn't it Sana?
-Sana is correct.

217
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,397
Sana, Mina, and Momo.

218
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,731
It was Sana?

219
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,801
Shouldn't this be basic knowledge?

220
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,336
I knew those two would get it.

221
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,339
But I wasn't sure about these two,
so I was going to write it incorrectly.

222
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,977
-Anyway, you're off to a good start.
-Oh, Momo.

223
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,111
Woo-young.

224
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,147
PROPOSING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
FOR THE NEXT QUESTION

225
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,216
Really?

226
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,051
-Wow. For real?
-Yes.

227
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,820
MEANWHILE, HE'S AT IT AGAIN

228
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,121
ONLY ONE PERSON CAN
GUESS IT CORRECTLY

229
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,724
-All right. "What is…
-Yes?

230
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,963
…the variety show on KBS
that Woo-young is hosting?"

231
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,864
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 1

232
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,200
HMM

233
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,603
Gosh, what was it?

234
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,039
Recently, Woo-young became
one of the main hosts

235
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,610
of the KBS dating show called
<i>Mind the Noona Gap.</i>

236
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,411
WOO-YOUNG IS A HOST
ON "MIND THE NOONA GAP"

237
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,316
I know the concept of the show
and what it's about.

238
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,718
But I can't remember the title.

239
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,052
NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW

240
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,320
This is a bit disappointing.

241
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,356
ALTHOUGH IT'S EXPECTED

242
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,658
I know this for sure.

243
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,094
-What? You know this for sure?
-Yes.

244
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,796
-May I look forward to your answer?
-Yes.

245
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,566
-Are you serious, Jin-kyung?
-Yes.

246
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,202
Wait. Is she going to guess it correctly?

247
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,371
I know this one for sure.

248
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,572
-Really?
-Yes.

249
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,040
HER RARELY SEEN CONFIDENCE

250
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,342
Then, I'll write it wrong.

251
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,277
HE WRITES THE WRONG ANSWER
ON PURPOSE

252
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,078
-Are you done writing?
-Yes.

253
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,880
Show us your answer at the count of three.

254
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,182
One, two, three. Show us.

255
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,753
-Isn't it this?
-This should be right.

256
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,788
Geez. What the heck?

257
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,789
YOU'RE SO PRETTY, NOONA

258
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,890
WRONG ANSWER

259
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,492
Darn it. Come on!

260
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,260
-What's wrong?
-Woo-young, you failed.

261
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,529
-Why?
-Isn't it <i>You're My Woman, Noona</i>?

262
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,997
Isn't it <i>You're So Pretty, Noona</i>?

263
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,899
Isn't it <i>The Slam Dunk Sisters</i>?

264
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,367
THE SLAM DUNK SISTERS

265
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,469
COME ON, GUYS

266
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,604
Isn't this correct?

267
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,139
You said you knew for sure.

268
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,140
Isn't this correct?

269
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,676
It's scary that Woo-jae and Jin-kyung
wrote the same answer.

270
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,078
-You wrote <i>You're So Pretty, Noona</i> too?
-Yeah.

271
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,179
What is this?

272
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,348
-I thought you'd get it.
-This startled me.

273
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,586
-What is it?
-It's <i>Mind the Noona Gap.</i>

274
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,588
-I see.
-That's why…

275
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,523
-<i>Mind the Noona Gap?</i>
-Only one person could

276
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,725
-get it right.
-Mine was similar though.

277
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,894
Did you write it correctly?
If you did, we got it, right?

278
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,762
But Jin-kyung said she knew for sure.

279
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,431
-You believed her?
-Come on.

280
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,166
How could you believe her?

281
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,035
-You've known her for years.
-I don't get her.

282
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,504
-How could you believe her?
-But she was so sure.

283
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,939
I did <i>You're My Woman, Noona</i>.

284
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,208
-Always question her.
-Yeah, it's my fault.

285
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,877
-Did the title change?
-Woo-young, the final third question.

286
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,447
The proposed number of people
is very tricky.

287
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,517
Okay.

288
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,155
What is the name of
Woo-jae's YouTube channel?

289
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,891
Write your answer.

290
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,826
-Oh, no.
-You know,

291
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,095
I think all five of us know the answer.

292
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,663
Of course they do.

293
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,331
How could they possibly not know this?

294
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:33,866
Exactly.

295
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,800
WAS 5 THE PROPOSED NUMBER
OF PEOPLE?

296
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,135
-Let's go.
-How many is it?

297
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,471
I'm going to cut ties with them
if they don't know this.

298
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,439
I've been doing it for seven years.

299
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,174
Why are you so quiet, Jin-kyung?

300
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,342
I know this for sure.

301
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,577
I KNOW THIS FOR SURE

302
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,379
-She clearly doesn't know.
-Geez.

303
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,780
She definitely has no idea.

304
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,750
All right. One, two, three. Show us.

305
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,653
THE JOO WOO-JAE SHOW

306
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,155
-Please.
-Woo-young, turn around.

307
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,724
TODAY'S JOO WOO-JAE

308
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,660
TODAY'S JOO WOO-JAE

309
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,228
TODAY'S JOO WOO-JAE

310
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,596
TODAY'S JOO WOO-JAE

311
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,464
EVERYONE DEFINITELY GOT IT RIGHT

312
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,699
Darn it.

313
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,768
Quite a lot of you knew.

314
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,903
How could you not know this?

315
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,338
Woo-young, you failed.

316
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,006
-Why?
-How many was it?

317
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,675
-It was two.
-Hey!

318
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,877
How could you ask that question
for only two people?

319
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,747
I was certain that
Jin-kyung couldn't get it.

320
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,584
You knew how many had to guess it,
so how could you ask this question?

321
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,154
-By the way, Jin-kyung…
-Yeah?

322
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,489
…you know my channel
even though you didn't subscribe to it.

323
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,458
Of course I know.

324
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,794
-You got one question, Woo-young.
-I'll go.

325
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,995
-I'll go.
-I only got one.

326
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,764
The person who's giving the question
has to be strategic.

327
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,934
-Hang on. Listen, everybody.
-Yeah?

328
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,135
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

329
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,937
We should guess truthfully.

330
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,172
-Don't be clever.
-Okay.

331
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,139
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

332
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,241
-Then, the probability goes up.
-Okay.

333
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,543
-Okay.
-Got it?

334
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,212
Sook, let me tell you
how many people should guess it correctly.

335
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO SHOULD GET IT RIGHT

336
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,949
GLANCING OVER

337
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,419
PICKING A QUESTION

338
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,221
"Write 'Wednesday'

339
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,324
in English."

340
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,128
We should guess truthfully.
Don't be clever.

341
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,364
You know, it wouldn't make sense
if anyone got this wrong.

342
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,234
-One person is a global K-pop idol…
-Yeah.

343
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,337
…one person goes to the States
very frequently,

344
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,806
and one person is a genius
in languages, as far as I know.

345
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,608
I'm suddenly getting confused.

346
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,043
Suddenly getting confused?

347
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,879
WATCHING HIS REACTION

348
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,348
-Don't ask me for the answer.
-I was wondering if you knew.

349
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,351
Show us at the count of three.
One, two, three. Show us.

350
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,552
Geez. I think mine is wrong.

351
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,653
I think mine is wrong.

352
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,855
I suddenly got confused.

353
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,789
SOOK GOT IT WRONG

354
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,991
-No way.
-The number that had to guess correctly

355
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,126
was three people.

356
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,460
I think we got it.

357
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,597
Only two people got it. You failed.

358
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,768
Woo-jae, who else do you think
guessed correctly besides you?

359
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,469
-Jin-kyung.
-That's right.

360
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,570
Am I right?

361
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,638
You guessed correctly.

362
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,073
THE UNEXPECTED PERSON
WHO GOT IT RIGHT

363
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,974
How did I do that?

364
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,176
I added a letter
because I thought mine was right.

365
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,544
SHE ADDED A "Y"
TO GET IT WRONG ON PURPOSE

366
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,649
I thought Sae-ho would get it.

367
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,885
I wish I'd written in Korean
to make it funny at least.

368
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,952
HE WASN'T FUNNY
AND HIS SKILLS GOT EXPOSED

369
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,354
It can be confusing.

370
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,422
Let's decide the next number.

371
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,892
When you indicate with your fingers,

372
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,060
I'll nod like this.

373
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,530
2 PEOPLE

374
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,065
HE IS SOMETHING ELSE

375
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,601
Okay. When is Sook's birthday?

376
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,103
WHEN IS KIM SOOK'S BIRTHDAY?

377
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,138
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 2

378
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,206
Gosh, when was it?

379
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,941
THE TRUST THAT THEY WOULDN'T KNOW
EACH OTHER'S BIRTHDAYS

380
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,442
AT LEAST, 2 PEOPLE WOULD KNOW, RIGHT?

381
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,777
Okay, let's go.

382
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,846
Gosh, when was it?

383
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,114
AFTER THINKING CAREFULLY,
SHE WRITES HER ANSWER

384
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,582
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

385
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,550
Show us.

386
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,752
JULY 5TH

387
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,421
Turn around and check for yourself, Sook.

388
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,322
THE ANSWER IS JULY 6TH

389
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,959
BAFFLED

390
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,727
-"Around June"?
-Darn you.

391
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,529
Come on, man.

392
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,264
-Is he for real?
-Geez.

393
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,133
-You failed.
-We failed.

394
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,034
I was wrong too?

395
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,836
-Yours is correct.
-Mine's correct.

396
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,205
I was expecting one more person
to guess it correctly.

397
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,906
Gosh, I didn't write the correct answer.

398
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,308
Two people had to guess correctly.

399
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,542
THE REALITY OF
THE CLOSE-KNIT SCREWBALLS

400
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,810
It wasn't in June?

401
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,245
Whose birthday is on June 11th?

402
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,147
Who was born on June 11th?

403
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,516
No one, you idiot. No one here.

404
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,852
Why did you write June 10, Jin-kyung?

405
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,186
I misread yours.

406
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,056
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

407
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,824
OH WELL

408
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,295
-So she cheated on his wrong answer?
-Yeah.

409
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,597
That's too funny.

410
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,199
Why did you write so confidently
if you had no clue?

411
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,201
I really thought it was June 11th.

412
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,803
Give us the next number.

413
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,439
4 PEOPLE

414
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,774
Then, this one should be…

415
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,942
IT SHOULD BE AN EASY QUESTION

416
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,778
What year did Jin-kyung debut?

417
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,747
WHAT YEAR DID JIN-KYUNG DEBUT?

418
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,681
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 4

419
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,016
THE YEAR THAT THE DEAREST
SECOND ELDEST MEMBER DEBUTED

420
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,784
The year she debuted?

421
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,355
IN THE PAST LIFE, THEY CELEBRATED
HER 30TH DEBUT ANNIVERSARY

422
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,324
One, two, three. Show us.

423
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,493
THE YEAR 1993

424
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,529
SURELY THEY KNOW

425
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,331
The year 1993.

426
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,232
-Yeah. Why?
-But…

427
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,300
We can do it.

428
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,902
I'm sure we can get this one.

429
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:03,969
Turn around.

430
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,040
-1993.
-Jin-kyung.

431
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,009
Who wrote 1996?

432
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,244
THE YEAR 1996

433
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,146
If she debuted in 1991,
how old would she be?

434
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,180
Wasn't she 15 years old?

435
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,583
-I'm so shocked that Sae-ho doesn't know.
-I know.

436
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,784
How can he not know?

437
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,452
Oh, yeah. She was born in 1977, right?

438
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,521
I got confused. I really did.

439
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,956
We also celebrated

440
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,858
-her 30th debut anniversary.
-Yeah.

441
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,127
We did that in 2023.

442
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,495
How could he?

443
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,562
HE GOT IT WRONG TOO

444
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,333
-Geez.
-You didn't get a single question right.

445
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,068
I'll give it a try.

446
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,405
Of the six questions,
I got five of them right.

447
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,439
BRAGGING

448
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,143
Sae-ho, when you indicate
the number of people on your chest,

449
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,544
I'll nod in agreement.

450
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,980
Here I go.

451
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,183
When is Jin-kyung's birthday?

452
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,188
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 2

453
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,658
ONLY JIN-KYUNG AND I
KNOW HER BIRTHDAY

454
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,464
One, two, three. Show us.

455
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,066
DECEMBER 23RD

456
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,834
Gosh, I don't know.

457
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,402
OCTOBER 7TH, WRONG

458
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,738
DECEMBER 12TH, WRONG

459
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,174
Geez. These people are insane.

460
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,909
-You failed.
-We failed?

461
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,378
-What is going on?
-How do you know that?

462
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,579
Of course I know.

463
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,348
Isn't it in December?

464
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,049
Of course, I should know when it is.

465
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,150
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THIS?

466
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,519
-Woo-jae would know.
-I thought he wouldn't know.

467
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,088
-Of course I know.
-He's smart.

468
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,155
Honestly, shouldn't those

469
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,958
with a high rate of
correct answers get some benefit?

470
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,326
Even if it's only honorary.

471
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,395
-We'll make sure to point it out.
-Yes.

472
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,630
WOO-JAE IS THE BEST
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD

473
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,699
Indicate with your fingers on your chest.

474
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,134
Okay.

475
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,202
All right.

476
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,537
On <i>Beat Coin</i>,

477
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,905
we received health check-ups.

478
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,040
-In our past life?
-Yes.

479
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,077
Because of Woo-jae, Sae-ho's height
was revealed against his will.

480
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,213
What is Sae-ho's height?

481
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,714
I know this one for sure.

482
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,949
Include the decimal point?

483
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,751
-Yes, please include it.
-Really?

484
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,887
Do you even know
the decimal point, Sae-ho?

485
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,122
Of course I do.

486
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,256
IT'S MY HEIGHT
OF COURSE I KNOW

487
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,991
There were a lot of articles about that.

488
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,292
CHO SAE-HO'S HEIGHT IS 166.9 CM
5-CM DIFFERENCE ON HIS PROFILE

489
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,961
Hang on. Was it not that?

490
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,029
Hang on.

491
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,197
Was it not this?

492
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,999
Gosh. Hang on.

493
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,669
THE 166.9 CM TALL GUY
ENDS UP REVISING HIS ANSWER

494
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,304
Is this right?

495
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,440
It's hard to guess
up to the decimal point.

496
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,742
One, two, three. Show us.

497
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,444
Is this right?

498
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,016
-No one got it right.
-What?

499
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,053
Isn't it 166.7?

500
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,822
-It was 166.9 cm.
-What?

501
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,924
-I was 166.9 cm?
-Yes.

502
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,660
Oh, it was 166.9 cm?

503
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,696
-All of us got it wrong.
-Jin-kyung wrote 163.2.

504
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,271
By the way, the number
you had to get was five.

505
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,605
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 5

506
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,074
What were you thinking?

507
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,009
You asked this
when you needed five people?

508
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,610
I thought they would all know.

509
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,179
Are you drunk?

510
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,081
-It was so cold outside.
-Come to your senses.

511
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,582
But it's too hot in here.

512
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,119
-How can he ask this when he needs five?
-He needs to get a grip.

513
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,022
You only got one question correct.
The very first one.

514
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,024
Woo-young did the best so far.

515
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,659
-Really?
-From all of you?

516
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,360
-Yeah.
-You only got one question.

517
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,497
Didn't we agree upon
getting seven questions to win a prize?

518
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,566
It's over then.

519
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,167
If you get three, you get the prize.

520
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,303
-Just three questions.
-Really?

521
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,605
Let's give it a shot.

522
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,539
Give us a number.

523
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,807
Can I go with this?

524
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,875
You can go with that.

525
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,443
-With this?
-Yes.

526
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,911
In soccer,

527
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,012
THE NEXT CATEGORY IS SPORTS

528
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,017
what do you call it when a player
scores three or more goals in a match?

529
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,887
SAE-HO'S STRATEGY FOR THIS ROUND

530
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,223
ALL THE MALE MEMBERS WILL GET IT

531
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,558
AND ALL THE FEMALE MEMBERS WILL NOT

532
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,628
HIS PLAN IS TO GET THOSE THREE

533
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,997
Show us at the count of three.

534
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,267
-Do you know the answer, Jin-kyung?
-Yes.

535
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,535
-What?
-Okay.

536
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,170
Show us at the count of three.

537
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,838
One, two, three. Show us.

538
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,174
It's confusing. I don't know.

539
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,475
What's wrong?

540
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,544
All right.

541
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,945
Woo-young wrote "hat trick."

542
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,113
Woo-jae wrote "hat trick."

543
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,448
Sook wrote "hat trick."

544
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,883
Jin-kyung wrote "triple shoot."

545
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,751
TRIPLE SHOOT

546
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,652
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

547
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,321
She's amazing.

548
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,656
That was close.

549
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,057
-You know--
-How many was it?

550
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,626
-It was three.
-I should've missed it.

551
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,127
Were you only expecting the guys?

552
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,030
Yeah, since it's soccer,
I thought the ladies wouldn't know.

553
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,800
Since Sook got it as well,
four people answered correctly,

554
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,035
so you failed.

555
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,638
I should have written the wrong answer.

556
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,439
Sook answered correctly.

557
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
SAE-HO GOT 0 QUESTIONS

558
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,912
Indicate a number between two to four
with your fingers on your chest.

559
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,680
Okay.

560
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,981
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 2

561
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,850
-I'll do this one.
-Okay.

562
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:49,288
"What is the award that Jin-kyung won
at the 1993 Supermodel Contest?"

563
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,857
SIGH

564
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,326
THIS ONE'S TOUGH

565
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,863
SHE THINKS AT LEAST
ONE PERSON WOULD KNOW

566
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,638
DOES SHE NOT KNOW?

567
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,539
Geez.

568
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,241
PHOTOGENIC AWARD

569
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,911
FINALLY MANAGES TO SCRIBBLE DOWN AN ANSWER
AFTER MULLING OVER IT

570
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,346
Show us at the count of three.

571
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,881
One, two, three. Show us.

572
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,749
PHOTOGENIC AWARD

573
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,051
Photogenic.

574
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,321
-You failed.
-How many was it?

575
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,056
Only Sook got it correctly.

576
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,459
-It wasn't Photogenic Award?
-What?

577
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,094
The answer is Best Pose Award.

578
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,862
Best Pose Award. Look, Jin-kyung.

579
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,632
Look at mine, Jin-kyung. Look.

580
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,200
Isn't it Popularity Award?

581
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,535
Weren't you popular?

582
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,171
You know what?
I remember this very clearly.

583
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,305
Jin-kyung told me that

584
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,708
she won the Photogenic Award.

585
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,776
RESULT OF SERIOUS
HIPPOCAMPUS DAMAGE

586
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,380
Then, I fell for
Jin-kyung's misinformation.

587
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,381
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TRUSTED

588
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,317
-Let's move on.
-Okay.

589
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,418
WHAT A HUGE LESSON

590
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,688
PROPOSING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
FOR THE NEXT QUESTION

591
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,789
Okay.

592
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,559
"Which American Novelist was the author
of <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>

593
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,629
and won the Nobel Prize in Literature
in 1954?"

594
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,898
THE MAJORITY MUST ANSWER CORRECTLY

595
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,102
I knew who this was.

596
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,870
Is this right? I'm not sure.

597
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,438
Why am I confused?

598
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,208
-Did you write the answer, Sae-ho?
-Of course.

599
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,976
I'm a bit confused
about the pronunciation.

600
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,878
We'll take that into consideration.

601
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,014
There's a name that came to me instantly

602
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,249
when I heard <i>The Old Man and the Sea,</i>
so I wrote that.

603
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,285
-Okay.
-Show us at the count of three.

604
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,720
-It isn't Novelist Lee Oi-soo.
-One, two, three. Show us.

605
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,189
HUMMINGWAY, HEMINGWAY, HEMINGWAY,
HEMINGWAY, PARK IN-SEOK

606
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,424
Wow!

607
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,027
-You got it.
-Really?

608
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,762
-You got it.
-Really?

609
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:37,796
SHE SUCCEEDED
IN PREDICTING 4 PEOPLE

610
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,197
She proposed four people,

611
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,966
and only Sook wrote "Park In-seok."

612
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:41,967
Wow!

613
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,535
The rest answered correctly.

614
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,370
THE ANSWER IS HEMINGWAY

615
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,772
But I wrote "Hummingway."

616
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:47,973
-Is it "Humming"?
-Who?

617
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,874
I wrote "Hummingway."

618
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,008
Oh, Hummingway.

619
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,810
-It's the pronunciation.
-You see…

620
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,112
We'll count it as a correct answer.

621
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,014
Okay, you succeeded in two questions.

622
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,283
Here's the last question for Jin-kyung.

623
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,118
Okay.

624
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,955
"How do you spell
Sae-ho's former stage name in English?"

625
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,390
Do we have to write in English?

626
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,727
Well, she did ask you
to spell it in English.

627
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,128
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

628
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,297
I don't know any English words.

629
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:15,801
Is it this?

630
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,970
THE BUSINESS TRAVELER TO THE U.S.
CONFIDENTLY JOTS DOWN THE ANSWER

631
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,139
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 3

632
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,108
CORRECT!

633
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,477
One, two, three. Show us.

634
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,112
-I'm not so sure.
-Cabbage.

635
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,580
ONLY 2 MORE PEOPLE MUST GET IT RIGHT
BESIDES JIN-KYUNG

636
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,083
THESE 2 ARE OUT

637
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,786
The proposed number of people was three.

638
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,556
-That's a lot.
-Three is a lot.

639
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,491
Sae-ho and Jin-kyung, you are correct.

640
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,193
-And me?
-Only two got it, so you failed.

641
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,461
What did you write?

642
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,528
WOO-JAE GOT IT WRONG?

643
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:44,996
I wrote "cabbage."

644
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,165
It's c, a, b, b, a, g, e.

645
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,533
Oh, it's b, b?

646
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,303
Geez, Woo-jae doesn't know
how to spell "cabbage"?

647
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,071
HOW DISAPPOINTING, WOO-JAE

648
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,506
-How disappointing.
-How shocking.

649
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,275
I'm not smart.
These guys are just too dim.

650
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,243
JIN-KYUNG AND SAE-HO'S ENGLISH
IS BETTER

651
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,947
Indicate a number between two to four
on your chest.

652
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,516
Okay.

653
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,784
Let's go!

654
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,053
If it's this…

655
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,154
ONLY 2 PEOPLE CAN GET THIS RIGHT

656
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,756
PROPOSED NUMBER OF PEOPLE: 2

657
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,090
Including three,

658
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,327
-What?
-list all the prime numbers

659
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,830
from three to twenty.

660
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,666
LIST ALL THE PRIME NUMBERS
FROM 3 TO 20

661
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,901
What are prime numbers?

662
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,002
Prime numbers?

663
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,438
Is it a small number?

664
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,840
IS IT A SMALL NUMBER?

665
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,043
BESIDES WOO-JAE,
ONE MORE PERSON MUST GET IT RIGHT

666
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,079
What is that?

667
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,981
-I'm taking a pass.
-Are you?

668
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,449
-The answer is five.
-That's wrong.

669
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,917
-Fifteen.
-That's incorrect.

670
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,519
What's that? I've never seen it before.

671
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,586
WHO IS THIS PROBLEM EVEN MEANT FOR?

672
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,588
I thought she would have

673
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,891
covered this on her channel.

674
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,493
WOO-JAE'S HOPING THAT
THIS PERSON WOULD GET IT

675
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,796
Which even number is a prime number?

676
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,832
Of the even numbers, which number
only has its own number and one?

677
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,267
-Two.
-Yes.

678
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,437
Is it between 3 and 20?

679
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,405
-Yes, between 3 and 20.
-Including those.

680
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,408
CONFIDENTLY JOTS DOWN THE ANSWER

681
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,410
One, two, three. Show us.

682
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,145
What is it? I don't know the answer.

683
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,680
REVEALING THE ANSWER

684
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,015
Is this right?

685
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,983
Oh, my.

686
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,785
-What got into you?
-What's wrong?

687
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,554
Sae-ho, you are correct.

688
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,389
Sook, why is yours correct?

689
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,257
-What's going on?
-What? I'm right?

690
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,092
-You are correct.
-Why is this correct?

691
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,262
I only had Sae-ho and Jin-kyung in mind.

692
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,299
I thought that at least one of them
would answer correctly.

693
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,068
Jin-kyung, one of the numbers
is incorrect.

694
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,037
His is kind of right too.

695
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,705
Nine doesn't make sense.

696
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,073
I got confused.

697
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,541
Three got it right, so you failed.

698
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,109
Honestly, I feel so good.

699
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,846
They aren't as bad as I thought they were.

700
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,514
How did I get it right?

701
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,815
Propose a number.

702
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,383
PROPOSING THE NUMBER
FOR THE NEXT ROUND

703
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,319
Here goes the question.

704
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,820
HE EXPECTS THE MAJORITY TO GET THIS RIGHT

705
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,756
The members of the group VIVIZ…

706
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,291
MEMBERS OF THE GROUP VIVIZ

707
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,994
Write the name of the three members.

708
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,965
May I ask you for the names
of the three members of VIVIZ?

709
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,666
-Umji, SinB…
-Umji.

710
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,468
SinB and Ye-sol.

711
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,636
1ST ATTEMPT: UMJI, SINB, AND YE-SOL?

712
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,672
20 MINUTES LATER

713
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,674
Umji, Gumji, SinB.

714
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,343
2ND ATTEMPT: UMJI, GUMJI, SINB

715
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,712
I'll engrave their names on my bones.

716
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,980
-Good.
-Yes.

717
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,381
Should I count on her?

718
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,316
SHOULD I COUNT ON HER OR NOT?

719
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,951
Should I count on her? What do I do?

720
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,852
Should I trust her?

721
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,521
Okay. Show us at the count of three.

722
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,322
One, two, three. Show us.

723
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,957
UMJI, SINB, EUNHA

724
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,858
HE WROTE THE ANSWER IN THE END

725
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,693
All right, Jin-kyung.

726
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,061
Show us what you wrote.

727
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,631
"Eunhasoo, Umji, Aurora."

728
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,200
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

729
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,903
What's the answer?

730
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,771
-"What's the answer?"
-Look,

731
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,073
you all teased her so much.

732
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,341
WE GET THAT JIN-KYUNG GOT IT WRONG BUT…

733
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,776
Hey, what's up with your answer?

734
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,077
Why did you write "I'm sorry"?

735
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,613
-Exactly.
-I'm so sorry.

736
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,115
Who is Eunah?

737
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,883
-Is it "Ha"?
-It's Eunha.

738
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,554
-Oh, it's Eunha.
-I said it like 400 times.

739
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,055
-The people who got it…
-I got it.

740
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,690
…are two people, Woo-jae and Sae-ho.

741
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,427
But we all teased her together.
How could they not know this?

742
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,729
I knew that Jin-kyung wouldn't know.

743
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,131
Tease her how?

744
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,401
WE ARE SORRY, VIVIZ

745
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,904
Pick a question that's okay
to answer incorrectly.

746
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,739
-Yeah.
-Right?

747
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,708
-Do we get a prize if we get this?
-Yes.

748
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,410
My team behind me are

749
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,346
Sook, Jin-kyung, Sae-ho,
and Woo-young, right?

750
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,247
TRULY A DREAM TEAM

751
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,116
Sae-ho is kind of my barometer right now.

752
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,952
To be honest,

753
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,187
I am not counting on these two at all.

754
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,458
That's why I am picking questions
based on what he may know.

755
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,026
Don't count on me too much either.

756
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,362
I'll pick something
that you'll definitely know.

757
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,964
-Here I go.
-Okay.

758
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,031
FINAL CHANCE

759
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,134
Right now, there's a joint director

760
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,836
for JYP behind me.

761
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,972
Of the groups in JYP,

762
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,506
this is about Stray Kids.

763
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:53,578
<i>Write the name of the member</i>
<i>who handles the bass in the group.</i>

764
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,580
GLANCING OVER

765
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,681
Okay.

766
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,251
Come on, Jin-kyung. You went too far.

767
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,053
How could you cheat so shamelessly?

768
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,421
SHAMELESSLY CHEATING

769
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:04,889
Those who shouldn't know

770
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,291
-should get it wrong.
-Okay.

771
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,093
Do you know the answer, Jin-kyung?

772
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,294
No.

773
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,163
SHE IS A GOOD PERSON THOUGH

774
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,400
Show us at the count of three.
One, two, three. Show us.

775
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,002
FELIX

776
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,471
Sook wrote "Joo Woo-jae."

777
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,039
Jin-kyung wrote "Hyun-sik."

778
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,775
The rest of you wrote "Felix."

779
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,943
Three people. You got it.

780
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,977
WE DID IT!

781
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,579
Good job!

782
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,915
-Good job!
-We have to use our brains.

783
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,350
I knew Felix.

784
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,386
I know you know,

785
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,287
but it's hard to think of it on the spot.

786
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,188
HE PRECISELY KNEW THEIR TENDENCIES

787
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,024
THE GAME ENDS

788
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,660
You got more than three questions,
so as we promised,

789
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,561
-we will give you your prize.
-What is it?

790
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,629
Let's see what it is.

791
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,665
-Take a look at it first.
-I bet it's very meaningful.

792
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,601
It's the calendar for 2026.

793
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,568
It's a calendar.

794
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,637
BUT THE MEMBERS' FACES ARE ON IT

795
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,872
It's us!

796
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,409
Is it from the first episode
of <i>Screwballs</i>?

797
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,944
-It's all Sook.
-It's all Sook.

798
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,979
It's all me.

799
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,113
THE CALENDAR ONLY CONTAINS
THE HISTORY OF SOOK

800
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,014
TOSS

801
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,784
-It's all Sook.
-I see.

802
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,851
Is it all me?

803
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,055
SCREWBALLS' SOOK CALENDAR

804
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,157
Can we sell this?

805
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,192
You can sell it online.

806
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,427
It's so pretty.

807
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,929
I like it. This makes me happy.

808
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,264
I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH IT

809
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,133
You can tell she got Ultherapy
in this picture.

810
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,034
Ulthera?

811
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,269
-Yes, Ultherapy.
-Right?

812
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,804
I took that right after I had Ulthera.

813
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,039
What was this one about?

814
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,307
-Gosh.
-This was the 2PM one.

815
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,309
This is too funny.

816
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,011
-It was 2PM.
-Geez.

817
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,114
-Gosh, 2PM.
-Did you see the comment for this preview?

818
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,516
<i>It said that she looked like</i>

819
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,819
<i>a high-ranking North Korean official.</i>

820
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,520
THE WOMAN WITH A THOUSAND FACES

821
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,055
This one is so funny.

822
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,093
By the way, Sook played
a huge part in the shoot that day.

823
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,527
<i>Her dance was just…</i>

824
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,663
<i>Her dance was so funny.</i>

825
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,997
You all did a great job.

826
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,500
-So we'll be spending the night here.
-Yes.

827
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,369
I heard that you have a mission
for the guys for tomorrow morning?

828
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,906
Yes, since the guys are here today…

829
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,375
It's the first time
for these three to come over, right?

830
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,912
The air is so fresh around here
in the morning.

831
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,348
-There's a metasequoia forest here.
-Okay.

832
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,449
In the morning…

833
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,717
What are you up to?

834
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,887
You feel great even if you sleep
for just a couple hours there.

835
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,655
-Says who?
-So tomorrow morning,

836
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,824
since it's the new year,
you're going to make <i>tteokguk</i>

837
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,892
when you get up.

838
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,128
-You want us to make <i>tteokguk? </i>Okay.
-That's easy.

839
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,864
Then, it would really be like a family,

840
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,699
-if my little brothers made it.
-You know,

841
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,302
I thought you wanted us to
go see the sunrise.

842
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,172
What does the metasequoia forest
have to do with <i>tteokguk</i>?

843
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,607
There's a reason for that.

844
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,142
Okay, we'll prepare

845
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,444
-delicious <i>tteokguk </i>tomorrow.
-Okay.

846
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,946
You can get up at whatever hour you want.

847
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,047
You'll eat your <i>tteokguk</i>,

848
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,616
drop by somewhere, and we'll be done.

849
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,517
Drop by somewhere?

850
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,652
You'll drop by somewhere
to throw a coin. That's it.

851
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,787
-Okay.
-Nice.

852
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,989
-Have a good night. Thank you.
-Thank you.

853
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,092
UP TO THIS POINT, THEY HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW

854
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,327
TIME FOR THEM TO GO TO BED

855
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,864
We just have to make the <i>tteokguk</i>
in the morning and serve it to them?

856
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,400
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

857
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,935
WOO-YOUNG TO BED

858
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,604
WOO-JAE TO BED

859
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,139
-Good night.
-Good night.

860
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,641
SAE-HO TO BED

861
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,944
LIGHTS OUT

862
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,515
THE DARKNESS DIDN'T LAST LONG

863
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:21,152
THE MORNING OF DAY 2
BRIGHTENED QUICKLY

864
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,357
CURRENT TIME: 8:25 AM

865
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:35,033
THE OLDEST OF THE TTEOKGUK BROTHERS
WOKE UP FIRST

866
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,639
THE SECOND OLDEST WAKES UP TOO

867
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,744
THE YOUNGEST NEEDS TO BE WOKEN UP

868
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,080
YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP!

869
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,383
Oh, yeah. We have to make <i>tteokguk.</i>

870
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,623
THE THREE TTEOKGUK BROTHERS
ARE ALL AWAKE

871
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,093
-So it's all set up.
-Yeah.

872
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,563
THEY WELCOME THE MORNING
WITH SWOLLEN FACES

873
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,869
THEY OPT FOR THE CONVENIENT
STORE-BOUGHT BROTH

874
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,638
Should I pour another one in?

875
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,640
TO MAKE IT NICE AND THICK
THEY POUR A 3RD PACKET IN

876
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,409
PRESSING THIS AND THAT

877
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,744
How do you turn this on?

878
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,847
What?

879
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,117
WHY ISN'T THE INDUCTION COOKTOP WORKING?

880
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,220
I'M NOT AN EMPLOYEE
OF THE STOVE COMPANY…

881
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,725
COMMON SCENE AT AN APARTMENT
WHERE TWO MEN LIVE TOGETHER

882
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,829
WANTING TO CRY

883
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,898
IN TIMES LIKE THESE

884
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,769
IT'S BEST NOT TO BE STUBBORN
AND JUST TAKE ANOTHER ROUTE

885
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,574
WOO-JAE IS IN CHARGE OF EGGS

886
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,310
You're all up.

887
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,512
THE HOMEOWNER IS AWAKE

888
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,614
-You're up too, Jin-kyung?
-Yeah.

889
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,349
WITH JIN-KYUNG WAKING UP,
EVERYONE IS FINALLY AWAKE

890
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,719
-Did you sleep well?
-Yeah, I did.

891
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,322
How do you feel? Are you feeling okay?

892
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,657
I feel fine.

893
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,859
-I'm glad to hear that.
-I'm getting my appetite back.

894
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,494
When should I put the eggs in?

895
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,430
Later. You put it in
when everything is done.

896
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,098
-The <i>tteok</i> has to cook too, right?
-Yeah.

897
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,900
Add the eggs and stir.

898
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,069
Add the eggs now.

899
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,070
IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE TTEOKGUK

900
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,739
-I smell something delicious.
-Look at these guys.

901
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,574
They're pretty impressive.

902
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,910
When are you going to
upload your vlog, Jin-kyung?

903
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,211
VOLUNTEERS TO BE THE VJ
AS SOON AS SHE GETS UP

904
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,213
Who made this?

905
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,382
We made the broth and everything.

906
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,550
This morning?

907
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,952
We slaughtered a cow for this.

908
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,620
Who made this?

909
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,388
We made all of this.

910
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,858
WE MADE IT WITH
THE STORE-BOUGHT BROTH

911
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,327
What time did you get up?

912
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,594
We just didn't go to bed.

913
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,495
No?

914
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,465
-You snore so loudly.
-Me?

915
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,901
While you were sleeping,

916
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,936
there was a 24-hour supermarket.

917
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:55,306
We bought the bones from there
and made the broth.

918
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,374
-Really?
-Yes.

919
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,875
We weren't sleepy so we didn't sleep.

920
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,477
-We boiled it for five hours.
-Yeah.

921
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,179
-Jin-kyung.
-We boiled it

922
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,613
from three to five…
No, three to eight.

923
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,819
IS THIS THE SOUND OF THEM
MAKING TTEOKGUK FOR FIVE HOURS?

924
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,287
You guys are amazing.

925
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,122
-Oh, my.
-We bought all the ingredients.

926
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,190
GREAT STORYTELLING

927
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,926
-We added the meat and everything.
-Oh, my.

928
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,762
-You guys are adorable.
-I am so touched, guys.

929
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,864
I hope it tastes good.

930
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,234
I hope it tastes good.
We put so much effort into it.

931
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,802
I hope it's good.

932
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,304
THE FIRST BITE

933
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,741
-Is it good?
-It's really good, Sook.

934
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,777
-What?
-They didn't even sleep to make this.

935
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,245
These guys are something else.

936
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,047
-Enjoy.
-What got into you?

937
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,115
It's pretty good.

938
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,050
It's a shame that
we don't have any kimchi.

939
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,085
It's so good.

940
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,453
How is it this good?

941
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,621
-Is it good?
-Yes!

942
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,757
You get the flavor
when you take the time to make it.

943
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,924
Fascinating.

944
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,826
-Sprinkle some red pepper?
-Yes.

945
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,695
-Thank you.
-It's pretty good, isn't it?

946
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:56,834
THE TWO OLDER SISTERS
REALLY ENJOY THE FOOD

947
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,703
Gosh, that's good.

948
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:01,806
What is this?

949
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,107
What's your secret?

950
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,442
-Is it good?
-Yes.

951
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,544
You had to have cooked the meat

952
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,981
low and slow from last night.

953
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,218
I'm glad we took turns
to stay up last night.

954
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:18,756
THEY DECIDED TO DOUBLE DOWN
ON BEING SHAMELESS

955
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,059
-Let me give you some more, Sae-ho.
-I'm okay.

956
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,960
-I don't eat a lot for breakfast.
-Really?

957
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,996
A lot of you don't eat breakfast.

958
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,532
I'm like a walking corpse
if I don't eat breakfast.

959
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,467
LIKE A CORPSE?

960
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,035
You see, if I don't eat,

961
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,672
the period of intermittent fasting
becomes too long

962
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,774
since I don't eat dinner.

963
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,342
What?

964
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,477
What are you saying?

965
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,446
WHAT JIN-KYUNG ATE
FOR DINNER YESTERDAY

966
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,416
SALAD, HALF-DRIED SAURY,
FISH CAKE SOUP, LOTUS LEAF RICE,

967
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:49,487
GRILLED EEL, ROASTED SWEET POTATOES,
POTATOES, STRAWBERRIES

968
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,092
-Yesterday's dinner…
-Yesterday was…

969
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,662
-Yesterday was an exception.
-Since we were filming?

970
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,864
-From two or three…
-You ate all day yesterday.

971
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,199
Because we're filming this.

972
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,500
But it was so good.

973
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,435
After you ate so much fried chicken,

974
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,737
-you ate so much at Sookmakase.
-It was more than that.

975
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:11,175
I've never met someone
who actually does intermittent fasting.

976
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,910
You ate that bread even at the bath house.

977
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,979
WHAT JIN-KYUNG ATE INTERMITTENTLY
BREAD, FRIED CHICKEN, SOOKMAKASE

978
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,514
We ate fried chicken together,

979
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,083
but you ate some more
when your manager got one for the road.

980
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,685
Was it the classic one or sauced?

981
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,820
She ate so much fried chicken.

982
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,556
I'm sorry. Actually,

983
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,191
I eat a lot.

984
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,860
I JUST EAT A LOT

985
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,027
She had fried chicken and…

986
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,098
A PEACEFUL MORNING
WITH QUICK ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

987
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,100
-Hey.
-Is something out there?

988
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,468
-What's out there?
-What is it?

989
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,003
-What is it?
-There's a coffee truck.

990
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,705
Netflix sent one for us.

991
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,974
NETFLIX SENT A COFFEE TRUCK

992
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,375
-What is this?
-Wow!

993
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,210
What is that in front of my house?

994
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,778
It's so cute.

995
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,314
Wow. Netflix really sent that?

996
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,482
WE ARE ROOTING FOR YOU, SCREWBALLS!

997
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,151
What does this mean?

998
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,585
To thank us for our hard work?

999
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,621
"We are rooting for you, Screwballs."

1000
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,489
-Wow.
-Can we get some coffee?

1001
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,458
-Let's check it out.
-Is it just coffee

1002
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,559
or do they have bread too?

1003
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,994
I thought you don't eat much.

1004
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,096
I eat a lot of breakfast, Sook.

1005
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,364
You ate though.

1006
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,798
-But…
-Do you want bread too?

1007
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,434
-I want bread too.
-Oh, yeah. I got some bread too.

1008
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,402
-Yeah!
-Bread.

1009
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,070
-Let's have some bread with it.
-Let's have bread.

1010
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,506
WE'RE HERE TO ORDER COFFEE

1011
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,674
Hello.

1012
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,511
Thank you for your hard work
so early in the morning.

1013
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,114
GOOD GOOD MORNING

1014
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,949
LOOK OVER HERE

1015
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,717
I can't believe this.

1016
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,820
EVERYONE, WE GOT A COFFEE TRUCK

1017
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,591
I'll have a hot organic Boseong green tea.

1018
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,459
I'll have an iced Americano or…

1019
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,361
-The air is so fresh.
-What about you?

1020
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,864
-He'll get it for me.
-What did you order?

1021
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,866
-A Jolly Pong shake and <i>misugaru.</i>
-Really?

1022
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,768
What? I ordered
the Jolly Pong shake for you.

1023
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,869
And <i>misugaru</i>.

1024
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,371
What? You said you were fine
with just the shake.

1025
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,473
-I'm going to drink both of them.
-What?

1026
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,709
I'm going to have
the Jolly Pong shake and <i>misugaru.</i>

1027
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,044
What about your fast?

1028
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,147
You guys. I do eat breakfast, you know.

1029
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,349
I eat whatever I want for breakfast.

1030
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,417
SHE SEEMS TO BINGE EAT HABITUALLY

1031
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,986
For breakfast,
I eat pork belly, <i>samgyetang</i>

1032
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,421
fried chicken, and even pizza.

1033
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,655
Thank you.

1034
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,526
-Is this truck called Unnies?
-Yes.

1035
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,562
-You named it that?
-Yes.

1036
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,463
Why?

1037
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,898
Because of Unnies?

1038
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,735
Oh, because you are two women?

1039
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,504
We only have two women working here
and no men.

1040
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,276
I thought you named it that
because you were a fan of Sook and me.

1041
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:26,844
That isn't why, is it?

1042
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,812
DOUBLE CHECKING

1043
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,513
That also played a part.

1044
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,949
What percentage of a part did it play?

1045
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,352
Jin-kyung, if she didn't give you
an enthusiastic answer,

1046
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,087
just take a hint and move on.

1047
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,823
It felt like she wanted to say,
"I'm so busy. Why is she bugging me?"

1048
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,924
SHE TAKES HINTS INTERMITTENTLY

1049
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,926
Thank you very much.

1050
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,060
Enjoy.

1051
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,363
Thank you. The <i>misugaru </i>is nice and rich.

1052
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,297
THEY GOT TO ENJOY SOME DESSERT

1053
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,798
-It's so good.
-I'll take the shake.

1054
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,133
Okay.

1055
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,070
Producer Park, so is this
the final episode for this season?

1056
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,972
Are we doing another one?

1057
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,743
He has to clear his schedule if we do.

1058
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,812
What's in your schedule? Tell us.

1059
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,081
I have to visit my family in Busan.

1060
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,250
-Okay.
-Visit my family.

1061
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,086
Then, shoot <i>You're So Pretty, Noona.</i>
What was the name again?

1062
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,187
<i>Mind the Noona Gap.</i>

1063
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,056
-<i>Mind the Noona Gap.</i>
-Yes, <i>Mind the Noona Gap.</i>

1064
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,092
HE SHOULD JUST CONTINUE
FILMING SCREWBALLS

1065
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,061
-What else?
-Working on your music, right?

1066
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,663
How's Jun-ho?

1067
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,232
Can't you bring him on our show?

1068
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,067
Just bring him once.

1069
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,769
-Jin-kyung.
-He knows you.

1070
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:28,005
What is the title of the hit drama

1071
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,140
that Jun-ho was in?

1072
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,474
Of course, she knows that.

1073
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,643
Come on. How could you ask that?

1074
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,847
If she likes him that much,
I'm sure she knows.

1075
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,482
I don't watch TV.

1076
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,718
Then, when did you fall for Jun-ho?

1077
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,720
-At his concert.
-That's right. At his concert.

1078
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,388
What about when he was on <i>Beat Coin</i>?

1079
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,589
Was he on Beat Coin?

1080
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,725
GOSH

1081
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,560
The entire group of 2PM was on the show.

1082
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,962
-Nichkhun was there…
-Yeah.

1083
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,798
-This is so funny.
-It was so fun.

1084
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,866
Sometimes when I'm talking with Jin-kyung…

1085
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,934
This is just sometimes.

1086
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,270
I feel like I'm floating in space.

1087
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,473
Part of me feels like she'd be very happy.

1088
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,875
-I feel like I'm floating…
-My head clears up.

1089
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,445
…aimlessly here and there.

1090
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,846
This is what I think.

1091
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,648
There's an issue with my hippocampus,

1092
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,118
but I also think that I just live my life
from day to day.

1093
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,454
I don't take it to my memory.

1094
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,688
I think so too.

1095
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,457
I just live my life for that day.

1096
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,592
I burn it up and it's gone.

1097
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,861
Then, I live the next day like that.
That's how I am.

1098
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,963
I think that's a health way to live.

1099
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,633
I don't find the need
to keep that all in my memory.

1100
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,802
I don't think you have
any control of that though.

1101
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,070
It's automatic.

1102
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,073
-This is nice.
-Yes.

1103
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,077
-So today is the last day of shooting.
-Yes.

1104
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,881
We prepared the real final shoot
for our way back to Seoul.

1105
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,217
-On our way back?
-There's a cafe on our way back.

1106
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,485
A cafe?

1107
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,021
I don't think I can drink any other coffee
than the one Netflix sent us.

1108
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,824
You don't have to drink coffee
at the cafe then.

1109
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,059
Is there something there?

1110
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,294
There's a small event.

1111
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,798
We prepared an event
to honor all the hard work

1112
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,600
you've done this year.

1113
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,635
What is the event?

1114
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,204
-Could it be--
-Our parents aren't there, are they?

1115
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,574
A SURPRISE VISIT FROM THEIR PARENTS?

1116
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,180
OR A MESSAGE FROM THE PARENTS?

1117
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,049
Is it a final
celebratory performance for us?

1118
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,018
Should we perform <i>I'll Be Back</i> there?

1119
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:27,691
IT WAS A SHAME TO DANCE ONLY ONCE
SO MAYBE A 5PM CAFE EVENT?

1120
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,529
EYES FULL OF ANTICIPATION

1121
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,299
Come on. Why did you guys
prepare something so big?

1122
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,634
Do we have to dress up?

1123
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,437
-I think we should.
-Should we go like this?

1124
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,807
I think you can dress the way
you normally dress.

1125
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,442
Something simple.

1126
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,879
But the staff are the ones
who worked so hard. We did nothing.

1127
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,448
-You didn't need to throw an event for us.
-Yeah.

1128
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,583
We should be throwing you an event.

1129
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,285
Let's pull our money together for them.

1130
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,186
Pull?

1131
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,388
-You mean, pool our money.
-Pull what?

1132
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,622
POOL OUR MONEY TOGETHER

1133
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,458
She lives every day like a brand new day.

1134
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,426
So her words must be brand new as well.

1135
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,961
Thank you so much.

1136
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,362
-Thank you.
-Gosh.

1137
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,998
All of you are so warmhearted.

1138
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,534
ONE HOUR LATER

1139
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,338
What's this?

1140
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,506
We must have arrived.

1141
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,909
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARRIVED
AT THEIR DESTINATION

1142
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,178
Darn it. What is that?

1143
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:22,947
What is it?

1144
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:26,917
What's that?

1145
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,185
It's bungee jumping.

1146
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,354
The GPS seems to be taking us there.

1147
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,689
Isn't that a construction site?

1148
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,492
-Excuse me. I'll get out here.
-What is that?

1149
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,228
It looks different from bungee jumping.

1150
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,430
What is that? It looks different.

1151
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,564
WHAT DID THEY SEE?

1152
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,733
Wait. Why is it so high up?

1153
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,101
We aren't going to a cafe.

1154
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,236
Being so high up…

1155
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,671
-It looks different.
-It's called something-land.

1156
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,642
You know, look at how high up we are.

1157
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,578
I bet it's going to be way scarier.

1158
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,147
<i>-What is this?</i>
<i>-In-seok, this is wrong.</i>

1159
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,782
I'm getting out of this car.

1160
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,984
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE MEMBERS?

1161
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,620
Please, let it be tails.

1162
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,489
Tails!

1163
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,458
Tails!

1164
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,294
