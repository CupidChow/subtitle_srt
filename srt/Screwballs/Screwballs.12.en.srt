1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,140
I want to spend
the last day of my life here.

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,441
A STUNNING HOTEL SUITE

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,111
This hotel is really fabulous.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,445
It's my cup of tea.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,848
BUT WE NEVER SAID
ALL OF YOU COULD STAY HERE

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,750
THEIR PERFORMANCE IN GAMES
WILL DECIDE

7
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,118
HOW MANY CAN SLEEP INDOORS

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,053
You want us to sleep out there in tents?

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,623
Don't be absurd, okay?
We can't sleep out there.

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,960
We have prepared five games,

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,997
and the more you succeed,
the more of you can stay in the suite.

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,033
OFF WE GO WITH HUMAN ZERO

13
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,801
IT'S A SUCCESS!

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,569
NEXT IS JEGI

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,440
One.

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,509
DUE TO THE MISSION FAILURE,
ONE PERSON MUST SLEEP OUTDOORS

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,978
This is Guess the Survey Results.

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,448
On "the person likely to have been popular
among the opposite sex in school,"

19
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,717
-your predictions are correct.
-Are you serious?

20
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:51,985
DID THEY SUCCEED
IN ANOTHER MISSION?

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
For real?

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,687
-Pear.
-Melon.

23
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,922
-Banana.
-Irwin mango.

24
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,824
-Honeydew melon.
-Okay!

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,759
THEY SEEMED TRIUMPHANT HERE…

26
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,660
The answer is 200 won!

27
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,931
FAILING THE CALCULATION MISSION
DOOMED ANOTHER PERSON

28
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,167
WHILE THE CONSOLATION GAME
SEEMED HOPELESS…

29
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,571
WOO-JAE SAVED ONE SOUL
WITH HIS ARGUABLE BRUTE STRENGTH

30
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,741
IN THE END, ONE PERSON
MUST SLEEP OUTDOORS

31
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,546
THE UNLUCKY PERSON
WILL BE DECIDED AFTER DINNER

32
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,315
I get to visit this place at long last.

33
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,851
-"Joseho," just like my name.
-Gosh, you're right.

34
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,853
Goodness, it does say that.

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,022
I hear Kim Won-hyo runs this place.

36
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,292
The name is short for "fishing boat
hauling in shellfish and shrimp."

37
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,060
Look at the size of the shrimp.

38
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,995
-Man, those are gigantic.
-Right?

39
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,965
-I can't wait to try them.
-Look at those crabs, Jin-kyung.

40
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,934
-King crabs.
-Such big ones got caught.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,503
-Dang.
-Gosh, our tables are all set up.

42
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,138
Is this really it?

43
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,873
Do we get to eat here?

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,376
STARTING FROM THE 4-TIER TOWER
OF ASSORTED SHELLFISH

45
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,344
SHRIMP

46
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,312
CHOPPED LIVE OCTOPUS

47
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,379
COLD RAW FISH SOUP

48
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,547
AND STEAMED KING CRAB

49
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,783
A SEAFOOD FEAST AWAITS THE CAST

50
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,653
Our table is filled with delicacies.

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,021
It's so luxurious.

52
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,456
-Can we eat these?
-My goodness.

53
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,959
You might as well enjoy the trip
for a change. Bon appétit.

54
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,961
-This meal comes without a catch?
-Unbelievable.

55
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,829
-Everyone, enjoy.
-What do I do with these?

56
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,398
PICKS UP A SHRIMP RIGHT ON CUE

57
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,667
IS THAT A GROAN?

58
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,340
OR A MOAN?

59
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,743
You can tell how fresh they are
when you sink your teeth into the flesh.

60
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,181
WOO-YOUNG ENJOYS A BITE
OF THE ICE-COLD RAW FISH SOUP

61
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,651
WHILE SOOK RELISHES THE
JUICY MEAT OF STEAMED KING CRAB

62
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,754
EVERYONE SAVORS THE FEAST

63
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
Look at this.

64
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,458
LOOK AT THIS GUY'S CRAZED EYES

65
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,662
A LONG EXCLAMATION

66
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,831
I discovered that the crab meat
goes well with butter.

67
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,666
DINNER PARTY WITH SEAFOOD GALORE

68
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,768
AN APPRECIATIVE GROAN

69
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,205
I'm tempted to stuff myself
and upset my stomach.

70
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,606
-It's amazing.
-My goodness.

71
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,575
Wanna share? Oh, you already have one.

72
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,143
I finished this big chunk alone.

73
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,881
Take your time with the food.

74
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,616
The crew prepared an amazing feast for us.

75
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,218
My gosh, it all tastes amazing.

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,655
But I don't understand
why they went this far for us.

77
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,391
It's unlike them to be so generous
without some tricks.

78
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,458
-Wolf it down.
-If you ask me…

79
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,027
Here's my take, Jin-kyung.

80
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,462
They must've anticipated
a bunch of us camping outside tonight.

81
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,965
They prepared all this just to console us.

82
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,300
-Isn't that likely?
-Totally.

83
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,936
But a whopping four of us
are sleeping indoors.

84
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,504
That's a solid theory.

85
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,107
Whoever ends up sleeping outside,
let's not resent the arrangement, okay?

86
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,109
-Sure.
-It's nothing.

87
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,845
Whoever it may be, they should leave
in a good mood with a big smile.

88
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,281
We don't know who it will be,
let's all dig in.

89
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,184
-We'll at least have a hearty meal.
-They might kick us out, so…

90
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,120
-Please listen to my announcement.
-Sure thing.

91
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,958
As you know,
the theme of the shoot is "Besties Trip."

92
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,361
So, we prepared "Would You Rather"
centered around friendship.

93
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,029
A game of "Would You Rather"
on friendship?

94
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,732
You'll be given a theme
and two options, A or B.

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,169
Please select an option you prefer
and make a persuasive argument

96
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,872
-supporting your choice.
-Okay.

97
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,710
After the discussion is over,
the one with the most convincing

98
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,613
or the most charming argument
will be given a benefit.

99
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,714
What does it entail?

100
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,084
When we return to the hotel
shortly after your dinner,

101
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,286
we'll be selecting
who'll sleep outdoors, right?

102
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,622
The decision will be made
by the spin of a roulette.

103
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,725
-That's what we prepared.
-A roulette?

104
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,094
-That's so scary.
-I stressed we exclude games of luck.

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,929
-Our hearts are bound to lurch, then.
-I'm nervous.

106
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,866
The benefit holder can request another
spin if their name is chosen initially.

107
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,202
-That's huge.
-It's a game changer.

108
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,103
It's major, right?

109
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,773
That as good as guarantees
that person's overnight stay in the suite.

110
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,309
Here's the theme for you.

111
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,411
Please choose an option
that you'd rather avoid,

112
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,979
-not the one you prefer.
-One we'd avoid?

113
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,848
Your first option is a friend

114
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,550
who tries to hook you up with someone
you aren't into at a pickup bar.

115
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,819
Your second option is a friend

116
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,789
who keeps going and spilling
all your cringy moments.

117
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,392
If you dislike friends who push you
to people you're not interested,

118
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,394
-please raise your hands.
-Me.

119
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,597
How about those of you who dislike friends
who keep mentioning your shameful past?

120
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,133
Give me a bit more time to consider.

121
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,336
So what if they tried to hook me up
with someone I wasn't interested in?

122
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,038
-I can stay away.
-I can just not see them.

123
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,574
Unwanted romance is worse for me.

124
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,542
I'd rather revisit my past.

125
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,977
-Agreed.
-We're on the same page.

126
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,745
Oh, the team is split.

127
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,180
I can explain.

128
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,516
Let me explain. Here's what I think.

129
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,652
The matchmaking offer
would've uplifted my mood, right?

130
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,287
SCREWBALLS SPECIAL
MEMORIES OF PICKUP BAR

131
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,388
-Hi.
-Hello.

132
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,357
-Hey, Woo-young.
-Let's say Sae-ho invited me here.

133
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,558
-Woo-young.
-Hey.

134
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,859
-Sae-ho.
-You can sit there.

135
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,695
-Goodness.
-Go on.

136
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,264
Let me introduce my friend, Woo-young.

137
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,132
Her name is Jin-kyung.

138
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,134
Dang, what on earth?

139
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,269
Her name is Jin-kyung.

140
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,738
HOW DID CHUCKY END UP
IN A PICKUP BAR?

141
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,740
I want a time-out.

142
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,308
Forget about the discussion.

143
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,711
I'm too pissed to continue with this.

144
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,080
-He was acting.
-It's bad manners to act so startled.

145
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,316
BUT HOW COULD HE NOT
GET STARTLED?

146
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,186
So, would you feel more comfortable
with being forced to make a move?

147
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,320
It's much more preferable.

148
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,622
Who cares if the other person
gets the wrong impression?

149
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,857
I just won't engage myself.

150
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,927
What if there was a woman
that you actually liked in the bar

151
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,930
and you couldn't talk to her
because of your friend's interference?

152
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,665
That can easily be countered.

153
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,734
Let's say I'm interested in Sook
and not in Jin-kyung.

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,902
-Got it. I'll push you toward Jin-kyung.
-Have at it.

155
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,003
Swap your seat with me.

156
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,272
-I need to tell Sook something.
-Like what?

157
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,208
Oh, Woo-jae's coming here?

158
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,776
-I'll move too.
-Yeah, come over here.

159
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,579
-Where do you live, Woo-jae?
-In Gangnam.

160
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,148
Could you move down the table, Jin-kyung?

161
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,150
-Sorry about this.
-Here's the thing.

162
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,352
-Oh, so you live in Gangnam.
-That's right.

163
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,587
Where in Gangnam, exactly?

164
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,322
Exactly? I live in Yeoksam-dong.

165
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,690
-Yeoksam-dong?
-Yeah.

166
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,192
-What is he doing?
-Why did he give me the soda?

167
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,628
-Why is he being nice to me?
-Excuse me. Could you throw this out?

168
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,530
PREPARES ANOTHER SHOT
AT WINNING SOOK OVER

169
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,265
AFTER THE INITIAL SUCCESS
WITH THE SODA

170
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,134
-Not at all.
-Really?

171
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,570
Housing options in Pyeongchang-dong
are expensive from what I know.

172
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,606
I could say the same about Yeoksam-dong.

173
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,876
Yeoksam-dong has a wider range of options…

174
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,677
-At any rate--
-Thanks!

175
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,312
How kind of you.

176
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,349
THIS FRIEND IS
ON THE TACTLESS SIDE

177
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,551
Thanks for this.

178
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,452
NOM

179
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,721
THE FRUIT OF HIS ENDEAVOR
WENT TO SOMEONE ELSE

180
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,622
Well, still…

181
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,557
TRIES HIS BEST TO KEEP CALM

182
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,026
-Things are going smoothly there.
-Okay, let's go.

183
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,394
Do you have plans for this Saturday?

184
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,862
This Saturday?

185
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,330
On this Saturday…

186
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,365
I'll be working.

187
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,367
Really? When do you get off work?

188
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,603
TRIES TO COP OUT

189
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,972
Where are your manners?

190
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,441
STICKS TO HIS ACT DESPERATELY

191
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,310
-Wake up, Woo-jae.
-Oh, hi. It's just that…

192
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,546
I'm such a lightweight, you see.

193
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,114
When do you get out of work on Saturday?

194
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,682
HOLD UP, LET ME ZONE OUT AGAIN

195
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,983
-Woo-jae.
-Yeah?

196
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,385
WAKE UP, WOO-JAE

197
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,587
-I'm so sorry.
-Pull yourself together.

198
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,824
-Kiss the girl.
-Kiss the girl.

199
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,792
HE ASSURED US
HE COULD STAY AWAY…

200
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,129
Welcome, everyone.
It's time for today's special event.

201
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,432
Let's begin the couples' game.
Give it up for our contenders!

202
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,602
THE WHOLE WORLD IS PRESSURING
HIM TO GET TOGETHER WITH HER

203
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,206
Let's play the Chocolate Stick Game.

204
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,209
-Congratulations.
-Please bite this from both ends.

205
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,011
Let me announce the prize
for the couple with the shortest stick.

206
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,980
The house will be taking up their tab!

207
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,483
I'll gladly pay for my table.

208
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,785
-Are they going to kiss?
-Come on, Woo-jae.

209
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,488
Let's not think about paying just yet.
We could still save money.

210
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,323
Can't I spend my money however I want?

211
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,492
Why would you worry about my money?

212
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,126
Come on, don't be a buzzkill.

213
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,929
We're having a draw.
The prize for the lucky winners…

214
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,197
is two movie tickets!

215
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,398
A round of applause!

216
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,001
WOO-JAE ONLY WANTS TO KNOW
SOOK'S NUMBER

217
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,603
-I have the winning number.
-What is it?

218
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,671
-It's the table number 23.
-What a shame.

219
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,975
-Gosh, that's us!
-Congratulations!

220
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,177
Our table number is 24.

221
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,111
Congratulations.

222
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,380
-Here are your movie tickets.
-Thank you.

223
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,414
Here. Take them.

224
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,616
Let's use them together.

225
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,084
Let me be frank with you.

226
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,252
No, don't be.

227
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,319
-Earlier--
-No, stop it.

228
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,122
JUST CHEW ON THIS, WOO-JAE

229
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,424
Let's move on.

230
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,094
What genre do you like?
For movies, I mean.

231
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,095
Movie genre?

232
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,365
I think Sook said she loved romance films.

233
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,035
SOOK IS ALL WOO-JAE THINKS ABOUT

234
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:00,406
I'm sorry,
but I'd rather not mislead you further.

235
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,875
-So, let's call it quits here.
-But--

236
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,210
Goodness, you two.

237
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,479
-You look so lovely together.
-I suppose we do!

238
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,780
Sook!

239
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,583
-You get movie tickets too!
-I realize we only met tonight,

240
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,051
but I must tell you how I feel.

241
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,320
BUT SOOK IS ALREADY
WOO-YOUNG'S GIRL

242
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,289
These two decided to go out together.

243
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,290
You can sit back down.

244
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,691
I just won't engage myself.

245
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,759
LIFE IS NEVER EASY

246
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,694
Let's just continue with our game.

247
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,396
THERE'S NO ESCAPING HER

248
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,865
-Maybe the shellfish had gone bad.
-Let's play the game.

249
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,133
-What's up?
-I need to take a dump.

250
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,034
Oh, really?

251
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,037
We've upgraded our facilities.
Feel free to relieve yourself here.

252
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,406
DO WHATEVER'S NECESSARY HERE AND
FOCUS ON YOUR BUDDING ROMANCE

253
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,042
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it for you.

254
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,310
THE SKIT ENDS
IN WOO-JAE'S DEFEAT

255
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,479
Here come the fried rice
and seafood noodles.

256
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,981
Look at the noodles.

257
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,316
SEAFOOD NOODLES FOR DESSERT

258
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,283
It's mind-blowing.

259
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,053
-Are the noodles good?
-They're good.

260
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,588
IT TASTES EVEN BETTER
AFTER THE ZEALOUS SKIT

261
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,958
THE CAST ENJOY THEIR FOOD,

262
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,560
UNCONCERNED
BY THE CAMPING PENALTY

263
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,430
It's so good.

264
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,431
HAPPY FOR NOW

265
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,232
This is insane.

266
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,235
I hope none of us
have to sleep outdoors tonight.

267
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,105
But at least one person
is definitely doing that for sure.

268
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,878
AS DARKNESS SETS IN BUSAN…

269
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,549
THE ROULETTE HAS ALREADY
BEGUN SPINNING

270
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,786
ONE OF THE FIVE CAST MEMBERS

271
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,889
IS GOING TO SLEEP TONIGHT
WHILE FACING BUSAN'S SEAFRONT

272
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,393
Will we be spinning the roulette now?

273
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,661
That's right.

274
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,465
Let me remind you of the mini-game
you participated in over dinner

275
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,501
-that promised a benefit.
-Oh, we did that.

276
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,803
The winner gets the chance
to request another spin.

277
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,105
It's huge.

278
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,673
I liked Jin-kyung's performance.

279
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,608
-It was convincing, wasn't it?
-The right

280
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,076
to request one more spin

281
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,412
can reduce your chances
of ending up outdoors

282
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,914
-from 20% to 4%.
-My goodness.

283
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,516
That's almost 0%.

284
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,852
-It is indeed virtually 0%.
-You're right.

285
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,321
Woo-young, judging by your pajamas,
you're determined to sleep here.

286
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,923
That's right. I happen to be…

287
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,592
Well, I'm an indoorsy guy.

288
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,761
An "indoorsy" guy? Is that even a thing?

289
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,396
-What's that?
-He's witty.

290
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,797
What does that even mean?

291
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,199
Why don't we take a moment
to look at our supposed lodgings?

292
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,969
-I did take a look, actually.
-Is it visible now?

293
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,037
I felt nervous, you see.

294
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,471
But it's so bright out there.

295
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,207
-You mean it's well-lit?
-The light there is almost harsh.

296
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,609
I don't think we'd get a wink there.

297
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,344
-We'd need an eye mask.
-Exactly.

298
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,946
-I can't sleep with the light on.
-I saw anglers outside.

299
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,683
What if they end up getting me?
When they cast their line?

300
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,385
You're worried they might get you?
Maybe you want to sleep out there.

301
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,987
What's gotten into me?

302
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,255
-Weren't you an indoorsy guy?
-I am.

303
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,324
MAYBE THE INTERIOR OF A TENT
COUNTS AS INDOORS?

304
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,760
We have the results.

305
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,530
Based on your discussions
during the Would You Rather game,

306
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,799
the glorious winner is…

307
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,701
Get ready, Jin-kyung. It must be you.

308
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,235
-My money is on Sae-ho.
-Why?

309
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,005
Mine is on Jin-kyung.
You'd better get ready.

310
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,107
Woo-young prepared a set of pajamas.

311
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,142
-Let's congratulate…
-What? It must be you.

312
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,112
-…Sae-ho.
-See? I thought so.

313
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,514
Just a second.

314
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,783
I'm not trying to dispute the results,

315
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,618
but may I ask why you voted for him?

316
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,421
-I introduced the couples' event.
-Oh, I remember.

317
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,057
-I added variety to our skit.
-That's true.

318
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,759
I don't want to nitpick,

319
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,627
but shouldn't you
congratulate your colleague

320
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,895
on their achievements?

321
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,630
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
BESTIES ON A TRIP

322
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,433
I'd rather not fake it for the camera.

323
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,569
What do you mean?

324
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,805
I can't congratulate someone else
when I feel like crap.

325
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,607
HEH-HEH

326
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,975
-Thank you.
-As matters stand…

327
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,376
He'd be sleeping indoors.

328
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,812
-Thank you. I appreciate it.
-Lucky him.

329
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,415
I hate it so much.

330
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,117
Please set up the roulette.

331
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,587
-Just try it.
-We have to write our own names.

332
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,255
It has 15 empty slots in total.

333
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,191
Please select three slots each
to write your names down.

334
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,193
Alternatively,
we could select a color each.

335
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,696
-That works, too.
-By colors?

336
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,898
-May I take the sky blue ones?
-Sure, go ahead.

337
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,832
I'm choosing randomly.

338
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,367
Isn't that AMOUPRE's brand color?

339
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,369
Yes, exactly.

340
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,771
That was smooth, dude.

341
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,974
A full-day shoot wasn't enough
to get a compliment from him,

342
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,876
but one mention of AMOUPRE
softened him up.

343
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,011
-How ridiculous.
-You're really smooth.

344
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,513
Woo-jae has a point.

345
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,014
I'm seeing you in a new light.

346
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,349
Make your pick, Jin-kyung.

347
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,050
-Shall I choose one color too?
-Yeah.

348
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,685
OTHER MEMBERS FOLLOW SUIT

349
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,988
THE ROULETTE IS ALL FILLED UP

350
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,556
I've got a bad feeling about this.

351
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,359
-It's so nerve-racking.
-Oh, man…

352
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,596
It feels terrible to leave my fate
to a game of chance.

353
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,198
THE ROULETTE OF DESTINY

354
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,133
Wait. It should spin this way, right?

355
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,701
-Shall we, then?
-Hold up.

356
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,470
-Wait!
-Why do you get to spin it?

357
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,173
-I won't, then. Rock-Paper-Scissors?
-Let's do that.

358
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,175
-Let's have the winner spin it.
-Okay.

359
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,342
You snooze, you lose.

360
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,610
SOOK, JIN-KYUNG
AND WOO-YOUNG WON

361
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,978
You snooze, you lose.

362
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,980
JIN-KYUNG IS THE FINAL WINNER

363
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,682
-Will you do a trial run?
-No.

364
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,318
UNDER THE BRIDGE
VERSUS A 5-STAR HOTEL SUITE

365
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,788
THEIR FATE RESTS
ON JIN-KYUNG NOW

366
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,690
-Give it a good spin!
-Spin it!

367
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,759
-Give it a good spin!
-Spin it!

368
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,362
The person who's chosen here
will have to sleep outdoors.

369
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,331
THE NIGHT AIR IS
STILL QUITE CHILLY

370
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,400
THE WATER IS ONLY 3 METERS AWAY

371
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,236
THE GLARINGLY BRIGHT LIGHT
WILL SURELY KEEP YOU UP

372
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,839
WHO WILL HAVE TO LEAVE
THE 5-STAR HOTEL

373
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,740
TO STAY THE NIGHT
IN THE HUMBLE TENT?

374
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,313
Oh, no!

375
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,014
PLEASE…

376
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,317
ALL EYES ARE ON THE ROULETTE

377
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,653
Oh, no!

378
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,788
Okay!

379
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,724
HONG

380
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,460
Okay! Hong Jin-kyung!

381
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,196
-It's Jin-kyung.
-My goodness.

382
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,398
SHOCKED

383
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,802
THE TRUTH IS TOO HARSH
TO BELIEVE

384
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,770
CHILLS

385
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,205
CAUTIOUS

386
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,375
MY NAME IS
IN THE VERY NEXT SLOT!

387
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,509
Oh, dear. What do we do about this?

388
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,944
CAN'T HIDE HER SMILE

389
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,847
JIN-KYUNG'S LEGS GIVE OUT AND
WOO-JAE HIDES BEHIND THE COUCH

390
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,048
Just a second.

391
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,552
-Stop toying with me, okay?
-No one's doing that.

392
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,820
Don't joke around.

393
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,922
No one tampered with it, right?

394
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,057
Don't forget you spun it yourself.

395
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,360
-If only it had come over here…
-My goodness.

396
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,628
SHE BROUGHT IT ON HERSELF

397
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,197
-If only it had come over here…
-My goodness.

398
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,600
JANG - HONG

399
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:07,406
THAT MOMENT,
THE CREW STARTS MURMURING

400
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,808
Hey.

401
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,111
-Hey, the needle is pointing at Jang.
-Jang?

402
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,178
What?

403
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,480
-No way. It's Hong.
-It's Hong.

404
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,715
-Wait.
-It's shaped like an arrow.

405
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,883
IT IS SHAPED LIKE AN ARROW

406
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,785
AND ITS END IS POINTING AT JANG

407
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,087
-It's shaped like an arrow.
-Sook is right!

408
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,089
IT IS INDEED SHAPED
LIKE AN ARROW!

409
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,858
THE ARROW'S TIP - THE STOPPER

410
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,627
YES, IT'S AN ARROW POINTER!

411
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,598
THRILLED

412
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,466
WE'RE SLEEPING IN THE SUITE

413
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,835
THE HOTEL SUITE QUARTET
IS ELATED

414
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,274
THEIR FATES ARE CHANGED
IN A FLASH

415
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,876
Hold on. Just a second, guys.

416
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,544
-What?
-The result is clear.

417
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,179
-I made it out alive!
-It's an arrow.

418
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,148
-Isn't it ambiguous?
-No, the arrow shape is clear.

419
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,215
It's an arrow.

420
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,451
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT
THE ARROW IS POINTING AT JANG

421
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,819
It's clearly an arrow.

422
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,354
-My gosh.
-There's no doubt about that.

423
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,589
-Good for you, Jin-kyung.
-Gosh, Sook. I almost died.

424
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,058
-It's an arrow.
-Gosh, Sae-ho.

425
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,826
My heart is racing like crazy.

426
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,828
-That was a close call.
-Wait.

427
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,964
This one isn't in my slot.

428
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,533
That's supposed to hold it in place.
It did its part.

429
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,302
Why don't we have Woo-young and Jin-kyung…

430
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,371
WHAT NOW?

431
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,440
Isn't this out of line?

432
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,208
-I was scared senseless.
-My goodness.

433
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,210
-You know what?
-How could you decide by this one?

434
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,646
I thought it was bad luck
when I first saw your pajamas.

435
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,780
My soles are sweating.

436
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,116
My heart lurched, thinking it was me.

437
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:28,053
The roulette is set up
to give us heart attacks.

438
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,723
-How did it stop like this?
-Here's the thing.

439
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,925
Isn't it ridiculous?

440
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,660
We should've been focusing on the arrow…

441
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,362
-The stopper held it there.
-…not the stopper.

442
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,098
That's my point.
Shouldn't you take that into account?

443
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,899
-If it only had moved--
-No, the arrow's tip--

444
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,267
Don't you dare touch it.

445
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,469
TEARS

446
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,271
We should judge by the arrow's tip.
Woo-young, get going.

447
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,909
-It's time for bed.
-But I'm an indoorsy guy.

448
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,678
We have to… An indoorsy guy.

449
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,514
If sleeping alone
is truly too much for you,

450
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,351
Woo-jae and I will put our names
in one slot each,

451
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,587
with your name on the remainder.

452
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,955
If I get selected, I'll join you.

453
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,724
-Why don't I get a say in this?
-That was just an example.

454
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,593
-Have you lost it?
-So, how about it?

455
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,328
There's no way we'll get chosen.

456
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,930
Sae-ho, think how terrible you'll feel
if you do get selected.

457
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,298
But what are the chances, right?

458
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,035
In that case, I have an offer for you.

459
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,470
-Don't even suggest it.
-Oh, come on.

460
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,706
-It's all been decided.
-Let me just put it out there.

461
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,542
Why does our shoot always go on forever?

462
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,345
-What offer? It's all been settled.
-Let's hear him out, Jin-kyung.

463
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,880
Just give it a listen.

464
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,582
Our theme is
"Besties Trip in Busan," right?

465
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,651
-Oh, no. Forget it.
-Yeah, we're good.

466
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,387
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP ANYMORE

467
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,056
DEEPLY UPSET

468
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,824
It will be very meaningful for Woo-young

469
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,793
-because he's from Busan.
-That's right.

470
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,062
Won't it be lovely to sleep outdoors
in your hometown?

471
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,597
It's doubly upsetting to sleep out there
when I have my family here.

472
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,634
All I can do for Woo-young now
is to wave at him from the window.

473
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,002
You could probably see us, right?

474
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,738
We'll say our good night
with a flashlight.

475
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,374
-I haven't made my offer yet.
-Okay, let's hear it.

476
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,543
If you succeed at a game,
Woo-young can sleep here.

477
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,045
-If we fail?
-One more person must join him.

478
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,314
-That's why we aren't interested.
-How ridiculous.

479
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,383
-Why would we?
-We're not going to do it.

480
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,052
-That has no merits for us.
-We're choosing not to do it.

481
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,055
Okay, I got it.
While I expected you would say that…

482
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,457
Woo-young, get going.

483
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,658
GET LOST, WOO-YOUNG

484
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,660
YOU'RE ALL SO MEAN

485
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,695
-We should get ready for bed.
-He's right about that.

486
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,397
Will all of you be sleeping here?

487
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,898
Yeah, all 40 people here.

488
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,001
LEAVE SO ALL 40 OF US CAN START
LAYING OUT THE BEDDINGS

489
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,605
-You might be happier over there.
-Leave us.

490
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,375
Can't you just beat it already?

491
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,846
-Let us sleep in peace.
-But still, Director.

492
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,116
It's stuck in the middle. Why does
this ugly arrow get to hog the spotlight?

493
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,885
AS WOO-YOUNG KEEPS ON WHINING,
WOO-JAE STEPS IN

494
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,919
Here's what we'll do.

495
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,688
-If you're interested.
-It's "Besties Trip."

496
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,523
-That's right.
-I'll be magnanimous.

497
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,459
Sae-ho and I will put our names
on one slot each and spin the roulette.

498
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,028
If one of our names gets picked,
we'll go out with Woo-young.

499
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,965
-Otherwise, he has to go alone.
-So, how about it?

500
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,067
-The chances are low.
-Still, we're giving you a choice.

501
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,035
The probability isn't at all high.

502
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,938
Do I get to sleep here
if other guys are chosen?

503
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,441
No, you're still going out there.

504
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,243
-Just go.
-You're leaving no matter what.

505
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,978
-We were being generous!
-Don't even bother.

506
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,714
Okay, give me this shot.
I'll be so lonely out there.

507
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,749
THE 2ND ROULETTE IS PREPARED

508
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,818
I'll be amazed if our names get picked.

509
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,286
-There's no helping it then.
-Sae-ho.

510
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,656
If the arrow does point at our names,
let's leave without complaint.

511
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,758
Goodness. Your loyalty is admirable.

512
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,527
Of course. We're besties, after all.

513
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,829
-Let's have Jin-kyung spin it.
-So confident, huh?

514
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,264
-Do the honors.
-She'll do it.

515
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,966
You think you're safe.
We'll see about that.

516
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,301
-A long, good spin!
-One, two, three.

517
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,637
THE ROULETTE CAUSED
A HUGE DRAMA EARLIER

518
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,739
SAE-HO WAS SO SURE
ABOUT HIS SAFETY

519
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,841
AND WOO-JAE SUGGESTED
THAT THEY LEAVE IN HIGH SPIRITS

520
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,709
COULD THEIR NAMES BE CHOSEN?

521
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,912
-It's about to stop.
-I knew it.

522
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,547
-One more time.
-That's enough. Go.

523
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,516
The chances are way too slim.
Now, get lost.

524
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,919
We'd never get chosen.

525
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,220
SOOK GIVES IT ANOTHER SPIN

526
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,489
BUT JIN-KYUNG IGNORES IT
AND SAYS GOOD NIGHT

527
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,524
GOOD NIGHT

528
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,628
HURRY OVER THERE
BEFORE THE HAND WARMERS GO COLD

529
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,232
EVERYONE'S FATE HAS BEEN SETTLED

530
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,067
WAKE-UP MISSION ANNOUNCEMENT

531
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,938
I hope you'll have a peaceful night
at your designated lodgings.

532
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,941
When morning comes, an alarm will go off.

533
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,344
The Songdo Beach
is within easy walking distance,

534
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,479
less than nine minutes.

535
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,216
Please gather at the beach
as soon as you wake up.

536
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,452
What do we have to gain
if we arrive at the beach first?

537
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,188
We have one last mission
prepared at the beach.

538
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,489
Just a second.

539
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,726
You'll find that order matters greatly
for this certain task.

540
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,861
-Is anyone going into the water?
-It's a coin toss.

541
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,130
THAT IS CORRECT! ONE PERSON
HAS TO JUMP INTO THE WATER

542
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,299
It's still too cold to go into the water.

543
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,268
If you ask me,
Jin-kyung will stay up all night.

544
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,170
Does the last person to arrive
get the penalty?

545
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,772
-They'll do a coin toss first.
-Oh, in reverse order?

546
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,041
Getting there early doesn't matter, then.

547
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,244
No, the first to arrive
can go last in the coin toss.

548
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,144
Exactly.

549
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,880
-Things will likely be settled by then.
-You get the penalty with heads.

550
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,816
THE CHANCES GO DOWN
IF YOU GO LATER IN THE COIN TOSS

551
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,017
Let's get some sleep first.

552
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,985
FORGET ABOUT THE PENALTY

553
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,320
Come on, you have to leave.

554
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,389
I have a question.

555
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,124
Since Woo-young will be sleeping outside,

556
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,260
-he gets a headstart, doesn't he?
-That's true.

557
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,796
-I should've chosen sleeping outdoors.
-That doesn't sound fair.

558
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,466
Why didn't you bring this up earlier?

559
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,801
-He has that edge.
-It's a small consolation, if you will.

560
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,036
So annoying.

561
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,872
-When the alarm goes off…
-What is he saying?

562
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,609
…Woo-young should come up here
and wake us up before he goes.

563
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,547
When do you want us to get up, roughly?

564
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,550
-We had 8 a.m. in mind.
-Got it.

565
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,754
It isn't against the rule
to leave before the alarm rings, is it?

566
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,322
-It's not.
-I thought so.

567
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,224
Early risers can't help it.

568
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,893
Thanks for the info.

569
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,194
Thank you, everyone!

570
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,963
-Thank you.
-Great work.

571
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,965
AS THE SHOOT FOR DAY 1 WRAPS UP…

572
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,767
Is Woo-young's place set up far?

573
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,670
-It's right across the hotel's front door.
-Really? Then we'll walk him out.

574
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,837
Gosh, it's not necessary.

575
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,873
-I want to see you out.
-Goodness.

576
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,543
Wait, he's tagging along
only to see me miserable.

577
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,878
I'll stay here.

578
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:53,979
SADDENED

579
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,547
Here's what I'll do instead.

580
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,784
-If you do get the penalty tomorrow…
-Yeah?

581
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,985
I'll be there for you.

582
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,553
WOO-JAE PLANS ON BEING
LOYAL TOMORROW

583
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,621
I promise.

584
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,289
WILL HE, THOUGH?

585
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,390
Let's go.

586
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,459
We're in the lobby, but it's not cold.

587
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,729
I actually tagged along
to scope out our route for tomorrow.

588
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,332
Isn't this over the top?

589
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,933
Gosh, it's cold. I'm heading in.

590
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,302
-Come on, it's nice and cool.
-Don't be like that.

591
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,770
Goodness. It's so cold.

592
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,639
A NIGHT IN MARCH IS
STILL PRETTY CHILLY

593
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,342
Are we sure I can camp out here?

594
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,677
Can I just sleep here?

595
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,680
-Is that even allowed?
-I hear they received special permission.

596
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,449
SHOOT UNDERWAY
WE ASK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

597
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,684
-I bet we can see our suite from here.
-Of course.

598
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,886
-There it is.
-It's one floor down from the top floor.

599
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,154
Yeah, that's our place.

600
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,456
WHAT A VIEW, RIGHT?

601
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,657
THE CAST'S SUITE

602
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
GOSH, THE VIEW FROM HERE
IS AMAZING TOO

603
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,795
CHECKS THE SLEEPING BAG

604
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,398
I just put my hand inside,
and it's hot enough to burn your skin.

605
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,302
-Oh, my.
-It's scalding.

606
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,970
At least it's spacious here.

607
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,308
It seems I'll have an unforgettable night.

608
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,943
Can you do the dance from "Sexy Lady"?

609
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,344
Two, three, four.

610
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,345
BARELY MOVES

611
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,481
If you had put in effort,
I would've slept here too.

612
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,449
-There he goes again.
-What a shame.

613
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,952
Woo-young blew his final shot.

614
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,220
Leave already.

615
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,921
Pick a number from one to four.

616
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,256
-Number three.
-Number three?

617
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,291
Oh, dear. It's a dud.

618
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,794
HEH-HEH

619
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:16,895
Get going, then.

620
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,397
-Good night, then.
-Night.

621
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,898
-See you tomorrow.
-Sleep tight.

622
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:20,799
GOODBYE, WOO-YOUNG

623
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,834
We could be the ones
sleeping alone next time. Bye.

624
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,772
-Good night, guys.
-This does weigh on me.

625
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,508
Shall I go in, then?

626
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,642
ENTERS HIS SWEET HOME

627
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,712
ALL ALONE WITHOUT HIS CASTMATES

628
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,048
-Night, guys.
-Good night.

629
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,219
WOO-YOUNG SPENDS THE NIGHT
ALONE IN THE TENT

630
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,860
WHILE THE OTHERS SLEEP
IN THE SUITE

631
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,096
-Night, Jin-kyung.
-Good night.

632
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,267
Poor Woo-young.
He must be freezing out there.

633
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,136
LOL

634
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,037
Oh, dang.

635
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,339
I completely forgot about Woo-young.

636
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,445
DON'T WORRY, HE'S SLEEPING
LIKE A BABY

637
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,748
NIGHT WATCH DUTY

638
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,784
THE NIGHT OF THE BESTIES TRIP
WORE ON…

639
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,493
THE SUN HAS COME UP
FOR DAY 2 OF THE BESTIES TRIP

640
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,228
STILL FAST ASLEEP

641
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,800
THIS GUY MINDS HIS CIRCULATION
EVEN WHEN HE'S ASLEEP

642
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,372
WHERE ARE SOOK AND JIN-KYUNG?

643
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,541
MISSION TIME - 8 A.M.
CURRENT TIME - 6:30 A.M.

644
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,244
RUMMAGE

645
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,680
SHE SETS UP HER CAMERA

646
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,150
It isn't against the rule
to leave before the alarm rings, is it?

647
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,651
-It can't be.
-It's not.

648
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,321
WE WEREN'T SURE
WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THIS…

649
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,057
I've set up an alarm for 7 a.m.

650
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,059
IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS
DETERMINED TO GET UP EARLY

651
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,694
This is better than getting soaked.

652
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,530
THE EARLY BIRD AVOIDS
GETTING DUNKED

653
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,666
I hope Woo-young slept all right.

654
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,635
CONCERNED

655
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,505
STILL IN DREAMLAND

656
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,140
THESE TWO ARE ALSO
SLEEPING LIKE A LOG

657
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,510
SPRINGS UP

658
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,715
GOES STRAIGHT
TO SOOK AND JIN-KYUNG'S ROOM

659
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,152
Hey.

660
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,088
Why did you get up so early?

661
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,789
I wanted to use the bathroom.

662
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,760
Hey, Sae-ho.

663
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:34,032
-Don't tell Woo-jae we're already up.
-Okay.

664
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,370
HE HAS INDEED COLLAPSED
AFTER MESSING AROUND SO MUCH

665
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,505
I'll head for the beach

666
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,374
before these two come running after us.

667
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,209
Look at Sae-ho.

668
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,411
He's putting on his socks.

669
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,480
Why is he doing that?

670
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,282
Why did he put on his socks?

671
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,449
Sook.

672
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,984
I haven't put on my shoes yet.

673
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,921
This is crazy. Where is Sook?

674
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,989
SHE'S IN A HURRY
AND SOOK IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

675
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,724
PUTTING ON HER SHOES FIRST

676
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,459
-Jin-kyung.
-Hurry over here.

677
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,995
Sae-ho was putting on his socks…

678
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,031
Gosh, he's here. You're so annoying.

679
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,866
Why did you all get up so early?

680
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,636
We have to catch that.
Guys, let's get on that elevator.

681
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,806
-Come on. Hurry.
-First floor.

682
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,174
Forgive me if I end up running.

683
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,809
You can't be serious.

684
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:21,246
-Don't do that.
-Come on, it's not 7 a.m. yet.

685
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,782
-Goodness.
-You didn't have to get up so early.

686
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,884
I thought we could only leave
after the alarm.

687
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,086
No, Director Park said it was okay.

688
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,087
SCURRYING AWAY

689
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,221
Hey, Sae-ho.

690
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,258
Why don't we just get there together?

691
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,860
Let's pick up the pace, though.
Woo-jae might come running.

692
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,997
I'm determined to see him
dive into the water this morning.

693
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,666
HER WISH MAY COME TRUE YET

694
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,069
But I'm still so on edge.

695
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,737
What if Woo-jae rushes over?

696
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,106
MAKES A RUN FOR IT

697
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,809
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE
TO WATCH OUT FOR

698
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,177
Hey, you!

699
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,045
Don't do this.

700
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,380
Seriously, let's not go this far.

701
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,215
Let's settle it with Rock-Paper-Scissors.

702
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,685
Why would I, though?
I'm the one who woke up earliest.

703
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,189
All right, then.
Let's do Rock-Paper-Scissors.

704
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,457
ANXIOUS

705
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,461
-I can't help but look behind us.
-Woo-jae might've gotten in a taxi.

706
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,395
He has that in him.

707
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,965
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT OUR COMATOSE GUY

708
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,236
HE STIRS,
FEELING ODDLY REFRESHED

709
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,605
GLANCES

710
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,409
WHERE IS SAE-HO?

711
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,745
HAS HE GONE TO THE BATHROOM?

712
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,116
IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS QUIET HERE

713
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,053
Man, these guys are really something.

714
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,388
RUSHING BACK IN

715
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,656
I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE

716
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,391
HIS CASTMATES ARE GONE!

717
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,659
THROWS ON HIS JACKET AND LEAVES

718
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,461
WHEN DID THEY HEAD OUT?

719
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,830
SPRINTING

720
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,432
What is it?

721
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,100
What if he gets here on a bicycle?

722
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,569
-I can see a rider moving at full speed.
-I'm terrified.

723
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,371
STOP RIGHT THERE

724
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,507
We don't have a moment to lose.

725
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,841
Oh, my heart!

726
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,446
My gosh. I was so startled.

727
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,014
IT'S JUST A GUY ON HIS BICYCLE

728
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,683
I wouldn't put it past him to ride a bike.

729
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,984
I was so startled.

730
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,654
This is it, Sook.
We've reached our destination.

731
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,524
-Let's do Rock-Paper-Scissors here.
-No fighting over the results, okay?

732
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,260
-You snooze, you lose.
-You snooze, you lose.

733
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,661
SOOK GETS FIRST PLACE

734
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,063
Rocks-Paper-Scissors… Shoot!

735
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,297
JIN-KYUNG SECURES SECOND PLACE

736
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,566
I'm the runner-up, and Sook is the winner.

737
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,335
No matter how quickly he gets here,
he'll be in fourth place.

738
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:26,638
My gosh!

739
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,739
My gosh!

740
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,074
What the heck?

741
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,275
My gosh!

742
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,477
What the heck? Oh, my heart.

743
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,479
I thought that was Woo-jae.

744
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,148
Did he have to rush over at full speed?

745
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,085
-Let's walk on the sand.
-Let's do that.

746
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,720
-Here we are.
-Okay.

747
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,222
Someone's filming us.

748
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,293
Oh, it's the AD who let it slip
about the hotel yesterday.

749
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,961
We wondered who could be filming us.

750
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,330
Good morning.

751
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,100
My heart just did a backflip.

752
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,035
Why are you up so early?

753
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,037
-What's that?
-Why did you come out so early?

754
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,505
Do you even have to ask?

755
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,574
Jeez.

756
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,345
Look, the camera crew is running over.

757
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,148
-Sorry for giving you trouble.
-We have a camera of our own.

758
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,516
I'm really sorry about this.

759
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,851
Look at their faces, Jin-kyung.

760
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,419
-They're not in a good mood.
-They're not.

761
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,087
Especially my look-alike.

762
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,457
When was the crew planning to get up?

763
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,926
-We were told to get here by 7:30 a.m.
-Oh, I see.

764
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:25,029
So you're here about 30 minutes early.

765
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:29,000
We were supposed to find crew members
holding a flag, but we came ahead of them.

766
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,735
-That's right.
-Someone's running over here.

767
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:31,636
Who is it?

768
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,005
-That's Woo-jae, isn't it?
-It's him.

769
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,140
Woo-jae is running.

770
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,241
HUFFING AND PUFFING

771
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,945
WHERE DO I COME IN?

772
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,214
Woo-young's not here yet!

773
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,217
-What is he saying?
-I think he's swearing.

774
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,187
We thought you weren't joining us,
but here you are, Woo-jae.

775
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,855
RUNNING FOR NO REASON
AMIDST THE LAUGHTER

776
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,123
I like the look of him running.

777
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,792
A RARE SIGHT OF WOO-JAE
LOOKING OUT OF IT

778
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,261
ALL CRACKING UP

779
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:59,063
-Look at his shoes.
-He didn't even put them on.

780
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,431
Oh, dear.

781
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,200
He must've been really in a hurry.

782
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,435
I thought… the alarm had to go…

783
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,171
for us to leave.

784
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,372
That's not the case.

785
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,873
I would've come down here at 3 a.m.

786
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,176
I was up until then.

787
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,545
-Oh, my abs hurt.
-I did consider

788
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,580
hiding your shoes at one point.

789
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,782
-That's diabolical.
-He's a smart cookie.

790
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,952
Don't compliment him.
It only shows how terrifying he can be.

791
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:21,986
Still, that's clever.

792
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,289
HIS MIND WORKS
ON A DIFFERENT PLANE

793
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,090
There comes Director Park.

794
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,426
EXHAUSTED FROM RUNNING

795
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,894
Director Park.

796
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,430
Your answer to my question last night
still stands, right?

797
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,532
-You said it wasn't against the rules.
-Right.

798
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,433
Okay.

799
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,968
These ladies are something.

800
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,636
I could say the same about Woo-young.

801
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,972
If I had slept outdoors,
I'd be here before any of us.

802
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,774
DANG, THAT SLIPPED MY MIND!

803
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,476
WOO-YOUNG IS INCREDIBLE
IN HIS OWN WAY

804
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,846
We did Rock-Paper-Scissors
to sort out the order.

805
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,380
Sook got here first,

806
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,049
followed by Jin-kyung.

807
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,251
I'm in third place,
and Woo-jae is in fourth place.

808
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,853
That leaves Woo-young in fifth place.

809
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,588
The order is all set anyway,

810
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,257
so let me treat all of you
to some warm instant noodles.

811
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,526
What if Woo-young arrives
while you are away?

812
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,961
-It's all over.
-We had it filmed.

813
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,164
You're free to head out before the alarm,

814
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,200
but you have to wait here
once you've arrived.

815
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,035
If Woo-young gets here
while we're away,

816
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,438
-our ranks fall after his?
-That's it.

817
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,672
Then you've been beaten.

818
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,308
-We're going nowhere, then.
-We can't leave.

819
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,977
We're staying put.

820
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,045
We're not taking
one step away from the beach.

821
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,580
You're all so competitive.

822
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,550
-You bet we are.
-We woke up at 6 a.m. for this.

823
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,185
I've never seen anyone go this far.

824
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,888
-This is a first for me, too.
-I mean…

825
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,189
Aren't you hungry?

826
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,458
-Go grab a bite.
-No, I'm good.

827
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,060
Why don't we select a pair

828
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,096
to go get some coffee
or snacks at least?

829
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,430
See? There he goes again.

830
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,466
-I'll stay here in case Woo-young arrives.
-We're good.

831
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,334
Why don't you go get them?
You're fourth anyway.

832
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,638
Why don't we all go together?
Do you have something to tie our ankles?

833
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,373
Something you'd use
for a three-legged race.

834
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,774
Does anyone have some cords?

835
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,311
-Tying our ankles would ease our minds.
-She's right.

836
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,781
How is it that none of us
are willing to trust others?

837
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,783
Way to go, people.

838
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,619
Can't one of us
just run over to the shops?

839
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,121
Do we have to go this far?

840
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,856
The distrust among us…

841
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,258
What sort of besties
do this on a trip together?

842
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,626
Okay, let's go.

843
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,495
-Ready, go.
-Ready, go.

844
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,562
-One, two.
-One, two.

845
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,232
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS?

846
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,467
-Seriously, though.
-Over to that convenience store.

847
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,736
THEIR FEET SINK INTO THE SANDS

848
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,272
-One, two.
-Why don't I order delivery?

849
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,675
-One, two.
-This is so uncomfortable for me.

850
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,577
-Jeez, I'm so sick of this.
-Let's think over this trip.

851
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:30,048
We had to go all over Busan
in weird costumes like Chucky and whatnot,

852
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,316
and now we're doing this.

853
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,350
-One, two.
-One, two.

854
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,486
Be careful of the stairs. Ready, go.

855
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,489
FACED WITH THE TRIAL OF STAIRS

856
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,191
-One, two.
-One, two.

857
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,259
Here we go again.

858
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,294
NARROW DOORWAY

859
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,462
HOW TIRESOME…

860
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,197
-I'm so tired.
-What are we even doing?

861
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,333
-One, two.
-Okay, we're back.

862
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,368
-We'll untie these. I'm worn out.
-Finally.

863
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,036
REMOVING THE BINDS

864
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,206
-Let's hide behind that boat.
-That's a good idea.

865
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,743
-Would he be able to see us on the way?
-If you ask me, he'll stay clueless.

866
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,550
THE SUN IS HIGH IN THE SKY

867
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,886
IT'S ALMOST 8 A.M.,
THE PROMISED TIME

868
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,091
WAKE UP, SOLDIER

869
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,664
WHAT IS THIS?

870
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,669
GOOD MORNING!
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR MISSION

871
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:29,040
OF COURSE,
THE ONLY COMPETITOR IS YOU

872
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,977
WELL-RESTED

873
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,646
Should I wait for the others?

874
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,383
It may take a while
to get down from the 26th floor.

875
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,984
Let's all stand against this tent.

876
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,921
PASSING THE HOTEL BY

877
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,157
I'll get there first, right?

878
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,326
The weather is so fine today.

879
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,695
It's perfect for jumping into the water.

880
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,199
Isn't it nice jogging together
in the morning?

881
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,001
It's great.

882
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,536
IN HIS PERSPECTIVE,
HE'S IN THE LEAD

883
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:05,176
I personally think that
Jin-kyung will be going into the water.

884
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,545
I can picture it vividly.

885
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,149
Am I getting there this easily?

886
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,885
But then again, it can take a while
to come down all those floors.

887
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,154
Is he on his way?

888
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,455
WOO-YOUNG

889
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,724
-Let us know when he passes.
-We have to move out of sight.

890
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,691
What on earth?

891
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,929
Why is Sae-ho's manager here?

892
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,232
Maybe the managers got here ahead of us.

893
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,569
HE CAN ONLY SEE
THE CREW MEMBERS ON THE BEACH

894
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,072
There we go. This is how it should be.

895
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,573
I'm the uncontested winner.

896
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,242
I'm claiming the first place.

897
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,312
Hi, guys. Good morning.

898
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,449
He's so adorable.

899
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,752
I've been busy working on my new album,

900
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,822
so I've mostly stayed indoors.

901
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,124
You could even say
I was isolated from the world.

902
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,460
I think this trip will help me
produce great songs.

903
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,128
It's been a huge inspiration for me.

904
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,763
Frankly, I slept like a log last night.

905
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,331
YEAH, WE CAN SEE THAT

906
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,333
Thank you for all the hand warmers.

907
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,735
I also appreciated
the crew members standing guard.

908
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,870
I had a good night's sleep.

909
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,007
I'm in first place, right?

910
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,343
AND YET…

911
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,512
What's taking them so long?

912
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,181
It's about time they arrived.

913
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,383
The hotel elevators worked fine.

914
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,618
WHAT'S TAKING THEM…

915
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,688
-Someone's asking to speak to you.
-Who is it?

916
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,056
It's Sae-ho.

917
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,758
He should be running over here,
not calling you guys.

918
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,461
Hey, Sae-ho.

919
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,730
Hello? Where are you?

920
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,798
Get over here!

921
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,366
No one's in the suite.

922
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,268
Get here quickly!

923
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,270
-You're dead last.
-Where are you?

924
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,672
Come on, just get over here.

925
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,941
Jeez. What should I do?

926
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,444
They updated the rules.
The last to arrive is going in the water.

927
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,512
Really?

928
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,546
You bet!

929
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,982
The last to arrive is going in the water?

930
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,316
Yeah.

931
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,285
-How come the penalty…
-There we have it.

932
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,586
Are you sure?

933
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,687
Of course.

934
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,890
Run over here, okay?

935
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,025
I doubt running will help now.

936
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,127
I doubt running will help now.

937
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,829
I can't believe you people.

938
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,198
-Where are you, Woo-young?
-You're last place.

939
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,566
DID YOU REST WELL?

940
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,871
-So the last to arrive gets the penalty?
-That person goes in the water?

941
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,107
-What do you mean?
-We got here before 7 a.m.

942
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,508
-Hey, Woo-young--
-Dang it.

943
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,744
-Why didn't you wait for the alarm?
-That's not how it works.

944
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,548
You should've waited for the alarm!
You guys told me to play it fair.

945
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,450
-But we went over that rule last night.
-That's what I thought too.

946
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,552
I'm in fourth place.

947
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,387
Apparently, we had the wrong idea.

948
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,256
Don't grumble and take off your clothes.
You said so yourself.

949
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,692
They updated the rules.
The last to arrive is going in the water.

950
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,093
Damn it!

951
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,762
This is preposterous!

952
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,932
IT'S STILL A LITTLE TOO EARLY
TO HIT THE WATER IN MARCH

953
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,035
THE COIN TOSS WILL DECIDE
WHO DIVES INTO THE WATER

954
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,503
-Sook's first.
-Am I in last place?

955
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,637
-Yes.
-Who's second?

956
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,139
Jin-kyung. She won at Rock-Paper-Scissors.

957
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,841
-Next are Sae-ho, me, and you.
-You're in last place.

958
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,978
Make your choice. You can volunteer
or go in after the coin toss.

959
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,146
The latter, of course.

960
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,647
Just volunteer and be the hero.

961
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,682
How is it heroic?

962
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,117
-Wait, Woo-young.
-I know this isn't how my fate ends.

963
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,653
Does anyone want to volunteer?

964
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,322
Why would anyone do that?

965
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,256
In Woo-young's place?

966
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,492
-What do you mean, in my place?
-Does anyone want to take his place?

967
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,062
Why do we have to toss the coin?
Isn't it unnecessary?

968
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,331
-What do you mean? It's necessary.
-Are we doing it?

969
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,099
You said the last to arrive
gets the penalty.

970
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,067
Stop it.

971
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,568
That was me coming up with nonsense.

972
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,971
-That never reflected the crew's decision.
-Exactly.

973
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,339
PLEASE LET ME AVOID DIVING

974
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,607
So that's how you're playing it?

975
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,976
-So, heads or tails?
-You get the penalty with heads.

976
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,777
Okay, the person
who gets it should jump in.

977
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,748
You seem ready to head straight
to Busan Station, Jin-kyung.

978
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,184
-We've booked our tickets.
-Our train leaves in an hour.

979
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,953
But one of you
will have to return to the hotel

980
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,256
-for a shower.
-That's true.

981
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,358
I thought we were all leaving at noon.

982
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,859
-No.
-Did you exchange your tickets?

983
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,127
Your train leaves at noon?

984
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,364
-That's great.
-Why don't you jump in?

985
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,699
Okay, give me the coin.

986
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,268
You only get one shot.

987
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,704
-Heads mean the penalty.
-Come to the center.

988
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,375
THE COIN WILL DECIDE
WHO GETS THE DREADED PENALTY

989
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,909
Let's pray, Woo-jae.

990
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,244
PLEASE DON'T LET THE DIVER BE ME

991
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,047
Come on, I can't get the penalty now.

992
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,316
IT'D BE TOO CRUEL IF I GOT IT
ON TOP OF CAMPING OUTSIDE

993
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,721
HE HAD TO BEAR THE MOCKERY AND
RIDICULE ALONE FROM LAST NIGHT

994
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,158
You should've waited for the alarm!
You guys told me to play it fair.

995
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,793
This isn't fair.

996
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,764
PLEASE…

997
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,802
TAILS

998
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,638
-Clasp your hands.
-This can't be.

999
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,407
-Show us the results.
-Hold them steady.

1000
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,475
-This can't be it.
-Show us first.

1001
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,514
Okay.

1002
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,484
I can't be made to go in.
I did more than my share last night.

1003
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,454
What's more,
I know Busan would never betray me.

1004
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,556
-All the years I spent here…
-Hey, Woo-jae.

1005
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,792
-Oh!
-Come back here.

1006
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,094
HOORAY, I GOT TAILS!

1007
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,663
IS THE WATER COLD?

1008
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,865
Play tricks all you want,

1009
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,934
but Busan always has my back.

1010
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,604
HE SEXILY AVOIDS DOOM

1011
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,606
You're one lucky guy, Woo-young.

1012
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,875
ALL RIGHT!

1013
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,245
Now I'm getting antsy. There were times
when the last in order got the penalty.

1014
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,516
THE TURN OF EVENTS GAVE
THE NEXT ONE A LOT TO WORRY OVER

1015
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,154
HE PREPARED A PROPER COSTUME
FOR A CHANGE

1016
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,956
AND EVEN WON
THE ARM WRESTLING CHALLENGE

1017
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,524
Off I go.

1018
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,327
-Man, Woo-young…
-How is he so lucky?

1019
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,695
-He did it.
-There we go.

1020
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,763
Show us the result.

1021
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,501
The real ordeal won't be the water itself
but getting back to the hotel after.

1022
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,773
WHAT IS WOO-JAE'S FATE?

1023
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,778
-He must not be it.
-Show us.

1024
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,246
-Let us see it.
-Show us.

1025
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,314
I don't think it's him.

1026
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,249
Three, two, one.

1027
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,951
TAILS

1028
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,819
-Goodness.
-Dang it.

1029
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,921
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

1030
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,827
CRAZED FRENZY

1031
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,632
THE THREAT OF THE PENALTY
LOOMS OVER THE EARLY RISERS

1032
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,801
-We're going to Seoul!
-Woo-young!

1033
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,470
Who's next?

1034
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,872
-Why are you taking it off?
-Go ahead!

1035
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,507
-I should--
-Watch out for your mic.

1036
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,943
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Chills are running down my spine.

1037
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,346
PLEASE LET HIM GET THE PENALTY

1038
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,649
HE TEASED WOO-YOUNG NONSTOP
SINCE LAST NIGHT

1039
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,751
RACKING UP BAD KARMA

1040
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,787
-Off I go.
-Good work so far.

1041
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,522
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY BUILD
MORE BAD KARMA

1042
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,858
THE NEXT IN LINE

1043
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,394
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT

1044
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,630
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THE TRIO?

1045
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,064
Take it for the team, Sae-ho.

1046
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,400
PLEASE LET IT SHOW TAILS

1047
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,768
I'm begging here.

1048
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,003
Come here, Sae-ho.

1049
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,474
It can't be him. He's made
a lot of sacrifices for the team.

1050
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,976
-Nice and slow.
-Hey.

1051
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,681
HEADS

1052
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,184
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

1053
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,919
You're one lucky guy.

1054
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:55,920
I'M LUCKY?

1055
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,489
LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO
INTO THE WATER

1056
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,625
Sook, I kept thinking
that he's become such an annoying tease.

1057
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,527
When he appeared holding his phone,

1058
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,064
I thought I was watching a scene
from Nameless Gangster: Rule of the Time.

1059
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,466
-Let's turn.
-We're safe, Jin-kyung!

1060
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,534
WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND

1061
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,638
THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD

1062
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,541
LESSON HAS BEEN TAUGHT

1063
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,811
SHE CAN FINALLY APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF BUSAN'S BEACH

1064
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,513
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-Get the 12 o'clock train.

1065
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,248
-Get another ticket.
-What time is it?

1066
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,649
He can take my ticket.

1067
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,818
-You can take Woo-young's ticket.
-Take mine instead.

1068
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,654
I can't believe you guys left without me.
Seriously, how could you?

1069
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,823
-Where were you? Behind the tent?
-Yeah, we hid there.

1070
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,358
You're driving me mad here.

1071
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,961
I almost feel faint. My gosh.

1072
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,496
You have to fully submerge yourself.

1073
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,763
All right.

1074
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,032
He looks so worried.

1075
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,301
It's still scary for the veteran
of Two Days and One Night.

1076
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,003
Even the sand is icy cold.

1077
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,739
When the episode goes live,
the viewers might think it's balmy.

1078
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:49,807
But it's still chilly.

1079
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,575
-It's March now.
-Take your T-shirt off.

1080
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,111
-You want me to take it off?
-What, did I go too far?

1081
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,813
You'll only feel colder when you come out.

1082
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,548
Take your pants off too.

1083
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,816
AND OFFEND THE VIEWERS?

1084
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,818
Let me make a quick suggestion.

1085
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,186
No thanks.

1086
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,088
Let's hear him out at least.

1087
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,757
Yeah, let's. Back when Woo-young was ill,

1088
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,626
-Sae-ho slept outside in his place.
-Right.

1089
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,127
I did help him out then.

1090
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,997
-Oh, that's true.
-If Sae-ho had seemed unprepared,

1091
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,665
-I would've taken his place.
-He's unzipping!

1092
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,600
I do remember that.

1093
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,102
Woo-young is taking his jacket off.

1094
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:19,937
It's fine.

1095
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,506
-If you think about it…
-Oh, my.

1096
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,174
We went through a lot together.

1097
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,343
-Do you mean it?
-How's this? Isn't it cute?

1098
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,946
-That's better.
-What's the brand?

1099
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,381
I dig this color.

1100
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,116
Let's roll!

1101
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,752
-Good luck, Sae-ho!
-You've got this!

1102
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,321
THIS PERFORMANCE WILL
BRING SCREWBALLS GOOD ENERGY

1103
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,157
CRIES OUT

1104
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,161
-I'd hate to be in his shoes.
-You can do it!

1105
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,697
I'd hate it so much.

1106
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,898
HERE HE GOES!

1107
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:55,839
THE FIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
RETURNED FROM HELL

1108
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,907
…to be the president.

1109
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,075
LOL

1110
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,578
FUELING RUMORS
AND RUNNING EACH OTHER DOWN

1111
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,279
TURNED ALL OF US INTO A MESS

1112
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,848
AT TIMES, WE COLLAPSED
FROM FATIGUE

1113
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,684
OR HAD TO SACRIFICE OURSELVES
FOR LAUGHS

1114
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,620
HERE WE STAND TOGETHER
AFTER THE STORM

1115
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,288
WITH BIG SMILES ON OUR FACES

1116
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,024
-You can do it!
-I'd hate it so much.

1117
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,294
AS A THANK-YOU FOR WAITING
FOR US, WE PROMISE TO SHOW YOU…

1118
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,198
US GOING ALL IN
WITH ALL OUR HEART,

1119
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,100
THOUGH IT MAY SOMETIMES
SEEM CHEESY

1120
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,134
Screwballs!

1121
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:31,909
OUR SECOND CHANCE TOGETHER
MAKES EVERY SECOND MORE PRECIOUS

1122
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,245
HE'S SO DRAMATIC

1123
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,450
SAE-HO WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO TOOK THE PLUNGE

1124
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,051
Seeing you dive in was so refreshing.

1125
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,186
BUT WE'LL ALL CHERISH THE MEMORY

1126
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,153
You looked amazing.

1127
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,029
Are you here for an awards ceremony?

1128
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,500
JUST LIKE BUSAN'S VAST SEAFRONT,

1129
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,204
OUR FUTURE TOO MUST HOLD
GREAT POSSIBILITIES

1130
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,341
WE PROMISE YOU
MORE BUBBLING LAUGHTER

1131
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,310
-Let's leave now.
-Great work, everyone!

1132
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,678
Thank you!

1133
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,581

You have been invited to the gods' party
named "Along with the Gods."

1135
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,088
-I'm the Ice God.
-I'm the Hungry God.

1136
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,123
I'm capsaicin

1137
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,557
THE RAGTAG WANNABE GODS

1138
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,695
ARE GRACED BY A REAL GOD

1139
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,730
THE HANDSOMEST IDOL
HANDPICKED BY IDOLS

1140
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,865
-Who could it be?
-It's Jin.

1141
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:28,832
It's Jin!

1142
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:29,800
Hey, Jin!

1143
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,001
Tone it down, will you?

1144
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,137
The first-ever guest to our show.

1145
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,805
Hi, I'm Jin from BTS.

1146
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,040
Your show's the hottest.

1147
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,508
-Yes!
-Let me hear you scream!

1148
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,777
THIS TRUE GOD IS GENEROUS

1149
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,778
I love you.

1150
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:43,914
I love you.

1151
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,649
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

1152
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,419
-Join us again when you have free time.
-I rarely have free time.

1153
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,520
GUARANTEED TO MAKE YOU LAUGH

1154
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:52,756
You have a grand place.
If you sold it, I'd join you as a regular.

1155
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,093
Jin doesn't have a filter, does he?

1156
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,062
He's got skills.

1157
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,397
Only Gods are allowed in here,

1158
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,532
but one human snuck in.

1159
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,934
We have such an impudent mortal among us?

1160
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,269
Could it be you, Jin?

1161
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,538
IDENTIFY THE HUMAN
CRASHING THE PARTY OF GODS

1162
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,273
-You seem most suspicious.
-It's not me.

1163
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,443
GODS' RULE NO.1
TRUST NO ONE

1164
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,578
You think I'm a human?
I'm way beneath one.

1165
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,713
You have a long way to go.

1166
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,915
NO DECENT PERSON
CAN BE THIS RUDE

1167
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,318
GODS' RULE NO.2
GIVE AS GOOD AS YOU GET

1168
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,686
So you don't trust me, do you?

1169
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,021
I swear I'm not human!

1170
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,423
GODS' RULE NO.3 - HAVE A KNACK
FOR SHOWBIZ AND BE CUTE?

1171
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,125
It's not me. I mean it.

1172
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,394
WHO IS THE HUMAN WHO SNUCK INTO
THE PARTY FOR GODS?
