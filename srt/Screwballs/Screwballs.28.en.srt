Poof! Pororong at your service.

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,839
Yes, I love it

17
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,274
I love to play

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,244
Hey, I may as well play every day

MONSTER BALL

00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,017
It's nice to meet you.

23
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,485
Can you introduce yourself?

24
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,287
I'm going to catch you, pokémon!

25
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,990
I'm Ash, the pokémon master.

26
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,260
I'm the world's hottest pokémon master…

27
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,228
Well, at least that's my goal.

28
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,230
Next contestant, please come in.

29
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,765
I'm not selling my house!

30
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,367
I simply can't do that.

31
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,668
Get in here, Koffing!

32
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,337
Memories of my beloved wife
are in every corner of this house!

33
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,106
Let's greet him.
Could you tell us who you are?

34
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,174
Hello.

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,443
I'm the gramps from Up.

36
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,111
It's a pleasure.

37
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,979
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

38
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,650
I heard that your team
needed a space for the shoot.

39
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,385
So I prepared this place.

40
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,353
-I'm--
-Who are you here for?

41
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,423
-I used to be a beast.
-I see.

42
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,125
Oh, as in the "beast idol."

43
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,493
No, that's not it.

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,694
Did you really mean beast?

45
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,596
-I used to be under a spell.
-Oh, that beast!

46
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,399
The enchantment was lifted
a few days ago--

47
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,000
Hello.

48
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,470
-Hi.
-What on earth…

49
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,871
-Good morning.
-Hey, Candelabra.

50
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,906
-I'll shine a light on your hearts.
-Candelabra…

51
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,408
Life is hectic these days, isn't it?

52
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,443
-Unbelievable.
-But the spell was lifted!

53
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,345
What a way to show she's lost her flame.

54
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,181
-A bright light for your dark days.
-But the spell was lifted!

55
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,749
-I'm at your service.
-Isn't she your aide?

56
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,818
-The enchantment was lifted.
-Excuse me?

57
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,054
-Hold on.
-You two are on the same side, right?

58
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,455
"CANDELABRA…"
"MY PRINCE…"

59
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,724
NOW THAT THEY'RE REUNITED…

60
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,593
I don't remember
my candelabra being so tall.

61
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,861
Lumière used to be this tall.

62
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:12,365
I wish to be a spark of bright light
whenever darkness casts over your hearts.

63
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,334
I can't believe her. A candelabra?

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,535
Oh, dang.

65
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,339
Can I share a little tale
about Jin-kyung in our intro?

66
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,840
I meant what happened yesterday.

67
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,142
Oh, please do.

68
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,477
-If you do, I'm going home.
-Spill it.

69
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,847
-It's just--
-I've only begun breathing freely.

70
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,149
It's…

71
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,351
I've barely gotten out of the rough patch.

72
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,220
A friend of mine gave me a call.

73
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,755
He said he had some questions

74
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,158
in the field Jin-kyung knows well.

75
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,760
He asked if she wouldn't mind
his reaching out to her.

76
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,029
So I promised to check it with her

77
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,732
and give her his contact info
and vice versa.

78
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,068
Then, I went to our group chat
to ask Jin-kyung how she'd feel about it.

79
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,072
I wrote, "One of our recent guests,
Young K, has a few questions for you."

80
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,841
"Could I give him your number?"

81
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,143
I told him yes without hesitation.

82
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,311
I gave him the go-ahead.

83
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,579
-"Okay."
-And she did.

84
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,481
-I was ready to help.
-She added the smiley emoji.

85
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,116
What have I done wrong so far?

86
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,717
None. So that's that.

87
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,619
-End of discussion.
-After that…

88
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
-We're done.
-Here's the thing.

89
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,323
-You were open to helping…
-Wait…

90
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,624
…but you didn't know Young K.

91
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,095
That was a sick burn.

92
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,463
Well done.

93
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,899
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE INCIDENT

94
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,868
YOUNG K WANTS TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
CAN I GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER?

95
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,903
JIN-KYUNG: SURE
WOO-JAE: OKAY!

96
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,640
JIN-KYUNG: BY THE WAY

97
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,609
She wrote, "What does Young K do?"

98
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,712
JIN-KYUNG: WHAT DOES YOUNG K DO?
HEH

99
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,780
"Is he a celebrity?"

100
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,615
She even added an extra question mark.

101
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,849
So I wrote,

102
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,552
"Jin-kyung, we're off-camera."

103
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,321
She then wrote, "Yeah, I get it."

104
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,022
Yes, she finally caught on then.

105
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,225
-But we should make allowances for her.
-You bet we do.

106
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,561
-As an old friend of Jin-kyung…
-Tell them.

107
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,564
…I must stress that she's worked hard
over the years at social events.

108
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,867
All the alcohol she had consumed
damaged her hippocampus.

109
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,502
-How admirable, right?
-Hey!

110
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,472
Actually, that applies to me.
My hippocampus is shot too.

111
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,641
I see our group chat in a new light.

112
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,209
Turns out it's a frightening place.

113
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,745
Just when Jin-kyung
asked about Young K's profession,

114
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,915
-messages kept piling up.
-I almost thought

115
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,251
I committed high traison.

116
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,886
Everyone got excited at her mistake.

117
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,588
-Unbelievable.
-I assumed

118
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,191
everyone was working
because no one replied.

119
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,227
But the moment Jin-kyung asked
if Young K was a celebrity,

120
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,063
everyone wrote, "LOL."

121
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,332
-How scary.
-Tell me about it.

122
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,434
The moment you slip,
the pack of hyenas lunge at you.

123
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,502
It's a jungle.

124
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,804
Can I ask you a question, Jin-kyung?

125
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,239
You just said "high traison."

126
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,276
-Yeah, what was that about?
-Can you describe what that means?

127
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,543
I committed high traison.

128
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,912
I wondered about that too.

129
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,915
"Why did she say 'high traison'
instead of 'high treason'?"

130
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,684
But I let it slip,

131
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,886
thinking she might find it too stressful.

132
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,721
Consider Seoul Station or Busan Station.

133
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,690
Train stations are national assets.

134
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,859
Attacks on major ones
can be a national security threat.

135
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,627
Yes, exactly.

136
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,396
You'll have to be on your toes today.

137
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,664
DIZZY

138
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,767
This is the second shoot
after the incident,

139
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,702
and I'm stressed out already.

140
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,606
All right, everyone.
Can you guess where we are?

141
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,741
-A kids café.
-I suppose Jin-kyung

142
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,476
and Woo-jae are familiar with it.

143
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,446
I don't see my niece that often,
so it's actually my first visit today.

144
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,316
-We don't have a reason to visit one.
-It's my first visit too.

145
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,383
Same here.

146
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,486
-What about you, Jin-kyung?
-I had many visits when La-el was young.

147
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,423
When you were young,
this kind of facility--

148
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,358
-It wasn't around.
-All we had were playgrounds.

149
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,260
Playgrounds with dirt floors.

150
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,362
When I was young,
we didn't even have regular cafés.

151
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,563
NO CAFÉS LET ALONE KID CAFÉS

152
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,698
Oh, that's true.

153
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,700
We had nothing like it.

154
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,435
Didn't you play
on market streets as a kid?

155
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,303
-You bet I did.
-Or an old-school coffee shop.

156
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,871
Honestly, cafés weren't a thing then.

157
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,342
A THOUGHT STRIKES JIN-KYUNG

158
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,410
-Can we continue sitting down?
-Excuse me?

159
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,411
Can we sit down?

160
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,313
We'll stay on our feet,
but you can sit down.

161
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,083
Yeah, feel free.

162
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,452
-You may sit down.
-Can I get a chair?

163
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,156
(SCURRYING OFF)

164
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,826
IT'S UNLIKE WOO-JAE
TO DO A FAVOR FOR JIN-KYUNG…

165
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,427
-Woo-jae's so sweet…
-It's okay…

166
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,864
-You can follow his example.
-What?

167
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,633
-Let's each bring a chair and sit down.
-Go get one yourself.

168
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,235
-There's one.
-I should've known.

169
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,636
It was unlike Woo-jae
to bring her a chair.

170
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,704
BEST PERSONALITY EVER

171
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,339
There you go. Take that with you.

172
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,174
Well done. That's it.

173
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,642
-Woo-jae hasn't changed a bit.
-Good.

174
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,978
With how things look,
we should have Sook sit down first.

175
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,514
I'll get you a chair.

176
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,815
-I get to sit?
-Found it.

177
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,117
-Here's one, Jin-kyung.
-Take this.

178
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,418
Thanks.

179
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,086
There you go.

180
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,154
SITTING DOWN AT LAST!

181
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,422
-It looks uncomfortable.
-Do we all sit?

182
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,490
Let's sit.

183
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,392
I want to show my commitment
by staying on my feet.

184
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,260
Oh, as for me…

185
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,461
Wait.

186
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,730
To show my commitment,
I'll sit on the invisible chair.

187
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,265
INVISIBLE CHAIR

188
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,335
I mean, we don't have the time
to bother with sitting down.

189
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
FOR COMMITTING HIGH "TRAISON"

190
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,606
I want to be able to
meet the viewers' eyes.

191
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,907
Me too.

192
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,008
Perfect eye level.

193
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,043
Let's circle back.
What did you do for fun as a kid?

194
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,111
Horseback riding?

195
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,013
Back then,
vendors used to bring toy ponies.

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,214
-Ponies…
-The vendors traveled.

197
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,316
They would bring a cart with five ponies.

198
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,485
Also, puffed rice vendors
brought excitement.

199
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,220
-You know how they say "Puff!", right?
-Sure.

200
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,288
I loved watching them.

201
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,557
We also had a blast
running after fumigation trucks.

202
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,426
-Oh, the trampoline!
-Whenever a vendor brought it…

203
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,694
(SOMETHING WENT DOWN THE WRONG PIPE)

204
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,364
I suppose I was in the sixth grade

205
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,698
when I nagged…

206
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,766
COUGH, COUGH

207
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,601
A COUGHING FIT

208
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,204
MR. PAPER DOLL HAS GONE WEAK…

209
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,272
…at my parents to…

210
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,140
-You need this more than Sook.
-Take it.

211
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm good.

212
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,210
I'm fine, really.

213
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,311
I pestered them…

214
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,079
This actually suits you.

215
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,781
It goes well with you.

216
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,250
-Goodness.
-I got a Game Boy.

217
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,718
HE'S WORN OUT IN JUST 20 MINUTES…

218
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,786
So…

219
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,189
A SHORT REST PRESCRIBED

220
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,492
There's a reason why
we asked you to come here.

221
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,462
It would be terrific if Screwballs
were to become a long-running show.

222
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,563
-Sure.
-Of course.

223
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,265
For our show to have a long run,

224
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,434
we prepared this mission for today.

225
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,204
It is winning the hearts
of future viewers.

226
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,206
We have to win over the future viewers?

227
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,907
We'll be meeting children, then.

228
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
Hold on.

229
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,811
-It's so important.
-I bet they'll love Sae-ho.

230
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,946
Think about your outfit.

231
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,948
We're meeting the future viewers?

232
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,616
FUTURE VIEWERS = CHILDREN

233
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,384
My getup will probably scare them.

234
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,753
So we're meeting kids?

235
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,455
AN UNEXPECTED MISSION
GOT THEIR HEARTS RACING!

236
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,857
This is going to be no joke.

237
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,425
To be a long-running series,

238
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,428
we'll have to open the hearts
of the future viewers.

239
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,099
Please do your best to charm the children
who will become our future viewers.

240
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,134
-How old are they?
-Tell us their age.

241
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,504
-How old?
-You'll be meeting two groups of children.

242
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,973
The first group of children you'll meet

243
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,508
are two-year-olds.

244
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,443
How adorable.
That's when they're the cutest.

245
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,944
They're about the same age as my niece.

246
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,412
Four-year-olds are so lovely.

247
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,848
You'll soon be meeting the children.

248
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,384
Who do you think
will be popular among them?

249
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,119
-I'd say Pororo.
-For sure.

250
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,821
-I doubt…
-This guy, considering his costume.

251
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,123
…the children will recognize us.

252
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,025
-You bet they won't.
-But considering our costume.

253
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,326
Before all that,

254
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,928
kids love good-looking people.

255
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,897
-No way.
-He's dressed as their type.

256
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,532
They like prince characters.

257
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,301
Children do love attractive people.

258
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,737
BURSTS INTO TEARS

259
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,006
See? She's crying harder
at the sight of you.

260
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,741
How could you make a kid cry?

261
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,442
We have a misunderstanding here.

262
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,211
WOO-YOUNG BLAMES A MISUNDERSTANDING

263
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,314
BUT HE'S GOING TO KEEP MAKING CHILDREN CRY
REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE

264
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,382
TEARS

265
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,517
There's a high chance

266
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,620
kids will think she's a man.

267
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,356
They might think she's an old gentleman.

268
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,959
I'm being serious.
Children have no idea about costumes.

269
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,697
(THE CULPRIT BEHIND THE TEARS)

270
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,867
WAILING

271
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,237
Couldn't you have given me a heads-up
about meeting children?

272
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,339
They might actually love Jin-kyung.

273
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,074
-Her costume is cute.
-Yeah, the candelabra.

274
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,044
They might get confused
if she's a person or not.

275
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,112
Can I teach kids calculus?

276
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,014
I should film a dance challenge with them.

277
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,916
-For "Simple Dance"?
-Hey, that's a good idea.

278
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,752
My heart is thumping.
Children will be challenging customers.

279
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,556
The best teacher
who charms the young children

280
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,491
will be given an incredible gift.

281
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,793
Please look forward to it.

282
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,462
We've divided you
into two groups randomly.

283
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,030
-Each team…
-Two teams?

284
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,166
…will be one-day teachers.

285
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,268
Whoever gives the children the most joy

286
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,404
will likely earn their votes

287
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,273
-for the best teacher.
-Of course.

288
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,009
You're pairing me with Sae-ho, right?

289
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,111
-I could never beat this comedian.
-It won't be like that.

290
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,281
Why don't I lie down for a bit
while he takes care of them?

291
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,449
You might still win.

292
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,018
The key is being honest and open-hearted.

293
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,453
Here's what I want.

294
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,255
He'll take care of the kids
only to lose their votes to me.

295
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,191
-That's my best-case scenario.
-That can happen.

296
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,361
They may go, "Who's that guy?
I want to know more about him."

297
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,796
Nothing is off-limits
so long as we get the most votes, right?

298
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,864
That's it.

299
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,066
-I'll leave it to your capable hands.
-We've got this.

300
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,401
-Good luck!
-All right!

301
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,469
CAN THEY CAPTURE FUTURE VIEWERS' HEARTS?

302
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,536
SCREWBALLS

303
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,272
SAE-HO AND WOO-JAE ARE VISITING
ANOTHER KIDS CAFÉ IN A NEIGHBORING AREA

304
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,540
My gosh, this is new.

305
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,608
MR. CHO HAS ARRIVED FIRST

306
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,012
I hope I can meet

307
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,980
the children's energy level.

308
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,850
Jeong-hu, Seo-jin, A-yun,

309
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,518
I-na, and Hae-sa.

310
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,487
Hae-sa is a lovely name.

311
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,588
Cho Hae-sa.

312
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,791
-I only need to give them a good time?
-Yes.

313
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,859
With the children.

314
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,495
My past experience taught me

315
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,065
that those in childcare services
are on par with gods.

316
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,366
I once had to oversee a game.

317
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,502
When I told the kids
I would explain the rules to them,

318
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,703
they dispersed.

319
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,439
I have infinite respect
for teachers of day care centers.

320
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES

321
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,475
The thing is, I'm not all that confident

322
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,245
about my skills
in giving kids a good time.

323
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,813
I do have another concern.

324
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,115
When young kids at this age

325
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,284
are exposed to a horrific sight,

326
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,521
they tend to remember it for a long time.

327
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,323
I'm worried we might end up scarring them

328
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,892
-with awful memories.
-Oh, come on.

329
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,326
-These two uncles…
-Just play with them.

330
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,728
Yes, that's all.

331
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,831
I feel rather nervous.

332
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,700
We'll be meeting really young kids.

333
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,736
The important thing
is winning the children's votes,

334
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,171
so think about what you can offer.

335
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,906
Can we give them some money?

336
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,742
If you have money to spare,
give it to Jin-kyung and me.

337
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,677
SHOOT WAS CONDUCTED SAFELY
UNDER SUPERVISION OF STAFF

338
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,679
Everyone, let's get off the elevator.

339
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,980
-Go.
-Let's get off.

340
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,949
Here they come.

341
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,185
-Hi.
-Hello.

342
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,252
Hi.

343
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,790
7 CHILDREN OF NARAE CLASS
FROM LOVE FOREST DAY CARE CENTER

344
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,258
It's lovely to meet you.

345
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,326
Hello.

346
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,828
-Hi.
-You're all so adorable.

347
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,895
How cute.

-What's wrong?
-Look, Hae-na. Here's the Prince.

389
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,912
I'm the Prince from the cartoon.

390
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,114
-I'm the Prince.
-She's staring at Woo-young as she cries.

391
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,315
What?

392
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,383
Stay away.

393
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,218
You heard Jin-kyung. Step aside.

394
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,287
-How could you make a kid cry?
-Come to me, kids.

395
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,555
We have a misunderstanding here.

396
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,090
How could you?
She must be so scared of you.

397
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,560
See? She's crying harder
at the sight of you.

398
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,628
No, that's because of Sook.

00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,476
Do something, Jin-kyung.

407
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,544
Come on.

408
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,479
Hi, do you see the flame here?

409
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,647
My gosh. She hates it.

410
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349

412
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,985
-She hates it.
-Blow on it.

413
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,588
SHE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE'S FACED WITH A HIDEOUS MONSTER

414
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,655
She's terrified.

415
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,823
It's okay.

416
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,658
It's all right.

417
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,726
It's your eyebrows.

418
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,228
-Sorry?
-She finds your eyebrows scary.

419
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,996
Oh, my eyebrows?

420
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,165
It's fine. She's not a scary person.

421
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,867
She practically backed away from me.

422
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,370
Do these eyebrows look that menacing?

423
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,408
-Ta-da.
-What are those?

424
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,977
Come here, Ha-on. Take some crackers.

425
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,111
Do you like these?

426
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,179
PORORO?

427
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,181
-Do you like crackers, Hae-na?
-That's Loopy.

428
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,116
Hae-na loves Petty.

429
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,118
-You like Petty, Hae-na?
-Yes.

430
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,620
Why don't we look for Petty here?

431
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,988
Where is Petty?

432
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,522
I wonder where she is.

433
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,757
(A MOM WITH 14 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE)

434
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,825
Petty.

435
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,493
There she is. Look, here's Petty!

436
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,295
Look, she's got Petty!

437
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,563
Hooray!

438
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,267
CALM

439
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,102
Are you good now? Okay.

440
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,070
-Do you like Petty?
-You want some more? Ask her.

441
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,472
-I have another Petty.
-She has more.

442
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,539
One more Petty for you.

443
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,707
Can you give me a hug?

444
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,009
Say, "Thank you."

445
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,076
Thank you.

446
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,411
-Say, "Thank you."
-Thank you.

447
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,545
HER YOUNG HEART IS FINALLY OPEN

448
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,047
-Thank you.
-Well done, Hae-na.

449
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,449
I've picked up some tricks
from raising my daughter.

450
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,451
All it takes is the Pororo crackers.

451
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,687
Ask them who's your favorite,
and you're all set.

452
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,289
Who's your favorite?

453
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,356
Pororo.

454
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,724
-Pororo.
-I've got you.

455
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,792
Look, it's Pororo.

456
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,694
Is he your favorite?

457
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,762
Here you go.

458
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,196
Go ahead and thank her.

459
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,698
Have this, Yul.

460
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,766

461
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,234
-Say thank you.
-Do you like crackers?

462
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,369
-Yeah.
-Can you give me a hug?

463
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,039
My gosh, thank you.

464
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,308
Yul, I have your name tag.

465
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,978
Let me put it on right here.

466
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,079
There you go, Yul.

467
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,147
You're all set.

00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,214

THE CHILD CARE NOVICE

470
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:52,985
Who is Ho-won?

471
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,156
(I'M SEONG-JUN)

472
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,857
Are you perhaps…

473
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,925
Are you Ho-won?

474
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,163
Hi, Ho-won. Are you applying lipstick?

475
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,831
PRINCE WOO-YOUNG'S LONELY COURTSHIP

476
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,399
ABSORBED IN HER MAKEUP

477
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
HEH…

478
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,668
What's your name?

479
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,337
It's Won.

480
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,404
Won?

481
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
FINALLY, A RESPONSIVE FUTURE VIEWER!

482
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,540
-You're Won?
-Yeah.

483
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,774
Hi, Won.

484
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,842
Hi.

485
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,910
SO COOL

486
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,111
The children

487
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,080
are having a fine time on their own.

488
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,215
Do they generally not require a playmate?

489
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,283
No.

490
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,351
Really?

491
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,853
Yes, but they'll have more fun
if you chime in every now and then.

492
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,421
-Just every now and then?
-Yes.

493
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,924
AFTER A SHORT OBSERVATION

494
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,559
Oh, you're putting it there?

495
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,294
Great job.

496
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,763
Well done.

497
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,899
They don't need us to have a good time.

498
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,201
I can't help but wonder

499
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,969
if we're being of any use to them.

500
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,904
I don't think we are.

501
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,406
Shall we go on the trampoline, I-seo?

502
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,341
GRAMP'S SLOW AND CAUTIOUS APPROACH

503
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,377
Won, look at me.

504
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,178
LOL

505
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,880
Won, look at me.

506
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,982
PESKY PRINCE ON HIS WHITE HORSE

507
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,417
I'm having a blast!

508
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,120
ATTENTION HOG PRINCE

509
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,554
Hey, Won. Don't forget me!

510
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,990
I'M FORGETTING ALL ABOUT YOU

511
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,892
Won, you're hurting my feelings.

512
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,361
Still, I won't forget you.

513
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,431
A NEW CRIER

514
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,799
He's made another girl cry.

515
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,703
HA-ON DOESN'T LIKE THE LIVE-ACTION PRINCE

516
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,405
Woo-young is the least popular.

517
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,040
Everyone cries when they see him.

518
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,542
Ha-on, I'm a person.

519
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,945
I'm a person just like you.

520
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,080
Woo-young

521
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,315
made two girls cry.

522
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,784
There was a misunderstanding.

523
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,185
It's because…

524
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,187
YOUR LAME JOKES ARE THE CAUSE

525
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,190
We have an ice cream shop.

526
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,658
(I-SEO) (HAE-NA)

527
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,226
Let's check out the ice cream.

528
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,961
Do you like strawberry-flavored ice cream?

529
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,029
Strawberry.

530
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,298
Ta-da. Here's your ice cream.

531
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,534
Is it good?

532
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,835
-Yeah!
-Good.

533
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,404
What flavor would you like, I-seo?

534
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,472
(SHAKING HER HEAD)

535
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,575
Which is your favorite
between strawberry and chocolate?

536
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,110
-This.
-What?

537
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,244
This.

538
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,380
ONE OF HAE-NA'S PARENTS IS AMERICAN

539
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,648
Do you like chocolate?

540
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,715
Yeah.

541
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,553
SPEAKING HAE-NA'S LANGUAGE
BROUGHT JIN-KYUNG CLOSER TO HER

542
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,954
My gosh, Jin-kyung.

543
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,622
What did you do?

544
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,658
There's no helping it.

545
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,393
I need some tools.

546
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,997
THE ITEM TO HOG EVERYONE'S ATTENTION

547
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,800
Won!

548
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,769
Won and I-seo.

549
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,972
COULD I GET YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

550
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,074
Stop making children cry, all right?

551
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,243
WHAT ON EARTH IS HE DOING?

552
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,213
THIS TIME, HE'S USING THE TOY PLANE

553
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,581
CHUCKLES

554
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,951
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE KIDS BABYSIT HIM,
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND

555
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,919
YOU'RE TRYING

556
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,755
-He gets their attention, at least.
-Gosh, this is so fun!

557
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,691
Hey, I'm playing with this toy plane.

558
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,660
BUT THE FUTURE VIEWERS
ARE FAR FROM ENTHUSIASTIC

559
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,295
Hey, I'm playing with this toy plane.

560
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,663
Shall we go check him out?

561
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,065
Do you want to go to the Prince?

562
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,466
NOPE

563
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,734
Doesn't he look like a prince?

564
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,835
Does he look like a bum?

565
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,271
I don't want to go to the Prince.

566
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,740
You don't want to go to him? Got it.

567
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,910
HE'S HAVING FUN ON HIS OWN

568
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:07,880
Guys, look.

569
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,881
UNINTERESTED

570
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,349
No one's looking.

571
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,650
-Guys… Oops, I'm sorry.
-No one.

572
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,785
Hey, why do you keep making the kids cry?

573
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,053
Here I go, Sook.

574
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,622
Whee! It's fun for me.

575
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,958
FINALLY SPOTTED A "CHILD"
WILLING TO PLAY WITH HIM

576
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,926
Even the plane flopped.

577
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,960
OPERATION TOY PLANE FAILED

578
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,696
WOO-YOUNG NEEDS A BRAND-NEW APPROACH

579
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,866
TRYING HIS MAIN GIG
ENTER THE MIC

580
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,935
Hello, everyone.

581
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,641
IGNORES

582
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,442
Two, three.

583
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,578
-Let's sing a song.
-That might give them a bad memory.

584
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,712
Let's do it.

585
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,447
Hello, children.

586
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,984
We'll now begin
a musical performance for you.

587
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,153
-A round of applause, please.
-A round of applause.

588
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,055
-A round of applause, please.
-A round of applause.

589
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,190
CLAPPING

590
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,358
What's this about?

591
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,626
-We'll sing you a song.
-Hey, Yul.

592
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,762
We're actually singers.

593
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,630
All right. I'll dance for you.

594
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,598
Really? Great!

595
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,666
-Dance for us.
-Good idea.

596
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,801
CAN'T HAVE AN EXCITING SONG WITHOUT DANCE

597
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,069
Put your hands up!

598
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,804
HOP

599
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,573
Hold your hands above your head.

600
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,141
Looking great, Yul.

601
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,376
Won, must you keep making me feel sad?

602
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,312
-Two, three, four. Go!
-By any chance

603
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,881
By any chance

604
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,482
A BALLAD TO GO WITH CHILDREN'S DANCE?

605
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,352
If I were to go

606
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,121
YOU SPOILED IT FOR ME

607
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,357
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE

608
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,292
WHO SINGS A BALLAD
WHEN EVERYONE IS HAVING FUN

609
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,661
She insisted on singing
even if we couldn't use it.

610
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,129
WE CAN'T USE THE AUDIO
DUE TO A COPYRIGHT ISSUE

611
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,564
SINGING HER HEART OUT

612
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,834
Is such a gloomy song
suitable for young children?

613
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,036
UTTERLY UNINTERESTED

614
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,006
Hey, put your hands up!

615
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,909
LET'S LIGHTEN THINGS UP AGAIN!

616
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,946
THIS PRINCE MUST'VE DANCED IN HIS HEYDAY

617
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,781
Put your hands up

618
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,717
Let's all hold our hands up

619
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,285
As well as our feet

620
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,153
Hold up anything you can

621
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,189
(SHE'S STILL SINGING)

622
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,257
Hey!

623
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,326
SURLY

624
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,128
I was singing, okay?

625
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,063
Kids loved it.

626
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,732
They were enjoying it, Woo-young.

627
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,200
You should try harder.

628
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,068
Netflix shows have to
pay copyright fees for songs.

629
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,136
SO PLEASE STOP IT…

630
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,971
But the children loved it.

631
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,539
WHY DON'T YOU GO SING IN A COIN KARAOKE?

632
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,708
I barely got the children to smile,

633
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,410
and she got in the way.

634
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,711
SHE KEEPS SPOILING THE MOOD

635
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,781
Do you want to hop on? Here's your seat.

636
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,150
Off you go, you two.

637
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,218
Faster!

638
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,923
UP AND DOWN THEY GO,
AND THE CHILDREN'S SPIRITS SOAR

639
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,125
Are you having fun?

640
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,261
They're loving it.

641
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,329
That's enough.

642
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,730
-You've had enough?
-Yeah.

643
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,866
-He wants to get off.
-Okay. He wants a short ride.

644
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,334
Why don't we try this?

645
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,535
It looks so fun.

646
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,005
SQUASHING THEMSELVES ONTO THE SEE-SAW

647
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,573
Gosh, I never knew this could be so fun.

648
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,008
It's amazing.

649
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,511
It's so much fun.
It's far better than I imagined.

650
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,014
AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE OF JOY

651
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,482
This is so much fun.

652
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,751
-Sook, this is incredible.
-Isn't it wonderful?

653
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,753
-It's mind-blowing.
-Who'd have thought, right?

654
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,556
-What's this?
-I should buy one.

655
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,657
It's so much fun.

656
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,725
This is hilarious.

657
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,327
WHO'S THE KID NOW?

658
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,062
It was my best moment of 2025 so far.

659
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,332
I suppose you have the most fun
when you're hanging out with your peers.

660
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,600
I too love hanging out
with Jin-kyung the most.

661

662
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,105
Let's see.

663
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,540
This is a great find.

664
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,909
Why don't I take a photo for you?

665
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,777
Three, two, one.

667
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,149
-All right, then. Yul.
-Yeah?

668
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,518
Give me your best pose.

669
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,320
Three, two, one.

670
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,923
A PRANKSTER'S POSE

671
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,325
Oh, no. Give me an adorable one.

672
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,827
This is the funny one.

673
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,029
Come on. I want a cute one.

674
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,398
No. Show me your lovely face.

-Sook!
-Yeah?

678
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,906
I found another great toy.

679
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,041
You did?

680
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,743
It's really fun.

681
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:58,844
What is?

682
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,045
Also,

683
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,147
this engages your core muscles.

684
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,949
-Yeah?
-It's a decent workout tool.

685
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:05,917

The slide is so much fun.

690
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,031
It's incredible. Try it just once.

691
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,099
-I mean it.
-Just once.

692
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,701
-It will exceed your imagination.
-But Jin-kyung,

693
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,436
-we're on camera.
-Try it, Sook.

00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,695
I'm going to ask my friends
to meet me at a kids café.

710
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,198
I think it's made for me.

711
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,933
My gosh.

712
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,735
Excuse me, Jin-kyung.

713
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,803
We get it, okay?

714
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,438
It's just like when the pirate ship drops.

715
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,072
-Sure.
-The slide makes you feel that rush.

716
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,307
-You've had enough.
-Okay.

717
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,342
That was fun.

718
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,644
Why don't we try the fishing toy?

719
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,711
Jin-kyung, the kids--

720
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,480
Come on, they're having fun on their own.

721
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,515
-Let's try this.
-Go ahead.

722
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,585
You could say she's a kid too.

723
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,921
She has several wounds of sorts.

724
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,622
I must stress

725
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,990
that we have no special ties.

726
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,593
Hey, Woo-young. This is very therapeutic.

727
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,661
Sure.

728
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,763
FULLY ENGROSSED

729
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,731
At any rate, Jin-kyung has gone way down

730
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,099
to meet the children's level. Look.

731
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,602
Won.

732
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,670
See?

733
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,605
(SPEEDING PAST)

734
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,873
Can you come to me?

735
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,108
It does take time, sure.

736
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,777
But in the end, Won will come to me.

737
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,446
For sure, he'll come into my arms.

738
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,682
He does operate on his own schedule.

739
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,484
Hello, I-seo.
I-seo and I are pretty tight.

740
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,285
Hi, I-seo.

741
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,254
CLOSE ENOUGH TO EXCHANGE GREETINGS

742
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,556
This is top secret,

743
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,991
but I've managed…

744
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,827
to understand the bond
between the children here.

745
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,497
I-seo

746
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,731
likes Won.

747
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,799
I-seo

748
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,400
likes Won.

749
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,603
A ROMANCE KINDLING IN NARAE CLASS?

750
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,905
I've observed these two

751
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,609
exchanging glances many times.

752
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,712
This should be kept a secret
from the other kids.

753
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,247
Won.

754
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,314
See? He's startled.

755
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,350
He visibly jumped.

756
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,718
Where's I-seo?

757
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,087
-Won, what about me?
-Where is I-seo?

758
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,154
I-seo.

759
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,856
I love you.

760
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,126
-I…
-I want I-seo.

761
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,194
WHERE ARE YOU, I-SEO?

762
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,462
What's the matter, Won?

763
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,830
-Won.
-I-seo!

764
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:32,964
-Come here.
-You want I-seo?

765
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,266
-Yeah.
-Shall we go see her?

766
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,067
-Let's go find her.
-Won.

767
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,402
10 MINUTES AGO…

768
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,671
(I-SEO) (YUL)

769
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,507
WON HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO WATCH I-SEO SPEND TIME WITH YUL

770
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,279
-I-seo's right here.
-I-seo!

771
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,413
She's here.

772
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,915
-I-seo.
-There she is.

773
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,950
-She's right there.
-I-seo.

774
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,685
-Look, I-seo's here.
-Yeah.

775
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,986
-There she is.
-Look, it's I-seo.

776
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,321
WATCHFUL AND ENCHANTING I-SEO

777
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,157
-I-seo, can you give Won a hug?
-Hey, I-seo.

778
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,026
-Won's been asking to see you.
-Give him a hug.

779
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,562
HE'S BEEN LOOKING FOR ME?

780
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,565
I-seo.

781
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,866
-My gosh.
-I-seo.

782
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,167
I-seo.

783
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,869
I-SEO APPROACHES WON QUIETLY

784
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,504
AND HOLDS HIS HAND

785
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,739
SHE'S AN ALPHA FEMALE FOR SURE

786
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,875
(HANDS HELD TIGHTLY)

787
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,310
Something's going on between them.

788
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,945
PFFT

789
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,546
-You know what, Woo-young?
-What?

790
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,049
I haven't seen such devotion lately.

791
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,319
She was out of his sight
for only a minute,

792
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,254
and Won started bawling.

793
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,922
I've never seen such passion before.

794
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,558
He loves her truly.

795
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,294
I-seo walked up to him, all composed,

796
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,729
and led him away by his hand.

797
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,931
I-SEO CAME TO HIM AND HELD HIS HAND FIRST

798
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,167
My gosh.

799
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,502
A love like that is rare these days.

800
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,938
(LET'S STAY TOGETHER FROM NOW ON)

801
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,074
To think she made him
stop crying just like that.

802
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,742
Jin-kyung, your snot… Wait, it's not you.

803
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,177
Go and wipe Won's snot.

804
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,447
How fun!

805
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,549
Won, come here. Let me wipe your tears.

806
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,584
You poor thing.
You were so sad, weren't you?

807
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,453
-I-seo wasn't there, was she?
-No.

808
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,722
-You then missed her all of a sudden.
-Yeah.

809
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,423
-Do you like her best?
-Yeah.

810
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,791
Why do you like I-seo?

811
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,527
It's so much fun.

812
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,397
MA'AM, WE TOLD YOU THIS WAS INAPPROPRIATE

813
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,232
This is so much fun, Ha-on.

814
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,600
(HAE-NA)
(HA-ON)

815
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,403
HURRYING BACK

816
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,272
I love this.

817
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,408
Woo-young, come here. It's really amazing.

818
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,276
-Let me join you.
-It's incredible.

819
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,078
-How do I get there?
-Come on up.

820
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,813
HEIGH-HO

821
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,682
PRINCE WOO-YOUNG'S SOCKS
ARE GIVING HIM TROUBLE

822
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,717
-Woo-young, look.
-How do I climb up?

823
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,785
-You mean here?
-Yeah!

824
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,887
Take off your socks first.

825
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,156
On barefoot like this!

826
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,392
Come on up, Woo-young. This is really fun.

827
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,395
How do I get there?
Tell me how to get up.

828
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,130
-Get up here already.
-I'm really slipping.

829
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,865
-Stop messing around.
-I'm not exaggerating.

830
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,566
What's with you?

831
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,634
Give me a hand, Ho-won.

832
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,702
What's with you?

833
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,070
(HO-WON)

834
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,138
Please help.

835
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,205
LITTLE RESCUER ON THE WAY

836
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,740
Guys, please help me.

837
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,976
Hurry. Please pull me up.

838
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,045
Quickly, I-seo. Won!

839
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,446
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

840
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,981
(A TIGHT GRIP)

841
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,482
HIGH-MAINTENANCE PRINCE

842
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,550
Give me a hand!

843
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,186
MR. NUISANCE FINALLY REACHES THE TOP

844
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,855
Won, you saved my life. Up top!

845
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,190
Yeah!

846
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,060
WON HAS DONE IT AGAIN

847
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,261
Slide down on three.

848
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,163
It's much better than you might think.

849
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,065
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

850
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,468
GIGGLING

851
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,770
Hey.

852
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,905
Isn't it amazing?

853
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,972
It's so much fun.

854
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,908
-No wonder kids love it.
-I can't believe you hogged this place.

855
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,409
-I get it.
-That was mean.

856
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,711
Let us join you.

857
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:33,645
I get why they love it.

858
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,480
WOULDN'T BE STRANGE
TO JOIN DAY CARE THEMSELVES

859
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,782
I'll get there in one go this time.
Watch me closely.

860
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,784
-I'll join you in my first attempt.
-All right.

861
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,386
Can you say, "Go"?

862
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,620
-Go!
-Go!

863
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,888
-Go!
-Go!

864
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,523
HERE I COME!

865
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,260
GOOD JOB

866
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,097
Why don't the five of us
slide down together?

867
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,264
-We'll go together.
-Yeah, let's.

868
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,933
-On three, okay?
-Are you ready?

869
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,000
-You can start from there.
-I-seo.

870
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,068
Okay. Ready.

871
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,670
-All right.
-One.

872
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,572
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

873
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,574
GO

874
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,808
…three.

875
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,611
IT WAS A SHORT RIDE DOWN

876
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,912
BUT THEIR HUGE SMILES LINGER

877
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,248
Gosh, it's so much fun.

878
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,016
HOORAY

879
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,621
UNCOMFORTABLE

880
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,356
-My gosh. What's this?
-Hey.

881
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,158
Isn't it wild how fun this is?

882
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,093
-Jin-kyung.
-Check this out, Woo-young.

883
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,863
When we jump together, we can go higher.

884
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,664
THE HIGHER THEY JUMP,
THE MORE IMMATURE THEY GET

885
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,066

00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,364
Just like this.

1065
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,566
How's this red one?

1066
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,334
Okay.

1067
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,837
Here's what we'll do.
You're all dolled up. Please come along.

1068
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,573
Girls, please follow me.

1069
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,009
Now, Hae-seo. Can you sit on this pony?

1070
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,311
Why don't I take a photo of you?

1071
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,378
SHOW'S MASCOT RIDING CEREMONY

1072
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,613
Three, two, one.

1073
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,048
Okay, let's get you on the saddle.

1074
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,383
Okay. There you go.

1075
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,585
(IT'S PRETTY COMFORTABLE)

1076
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,687
I'll take your photo.

1077
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,955
Okay. Make a V sign.

1078
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,424
Look here, Hae-sa. Three, two, one.

1079
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,992
(SMILING INWARDLY)
[SHE SEEMS SATISFIED]

1080
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,160
Three, two, one.

1081
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,628
Okay. Just one more.

1082
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,930
SAE-HO'S DOING PRETTY WELL

1083
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,066
Who wants to take some photos next?

1084
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,501
Who wants to play hide-and-seek with me?

1085
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,568
I CAN'T LOSE

1086
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,539
Does anyone want to
play hide-and-seek with me?

1087
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,109
If you want to play hide-and-seek,
please gather here.

1088
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,944
LOOKING FOR HIGH-AND-SEEK PLAYERS (0/5)

1089
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,246
NO TAKERS?

1090
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,848
(I'LL PLAY IT WITH YOU)

1091
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,617
-Do you want to play hide-and-seek?
-Yeah.

1092
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,385
In that case,

1093
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,521
-will you be hiding?
-Sure!

1094
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,855
Go ahead and hide.

1095
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,857
OF COURSE I SHOULD OBLIGE MY SOLE PLAYER

1096
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,125
Go ahead and hide, Hae-sa.

1097
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,326
I'll come look for you.

1098
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,961
Go, Hae-sa.

1099
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,596
I'll come find you.

1100
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,831
One…

1101
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:07,899
Three.

1102
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,001
-Four.
-What are you doing, Hae-sa?

1103
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,171
Do you want to go on this, Hae-sa?

1104
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,505
She's looking for a place to hide.

1105
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,542
SHE HASN'T FOUND ONE YET, HAS SHE?

1106
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,177
-How about it?
-I'll come find you now.

1107
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,013
I'll come looking for you.

1108
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,315
I'll come find you now.

1109
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,383
PLAYER COUNT: 1

1110
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,286
JEONG-HU BECOMES THE SOLE PLAYER
IN MR. JOO'S HIDE-AND-SEEK ONCE MORE

1111
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,854
I'm right here!

1112
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,591
STAYING WELL HIDDEN
IS THE KEY TO HIDE-AND-SEEK

1113
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,326
Here I am!

1114
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,461
-I wonder where Jeong-hu is.
-Here.

1115
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,963
Where are you, Jeong-hu?

1116
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,132
I DIDN'T HEAR JEONG-HU…
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS…

1117
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,668
Where did Jeong-hu go? I need to find him.

1118
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,102
I'm right here!

1119
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,139
Jeong-hu, you shouldn't tell me
where you're hidden.

1120
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,007
I'm here.

1121
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,075
HE'S ON A NEW LEVEL

1122
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,411
THE 38-YEAR AGE GAP
BLOCKS WOO-JAE'S UNDERSTANDING

1123
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,478
There you are.

1124
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,748
Come up here!

1125
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,218
Can I go and hide, Jeong-hu?

1126
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,688
What do we do? This fish?

1127
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,189
-The fishy.
-What's this?

1128
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,191
Wow, fish.

1129
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,528
-Oh, you can try fishing here.
-There!

1130
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,630
-Do you want to try fishing?
-Yeah.

1131
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,099
HIS LOWER BODY CAN'T FIT INTO THIS SPACE

1132
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,401
BUT HE CAN ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE
WITH HIS TORSO CRAMMED UP THERE

1133
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,502
Hey, you caught one!

1134
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,637
You did it, Jeong-hu.

1135
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,439
JEONG-HU HAS EASILY CAUGHT A BIG ONE

1136
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,075
-I did it!
-Applause.

1137
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,910
-I caught fish.
-Applause.

1138
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,745
-Wanna catch another one?
-Yeah.

1139
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:28,813
Let's do it again.

1140
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,716
IF THAT'S WHAT JEONG-HU WANTS,
I DON'T MIND MY LEGS AT ALL

1141
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,651
WHILE WOO-JAE IS TAKING CARE OF JEONG-HU…

1142
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,087
SAE-HO IS LEFT IN CHARGE
OF THE REMAINING 4 CHILDREN

1143
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,255
Hop on the Pirate Ship!

1144
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,923
All right. Here we go.

1145
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,591
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS ON BOARD

1146
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,792
Off we go.

1147
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,661
PIRATE SHIP "THE SAE-HO" LEAVES PORT

1148
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,863
You'll have to make some noise.

1149
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,498
Let me hear you scream!

1150
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,966
SHRILL CRIES

1151
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,736
One more time. Let me hear your voice!

1152
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,205
All right.

1153
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,674
Scream if you're having fun!

1154
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,242
HAPPY SQUEALS

1155
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,247
MR. CHO GIVES THEM A GREAT TIME
USING HIS EXPERIENCES LEADING GROUP EVENTS

1156
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,116
The ship might trip. It really might!

1157
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,619
Shall we pick up some speed?
Would you rather if we slowed down?

1158
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,221
-Faster!
-Really?

1159
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,790
MR. CHO IS TAKING CARE
OF 4 KIDS WITH THE BOAT RIDE

1160
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,760
MEANWHILE, MR. JOO IS STILL
ON A FISHING TRIP WITH JEONG-HU

1161
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,862
Shall we catch some more?

1162
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,897
Say hi to the friend
sitting across from you.

1163
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,067
How about a high five?
Give each other a high five to say hi.

1164
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,302
A-yun.

1165
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,470
Let me take your photo.

1166
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,005
Look here and give me a pretty smile.

1167
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,540
Look this way, A-yun.

1168
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,608
Let's be careful.

1169
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,842
-Don't let me catch you.
-Gently.

1170
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,711
-Easy does it.
-Don't get caught.

1171
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,846
-Wow. Oh, no. It got away.
-Guys, I'm so hungry.

1172
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,815
-Can I get something to eat?
-Shall we try one more time?

1173
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,016
MR. CHO PLAYED 6 GAMES IN 30 MINUTES

1174
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,084
All right.

1175
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,152
HE'S BEEN VERY DILIGENT

1176
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,588
Jeong-hu, are you trying to
catch all the fish in this pond?

1177
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,023
Yeah.

1178
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,059
I see fish!

1179
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,627
SPENT 30 MINUTES IN THIS POSE TO HELP HIM

1180
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,028
Jeong-hu.

1181
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,898
We shouldn't catch fish
more than we can eat.

1182
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,434
Count how many you've caught so far.

1183
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,501
THEY SAY MODERATION IS KEY

1184
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,969
One, two,

1185
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,404
three, four,

1186
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,772
five, six…

1187
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,574
Are you going to empty the pond?

1188
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,675
Yes.

1189
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,044
What are you going to do
with all the fish you caught?

1190
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,145
Eat them.

1191
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,280
-You're going to eat them?
-Yeah.

1192
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,614
I WONDER WHAT SAE-HO IS DOING

1193
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,783
What have you got for me?

1194
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,851
What's this?

1195
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,119
-Rice.
-Rice?

1196
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,555
DID RESERVED HAE-SA
ACTUALLY SPEAK JUST NOW?

1197
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,624
So? Do you want to ride it again, Hae-sa?

1198
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,959
WHEN HAE-SA NEEDED HELP

1199
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,027
You're smiling, Hae-sa.

1200
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,864
SAE-HO CAME TO HER AID
AS QUICKLY AS A SHOOTING STAR

1201
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,935
I'm too hungry, miss.
Can I get something to eat?

1202
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:31,836
(NODDING)

1203
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,137
How much does the meal cost?

1204
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,708
Will this be enough?

1205
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,909
Can you try this with me?

1206
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,511
Make a heart.

1207
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,480
There you go. Finger heart.

1208
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,349
Can I please get some delicious snacks?

1209
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,118
(A BEAM OF CONSENT)

1210
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,221
THOUGH SHE DOESN'T TALK MUCH,
HAE-SA SHOWS HER AFFECTION IN HER OWN WAY

1211
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,489
(+5 PUMPS OF CARE)

1212
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,357
(A GENEROUS PORTION OF LOVE)

1213
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,593
(A SPRAY OF INTEREST)

1214
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,329
HAE-SA CLEARLY ADORES MR. CHO THE MOST

1215
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,097
It's so good. Do you want a bite, Hae-sa?

1216
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,332
Just a bit.

1217
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,200
So?

1218
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,268
Give me a high five.

1219
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,938
THE OTHER KIDS ALSO LOVE MR. CHO

1220
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,041
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD STAY STUCK HERE…

1221
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,377
Jeong-hu. Do you want to keep fishing?

1222
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,578
Yeah.

1223
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,213
Why don't we go try something else?

1224
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,482
Okay.

1225
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,284
Set them free yourself.

1226
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,952
JEONG-HU WRAPS THINGS UP FOR MR. JOO

1227
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,554
Wish them a good life.

1228
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,688
Have a nice life.

1229
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,223
Say, "Let's hang out again."

1230
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,491
"Let's have fun again later."

1231
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,161
Let's have fun again later.

1232
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,297
FINALLY MOVING ONTO A NEW SPOT

1233
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,232
What do you want to do next, Jeong-hu?

1234
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,134
Seo-jin.

1235
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,369
Do you want to ride this too?

1236
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,570
-What?
-Do you want a ride?

1237
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,638
No.

1238
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,739
I want to try fishing.

1239
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,040
I want to try fishing.

1240
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,375
I want to try fishing.

1241
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,010
-Fishing?
-Yeah.

1242
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,145
Jeong-hu's been fishing all this time.

1243
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,015
-Do you want to fish too?
-Yeah.

1244
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,384
-All right, then.
-Okay.

1245
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,052
RETURNS IN 1 MINUTE

1246
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,654
-You can use this.
-Okay.

1247
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,489
Like this.

1248
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,259
There's a magnet inside their mouth.

1249
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,327
Where?

1250
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,231
LOVE FOREST DAY CARE CENTER
HAS SO MANY FISHING ENTHUSIASTS…

1251
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,335
MR. JOO DEVOTES HIS ENERGY
TO FISHING AGAIN

1252
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,905
I-na. Can you come to me, please?

1253
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,474
I want to ask you something.

1254
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,976
You met Mr. Joo and me today
for the first time.

1255
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,179
If you have to choose
between Mr. Joo and me,

1256
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,348
who seems to be the kindest?

1257
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,417
Really?

1258
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,418
Well done.

1259
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,321
Follow me down, Seo-jin.

1260
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,388
Okay.

1261
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,691
You heard me, right? Follow me down.

1262
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:34,758
Got it.

1263
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,162
FINALLY ESCAPES THE FISHING SPOT
AFTER APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES

1264
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:39,930
What are you doing, I-na?

1265
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,899
I'm doing origami.

1266
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,501
You're doing origami?

1267
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,568
SLIDING NEXT TO LONE I-NA

1268
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,103
Shall I make one for you?

1269
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,105
Tell me what you want.

1270
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,206
A unicorn.

1271
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,041
-What?
-A unicorn.

1272
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,209
A unicorn?

1273
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,446
UNICORNS ARE PRETTY…
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN MAKE ONE

1274
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,081
You want me to make a unicorn?

1275
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,950
-Yes.
-I'll make one for you.

1276
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:05,556
HE'S BARELY ESCAPED THE FISHING SPOT,
BUT HIS NEXT TASK IS CREATING A UNICORN

1277
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,093
I-na. Let's say I make you
an origami unicorn.

1278
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,594
What will you do for me?

1279
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,264
LIFE IS ALL ABOUT GIVE AND TAKE, I-NA

1280
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,698
I'll make you a unicorn.

1281
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,068
OKAY, HERE GOES NOTHING

1282
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,738
Don't you want to play tag with me?

1283
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,805
[STILL DOING HIS BEST]

1284
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,907
-Sae-ho.
-Huh?

1285
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,875
So, how's it going?

1286
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,310
This is really exhausting.

1287
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:27,845
LET'S DO A RETAKE

1288
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,348
It's lovely and exciting
to be with the children,

1289
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,117
but I wonder what more I can do for them.

1290
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:34,752
That's tricky.

1291
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,187
I still do feel like
they've warmed up to me.

1292
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,722
What's the most challenging aspect?

1293
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:39,990
The most challenging aspect

1294
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,893
is that my input is rarely considered.

1295
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,528
That's about it.

1296
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,830
It gives me great joy
to be around the children

1297
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,933
and see them open up
their pure hearts to me.

1298
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,402
I still want to please them further.

1299
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,904
That's my ultimate goal.

1300
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,739
Do you… Do you think…

1301
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,575
-What happened?
-Something's going on there.

1302
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,809
-A-yun.
-Go and help them.

1303
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,277
What's up?

1304
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,112
Does anyone need help?

1305
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,514
What's going on?

1306
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,582
Can I see it?

1307
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,116
It's a unicorn.

1308
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,851
-Wow.
-Do you see its horn here?

1309
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,087
Can you see the horn?

1310
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,889
I-NA IS NO GOOD AT LYING

1311
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,324
Here's your unicorn.

1312
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,393
BEATING IN THE IDEA

1313
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,696
What does it look like to you, I-na?

1314
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:20,664
A horse.

1315
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,999
Did you say horse?

1316
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,233
You got it right.

1317
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,569
Why don't you glue this here?

1318
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,204
You can…

1319
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,239
What's going on, A-yun?

1320
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,743
YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF, MR. JOO

1321
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,679
Shall we catch some fish?

1322
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,781
-Yes!
-Go ahead and try it.

1323
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,050
Here's your unicorn.

1324
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,952
WAS MAKING A UNICORN A BAD IDEA?

1325
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,487
I-na.

1326
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,555
Ms. I-na.

1327
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,757
Can you come here?

1328
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,594
Why don't we glue pictures together?

1329
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,429
-All right.
-Which picture do you want?

1330
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,964
Lion.

1331
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,032
The lion?

1332
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,900
I'll cut it up and put it for you.

1333
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,535
Listen, I-na.

1334
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,505
If you had to compare
Mr. Cho over there and me,

1335
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,940
who's the most handsome one?

1336
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,074
(A POKE)

1337
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,744
YOU'VE GOT STANDARDS, I-NA

1338
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,480
Who seems to be the kindest?

1339
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,581
Who's the most handsome one?

1340
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,649
EACH ASKED A SELF-SERVING QUESTION

1341
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,385
How about I cut up the lion
and you glue it on the sketchbook?

1342
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,988
KIND MR. CHO MAY NOT BE GOOD-LOOKING,
BUT HE'S GIVING THEM A GOOD TIME

1343
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,156
Who wants to go down the slide?

1344
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,158
Do you want to go down the slide, Hae-sa?

1345
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,296
Tell me, I-na. Who's your favorite,
your mom or your dad?

1346
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,731
-Come on down.
-Mom and dad…

1347
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,033
-What?
-Mom and dad…

1348
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,535
-All right. Let's go!
-I like my mom more.

1349
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,703
You like your mom more?

1350
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,538
THE NOISE IS GETTING TO HER

1351
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,606
Do you like your mom more?

1352
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,074
Yeah.

1353
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,442
What about your dad?

1354
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,744
BEATS ME

1355
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:45,949
I-NA FAVORS KINDNESS AND FUN
OVER GOOD LOOKS

1356
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,823
NOTHING GOES YOUR WAY IN CHILD CARE

1357
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,957
I guess my niece

1358
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,827
only likes me because I'm her uncle.

1359
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,465
I FINALLY LEARNED THE TRUTH

1360
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,535
UNLIKE WOO-JAE,
SAE-HO NOW SEEMS RELAXED

1361
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,104
All right. Hae-sa is coming down.

1362
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,172
Hae-sa!

1363
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,209
Up top. Good job.

1364
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,644
Give me a high five.

1365
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,112
Well done. Give me a high five.

1366
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,947
One more time.
Let's see who can come down first.

1367
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,182
Off you go!

1368
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,850
(I'LL GET THERE THE QUICKEST)

1369
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,785
Up top. Give me a high five. Come on.

1370
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,221
HE'S PRACTICALLY A PROFESSIONAL

1371
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,857
SAE-HO HAS MANAGED TO TAKE HOLD
OF ALL FUTURE VIEWERS' AFFECTION

1372
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,326
Great job. Give me a high five.

1373
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,329
Let's high-five! Okay. One more!

1374
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,698
WOO-JAE CAN'T JUST SIT BACK
