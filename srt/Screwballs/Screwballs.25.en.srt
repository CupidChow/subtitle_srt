-Two.
-That is correct.

19
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,601

00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,320
Did you finish it?

30
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,190
-Let's break for lunch.
-All right.

31
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,391

00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,037
My gosh, we even got shaved ice.

37
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,839
Can we tuck in?

38
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,074
Where's Sae-ho?

39
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,542
-Right here.
-Quick, Sae-ho.

40
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,609
Please enjoy.

41
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,878
Thank you for the food.

42
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:23,349
-This looks ridiculously good.
-My gosh, but this is for dessert.

43
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,417
So good!

44
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,685
EVERYONE GOES FOR SHAVED ICE

45
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm craving something sweet right now.

46
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,091
Still, you should have your meal
before digging into the dessert.

47
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,461
-That's new.
-Okay. I'm done with my meal.

48
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,730
All right, then. That was a good one.

49
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:39,866
Gosh, it's good.

50
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,267
It's amazing.

51
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,369
I love this.

52
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,805
I don't think I can eat my meal
after this. It's that good.

53
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,541
-It sure is. The shaved ice is the best.
-Yeah.

54
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,577
ON A HOT SUMMER DAY…

55
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,278
It lowers your body temperature.

56
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,613
…SHAVED ICE IN THE SHADE IS THE BEST

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,849
-So good.
-Feels like we're on vacation, right?

58
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,150
We are, actually.

59
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,885
We're not. We're here for the shoot.

60
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,121
-It's as good as a vacation for me.
-Is that right?

61
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,755
-Is it a toil for you?
-No, not at all.

62
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,292
-You just made a 180.
-Sure.

63
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,428
-In mere seconds too.
-And that's my prerogative.

64
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,063
It is, right?

65
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,065
I can say whatever I want, can't I?

66
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,733
Tell me. Do you get a say in this?

67
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,602
-You don't.
-Sure, you're right.

68
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,337
Whatever, I guess.

69
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,939
Did you order the dishes
from a famous restaurant?

70
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,975
Are they good?

71
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,376
They're amazing.

72
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,611
The acorn jelly is to die for.

73
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,579
-It's incredible.
-I'm good.

74
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,648
-Would you like some, Woo-young?
-Thank you.

75
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,050
-Let me get you some, Woo-young.
-A big scoop, please.

76
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,621
A BIG MOUTHFUL

77
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,089
-It's all cooked.
-Man, it's so good.

78
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,459
AN APPRECIATIVE MOAN

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
I wish we had some fire going.
It'd taste better hot.

80
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,797
Can we get the braised short ribs?
Let's me compare them.

81
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,301
That's a good idea.

82
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,969
Where are the short ribs?

83
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,773
DO YOU EVEN HAVE TO ASK?
YOU BLEW YOUR SHOT WITH THIS STUNT

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,110
-Let's check out the braised short ribs.
-All right, then.

85
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,778
-Yeah?
-Here's my suggestion.

86
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,013
Let's hear it.

87
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,382
We actually have prepared some more food.

88
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,951
The braised short ribs
that you unfortunately didn't win,

89
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,886
some watermelon slices,

90
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,021
iced Americano…

91
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,088
ICY-COLD AMERICANO

92
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,657
…and cup ramyeon.

93
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,025
That's our list.

94
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,259
-Let me have them.
-The watermelon.

95
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,029
-Come on, let's see them.
-I want the watermelon.

96
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,231
-Today's theme is the fairy tales, right?
-Yes.

97
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,334
-I'll give you some related topics.
-All right.

98
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,304
I'll present you with certain situations
from well-known fairy tales.

99
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,706
Please imagine
what the protagonists would've felt

100
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,676
and come up with lines they could've said.

101
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,646
The individual with the wittiest remark

102
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,782
will be given the food of their choice.

103
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,183
-Great.
-We'd love that.

104
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,952
-This is all about wit, right?
-Of course.

105
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,621
Here's an example.
Let's say the witch from Snow White

106
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,324
presented the poisoned apple
to the princess.

107
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,992
I could have Snow White say,

108
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,994
"Do I look like a sucker to you?"

109
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,096
-Exactly.
-That's how it works, yes?

110
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,931
-You're giving us scenarios, right?
-Sure.

111
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,733
-This sounds fun.
-Let's do this.

112
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,569
We'd obviously need someone
to judge your responses

113
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,171
and pick out the wittiest one.

114
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,505
Is a guest joining us?

115
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,508
Woo-jae's nemesis
will be our special guest for today.

116
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,378
MY NEMESIS?

117
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,579
Please come in.

118
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,147
WHO IS WOO-JAE'S NEMESIS?

119
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,482
Who's my nemesis anyway?

120
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,617
Oh, I get it.

121
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,018
-Who's his nemesis?
-I see.

122
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,787
Come on, you need to be evenly matched
to be someone's nemesis.

123
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,558
Hey, there's our guy.

124
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,726
FINALLY REVEALED

125
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,061
IN ONE OF THE BUSAN EPISODES FROM SEASON 1

126
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,263
-Ready.
-Don't get hurt.

127
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,530
Set, go!

128
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,332
MR. SKELETON AND MR. SOFT BOY'S
ARM WRESTLING MATCH

129
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,001
-Keep going. Go on.
-Oh, dear…

130
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,271
WOO-JAE WON IN THAT FIERCE COMPETITION

131
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,906
THAT WAS HOW SUN-GYU RECEIVED THE TITLE…

132
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:40,413
OF BEING THE ONLY MAN
THAT WOO-JAE COULD BEAT IN ARM WRESTLING

133
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,483
I'm the sound department's Kwon Sun-gyu.

134
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,917
WOO-JAE'S NEMESIS
DIRECTOR KWON SUN-GYU

135
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,919
WELCOME

136
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,490
We work on multiple shows together,
so I see Sun-gyu often quite regularly.

137
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,992
So I can tell you that I've caught Sun-gyu

138
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,062
building up his arms in break times
after that arm wrestling with Woo-jae.

139
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,163
INTENSIVE TRAINING

140
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,398
He's that determined to win.

141
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,067
-How have you been?
-I've been well. Thank you.

142
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,135
How cute.

143
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,171
Which one among the cast
makes you laugh the most

144
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,340
when you watch our show?

145
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,778
THEY MAY KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP,
BUT THEY ALL COVET THIS TITLE

146
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,079
…when you watch our show?

147
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:13,980
THE WINNER IS…

148
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,215
-You, Sae-ho.
-Oh, really?

149
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,117
SO HAPPY

150
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,852
-Don't play favoritism, though.
-Sure.

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,487
Please judge our remarks fairly.

152
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,389
-All right, then.
-He's so adorable.

153
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,325
All right. Here's the first topic.

154
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,493
As the clock struck midnight,

155
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,395
Cinderella must hurry back home.

156
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,198
What sweet words could she
have whispered into the prince's ear

157
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,633
before leaving?

158
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,703
This is the last thing
she says to him, right?

159
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,603
That's right.

160
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,705
SHE HAS TO MAKE HIM SEEK HER

161
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,039
-I've got one.
-Let's hear it.

162
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,774
She can just lick his ear.

163
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,510
-Dude, what do you think you're doing?
-Jeez, you sleaze.

164
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,212
He's a troublemaker.

165
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,915
What's wrong with that? She could do that.

166
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,049
Look at Sun-gyu's face.

167
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,851
Just look.

168
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,953
HIS LIPS TELL ALL

169
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,955
So what? He's not going to…

170
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,257
I mean, you're not going to
give me first place anyway.

171
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,393
Well…

172
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,294
HER MAJESTY'S INPUT

173
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,362
"I…

174
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,997
live alone."

175
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,968
"THE PASSCODE IS 2784#"

176
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,305
ULTIMATE SEDUCTION
FINISHED OFF WITH AN ABASHED LOOK

177
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,407
"You'll put a shoe on me, and that's it?"

178
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,908
I'll leave it at that.

179
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,343
"How about some soju?"

180
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,146
But we haven't made a line witty enough
to impress you yet, have we?

181
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,415
Actually, I did find one witty.

182
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,483
Really? Okay.

183
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,851
-Which one was it?
-Can you tell us?

184
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,720
-We have to know your taste here.
-Yeah.

185
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,788
"I live alone."

186
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,790
-That one?
-All right!

187
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,358
I APPROVE OF HIS TASTE

188
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,259
Okay.

189
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,462
So this is the line
that works on you, huh?

190
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,764
Okay, I got it now.

191
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,799
Now that he's shared that,

192
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,135
it seems Sun-gyu's general taste…

193
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,137
is that of a soft boy.

194
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,039
I think I get him now.

195
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,107
EMBARRASSED

196
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,809
Did you just call him a soft toy?

197
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,478
Not "soft boy," Jin-kyung.

198
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,546
Was it a softie, then?

199
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,714
That's not it either.

200
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,082
-I didn't say that.
-What was it?

201
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,950
Soft boy, and soft as in gentle.

202
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,952
There are these new slangs grouping guys,

203
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,322
putting total machos on the one side
and the gentle folks on the other.

204
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,126
Total machos
are the burly, energetic guys.

205
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,829
But he only stays at home.
How does he know all these things?

206
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,597
-Even at home--
-That's exactly why I know them.

207
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,901
New words aren't physically outside.
You can find them on the Internet.

208
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,236
Just go online.

209
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,773
All right.
Who takes first place on this topic?

210
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,177
I'll give Sook the first place.

211
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,545
-Ah, well…
-"I live alone."

212
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,280
-I got it now.
-I'll take a more gentle approach.

213
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,715
-Okay.
-You can choose one menu, Sook.

214
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,184
What's your pick out of short ribs…

215
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,085
-It's an individual match.
-…watermelon, iced Americano,

216
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,454
-and cup ramyeon?
-Choose cup ramyeon.

217
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,088
Watermelon.

218
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,156
-I see.
-Huh?

219
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,591
-What?
-Watermelon coming right up.

220
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,960
Give her a single slice.

221
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,028
Just one.

222
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,329
What? Just a slice?

223
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,697
IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL MATCH, AFTER ALL

224
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,300
ONE-SLICE DELIVERY
VS. WATERMELON EVALUATOR

225
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,935
NOT THAT ONE

226
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,403
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE

227
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,839
You're not giving her the whole dish,
but only a small portion?

228
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:53,973
Yes, just a slice.

229
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,242
-I still got the biggest one.
-Looks that way.

230
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,310
It looks pretty good.

231
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,778
Here's your next topic.

232
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,147
-Let's say Kong-gwi…
-What about her?

233
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,084
…discovered the hole in the water pot
while trying to fill it up.

234
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,053
What would she have said?

235
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,256
I have an answer.
She was pouring the water in

236
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,891
when she discovered the hole, right?

237
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,161
HMM…

238
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,130
"Screw you, Pat-gwi. You little ****."

239
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,966
"Screw you, Pat-gwi. You little b****."

240
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,033
WHAT?

241
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,101
LIGHTHEADED

242
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,438
EVEN THE CAMERA'S SHUDDERING

243
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,806
-It's just…
-Have you lost it?

244
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,207
I didn't mean to,

245
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,176
but that was the only way
to fully convey the tone.

246
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,044
My bad. Dear viewers, I apologize.

247
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,881
Let me explain.
It's just that we have to get immersed

248
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,817
in the world of Kong-gwi and Pat-gwi

249
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,520
to get into the character's head
and come up with lines.

250
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,589
-And it was the only option.
-Come on.

251
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,092
-Swearing is a cheap way to get laughs.
-That's true.

252
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,327
-Even Sook's not swearing.
-I'm holding it in on purpose.

253
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,796
But could you try it once
to set the right tone?

254
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,766
"Pat-gwi, you little…
You're one **** of a ****."

255
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,636
"You're one **** of a ****."

256
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,573
OOPS, WE FORGOT

257
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,575
THIS IS MS. KIM SOOK

258
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,678
THANK GOODNESS SHE'S ON OUR SIDE
(OR SO WE HOPE)

259
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,579
That was intense.

260
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,647
CHILLS, WE'RE GETTING CHILLS

261
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,949
WHAT KIND OF LIFE HAVE YOU LED SO FAR?

262
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,050
That was intense.

263
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,854
Could you add this hand gesture too?

264
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,690
HERE'S THE FAN SERVICE YOU WANTED

265
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,725
"That **** Pat-gwi
cooked up this scheme with her mom.

266
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,460
What a **** mess.

267
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,229
CRACKING UP

268
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,231
What a **** mess.

269
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,133
EPIC PERFORMANCE FROM THE QUEEN

270
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,769
See? Anyone could do it.

271
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,970
EVERYONE FAINTED

272
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,738
-How neat was that?
-I can't compete with that.

273
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:33,806
EVER SO REGAL

274
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,575
There's no competing with her.

275
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,543
I could never beat her.

276
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,980
Here's what I realized. It's too difficult
to channel the anger without swearing.

277
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,616
-Let's move on to the next topic.
-Let's do that.

278
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,485
Woo-jae actually covered
this very topic earlier.

279
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,254
-When the Evil Queen…
-Really?

280
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,191
When the Evil Queen presents
Snow White with the poisoned apple,

281
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,260
what would she say
if she were a 21st-century young adult?

282
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,131
SNOW WHITE AS A 21ST-CENTURY YOUNG ADULT?

283
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,968
"My gosh."

284
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,970
"My gosh. I'll die soon,

285
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,272
but I get to enjoy this apple.
Lucky you, Snow White."

286
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,140
SO PROUD OF HIMSELF

287
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,508
That ran too long!

288
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,144
Didn't he sound
like an old geezer just now?

289
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,613
-But why?
-"Lucky you"? I like it.

290
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,615
"I'll die shortly
when I eat this poisoned apple,

291
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,618
but I still get to eat it. It's healthy
to have one in the morning."

292
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,852
"Lucky you, Snow White."

293
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,087
SO, ARE YOU IMPRESSED?

294
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,990
DOUBLING DOWN IS A CLEAR SIGN OF AGING

295
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,993
Old geezers always use buzzwords
that just went out of fashion.

296
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,529
Ones whose shelf life
expired by mere months, not years.

297
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,731
They'd insist on trying them.

298
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,165
"Lucky you, Snow White."

299
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,233
THAT'S NOT IT, SIR…

300
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,036
MEANWHILE, SAE-HO'S EFFORTS
IMPRESSED THIS ELDER

301
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,104
How about this?

302
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,305
"OMG."

303
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,073
-"OMG"?
-I can't believe you.

304
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,708
-That's how young people talk.
-OMG indeed!

305
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,776
"OMG."

306
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,144
IT WAS A NEW SLANG BACK IN 2005

307
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,912
CONGRATS ON GETTING INTERNET SERVICE

308
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,514
How's this, then?

309
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,817
"If I eat this poisoned apple,
I'd die and stuff, right?"

310
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,352
-What do you think?
-"And stuff."

311
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,221
HERE YOU ARE,
THROWING OLD SLANGS AND STUFF…

312
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,622
And stuff, yeah.

313
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,092
"I'd bite into the poisoned apple,
or better yet, not do that and stuff."

314
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,260
HEH-HEH

315
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,530
"I always eat certain varieties.
Is it a crabapple? Can I ask and stuff?"

316
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,099
A FAKE YOUNG ADULT

317
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,734
I believe that was popular
way back in 2002.

318
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,469
-Has it been out there for so long?
-What?

319
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,804
Here's the simplest option.

320
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,406
-It's short.
-Let's hear it.

321
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,274
"Take this apple, Snow White."

322
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,876
"Whatever. Not interested."

323
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,778
-What was that?
-What? That's my answer.

324
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,814
-"Whatever."
-"Whatever. I'm not eating."

325
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,717
-"Sure, whatever."
-Hey, I like it.

326
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,452
-Let's hear the verdict.
-Okay.

327
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,254
-Who said the best line?
-Tell us, Sun-gyu.

328
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,823
I'll go with the last entry
from Woo-young.

329
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,158
After all the ideas from Sae-ho?

330
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,793
-Yes, I won!
-"Sure, whatever."

331
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,927
-That's the best, right?
-Sure.

332
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,762
I knew it. "Whatever. Not interested."

333
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,897
Sae-ho pitched so many ideas.

334
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,366
So you don't say, "and stuff"?

335
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,400
-That's outdated.
-Really?

336
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,768
HMPH

337
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,003
I'm sorry, though.

338
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,071
ALOOF

339
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,505
ANNOYED

340
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,940
Anyhow, I'd like cup ramyeon.

341
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,508
Please bring Woo-young one cup ramyeon.

342
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,110
I'd love to have one too.

343
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,611
The next topic, please.

344
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,447
Here's the last one.

345
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,349
-I trust you're familiar with Sim Cheong?
-Sure.

346
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,618
What would she have said
before jumping into the water?

347
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,754
IMAGINE THE FINAL WORDS FROM CHEONG

348
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,156
So I have to put myself in her shoes,

349
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,593
and think of what she'd say
as she jumped into the water?

350
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,361
No, well, yeah.
Her final words as she jumps.

351
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,296
"OMG."

352
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,363
"OMG."

353
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,667
"OMG" fits perfectly.

354
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,436
-Sun-gyu's face is screaming "OMG."
-Again?

355
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,105
OMG indeed.

356
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,272
STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART

357
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,908
But that's all I can think of.

358
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,211
Here's my idea for her last words
before the plunge.

359
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,713
As she takes the jump,

360
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,583
-"Though my life will come to a close…
-Jeez.

361
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,918
…my dad will get his sight back.
Lucky you, Cheong."

362
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:33,953
"Lucky you, Cheong."

363
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,288
GURGLING SOUNDS

364
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,558
Wait, but I have the most realistic line.

365
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,461
Just like the whole living alone idea,
Sun-gyu likes lines from everyday life.

366
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,529
So before she jumps…

367
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,697
AND WHAT'S THE MOST REALISTIC TAKE?

368
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,365
Most people say this before the plunge.

369
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,967
"Let's go!"

370
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,736
"Let's go!"

371
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,804
This is it, okay?

372
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,005
A SUDDEN BURST OF ENERGY

373
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:53,906
You agree, don't you?

374
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,441
EVEN THE DRAGON KING WOULD FEEL MOVED

375
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,575
That was hilarious.

376
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,911
-Woo-young will get another prize.
-That seems likely.

377
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,112
IN TERMS OF SPIRIT, SURE

378
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,015
THIS BRAISED-SHORT-RIB FAN
IS GETTING ANXIOUS

379
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,518
You could add flavor with a performance.
When jumping…

380
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,418
GETS ONTO HIS FEET

381
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,853
-Go ahead.
-You stand up tall…

382
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,754
-Let's roll.
-Ready.

383
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,889
Three, two, one.

384
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,790
SHRIEKS

385
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,191
I'm Sim Cheong

386
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,693
YIPPEE

387
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,895
This is an option.

388
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,796
HE'S LOST IT!

389
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:17,696
How's this?

390
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,131
ONE LAST DANCE BEFORE DIVING IN

391
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,032
I'm Sim Cheong

392
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,967
-Like a musical?
-Exactly. What do you think?

393
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,235
HE'S BULLDOZING HIS WAY…

394
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,870
AN APPLAUSE SECURED BY SHEER STUBBORNNESS

395
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,072
I'm calling it "I'm Sim Cheong."

396
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,908
-I just can't…
-I'm Sim Cheong

397
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,776
-Did you have a favorite?
-Yes.

398
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,945
All right. Please tell us your favorite.

399
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,714
CANDIDATE NO. 1: FRAUD "YOUNG ADULT"

400
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,784
CANDIDATE NO. 2: SIM CHEONG
SPIRITED ENOUGH TO LEAD AN ARMY

401
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,654
CANDIDATE NO. 3: PLAIN FAN OF "OMG"

402
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,289
"Let's go!"

403
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,124
"OMG" fits perfectly.

404
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,192
HE ONLY HAS AWFUL OPTIONS

405
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,993
-Please tell us your favorite.
-It's Sae-ho's idea.

406
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,695
SAE-HO WINS THE JACKPOT

407
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,896
-As in "I'm Sim Cheong"?
-For real?

408
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,832
You liked "I'm Sim Cheong"?

409
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,466
-Over mine?
-I loved "Let's go."

410
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,135
-It's clearly the best!
-What are my options?

411
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,271
Watermelon, iced Americano,
cup ramyeon, or braised short ribs.

412
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,640
-Braised short ribs, please.
-Short ribs were on the menu?

413
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,175
-Sure.
-Even back when I won the game?

414
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,243
Of course.

415
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,011
-And I chose watermelon instead?
-Yes.

416
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,348
THE JOLLY LUNCH HOUR ENDS
WITH BRAISED SHORT RIBS AS THE FINAL DISH

417
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,918
THE SUN IS SCORCHING

418
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,954
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO GO SWIMMING

419
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,523
Even your dresses look cooler.

420
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,058
I can't wait to dive in.

421
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,459
-Go right ahead.
-Can I do that?

422
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,694
If you'd like, sure.

423
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,296
But the water will be freezing.

424
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,831
SQUABBLING

425
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,233
Have you lost it or what?

426
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,069
IS HE A TRUE SCREWBALL?

427
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,304
I don't even want to
dip my toe into the water.

428
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,073
-Really?
-You're going in for sure.

429
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,207
Sae-ho.

430
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,475
"LET'S THROW HIM IN THERE"

431
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,410
Was that a challenge?

432
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,645
No way.

433
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,315
-She just dared me to show my true colors.
-I called Sae-ho, that's all.

434
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,450
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

435
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,019
YOU'RE ALL GOING IN THE WATER ANYWAY

436
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,988
Continuing with our fairy tale episode,

437
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,124
we have prepared a special game
that can only be played here.

438
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,793
Hoping to motivate you further,

439
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,395
we have placed prizes to your right.

440
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,765
They're back, I see.

441
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,933
RETURN OF THE NETFLIX MERCHANDISE

442
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,002
Wait, what is that?
Isn't that Netflix merchandise?

443
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,336
EVERYONE CRAVED THEM

444
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,140
AFTER COMPETING
IN THE GRACEFUL AND DIGNIFIED GAMES

445
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,143
THE MERCHANDISE SET

446
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,312
WENT INTO JIN'S HANDS

447
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,714
Are those leftovers
from the shoot with Jin?

448
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,284
For your information,
we've added more enticing goodies.

449
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,552
See the new backpack?
The Apple Watch is still among them.

450
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,421
Is this a group game?

451
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,423
-It's an individual match.
-Really?

452
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,892
-Yes, the winner of each game…
-Cool!

453
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,527
…could select a prize.

454
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,463
When we review a fairy tale
from our childhood as grown-ups,

455
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,333
we often see
characters' circumstances in a new light

456
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,901
or find ourselves reimagining the events.

457
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,105
Without further ado, let's reinterpret
fairy tales the Screwballs style

458
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,708
-and rewrite a few fairy tales.
-All right.

459
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,177
The first fairy tale we'll be rewriting…

460
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,578
centers around Cheong.

461
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,646
It's Tale of Sim Cheong.

462
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,782
In this story,
the dutiful daughter, Sim Cheong,

463
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,151
sacrifices herself to secure
300 seoks of rice for her blind father.

464
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,119
What if she could see

465
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,088
an inflatable float in the water?

466
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,058
Or we could imagine Cheong

467
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,393
-being a great swimmer like Park Tae-hwan.
-Exactly.

468
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,928
What if she were a skilled diver?

469
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,830
If there were a float in the water,

470
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,333
Cheong in our version of story
could survive.

471
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,235
And so, you'll each take a turn
to become Cheong.

472
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,470
-Oh.
-Let's go!

473
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,805
Let's do this!

474
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,373
HOLD YOUR BREATH AND DIVE

475
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,441
All right.

476
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,609
Behind you in the pool
is a bridge made of platforms.

477
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,012
-Right.
-Go across the bridge

478
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,547
until you reach the final platform.

479
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,817
Then, channel the dutiful Cheong's spirit
and jump onto the inflatable duck.

480
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,719
When you do, please shout,
"I love you, Mom and Dad."

481
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,822
Your task
is to successfully go on to the float.

482
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,191
Wait, isn't that way too easy?

483
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,258
It sure looks that way.

484
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,326
How are your lymph nodes?

485
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,494
Oh, about them.

486
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,229
I checked earlier, and they seem fine.

487
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,299
Wait, let's say we all went into the pool.

488
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,034
We won't catch his condition, right?

489
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,571
How rude.

490
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,139
BUT I DON'T WANT THAT

491
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,309
You'll each get a turn with the time limit

492
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,944
of 30 seconds.

493
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,013
Let's do Rock-Paper-Scissors,
nice and neat.

494
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,814
I want to know the pool's depth.

495
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,950
-Try going in.
-I don't want to drown.

496
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,251
It's 1.1 meters.

497
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,086
Why don't we do Rock-Paper-Scissors
to have the loser

498
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,254
show us the depth?

499
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,889
Why bother? The sign says it's 1.1 meters.

500
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,825
Let's still do it.
If you'd rather not, don't lose.

501
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,261
Why is that even necessary
when the number is right there?

502
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,596
Let's just move on.

503
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,764
Please, let's proceed.

504
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,665
-Jump in.
-Let's go!

505
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,867
Come on, do it.

506
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,934
RUNS AWAY

507
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,505
Why won't you listen?

508
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,674
-Why not jump in after saying, "Let's go"?
-Come on, let's have the loser jump in.

509
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,145
Wouldn't Director Park want us
to start the game in dry clothes?

510
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,646
-It's fine either way.
-Yeah?

511
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,847
-Thought so. So--
-Let's go, then.

512
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,985
SO IT'S FINE EITHER WAY, HUH?

513
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,720
Nicely done.

514
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:36,922
This is how deep the water is.

515
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,990
DEPTH CONFIRMED

516
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,825
-This is about it.
-It's all right, then.

517
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,660
AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

518
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,364
-My gosh, Jin-kyung!
-Was that a challenge?

519
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,265
NO WAY

520
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,633
Give me a hand.

521
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,234
I'll take a pass.

522
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,803
Just this once.

523
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,870
YOUR CHEAP TRICKS DON'T WORK

524
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,038
My lymph nodes…

525
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,041
Look at these rascals sitting down
not to get dragged into the water.

526
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,876
IN THE END, SAE-HO DIVED IN ALONE

527
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,944
SIM CHEONG GAME'S LINEUP

528
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,513
JIN-KYUNG, SOOK,
WOO-JAE, SAE-HO, AND WOO-YOUNG

529
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,449
Those of you not competing,
please get on that platform.

530
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,516
THE SPECTATORS' PLATFORM

531
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,619
-I'm sitting down.
-You can relax and watch from there.

532
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,288
How is it so firm?

533
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,790
Are we perhaps being
charged a fee for the show?

534
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,092
-We'd appreciate it.
-For real?

535
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,326
Gosh, you look so cute.

536
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,594
FLOATING AWAY

537
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,362
What is that dolphin called?

538
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,664
HE MEANT THIS DOLPHIN

539
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,731
What did he mean?

540
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,899
Genius dolphin.

541
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,802
I realize our thing is
not to care about gender,

542
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,571
but why don't we give
the ladies one minute?

543
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,573
-We don't do that here.
-Not at all.

544
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,074
-We don't want that.
-Why, though?

545
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,509
We all have working legs

546
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,010
and are given the same condition.

547
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,879
-We don't need it.
-I'll allow three seconds.

548
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,847
They can have 33 seconds.

549
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,815
-Don't bother.
-Thirty-three seconds.

550
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,884
-Thirty-three seconds, then.
-Fine.

551
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,154
Suppose I fell off the platform.
Do I get back onto it

552
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,089
-if I still have time to go?
-Sure.

553
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,224
Be careful not to get hurt.

554
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,559
You already gave us a spectacular fall,

555
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,261
-so make it count this time.
-Nice and neat.

556
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,329
Ready.

557
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,197
Go!

558
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,665
THE DOLPHIN SHOW BEGINS

559
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,134
There you go.

560
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,069
There you go.

561
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,170
SLIPS

562
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,272
Looking good.

563
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,541
Looking good.

564
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,411
SHE'S DONE FINE UNTIL THE LAST PLATFORM

565
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,013
THEN, SHE DIVES RIGHT IN

566
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,282
SPITS OUT WATER

567
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,050
-Wait.
-What was that?

568
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,556
SHE IS INDEED THE GENIUS DOLPHIN

569
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,592
BORN WITH A TALENT FOR VARIETY SHOWS

570
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,194
What was that?

571
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,063
-You still have time left!
-What?

572
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,131
-Get back up there.
-Go on.

573
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,000
-You still have time left.
-You can try again!

574
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,269
That was almost a scrumptious shot.

575
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,338
She fell on her back earlier
and then fell flat on her face just now.

576
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,774
-How hilarious is that?
-Three, two, one!

577
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,678
You forgot to scream,
"Mom and Dad, I love you."

578
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,681
You failed.

579
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,051
-I still made it to the last platform.
-Yeah, you were amazing.

580
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,853
-I'm so jealous.
-Why do you say that?

581
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,322
Earlier, you were flung away
like you weighed nothing.

582
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,524
Just now, you dived
like it was the easiest thing to do.

583
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,625
I can get there by myself.

584
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,728
Dang it! It's freaking cold in here!

585
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,331
SHE HATES THE COLD

586
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,733
-I can't believe her.
-Are you okay?

587
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,435
I don't see stairs here.

588
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,770
Can anyone help her up?

589
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,671
HERE I GO

590
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,738
Never mind, she's good.

591
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,307
Wow, you really are built strong.

592
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,608
Praise her muscles!

593
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,210
She looks like a real wrestler.

594
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,644
MUSCLE LADY WHO WRESTLES AS A HOBBY

595
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,279
-All I have to do is get on it?
-Sure.

596
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,315
-Good luck!
-Ready.

597
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,650
Set. Go!

598
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,185
HERE COMES THE MUSCLE LADY

599
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,287
She's not going fast enough.

600
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,522
FALLS

601
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,290
SHOWS OFF HER AMAZING SENSE OF BALANCE

602
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,292
CRAWLING FORWARD

603
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,894
OH, WOW…

604
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,962
But it's too far away.

605
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,096
It's drifting away

606
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,497
It's slipping away!

607
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,632
It's floating away!

608
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,967
Please don't go

609
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,102
-You have to jump, Sook!
-Please don't go

610
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,337
Do I have to bring it back?

611
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,438
Dang it.

612
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,374
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, DUCK?

613
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,410
SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURED

614
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,646
-I have to get back up here, right?
-Yes.

615
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,981
This is the tricky part.

616
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,582
She's right about that.

617
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251
OFF I GO!

618
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,255
ALL MUSCLES FULLY ENGAGED

619
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,757
HOW AMAZING IS THAT?

620
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,526
I did it.

621
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,061
Now, "Mom and Dad, I love you."

622
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,162
Mom and Dad.

623
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,864
I love you!

624
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,566
SHAKY LEGS

625
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,937
SHE DIDN'T JUMP FAR ENOUGH

626
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,071
You failed.

627
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,608
Damn it.

628
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,111
-Next up is Woo-jae.
-Let's go, Woo-jae.

629
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,612
Could you push the platform for me?

630
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,048
Don't waste our time.
Every second is precious to our crew.

631
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,983
When I clock out,
my clothes will still be dry.

632
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,184
You're ending up in the pool.

633
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,020
Gosh, this is actually fun.

634
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,221
REACHED THE LAND IN DRY CLOTHES

635
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,658
Woo-jae, show us how it's done.

636
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,127
-Are you guys ready?
-Can I make a request?

637
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,895
Could you jump high

638
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,964
and land with your legs
wrapped around the duck's neck?

639
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,999
With his legs wrapped around the neck?

640
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,701
Dang, the leg trick?

641
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,336
I have high hopes for you.

642
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,538
Ready. Set. Go!

643
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,308
LIKE A BULLET

644
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,912
WHOSE CLOTHES ARE WET NOW?

645
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,980
You can still do it!

646
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,315
-He's really doing it?
-Jump!

647
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,516
-Go on!
-Jump!

648
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,451
THE DUCK FLOAT IS FAR AWAY

649
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,919
-Go on!
-Jump!

650
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,254
You can do it. You've got long legs.

651
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,589
READY TO MAKE THE LEAP

652
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,892
What was that?

653
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,196
MR. SKINNY LEGS ENDS UP FALLING CLUMSILY

654
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,564
What on earth?

655
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,000
Try it again with the motto.

656
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,101
Come on.

657
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,269
You've got this.

658
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,670
NO END OF TROUBLES

659
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,439
Do it! No, don't let it go over.

660
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,506
DUCK GETS OVERTURNED

661
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,774
It's just not easy.

662
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,776
-You're bound to fall in the end.
-You can do it!

663
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,412
MR. SKELETON DOESN'T GIVE UP

664
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,181
Shout, "Mom and Dad, I love you."

665
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,317
What's the matter with him?

666
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,521
HE'S THE WORST AT THIS,
AND HE LOOKS THE MOST PATHETIC

667
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,689
You failed!

668
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,358
You're plain awful.

669
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,425
Out of the way.

670
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,728
-Who's next? Is it you, Sae-ho?
-Yeah.

671
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:43,795
Move.

672
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,831
You just can't win this thing.

673
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,599
Tell me something, Woo-jae.

674
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,167
Why do the platforms shake so much?

675
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,769
-Up to this point…
-Yeah?

676
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,738
-…you're good.
-I see.

677
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,805
But on this platform,

678
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,774
-make sure to step on this point.
-Oh, right there?

679
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,609
-Okay.
-And take the leap.

680
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,845
WHATEVER

681
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,880
When I clock out,
my clothes will still be dry.

682
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,949
The trick is to move quickly,

683
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,752
pushing your left foot forward
before your right foot lands.

684
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,287
I'd dash forward and then jump, okay?

685
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,490
-Are you saying you're going to fly?
-Exactly.

686
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,625
-Show us something cool for a change.
-I swear I will.

687
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,694
THIS IS SAE-HO'S PLAN

688
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,664
-Show us how it's properly done.
-Yeah, show us how a true veteran does it.

689
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,767
All right, then. I'm so nervous.

690
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,435
-Ready.
-Ready.

691
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,303
-Set. Go!
-You've got this!

692
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,571
-Wish me luck!
-Good luck!

693
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,707
SPRINT AND LEAP!

694
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,108
What the heck?

695
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,112
What the heck?

696
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,347
What's he doing?

697
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,283
You can do it. You still have time left.
There you go.

698
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,919
-I ended up slipping at that point.
-He doesn't seem so steady either.

699
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,955
Launch yourself to the float!

700
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,791
MR. LYMPH NODES SEEMED SO SURE OF HIMSELF

701
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:46,691
SHRIEKS

702
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:48,994
He's too short.

703
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,629
I bet Jin-kyung could've made it.

704
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,398
TOO SHORT

705
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,501
He's too short.

706
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,702
AN INSURMOUNTABLE LIMITATION

707
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,771
I bet Jin-kyung could've made it.

708
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,308
All right, then.
Try again with "Mom and Dad, I love you."

709
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,110
Mom and Dad, I love you!

710
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,178
He's done it!

711
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,345
WOBBLES

712
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,580
He's done it!

713
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,048
DID HE REALLY SUCCEED?

714
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,716
Mom and Dad, I love you!

715
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,151
DID THIS CHEONG SURVIVE

716
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,053
AFTER RESTORING HIS FATHER'S SIGHT?

717
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,389
Mom and Dad, I love you!

718
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:18,890
He's done it!

719
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,126
-He did it.
-It's a success!

720
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,295
He's done a great job with balance.

721
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,764
So that's how you keep it
from overturning.

722
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,901
SAE-HO SECURES A PRIZE!

723
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,969
This is fun.

724
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,337
Congrats.

725
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,673
You should try it his way…

726
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,341
A SELF-CONGRATULATORY CELEBRATION

727
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,243
It wasn't so bad.

728
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,478
Woo-young.

729
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,012
I'm so nervous. I don't think I can do it.

730
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,650
WHERE IS IT?

731
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,656
THAT'S BOUND TO SPARK A DISCUSSION
ABOUT HIS CHARACTER ISSUES…

732
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,359
A BRIDGE WITH A DEFLATED PLATFORM

733
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,760
THAT SHAKES

734
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,897
HE'S FACING TRIALS
EVEN BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS

735
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,266
WHAT A PAIR OF LOYAL FRIENDS

736
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,969
What's going on?

737
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,237
Is someone shaking it?

738
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,304
Who is it?

739
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,073
For your information,

740
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,442
I've had ample experience
on Let's Go Dream Team,

741
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,744
Running Man, and other variety shows.

742
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,913
-Don't we know it.
-I know how these things work.

743
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,548
-Ready.
-If you're curious--

744
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,883
-Go!
-Go!

745
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,855
OH?

746
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,923
Go!

747
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,859
WOO-YOUNG'S BOLD SPRINT

748
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,131
You did so well!

749
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,833
-It was so close.
-What a bummer.

750
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,801
-He's done great.
-You can still do it.

751
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,271
All right. Get back on the platform.

752
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,405
Don't forget the line.

753
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,040
"Mom and Dad, I love you."

754
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,775
Watch your foot.
You just pushed the float away.

755
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,144
You can just start from there.

756
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,446
All right. You have to jump far.
It's drifted away.

757
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,748
It traveled pretty far.

758
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,683
I CHOOSE DEATH

759
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,784
Oh, come on.

760
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,787
YOU'RE GREAT AT THESE ACTIONY GAMES, HUH?

761
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,188
-What's the matter with him?
-Come on.

762
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,124
All right.
Prepare to throw yourself to the float.

763
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,492
Do it. You've got this.

764
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,594
Yes, that's a good distance.

765
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,664
-No, you're too close.
-Mom and Dad.

766
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,098
Mom and Dad.

767
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,199
I love you!

768
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,268
Mom and Dad.

769
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,336
I love you!

770
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,606
WAIT, DID THAT GUY JUST…

771
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,142
SAE-HO'S OUT FOR MISCHIEF

772
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,176
Why did you do that?

773
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,477
What's he doing?

774
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,212
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN

775
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,614
I promise I won't move it back.

776
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,916
I swear not to do that.

777
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,252
-I don't trust you. Let me handle that.
-I'm being serious.

778
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,486
-But you'll pull it back.
-I won't!

779
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,554
-Woo-jae.
-I won't!

780
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,922
-Let me hold it.
-I won't!

781
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,258
-You can't trust him.
-Fine, don't trust me.

782
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,060
Mom and Dad.

783
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,328
SUDDEN TERROR ENGULFS HIM

784
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,395
He's just holding it.

785
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,763
-Please don't, man.
-I'm only holding it.

786
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,131
-He won't pull it.
-You're not Sae-ho.

787
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,266
Of course I'm not.

788
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,434
Mom and Dad.

789
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,202
Mom and Dad.

790
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,674
WOO-YOUNG IS DUPED AGAIN

791
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,810
-He didn't pull it back. He lifted it.
-So I did.

792
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,645
I didn't pull it back. I just lifted it.

793
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,814
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

794
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,148
I feel you. Get back up there.

795
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,650
I promise not to try anything again.

796
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,952
Why don't we hold it from both sides
so we can't move it away?

797
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,787
We can keep it in place that way.

798
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,122
Why do I get multiple shots?

799
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,224
If you pull it off this time,
we'll count it as a success.

800
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,160
-For real, yeah.
-Hold it steady for our youngest.

801
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,562
Help him win a prize.

802
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,097
Let's keep it steady.

803
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,999
-Help me out, guys.
-Got it.

804
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,634
-No more tricks.
-We promise.

805
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,902
Mom and Dad, I love you!

806
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,072
Mom and Dad, I love you!

807
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,042
SO PROUD OF THEMSELVES

808
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,011
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS

809
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,747
CACKLING

810
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,516
It was hilarious. He headbutted the float.

811
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,584
LET'S DRINK TO THAT

812
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,785
He butted his head right in.

813
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,654
DANG IT

814
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,922
-This is fun.
-That was hilarious.

815
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,391
-I feel like I could do it.
-Try it.

816
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,026
We'll give you another shot, Woo-jae.

817
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,293
I won't even touch the float.

818
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,663
Move.

819
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,965
You rascals.

820
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,000
I promise to let go
when you reach the last platform.

821
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,068
Okay.

822
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,337
HIS SPEED WAS IMPRESSIVE

823
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,373
BUT HIS FALL WASN'T

824
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,677
MR. SKINNY LEGS ENDED UP FLOUNDERING A LOT

825
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,744
Ready.

826
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,613
-Go!
-You can do it!

827
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,116
HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR!

828
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,755
SAE-HO SABOTAGED HIS COSTAR AGAIN

829
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,057
Why did you push it away?

830
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,225
I could picture myself
hugging the duck's neck.

831
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,560
-I was so close!
-Okay.

832
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,128
APPEALING TO THE CREW

833
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,697
Excuse me, there's a line here.

834
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,799
-Please make way for the next person.
-Damn you.

835
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,500
I swear I won't do something funny again.

836
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,269
Just don't, okay?

837
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,870
-You could get hurt.
-Got it.

838
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,306
I've had ample experience
on Running Man and other variety shows.

839
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,374
DESPITE HIS CONFIDENCE…

840
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,475
I love you!

841
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,544
HE WAS NO MATCH
FOR HIS MISCHIEVOUS COSTARS

842
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,712
I love you!

843
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,782
COULD HE SUCCEED IF THEY DIDN'T MEDDLE?

844
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,617
Ready. Set.

845
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,252
Go!

846
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,888
Show us how it's done, Woo-young.

847
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,057
A SPEEDY RUN-UP AND A POWERFUL LEAP

848
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,992
Show us how it's done, Woo-young.

849
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,694
WILL HE MANAGE IT THIS TIME?

850
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,730
Show us how it's done, Woo-young.

851
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,133
DID HE SUCCEED AT LAST?

852
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,038
HE FLOATED LIKE A BUTTERFLY

853
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,539
AND PLUNGED LIKE A BAT

854
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,108
SNICKERING

855
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,009
BUT HIS JUMP WAS AMAZING

856
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,077
You failed!

857
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,580
So these guys didn't win anything
despite the multiple attempts?

858
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,781
It's unfortunate, but yes.

859
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:10,982
ONLY THE CHOSEN ONES CAN SURVIVE

860
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,551
Sae-ho won a prize!

861
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,686
Can I choose from the bunch?

862
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,954
Yes, please.

863
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,022
What should I choose?
I wonder what's the best option.

864
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,391
-I'll go with this shopping bag.
-This one?

865
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,728
-A box?
-A coffee brand's logo's on it.

866
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:24,963
-What's inside?
-Open it.

867
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,398
WHAT GOODIES WERE IN THE SHOPPING BAG?

868
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,201
-It's a cup.
-And a bag of whole bean coffee.

869
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,070
Gosh, that's lovely.

870
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,438
Let's give him a big hand.

871
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,706
-Good work.
-Thank you.

872
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,174
I love the tumbler.

873
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,176
-Thank you.
-Great work, everyone!

874
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,911
LET'S GET READY FOR THE NEXT GAME

875
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,249
BOY, IT HURTS

876
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,385
There must've been a shark
or an alligator in the pool.

877
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,554
Otherwise, we can't explain the bitemark.

878
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,655
It's going to be okay.

879
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,892
HE MUST'VE GOTTEN HURT AT THIS POINT

880
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,460
GROANING

881
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,129
It's hardly the size of your pinky nail.

882
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,197
He did get grazed.

883
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,665
But the wound is tiny.

884
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,400
Should I twist my arm like this?

885
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,336
Director Park,
which way gives you a better shot at this?

886
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,438
TEARS

887
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,207
-Shall we get going, then?
-Sure.

888
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,809
Can you keep working, Woo-jae?

889
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,510
I'm not sure, but I'll do my best.

890
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,445
THIS GUY COULDN'T CARE LESS

891
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,513
-He did get hurt, so…
-Yeah.

892
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,582
-We got you.
-The blood is seeping through.

893
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,150
I told you that's the ointment.

894
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,052
Dear viewers,

895
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,422
please show Woo-jae much love and support.

896
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,492
The next fairy tale we'll rewrite
is The Fairy and the Woodcutter.

897
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,561
You're familiar with the story?

898
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,962
-All too well.
-Of course.

899
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,164
While a fairy from the heavens
is taking a bath,

900
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,699
a woodcutter steals her magical robes--

901
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,734
By the way, he's an *****.

902
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,436
He shouldn't have done that.

903
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,138
He committed theft

904
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,472
and unlawful confinement.

905
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,608
-Yeah.
-If you apply modern sensibilities,

906
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,410
-he's a criminal.
-He should be locked up.

907
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,477
What a rotten jerk.

908
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,179
He committed theft
and unlawful confinement, sure.

909
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,247
But his biggest crime

910
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,182
-is the invasion of her privacy.
-You bet it is.

911
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,052
Let me present to you
our version of the tale.

912
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,154
What if the fairy

913
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,823
caught the woodcutter
trying to steal her robe?

914
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,193
You'll play the part of the fairy

915
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,996
-and punish the woodcutter.
-All right.

916
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,731
Behind you in the pool

917
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,399
-are lifesavers.
-Yeah.

918
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,035
You'll each take a turn
to become the fairy in the story.

919
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,304
The fairy can take
one inflatable toy hammer.

920
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,606
That's a mace, isn't it?

921
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,307
I didn't know
toy hammers came in this design.

922
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,775
The spikes don't hurt at all.

923
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,878
I get where we're going.

924
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,280
-Is it a whack-a-mole game?
-It is.

925
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,749
The remaining four
will be the woodcutters.

926
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,384
They will have to hide
beneath the lifesavers.

927
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,785
When they come up,

928
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,120
the fairy will smack them.

929
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,588
THE FAIRY WITH THE MOST HITS WINS

930
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,789
How long does a round last?

931
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,124
I suggest two minutes.

932
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,560
-Can I stay underwater for a full minute?
-Of course.

933
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,694
-I can hold out, right?
-Sure.

934
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,929
Okay.

935
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,098
Won't my wound get infected
if I go into the pool?

936
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,499
SNORTS

937
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,668
-Let me see.
-Infection, seriously?

938
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,137
You won't have trouble today.
But it might start to rot tomorrow.

939
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,907
You should see the surgeon
who treated my lymph nodes.

940
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,608
You'll need surgery.

941
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,843
THE FAIRY GAME'S LINEUP

942
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,045
JIN-KYUNG, SOOK, WOO-YOUNG,
WOO-JAE, AND SAE-HO

943
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,815
By the way, where should the fairy
position themselves?

944
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,118
Oh, come on. Come along into the pool.

945
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,920
So they're going into the pool too?

946
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,554
Reach out when you see one coming up…

947
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,923
-Wait.
-…to smack them.

948
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,658
-The lifesavers are spread out too far.
-Yeah.

949
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,526
Before the woodcutters get in position,

950
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,061
we should decide
who gets the furthest spots

951
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,130
-with a round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
-All right.

952
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,733
-The center spots are disadvantageous.
-They're much closer to the fairy.

953
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,069
Please decide with a fair round
of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

954
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,570
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-All right!

955
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,407
Rock, paper, scissors. Okay.
Rock, paper, scissors.

956
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,142
One more time. Okay, I'll take this end.

957
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,944
-I'll take the other end.
-Okay.

958
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,312
I'm saddled with a center spot?

959
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,548
-Let's narrow the gaps.
-You're spread out too wide.

960
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,550
-Move in closer.
-Can I stand here?

961
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,819
SNEAKY WOODCUTTERS
ARE CAUGHT STEALING THE MAGICAL ROBE

962
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,355
THE FAIRY HEADBAND ON!
SHE'S READY TO TEACH THEM A LESSON

963
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,423
All right. Let's do this!

964
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,158
Now, ready.

965
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,393
-Set.
-Why are you right behind me?

966
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,829
Go!

967
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,197
ONE HIT RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO

968
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,265
Go!

969
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,201
DIVES TO RUN AWAY

970
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,571
WOODCUTTERS FOUND REFUGE UNDERWATER

971
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,407
ALL IS SILENT

972
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,242
THERE'S NO TARGET

973
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,379
SNEAKS OUT

974
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,382
FAILS TO CROSS THE DISTANCE IN TIME

975
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,851
SILENCE REIGNS FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS

976
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,621
ALL THOSE WOODCUTTING WORK
MUST'VE GIVEN THEM A GOOD SET OF LUNGS

977
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,624
EVEN SO, HOW ARE THEY
STAYING DOWN THERE FOR SO LONG?

978
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,763
STRIKES ENSUE
THE MOMENT ANYONE COMES UP FOR AIR

979
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,332
GOES UNDERWATER AFTER THE CLOBBERING

980
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,569
OTHERS COME UP FOR AIR
WHILE WOO-JAE KEEPS HER DISTRACTED

981
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,170
I NEED SOME AIR

982
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,942
TRAVELS BACK AND FORTH WITH THE MACE

983
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,178
THE WOODCUTTERS ARE MAKING HER DIZZY

984
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,048
SECURELY STATIONS HERSELF IN THE CENTER

985
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,217
FOCUSING ALL HER EFFORTS
ON THE TWO IN THE MIDDLE

986
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,353
HELP ME OUT

987
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,622
MEANWHILE, WOO-JAE…

988
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,993
IS HAVING A FIERCE BATTLE UNDERWATER

989
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,230
HE'S ATTACKING SAE-HO WITH ALL HIS MIGHT

990
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,967
IN THE END, HE COMES UP FOR AIR!

991
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,737
LET ME BREATHE, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD

992
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,640
THE FAIRY IS IN THE PRIME SPOT

993
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,810
THAT'S CLEARLY THE BEST SPOT

994
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,012
ENJOYING THE SHOW
LIKE SHE'S JUST A SPECTATOR

995
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,515
Why do you come up so often?

996
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,682
Dang it.

997
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,853
These guys need a whole lot of air.

998
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,156
Why are you taking all that air in?

999
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,627
WAIT, WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE
I'M HER ONLY TARGET?

1000
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,396
HE'S REACHED HIS LIMIT

1001
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,132
TIME OVER

1002
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,569
-These guys come up so often, Sook.
-Hey!

1003
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,971
Jin-kyung. Care to know
why I come up so often?

1004
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,607
That's because we're having
a brutal battle underwater.

1005
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,310
I didn't know I would stoop so low,

1006
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,878
but when things got desperate,

1007
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,947
I ended up reaching for his lymph nodes.

1008
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,649
You really shouldn't, though.

1009
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,217
Dang, this spot is…

1010
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,318
A WATERPARK!!!

1011
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,821
Seriously, the spot…

1012
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,023
She kept hitting me right here.

1013
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,124
The game makes you risk your life.

1014
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,193
-Sae-ho and I--
-But you came up so often.

1015
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,461
Positioning is everything.

1016
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,162
The fairy can never reach this far.

1017
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,931
I did great, though.
I held my breath fine.

1018
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:00,998
Who cares?

1019
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,335
Next up is Sook, right?

1020
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,403
-Yeah.
-The score--

1021
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,071
-Let's do Rock-Paper-Scissors.
-Let's do it.

1022
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,306
Rock, paper, scissors.

1023
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,407
JIN-KYUNG: SCISSORS
OTHERS: ROCK

1024
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,541
Your position matters.

1025
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,909
You got the center spot, Jin-kyung.

1026
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,177
Rock, paper, scissors.

1027
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,512
OTHERS: PAPER
SAE-HO: SCISSORS

1028
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,847
Okay, I'm staying here.

1029
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,981
Rock, paper…

1030
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,282
Hold on a second.

1031
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,151
-Dang, I can't stay in the center.
-Keep him here.

1032
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,819
Rock, paper, scissors!

1033
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,822
WOO-YOUNG WON!

1034
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,392
A CENTER SPOT TWICE IN A ROW

1035
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,995
SMACK, SMACK

1036
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,098
READY TO SCHOOL THE WOODCUTTERS

1037
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,266
Okay, good.

1038
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:36,834
Ready.

1039
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,569
Sae-ho, don't try anything this time.

1040
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,971
Let's do it right and hold our breaths.

1041
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,239
No tricks this time.

1042
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,707
Ready. Set.

1043
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,743
THE GAME BEGINS!

1044
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,346
PANICKING

1045
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,814
HIDES UNDERWATER

1046
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:54,552
LET HER CATCH YOU, AND YOU'RE DEAD!

1047
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,523
STOP IT!

1048
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,657
SNICKERS

1049
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,392
SMACK

1050
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,627
I told you not to do it!

1051
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:03,728
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN

1052
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,697
I told you not to do it! Stop it, okay?

1053
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,798
THIS IS MY SHOT TO GO UP

1054
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,234
THUD, THUD

1055
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,171
THE MERCILESS HAMMER DOESN'T MISS ITS MARK

1056
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,472
SHE'S ENJOYING THIS

1057
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,509
CAN YOU SEE ME?

1058
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,610
What is she doing?

1059
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,545
RETREATS UNDERWATER

1060
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,979
Hey, you.

1061
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,047
Hey, you.

1062
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,183
GETS BACK UNDERWATER

1063
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,251
You and your tricks.

1064
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,287
You and your tricks.

1065
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,122
ATTACKS HER

1066
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,523
-Hey, wait.
-You can't touch me.

1067
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,325
-You can never get me.
-You rascal.

1068
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,393
-Here I am.
-You brat.

1069
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,861
-Here I am. You can't…
-You brat.

1070
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,329
THE PAIR IS CAUSING HER TROUBLE

1071
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,998
He's pinching me from below.

1072
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,166
What on earth?

1073
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,069
He's pinching me from below.

1074
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,604
Hold on. What's up with her?

1075
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,106
HEH, YOU GOT ME

1076
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,309
You can't touch me.

1077
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,877
Here I am.

1078
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,045
I'm right here.

1079
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,246
Bet you can't touch me.

1080
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,215
-Catch me if you can.
-Come on, he's a pincher.

1081
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,950
What's this?

1082
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,818
-Where did it go?
-Hey, wait!

1083
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,620
-Where are you going?
-Come get me. I'm right here.

1084
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,721
Catch me if you can.

1085
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,122
-You can't touch me!
-What's up with her?

1086
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,958
-You two are just out here.
-Catch me if you can.

1087
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,659
Sook's round is a lot of fun.

1088
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,760
Catch me if you can.

1089
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,163
I dare you. Catch me if you can.

1090
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,564
YOU THINK THIS IS "FUN"?

1091
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,099
ON THE VERGE OF THROWING UP

1092
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,467
I'm going to kill him.

1093
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,703
-I swear I'll kill him.
-You can't touch me.

1094
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,004
-I'll help you.
-Here I am.

1095
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,206
NOW, SHE'S ONLY TARGETING ONE WOODCUTTER

1096
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,309
A JOINT OPERATION!

1097
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,782
OFF I GO

1098
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,252
-It flew away!
-Come catch me.

1099
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,319
-Dang it.
-But you never will.

1100
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,487
JUST HOW MUCH FORCE DID YOU USE?

1101
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,756
SMACK

1102
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:39,924
GAME OVER

1103
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,525
SHRIEKS IN PAIN

1104
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,628
She hit me with the handle!

1105
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,564
Man, it hurts!

1106
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,733
WAVES OF LAUGHTER

1107
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,635
That was freaking hilarious.

1108
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,270
By the way, this guy here

1109
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,572
is a pincher.

1110
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,307
-He pinched you, the fairy?
-Yeah.

1111
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,975
No, I didn't mean to pinch her.

1112
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,978
I was flailing
for something to hold on to.

1113
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,213
He's a pincher.

1114
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,281
No, I'm not.

1115
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,949
-Who's next?
-The third fairy.

1116
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,050
Hey, that's me!

1117
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,852
-Let's do Rock-Scissor-Paper.
-Jin-kyung, here.

1118
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,754
Come on. Rock, scissors, paper!

1119
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,289
WOMEN: SCISSORS, MEN: ROCK

1120
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,623
-I'm on fire today.
-All right!

1121
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,058
-We can take each end.
-Okay.

1122
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,694
Hey, I'm loving this.
I guess it's my lucky day.

1123
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,130
The 1,000-ton hammer breaks easily.

1124
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,598
That one's the best.

1125
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,367
THE BAND-AID IS ALREADY FALLING OFF

1126
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,635
HE'S A BIG CRYBABY

1127
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,803
Look at the Band-Aid.

1128
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,538
The Band-Aid…

1129
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,606
-That doesn't hurt.
-Yeah.

1130
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,707
Geez, you're so loud.

1131
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,342
Dang it.

1132
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,711
OUR NAUGHTY 40-YEAR-OLD TROUBLEMAKER

1133
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,313
Don't hit too hard, Woo-young.

1134
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,114
THAT'S FOR ME TO DECIDE, I'M JAZZED!

1135
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,483
It's just for the game,
so don't take it the wrong way.

1136
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,053
SWISH, SWISH

1137
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,922
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO
HURT OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS

1138
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,791
-Ready.
-Let's play it fair and square.

1139
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,426
-Set.
-No fouls, okay?

1140
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,061
GO

1141
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,262
DIVING UNDERWATER

1142
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,970
TWO GAMES EARLIER
MUST'VE HELPED THEM LEARN

1143
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,006
THEY'RE HOLDING THEIR BREATHS MUCH BETTER

1144
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,742
SNEAKS UP

1145
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,177
You can't touch me.

1146
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,745
Catch me if you can.

1147
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,281
TEASING WOODCUTTER IS BACK IN ACTION

1148
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,850
You can't get me, can you? Here I am.

1149
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,619
I'm right…

1150
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,521
STAY DOWN THERE, ALL RIGHT?

1151
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,891
ANOTHER TEASE ON THE OTHER SIDE

1152
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,827
GET BACK THERE THIS INSTANT

1153
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,628
You can't touch me. Catch me if you can.

1154
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,364
Try it, and I'll disappear.

1155
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,399
When you come near, I'll go underwater.

1156
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,734
I TOLD YOU TO STAY DOWN THERE

1157
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,371
THIS FAIRY WILL COME DOWN HARD ON YOU
EVEN IF YOU'RE FAR AWAY

1158
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,939
I love this spot.

1159
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,475
CLANG, CLANG

1160
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,910
CLANG, CLANG

1161
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,379
-Hey!
-Hold on.

1162
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,848
I need to adjust my swim goggles.

1163
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,250
SHALL I GET BACK OUT THERE?

1164
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,151
SNEAKS A PEEK

1165
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,222
THIS TEASING WOODCUTTER IS THE WORST

1166
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:56,227
THANKS TO THE TEASING WOODCUTTER,
ALL OTHERS ARE ON A BREAK

1167
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,895
STEALS A GLANCE

1168
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,797
DON'T YOU DARE

1169
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,732
CLANG

1170
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,501
CLANG, CLANG

1171
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,603
Hang on. I'm getting water in my goggles.

1172
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:13,244
SHE'S CHARGING AT HER FRENEMY COSTAR
WHILE THE FAIRY IS PREOCCUPIED

1173
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,046
Woo-young! Here's another target for you!

1174
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,616
Woo-young, look.

1175
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,217
Hold on. I need to deal with him first.

1176
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,419
HOLDING THE LIFESAVER FIRMLY

1177
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,686
HE'S BECOME A STATUE

1178
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,522
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1179
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,458
FAIRY WOO-YOUNG HAS DECIDED TO MARK SAE-HO

1180
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,161
FLUSTERED

1181
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,029
I'LL SMACK YOU EVEN IF YOU STAY THERE

1182
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,901
THINGS ARE GETTING PHYSICAL HERE TOO

1183
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,370
Here, Woo-young!

1184
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,872
Woo-young! Get over here. Quick!

1185
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,507
Hang on. I need to teach him a lesson.

1186
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,243
TIME OVER

1187
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,845
He's strong, all right.

1188
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,347
THAT WOODCUTTER IS A TEASE

1189
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,383
-You really got my goat.
-Listen.

1190
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,318
-You're pretty good.
-By the way, I saw two people

1191
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,153
fighting tooth and nail underwater.

1192
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,222
A BATTLE WITHOUT SPECTATORS

1193
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,490
Those two over there.

1194
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,059
Those two were having an all-out war.

1195
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,396
Sook looks so menacing underwater.

1196
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,464
A DOUBLY DIFFICULT GAME

1197
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,565
I mean it.

1198
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,632
Yeah, I get it.

1199
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,035
She looks so scary.

1200
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,403
Anyway, who's next?

1201
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,471
-It's Woo-jae.
-Woo-jae.

1202
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,239
Is it him? Okay, then.

1203
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,041
Give either Jin-kyung or me your spot.

1204
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,409
Sure, after the Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1205
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,778
-We got hit too many times.
-Okay, but first things first.

1206
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,047
-You snooze, you lose
-You snooze, you lose

1207
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,049
WOMEN: PAPER, MEN: ROCK

1208
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,984
-I mean to give you my place anyway.
-Yes!

1209
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,753
ALL FAIRY WOO-JAE CARES ABOUT
IS PUNISHING THE WOODCUTTERS

1210
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,822
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

1211
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,359
-Jin-kyung.
-I'm not going to play nice this time.

1212
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,229
Not that I'm ever nice,
but I'll be super mean this time.

1213
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:39,830
Ready.

1214
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,233
-Set.
-I have to stay underwater this time.

1215
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,133
GO

1216
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:45,669
FAIRY WOO-JAE IS HERE

1217
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,671
LET'S ALL RUN AWAY

1218
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,641
HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN!

1219
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,476
I'm not going to play nice this time.

1220
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,544
DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU

1221
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,449
No one's coming up?

1222
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,517
ALL IS QUIET

1223
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,584
What is this?

1224
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,886
Am I an outcast here?

1225
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,487
DEEPLY HURT

1226
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,356
How can they stay there this long?

1227
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,423
AN AMAZING LEARNING CURVE!

1228
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,359
I MUST HOLD OUT

1229
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,027
APPROACHES WOO-YOUNG

1230
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,629
WHAT NOW?

1231
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,632
A FIERCE BATTLE BEGINS ONCE MORE

1232
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,300
COMES UP

1233
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,169
Damn you, Sae-ho!

1234
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,672
I'm not going to play nice this time.

1235
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,007
THIS FAIRY IS A MAN OF HIS WORD

1236
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,942
I'LL GET BACK AT YOU

1237
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,044
COME HERE, YOU

1238
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,412
DELIVERS HIM TO THE SURFACE

1239
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,813
TEARS

1240
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,115
THERE YOU ARE, WOODCUTTER!

1241
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,349
HELP!

1242
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,985
THE WANDERING WOODCUTTER IS ALSO PUNISHED

1243
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,255
THE WOODCUTTERS ARE HELPLESS
TO THE BARRAGE OF HITS

1244
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,657
CRACKING UP

1245
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,791
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

1246
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,293
I'M RUNNING, ME TOO

1247
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,029
Get out here. I dare you!

1248
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,031
BORN TO BE AN AVENGING FAIRY

1249
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,733
What is all this?

1250
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,801
WHILE THE FAIRY'S FURY REIGNS…

1251
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,405
SAE-HO IS SURROUNDED
BY WOO-YOUNG AND JIN-KYUNG

1252
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,709
THEY'RE PINCHING AND HITTING HIM

1253
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,545
You've gone mad.

1254
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,581
GET BACK IN THERE

1255
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,016
YOU HAVE NO PLACE HERE!

1256
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,886
WOODCUTTER SAE-HO IS IN FOR AN ORDEAL

1257
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,222
COME HERE, YOU

1258
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,857
NOPE

1259
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,795
Come on. You have to stay inside the ring.

1260
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,164
PLEASE HELP

1261
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,267
A NEVER-ENDING FIGHT
BETWEEN THE WOODCUTTERS

1262
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,170
Seriously, what are we even doing here?

1263
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,641
TIME OVER

1264
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,776
I'm not going to play nice this time.

1265
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,411
HE'S PUNISHED THE WOODCUTTERS BIG TIME

1266
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,779
This is the final round.

1267
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,314
You won't believe
what went down underwater.

1268
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,016
It was a downright war,

1269
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,517
using the tips of our fingers.

1270
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,720
DRAGGING AWAY

1271
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,323
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1272
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,258
It's for the last game of today.

1273
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,694
-You snooze, you lose
-You snooze, you lose

1274
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,929
JIN-KYUNG AND WOO-YOUNG LOST

1275
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,297
-Okay, get in there.
-All right.

1276
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,033
DISMAYED OVER BEING IN THE CENTER
FOR THE THIRD TIME

1277
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,768
EVERYONE'S IN THEIR POSITION

1278
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,036
SMACK

1279
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,505
THE LAST FAIRY IS PRACTICING
TO GET HIS HITS JUST RIGHT

1280
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,240
-Don't overuse it, Sae-ho.
-I shouldn't?

1281
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,576
If it loses its tension,
the hits don't land properly.

1282
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,644
Is that right? Got it.

1283
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,946
I regretted putting
too much force into my swings.

1284
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,881
-It went rather flabby.
-Got it.

1285
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:11,949
Ready.

1286
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,854
THE TWO WOODCUTTERS IN THE CENTER
LOOK VERY TENSE

1287
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,921
Set.

1288
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,157
GO

1289
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,627
STARTS GOING AFTER WOO-JAE
WHO GAVE HIM A GREAT TIP

1290
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,697
FLUSTERED

1291
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,998
Don't overuse it, Sae-ho.

1292
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,066
HOW UNGRATEFUL IS THAT?

1293
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,936
WOO-JAE'S HEAD IS UNDERWATER

1294
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,172
BUT SAE-HO STRIKES HIM ANYWAY

1295
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,840
HEH-HEH

1296
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:37,908
SHOVE, SHOVE

1297
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,877
THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED FOUL

1298
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,912
DIVING TO ESCAPE

1299
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,215
JUST A PEEK ABOVE WATER

1300
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,017
GETS THE FAIRY TO RUSH OVER TO YOU

1301
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,086
COME HERE, YOU

1302
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,387
SMACK, SMACK

1303
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,689
TEARS

1304
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,158
FORGET ABOUT RULES,
I'M ALL IN FOR RETRIBUTION

1305
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,960
TOY HAMMER ON RAMPAGE

1306
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,863
Why does he get to smack me
even when I'm underwater?

1307
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,066
Come on, he shouldn't hit me
when I'm down there.

1308
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,568
CLANG, CLANG

1309
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,104
FAIRY SAE-HO IS OUT OF CONTROL

1310
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,075
ATTACKS HIS LYMPH NODES

1311
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:12,743
SHRIEKS IN PAIN

1312
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,044
SHRIEKS IN PAIN

1313
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,112
My lymph nodes.

1314
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,717
FURIOUS PUMPING MOTIONS

1315
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,251
FINDS A NEW TARGET

1316
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,753
Why hit a person below the surface?

1317
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,057
No, my lymph nodes!

1318
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,493
GET A TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE!

1319
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,663
-Watch out!
-I was underwater when he…

1320
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,797
YOU'RE ABOVE SURFACE NOW

1321
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,833
HELP ME

1322
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,334
A GLANCE

1323
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,904
A GOOD STIR WILL DO

1324
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,173
HE'S COOKING SOOK TO HIS LIKING

1325
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,510
BUBBLES RISING

1326
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,045
STEALS A GLANCE AT THE CREW

1327
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,480
BEFORE MAKING ANOTHER FOUL

1328
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,050
Why does he get to stir up the water? Why…

1329
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,153
RUTHLESS UNPROVOKED ATTACKS

1330
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,956
ARE KEEPING THE WOODCUTTERS
BELOW THE SURFACE

1331
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,528
HIS TYRANNY IS ONLY GROWING STRONGER

1332
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,502
Sook.

1333
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,403
My lips feel…

1334
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,305
CONFUSED GRUNTS

1335
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,573
He's lost it.

1336
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,176
Hey, Woo-young! Woo-young!

1337
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,144
THAT WAS A FEINT

1338
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,045
Give it back.

1339
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,113
This isn't right.

1340
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:24,948
This isn't right.

1341
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,652
A TOY HAMMER DROPS FROM THE HEAVENS

1342
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,554
THIS IS IT FOR YOU

1343
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,824
KARMA CAME BACK IN TWOFOLD

1344
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,994
A FINE JOB OF SERVING JUSTICE

1345
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,197
TOUCHED, "THE HEAVENS"
GRANT THE WOODCUTTERS ANOTHER TOY HAMMER

1346
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,565
Where did he go?

1347
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,699
Where is he?

1348
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,738
DIVES FOR DEAR LIFE

1349
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,840
SMACK, SMACK

1350
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,975
THE GOLDEN RULE OF FAIRY TALES

1351
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,244
IS THAT THE GOOD TRIUMPHS OVER THE EVIL

1352
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,281
LOL

1353
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,348
Come on, guys.

1354
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,318
TEARS

1355
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:04,188
WHILE WOO-JAE ALMOST COLLAPSES
FROM LAUGHING SO HARD…

1356
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,726
This is preposterous.

1357
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,364
A SUDDEN WARDROBE MALFUNCTION

1358
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,634
HOW UNFORTUNATE…

1359
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,336
What was all that about?

1360
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,904
HEH-HEH, WE HAD A BLAST

1361
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:21,972
It was so much fun!

1362
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,474
Seriously, that was not right.

1363
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,977
SERVES YOU RIGHT

1364
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,279
Sae-ho should have been
disqualified to begin with.

1365
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,316
He thrusted the handle to hit us
when we were underwater.

1366
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,984
Right. He did that to me too, didn't he?

1367
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,987
He'd attack you to get you up here
and smack you like this.

1368
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,857
If you ask me,
the way Sae-ho attacked you…

1369
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,592
looked like he was using a plunger

1370
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:42,726
to unclog a toilet.

1371
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,462
I was sure I was underwater,
but he kept hitting me.

1372
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,664
-Me too!
-I wondered if I wasn't fully submerged.

1373
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,067
But when I glanced to the side,

1374
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,735
he was hitting Woo-young…
Wait, it wasn't him.

1375
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,270
-Sook was being attacked like this.
-Yeah!

1376
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,504
He pulled that on me,

1377
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,006
and I got really confused.

1378
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,875
A MIX OF FOUL AND DISRESPECT

1379
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,077
-Do we have the results?
-Yes, we do.

1380
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,778
-Jin-kyung.
-Yeah?

1381
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,413
-You went first, right?
-Yes.

1382
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,481
You had 57 hits.

1383
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,450
-My gosh.
-That's your score.

1384
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,918
-Sook.
-Huh?

1385
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,486
-You had 46 hits.
-Got it.

1386
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,021
That's your score.

1387
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,322
-Woo-young.
-Yes?

1388
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,590
You had 43 hits.

1389
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,425
Sae-ho.

1390
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,627
I did pretty well, didn't I?

1391
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,262
-You had 33 hits.
-Really?

1392
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,563
-I thought…
-You still did pretty well.

1393
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,399
Is Jin-kyung the winner?

1394
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,500
SHE'S CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD

1395
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,635
Woo-jae.

1396
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,405
You had 123 hits.

1397
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:30,807

00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,037
Gosh, hello.

1412
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,106
-I can sense the cosmic energy.
-What?

1413
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,207
What a nice place.

1414
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,442
I love the couch.

1415
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,610
Can I take it?

1416
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,045
-I wear size 260.
-I wear size 260.

1417
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,513
-I'm sorry, but--
-This unit is mine.

1418
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,181
I put my life on the line for this.

1419
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,482
Please leave.

1420
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,719
Come on, Sae-ho.
We didn't come here to mooch off you.

1421
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,854
Gosh, this is so pretty.

1422
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:18,989
THEY COME WITH GIFTS

1423
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,991
Let's have the shoot
at my place from now on.

1424
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,492
I brought this to keep you warm.

1425
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,894
In the middle of summer?

1426
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,495
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN…

1427
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,864
-Sook gave you that, didn't she?
-Hear me out, okay?

1428
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,399
He's giving Sook's present to Sae-ho?

1429
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,002
-You're a piece of garbage.
-Do you have a death wish?

1430
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,637
WHILE THEY SQUABBLE ALL THE TIME…

1431
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,372
We've hit the half-year mark already.

1432
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,673
Has it been six months already?

1433
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,642
I suggest we have a team dinner.

1434
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,911
We'll play an individual game
to decide who picks up the bills.

00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,181
HE'S WELCOMED THEM TO HIS HOME,
BUT THEY'RE BEATING HIM UP

00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,816
-Woo-young.
-You failed.

1437
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,150
I'm losing my mind here.

1438
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,386
HIS LIVING ROOM EVEN HAS TO SUFFER

1439
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,455
HAVING A WATER PARK OPEN UP THERE

1440
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,956
-That's disgusting!
-My gosh.
