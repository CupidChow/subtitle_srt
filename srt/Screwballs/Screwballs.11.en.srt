1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:04,004
OFF THEY GO TO THEIR HOTEL AFTER
THE SUCCESSFUL JOINT MISSION!

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,839
-So it was 23 plus 78.
-I know.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,141
Everyone.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,877
Can you guess what is the number
that can get anyone to stand up?

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,579
All our quizzes were like that.

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,381
Get anyone to… Is it a trick question?

7
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,682
It gets folks to stand up.

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,583
Five.

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,351
THAT ONLY TOOK 5 SECONDS

10
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,686
-How so?
-For high fives.

11
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,754
Exactly.

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,755
Hey, Jin-kyung.

13
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,358
Here's another one.
How long does an oil delivery take?

14
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,726
-Oh, I know this.
-To where?

15
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,061
That doesn't matter.

16
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,329
Where is it being shipped from?

17
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,097
-Saudi Arabia.
-That doesn't matter either.

18
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:31,998
-It's this, right?
-Yeah.

19
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,166
Hey, I got it.

20
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,002
If we had chosen trekking,
we'd still be solving quizzes.

21
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,071
I bet Sae-ho would've done well.

22
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,440
-He has a higher IQ than me.
-Stop it.

23
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,842
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

24
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,511
Jeez. He's so annoying.

25
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,980
-Seriously, why bring up IQ?
-He's a pill.

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,182
Are we hopeless at quizzes
because we have low IQs?

27
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,985
It's not like we refuse to solve them.
It's for…

28
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,020
The show wouldn't be fun
if we solved everything.

29
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,889
All I did was compliment Sae-ho.

30
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,924
I don't get why you two act
like I ran you down.

31
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,526
-Jin-kyung.
-Seriously…

32
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,895
The answer is five days
because the English word "oil"

33
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,863
-sounds like--
-Do you take me for a fool?

34
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,931
I know that much.

35
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,735
Did you think I stayed quiet
because I didn't know that?

36
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,003
How's this one?

37
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,272
What type of martial arts
does Winnie the Pooh practice?

38
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,573
-It's so simple--
-Stop it.

39
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,810
Give me the name of the martial arts
Winnie the Pooh does.

40
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,679
It's an easy one.

41
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,181
TAEKWONDO? JUDO? KARATE? BOXING?

42
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,282
No idea.

43
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,950
Kung-Pooh.

44
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,954
Let's say Winnie the Pooh

45
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,322
is made deliriously happy.

46
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,225
Sum it up in a two-syllable word.

47
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,262
Something made him so happy
and turned him into this. What can it be?

48
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,597
-Pooh-dle.
-Exactly.

49
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,665
As in a puddle, right?

50
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,834
Way to make the show boring.

51
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:46,206
-It makes you feel like you're so smart.
-Seriously, where's the fun in this?

52
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,407
Do you want to see my A-game?

53
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,610
-Can you count one to seven twice?
-Stop bringing up the IQ.

54
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,811
Please do me this favor.

55
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,681
Please count from one to seven
out loud three times.

56
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,749
Just three times.

57
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,352
SHE MAY BE CRANKY,
BUT SHE IS AMENABLE

58
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,020
How many dwarves appear in Cinderella?

59
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:01,955
Seven.

60
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,323
You must be thinking of Snow White.

61
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,691
No dwarves appear in Cinderella.

62
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,227
SHOOT, HE'S RIGHT

63
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,562
Jin-kyung, try saying
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500?

64
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,831
No, I'm not going to say a thing.

65
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,533
-Say them out loud.
-This is the last one.

66
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,069
Come on. 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500.

67
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,737
FINE, I'LL BITE

68
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,272
-What number comes after 300?
-That's 400.

69
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,441
Come on, it's 301.

70
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,543
DANG, THEY GOT ME AGAIN…

71
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,878
-One last question.
-We promise.

72
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,413
-Jin-kyung, we won't pester you with more.
-Drop it already.

73
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,749
Woo-young is in a marathon
and overtakes the third place.

74
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,784
Where does that leave Woo-young?

75
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,719
He's the runner-up.

76
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,255
-No, the third place.
-He overtook the guy in third place.

77
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,590
RIGHT… THAT'S HOW IT WORKS

78
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,826
-He replaced the guy in third place.
-Not the runner-up.

79
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,261
SHE MAY BE STUDYING
TRICK QUESTIONS

80
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,395
ON HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL SOON

81
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,599
Does any of you know
the capital of Lithuania?

82
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,535
-That came out of nowhere.
-I have no idea.

83
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,104
-Do you honestly not know?
-Is it somewhere we'd know?

84
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,173
-Where is it, Jin-kyung?
-You're a mess.

85
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,307
It's Vilnius.

86
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,575
-Where?
-Vilnius.

87
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,478
Let's give it up for Jin-kyung. Kudos.

88
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,914
-The fact that you knew that is big.
-It's truly amazing.

89
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,216
-It's Vilnius.
-Vilnius?

90
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,784
She must know all the capital cities.

91
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,086
What about the capital of Luxembourg?

92
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,454
That's enough, Chucky.

93
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,923
TSK

94
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,826
AFTER A LENGTHY RIDE

95
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,562
THE MINIBUS REACHES
ITS DESTINATION

96
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,464
Gosh, we're here.

97
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,533
-Is this it?
-This is a hotel district.

98
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,838
WHERE DID THE HARD-EARNED
ADDRESS DIRECT THEM TO?

99
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,575
Hello.

100
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,043
-Hello.
-Notice the scent?

101
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,645
-Oh, my.
-Nice aroma welcomes you in fancy hotels.

102
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,613
-The front desk.
-Oh, wow.

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,848
I think there's a term for that.

104
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,251
-About maintaining the scents?
-Was it scentscaping?

105
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,786
-Hello.
-Hello.

106
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,687
Hello.

107
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,622
-The reservation's made under your name.
-Yeah.

108
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,657
-You should talk to them, then.
-Let's go.

109
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,527
Is there a reservation
made under the name of Kim Sook?

110
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,495
-Under Ms. Kim Sook, ma'am?
-Yes.

111
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,665
Thank you for the identification.

112
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,435
-Here is your key.
-Really? That worked.

113
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,036
-Is it her usual room?
-Look.

114
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,505
-Your room's all set for you.
-We've got the key.

115
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,941
Gosh, it's made of wood. Let's go.

116
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,278
-Goodness, what on earth?
-Was the 26th floor always so high up?

117
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,713
Man, this is amazing.

118
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,081
It's so beautiful here.

119
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:08,982
Hey, we're here.

120
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,383
-Gosh, this is it.
-Is that right?

121
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,485
Wow, it opened.

122
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,153
OPENS THE DOOR CAREFULLY
WITH FLUTTERING HEART

123
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,891
I want to spend
the last day of my life here.

124
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,293
-Oh, wow.
-Look at that.

125
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,395
-What's all this?
-Gosh, what an amazing view.

126
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,066
COME JOIN US FOR THE TOUR
OF A 5-STAR HOTEL SUITE IN BUSAN

127
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,369
-What have we got here?
-It's lovely.

128
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,637
Isn't this too much?

129
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,672
A SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM
GREETS YOU

130
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,141
-Gosh, that's Namhang Bridge.
-We crossed it earlier.

131
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,778
-What do we do?
-It's an oceanside view.

132
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,713
AMAZING VIEW OF YEONGDO

133
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,048
Gosh, the chills.

134
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,750
It's so pretty here.

135
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,086
Jin-kyung, we'd be doomed
without these windows, wouldn't we?

136
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,222
You bet. We'd be in huge trouble.

137
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,124
CACKLING

138
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,426
We could've had a serious situation.

139
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:57,063
This hotel is really fabulous.

140
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,532
All so clean and neat.

141
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,501
-It's my cup of tea.
-Let's look around.

142
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,869
Shall we check out the bedrooms?

143
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,805
Gosh, the corridor goes on forever.

144
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,944
A COMFORTABLE BEDROOM WITH THE
BONUS OF THE VIEW OF THE OCEAN

145
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,715
They even have workout machines.

146
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,517
-Come look at this.
-Oh, my.

147
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,485
-Incredible.
-It's insane.

148
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,321
-We have our little gym here.
-What?

149
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,489
-This place is something.
-Hold on.

150
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,291
Look at the bath here.

151
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,759
We've got our own spa here.

152
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,628
LUXURIOUS BATHROOM

153
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,929
All five of us can fit in there.

154
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,964
This is the best feature.

155
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,099
-Oh, my.
-It's incredible.

156
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,968
DON'T WE ALL GAZE AT THE OCEAN
AS WE BATHE OURSELVES?

157
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,137
SO WIDE AND SPACIOUS

158
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,708
-Think about the things we can do here.
-I know.

159
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,910
-How does lower-body bathing sound?
-Lower-body bathing?

160
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,246
Gosh, the ocean is right below us.

161
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,415
Try sitting like this. It's amazing.

162
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,983
HUDDLED TOGETHER

163
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,454
This is as grand as Jin-kyung's place.

164
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,823
CRACKS UP

165
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,725
This is what I call a masterpiece.

166
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,859
THANK GOODNESS WE DID THIS SHOW

167
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,462
Let me introduce where we are at.

168
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,966
This is a brand-new, five-star hotel
located in Seo-gu, Busan.

169
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,002
It belongs to the high-end brand
of Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts,

170
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,338
one of the largest global hotel chains.

171
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:16,042
We're in the first hotel
of the brand to open in Korea.

172
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,479
-So this is a famous global brand.
-I didn't know it was a branch.

173
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,049
It is highly accessible from Gimhae
International Airport and Busan Station,

174
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,284
making the hotel ideal
for your stay in Busan.

175
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,552
That's neat.

176
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,256
I'd love to stay here
if I visit Busan for pleasure.

177
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,759
-The restaurant seemed fancy too.
-I just love the view.

178
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,396
The hotel is situated near Songdo Beach,
the first to receive national designation.

179
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,798
Another prominent feature
is its panoramic view of the ocean

180
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,366
including popular attractions.

181
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,602
You can also see
the full stretch of Namhang Bridge.

182
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,605
Rooms facing Yeongdo
even offer the view of the sunrise.

183
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,675
-It is famous for its spectacular view.
-The view of the sunrise in Busan is rare.

184
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,544
Today's theme

185
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,080
-is Besties Trip, right?
-That's right.

186
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,948
I don't think we demonstrated
close friendship so far.

187
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,250
None at all.

188
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,686
Show us your close bond
and all of you can spend the night here.

189
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,989
-See? I told you.
-Don't be like that.

190
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,425
-Stop messing with us.
-If we fail, do we sleep on the streets?

191
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,561
Wait, where else are we sleeping
if we can't spend the night here?

192
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,629
My parents' place?

193
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,063
The alternative can be seen from here.

194
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,598
Must we leave the building?

195
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,067
Could you stand up for a second, Sae-ho?

196
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,469
-Me?
-Yes.

197
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,371
Could you check the window behind you?

198
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,072
-Stand before the curtains.
-Okay.

199
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,140
Pull them aside.

200
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,074
We're facing the ocean.

201
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,810
-Can you see the bridge?
-Yeah.

202
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,045
-Do you see the red block?
-Yeah, there is one.

203
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,581
-Part the curtains.
-Look over there.

204
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,850
-Dang it.
-What are you playing at?

205
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,585
Don't be absurd, okay?

206
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,520
You want us to sleep out there in tents?

207
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,489
-It's bound to be windy.
-No doubt.

208
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,258
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AREA

209
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,794
THE EARLY-MARCH SEA BREEZE
MAY STILL BE COLD

210
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,964
At least one of us will be here
to look down, right?

211
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,867
The ones who end up there
will feel like crap.

212
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,303
-The sea breeze will be harsh.
-What if…

213
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,805
-You're downright nasty.
-The arrangement…

214
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,106
If I sleep outside tonight…

215
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,842
I'm shooting
Two Days and One Night this week,

216
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,277
so I'll be sleeping outside
the whole week.

217
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,812
If that's too much, drop that show.

218
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,214
What do you think you're doing?

219
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,582
If it's too much of a burden…

220
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,816
When have I ever said that?

221
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,651
I only said both shows
may have me sleep outside.

222
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,053
-With a grin?
-Isn't it exciting?

223
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,621
Feel free to sleep outside tonight.

224
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,790
-What?
-I said you could sleep outside tonight.

225
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,291
I only meant I'm ready to do my best.

226
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,894
Was it after the shoot
for the first teaser trailer?

227
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,864
Jin-kyung offered me advice
in a very earnest tone.

228
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,931
"Director Park."

229
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,201
"The penalties this time around
have to be insanely harsh."

230
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,936
It's all because of her.

231
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,240
She practically begged me
to prepare ones that will make anyone go,

232
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,609
-"That's so brutal."
-What is wrong with her?

233
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,545
Aren't we all professionals here?

234
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,181
Are you a bunch of amateurs?

235
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,682
What's that supposed to mean?

236
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,018
Weren't you the one
who refused to zip-line?

237
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,621
SHE'S ALL TALK

238
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,023
We're not here
for a free vacation, are we?

239
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,691
LOL

240
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,960
-Do you think you can sleep outside?
-You're making no sense.

241
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,095
We should play by the book.

242
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,364
-Earlier in the zip-line course…
-Who gave you the right

243
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,765
to make those suggestions?

244
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,068
She always says things like that
after she's had drinks.

245
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,437
THAT'S WHY WE PREPARED THE TENT

246
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,740
We'll now begin playing games

247
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,876
that will decide
how many can stay in the hotel suite.

248
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,546
-Out there…
-It's a team game, then.

249
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,115
We can't go out dressed like this.

250
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,483
Where could I go, then?

251
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,586
You three… You, Woo-jae,
can make it work at a nightclub.

252
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,488
The clubbers will adore you.

253
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
HE COULD GET A JOB TOO

254
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,458
About us three.
I saw some music houses down the street.

255
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,727
Don't we look like we're here to perform?

256
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,362
I could rap…

257
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,730
-I can do well.
-…he can play keyboards…

258
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,365
-I have some magic tricks.
-You could do that.

259
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,601
-We'd be a multi-genre band.
-Exactly.

260
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,004
-Let's start the team game.
-Some of us must leave?

261
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,806
Its rules can't be simpler.

262
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,609
We have prepared five games,

263
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,746
and the more you succeed,
the more of you can stay in the suite.

264
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,082
-The number of our successes?
-If we win all five games,

265
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,251
-we can all sleep here.
-Oh, okay.

266
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,254
Should I sabotage the team game
and do my best later?

267
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,023
Come on, dude.

268
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,359
Seriously, what is the matter with you?

269
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,228
Your whole mindset is just…

270
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,531
What about it? I might not get to stay
despite my efforts.

271
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,199
-Others may benefit.
-Even so.

272
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,636
We have to do our best on the off chance
of winning all five games.

273
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,705
One day,
someone will expose his rotten character.

274
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,674
-He's always been that way.
-It's no fun to have all of us stay here.

275
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,210
All of us sleeping in peace
can also work nicely, can't it?

276
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,578
We can do this.

277
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,146
-Oh, man…
-Are you ready?

278
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,082
Let's work a miracle tonight.

279
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,583
-We can do that.
-Let's try it.

280
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,485
Let's proceed with the games.

281
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,420
Everyone, you can win and save yourselves.

282
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,688
Everything will be fine then.

283
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,690
It's all good if we do well
or if I avoid the penalty.

284
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,993
Here's your first game.

285
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,495
You know each other inside and out,

286
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,897
and you have a strong bond between you.

287
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,332
SCOFFS

288
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,334
-It's already clear that we lost.
-Since that's the case,

289
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,836
this will be a cakewalk.

290
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,272
This is Guess the Survey Results.

291
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,274
We have a shot at winning.

292
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,311
This sounds similar to the game
involving calls during the Heir Audition.

293
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,646
-Yeah.
-You could say that.

294
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,381
-Here's an example.
-I like our odds.

295
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,082
Let's say the theme is

296
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,285
"the person least likely to mind
price tags when out shopping."

297
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,688
You'll be given ample time
to discuss the possibilities

298
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,691
-before sharing your expected results.
-Okay.

299
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,193
Tell me. How are the themes selected?

300
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,231
As for the themes,

301
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,066
you can select them yourselves.

302
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,368
In that case, hypothetically,

303
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,272
we can decide on our ranks first
and select themes that are likely

304
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,409
to give us the outcome we desire, right?

305
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,345
-We could shape the results.
-Yeah, it's all up to us.

306
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,148
Please note that
surveys on the themes you select

307
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,383
will be carried out
on the fans of our show.

308
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,152
-Really?
-Where are our fans?

309
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,054
They're waiting for us
in an open chat room.

310
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,289
THE FANS ARE READY
FOR SURVEYS TO BEGIN

311
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,092
IMPROMPTU SURVEY CHATROOM
FOR SCREWBALLS

312
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,629
THE SURVEY THEMES ARE
SELECTED BY OUR CAST

313
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,230
-Let's give it a go.
-Yeah.

314
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,632
Okay, shall we choose one now?

315
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,101
You may begin discussing the themes.

316
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,105
-Go for something simple.
-Don't think of joining the chatroom.

317
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,907
-I was just checking the time.
-Really?

318
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,177
What do you mean?
I clearly saw you type in Screwballs.

319
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,211
Where's your team spirit?

320
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,113
-Even so.
-We're on the same side.

321
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,381
Still, that's not right.

322
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,983
BEING A JERK AS USUAL
EVEN IN BUSAN

323
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,485
Let's choose a simple one.

324
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,088
For example,
"Who would make the finest kimchi?"

325
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,956
Then, Jin-kyung is bound to come in first.

326
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:08,094
-But we can't predict the rest.
-It's a gray area.

327
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,994
How's this?

328
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,964
"The person likely to stay
in the broadcasting industry the longest."

329
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,899
-That's too difficult.
-It's way too hard.

330
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,303
How's this? "The person likely
to sing best in a live performance."

331
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,905
I think I can see the results.
First, Woo-young. Next, Woo-jae.

332
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,373
Third, Sook. Fourth, Me.

333
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,641
Fifth, Jin-kyung.

334
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,678
Why am I in last place?

335
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,247
-But that's a valid take.
-No one's contradicted him.

336
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,415
That's the vibe I'm going for.

337
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,250
Shouldn't it be more specific?

338
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,720
For example, "the person who would've had
their first romance the latest."

339
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,156
It's fun, but it's difficult for us
to predict the results.

340
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,392
-Not for me.
-Okay, then. Let's hear your take.

341
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,794
Who's in first place?

342
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,329
You married your first love.

343
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,563
That's true.

344
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,632
YONGSAN'S HUGH GRANT
IS HAPPY TO BE IN LAST PLACE

345
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,733
I DID GREAT, RIGHT?

346
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,235
YEAH, DUDE

347
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,469
You met your love late.

348
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,871
That's true.

349
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,973
This should give us
pretty accurate results.

350
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,175
Let's ask them to rank us
based on our looks.

351
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,877
I think that's pretty predictable.

352
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,345
-Let's roll with that.
-Then…

353
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,013
To be honest, I don't…

354
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,815
-Let's use that one.
-To think I suggested it…

355
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,417
-Still, that puts me in fifth place.
-Just a second.

356
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,620
-Pretty accurate, huh?
-Let's use that theme.

357
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,622
-The first place…
-I think it will be Woo-jae.

358
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,323
-I think it'll be Woo-young.
-Me too.

359
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,658
But that's… Darn it.

360
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,894
I'll probably be in fifth…
I mean, I'll likely rank low.

361
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,495
-I want a neat--
-No.

362
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,397
I'll join you there.

363
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,900
-No way.
-I'll be right there with you.

364
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,001
I'll join you too.

365
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:22,968
Stop it.

366
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,071
I'm sorry to pick at your words,
but why do you say you're "joining" me?

367
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,308
HEH-HEH

368
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,210
OOPS

369
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,212
Woo-young would get first place.

370
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,381
-I don't think--
-That's for sure.

371
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,483
-Woo-jae's good-looking too.
-Woo-young gets first place.

372
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,252
-I'll take fifth place.
-If I may cut in,

373
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,255
you'd be fighting over first place
on any other occasion.

374
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,124
Is it because of the threat
of sleeping outside?

375
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,027
It's strange to hear you say
you couldn't be best-looking.

376
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,695
-Sure, this is serious.
-On any other shoot,

377
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,332
we'd be showing attitude
and pointing fingers at each other.

378
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,733
We'd be yanking each other's hair.

379
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,168
Sae-ho would've tried this move.

380
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,003
-To be honest--
-Sleeping outside changed it.

381
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,072
To be honest…
I don't mean to cause discomfort,

382
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,974
but I'm not an ugly-looking guy.

383
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,108
-What?
-What on earth…

384
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,878
-If… I'll be honest with you.
-Why are you laughing?

385
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,414
-You just caused us discomfort.
-If camping wasn't in the picture,

386
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,883
I'll be honest and say
that I'm the best-looking woman.

387
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,551
-Umm, okay.
-"The best-looking woman"?

388
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,153
-Sorry, Sook.
-Out of you two?

389
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,622
LOL

390
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,291
-Wherever we go--
-Guys, let me tell you something.

391
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,194
People come up to tell me
that I'm in my glow-up era.

392
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,829
I'll support that claim.

393
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,564
After her under-eye fat transfer…

394
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,500
-Don't forget the 600 shots.
-…and the 600 shots of Ulthera,

395
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,469
her cheeks are now so firm
and so well-lifted.

396
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,205
-The skin-lifting treatment did wonders.
-The tension is amazing.

397
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,041
Do you really want to find out
who's the prettiest?

398
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,576
Get a two shot of us.

399
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,078
Three, two, one.

400
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,012
We've got a situation.

401
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,946
THEY'RE NECK AND NECK

402
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,215
Okay. Let's try this theme
in a bonus round.

403
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,452
-What about a practice drill?
-Okay, it'll be a practice run.

404
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,655
We'll decide our ranks among us
and check out our fan's input too.

405
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,123
I can't wait to hear their ideas.

406
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,561
Let's take this as an opportunity
to learn about our fans in the chatroom.

407
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,997
Okay. Your seats will represent ranks.

408
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,000
Sae-ho's seat should be first place
for our viewers' comfort.

409
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,002
-Sae-ho, come on out.
-What?

410
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,303
-I see.
-That's the top spot.

411
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,938
-Who should be first place?
-Go, Woo-young.

412
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,740
This is too much pressure.

413
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,943
I think I should take
either third or fourth place.

414
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,979
No, no. The competition
to take fourth place is fierce.

415
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,214
-Wait--
-It's intense.

416
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,950
Can't you see us three squabbling
to take fourth place?

417
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,253
But this isn't the real thing.
It's a bonus round.

418
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,155
-That's true.
-I'll take second place, then.

419
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,290
How come?

420
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,091
Because I obviously deserve it.

421
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,694
No, Jin-kyung. I don't think so.

422
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,930
-Come join us.
-What do you mean?

423
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,398
Come here, Jin-kyung.

424
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,566
I don't get why you think
you should get third place.

425
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,001
I'll take the last spot, nice and neat.

426
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,169
-Okay, then.
-Let's try this.

427
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,237
Is this really it?

428
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,672
I don't think this is it.

429
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,875
By the way,
I know I brought out this theme,

430
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,843
but this leaves
a bitter taste in my mouth.

431
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,513
-Guys, let's try this version for now.
-Okay.

432
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,448
-Let's roll.
-First off,

433
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,185
let's check out our fans' response
to learn their way of thinking.

434
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,553
Oh, wow.

435
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,455
-What's wrong?
-Must be unexpected results.

436
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,326
I think it may be possible for Sae-ho
to secure second or third place.

437
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,861
-Me?
-Jin-kyung might've gotten first place.

438
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,762
Yeah, exactly.

439
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,097
-Me?
-Yes, you.

440
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,167
-We might've ranked low.
-Sure, that's possible.

441
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,003
That closes the votes.

442
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,272
-It's just a practice run.
-Yeah, let's relax.

443
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,773
Don't take the results personally.

444
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,809
-Of course not.
-The results won't cost us anything.

445
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,110
We agreed on this placement.

446
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,144
Let's hear it.

447
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,014
I'll start from the top.

448
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,283
The results may have been impacted

449
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,353
-by whose fans turned up more today.
-That's true.

450
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,388
The first place needn't be so delighted,

451
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,157
-and the last place needn't despair, okay?
-Exactly.

452
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,393
First place goes to Woo-young. Congrats.

453
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,495
-As it should be, right?
-Guys.

454
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,897
We should've asked
to have this theme count.

455
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,467
-I think our predictions are right.
-Well, I am the hottest here.

456
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,835
-That's true.
-Just sit back down.

457
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,403
Let's move on to second place.

458
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,273
-I don't think it's you, Woo-jae.
-Me neither.

459
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,542
-I told you, didn't I?
-Congratulations, Sook.

460
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,146
See? I told you
that I was in my glow-up era.

461
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,416
-It's like I said. It's my prime.
-Gosh, the results are accurate.

462
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,386
I've had a major glow-up
with massive cosmetic procedures.

463
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,553
Our fans are objective.

464
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,224
That took Jin-kyung by surprise.

465
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,525
What happened to your prediction?

466
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,395
It's not too late yet, Jin-kyung.
Where do you think you should go?

467
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,232
Move. Go on.

468
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,167
-This doesn't seem right.
-You can stay there.

469
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,703
-What on earth?
-Stay where you are.

470
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,039
I'll now announce third place.

471
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,640
Congratulations, Woo-jae.

472
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,909
HE MAY BE A JERK, BUT HE'S GOT
GOOD LOOKS BEFITTING A MODEL

473
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,977
AND A SENSE OF HUMOR

474
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,712
How about we form a club for hot people?

475
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,147
CUTTING TIES IMMEDIATELY

476
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,315
Must we associate ourselves
with ugly people?

477
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,117
You shouldn't be trying to move up.

478
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,819
-I think…
-Hey, Jin-kyung.

479
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,821
Think again.
Are you sure that's your spot?

480
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,322
Shall we swap places?

481
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,957
-That's not necessary.
-Move.

482
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,292
-Come on.
-I'm serious.

483
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,994
I should consider my image.

484
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,230
-Look, Woo-jae is gloating.
-I think it's best for us

485
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,499
-to keep voicing our opinions.
-Wait.

486
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,437
-We should analyze the results.
-That's my point.

487
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,807
-We totally should do that.
-We have to understand the fans

488
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,909
-currently in the chatroom.
-We must figure them out.

489
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,912
I think we have a lot of Sook's fans
in the chatroom.

490
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,513
Yeah, a bunch of my fam must be there.

491
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,148
I'll announce fourth place.

492
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,351
Congratulations on placing fourth,

493
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,187
-Jin-kyung.
-So it was Jin-kyung.

494
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,492
I can't believe that actually relieves me.
Damn it.

495
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,893
What do I do?

496
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,529
I was hoping for small surprises,
but there was none.

497
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,099
Goodness, Sae-ho.

498
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,934
I just took a glance,

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,969
and I can see crashing waves beside you.

500
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,504
-What?
-I can picture that.

501
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,773
-What, me being out there?
-Yeah.

502
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,475
The vision just got clear and vivid.

503
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,710
I can see those waves.

504
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,846
-You married your first love.
-That's true.

505
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,647
WHO CARES ABOUT THE RANKS?

506
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,450
-And now…
-Let's go into the main event.

507
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,953
-Let's forget about this.
-Shake off any negativity.

508
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,121
Go ahead and smile, Jin-kyung.

509
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,023
-We learned how the game goes.
-Don't be like that, Jin-kyung.

510
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,259
-It's all for fun.
-I think we should post a notice

511
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,795
-in the open chatroom.
-A notice for what?

512
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,298
-Ask them to be as objective as possible…
-Oh, I'll do that.

513
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,001
-…when considering the theme.
-Ask them to forget about their biases.

514
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,903
If it's not too much trouble,

515
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,640
let's ask them to forget about
who their favorites are

516
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,308
and rank us on our looks again.

517
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,477
-Seriously?
-Think about it.

518
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,346
-Isn't it fun?
-Don't be like that.

519
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,214
Do you want to be hurt twice?

520
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,816
That won't change things for you.

521
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,917
But you'll rank higher.

522
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,352
But not you.

523
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,420
YOUR APPEAL HAS BEEN DENIED

524
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,321
Can't we try it again?

525
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,789
-We'll begin the main game…
-All right.

526
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,859
Please let the practice run go.
Let's forget about it.

527
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,828
-But why? I had fun.
-How could we forget it?

528
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,230
Did I feel that way because I ranked high?

529
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,932
I love being in the middle.

530
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,334
Please select a theme. Any ideas?

531
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,171
Why don't we select one
where we can recreate the results?

532
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,473
Our goal is
not to have to spend the night outside.

533
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,774
Can you give me an example?

534
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,144
"The person you want to
have a date with this weekend."

535
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,246
-I like the idea.
-Woo-jae will rank higher, then.

536
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,015
He'll probably get first place.

537
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,383
You'll probably place second.

538
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,218
No, that would be a long shot.

539
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,687
Anyone who'd want to date me
would be significantly older.

540
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,957
How's this? "The person likely
to have been popular in school."

541
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,358
I like the idea.

542
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,027
-Woo-young would place first.
-It's good.

543
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,195
-Then Woo-jae.
-Yeah.

544
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,063
Next would be you.

545
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,998
-Then me and him.
-I wasn't popular in school.

546
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,633
Let's sit in that order.

547
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,868
Updating your seats as you go?

548
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,604
-Just the theme, pretty much.
-You debuted as a high schooler.

549
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,172
I bet you were popular. Let's swap places.

550
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,807
No, we can keep our seats.

551
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,409
-But Jin-kyung--
-No, we can't.

552
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,277
Wait, why is no one talking to Sae-ho?

553
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:16,448
Sook, here's the thing. I don't think
people see me as a former popular kid.

554
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,618
A VIGOROUS DISCUSSION ON RANKS
EXCEPTING FIFTH PLACE

555
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,753
Popularity among the opposite sex?
That'd be you, Woo-jae.

556
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,622
I vote Woo-jae or Jin-kyung.

557
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,658
-Yeah, I see Jin-kyung getting many votes.
-Wait, Woo-young…

558
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,194
Again, guys.
Why aren't you mentioning Sae-ho?

559
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,196
-You added a romantic context.
-Why would we bother?

560
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,400
No, I'm placing Woo-young before Woo-jae.
Being a good dancer earns you points.

561
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,835
ONE GUY'S SEAT
REMAINS UNAFFECTED

562
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,637
Let's try it out like this.

563
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,639
CRACKING UP

564
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,242
Sae-ho, give us your input.

565
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,078
-I wasn't an unpopular kid.
-Of course not.

566
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,346
-Who are we talking about?
-Me.

567
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,380
Sure, we get it.

568
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,982
I received love letters too.

569
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,050
We get it, okay? Just stay there.

570
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,885
Maybe they were chain letters.

571
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,754
-Like what?
-"Send copies of this letter for luck…"

572
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,089
No, it wasn't like that.

573
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,492
Let's talk about something else
while our fans cast their votes.

574
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,495
I don't want you to feel downhearted
because of the earlier results.

575
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,331
You received messages of support, Sae-ho.

576
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,467
"Sae-ho, I didn't vote for you
because you're married."

577
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,735
-Yeah.
-Thought so.

578
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,902
That's one.

579
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,638
-They had their reasons.
-Is it the only one?

580
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,440
No, we've got another one here. "Sae-ho."

581
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,543
"I don't see you receiving many votes,
so I'm giving you my sympathy vote."

582
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,113
Wait, what's this?

583
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,815
-You didn't have to read that one.
-Hold on.

584
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,783
What are you playing at?

585
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,153
Shouldn't an old hand like you be able
to see what's appropriate and what's not?

586
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,891
I mean, it's the basics.
He's had years of experience.

587
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,559
-Hold it in.
-But it's just…

588
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,161
-Right, he's our showrunner.
-You're a newlywed.

589
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,429
-As a peer…
-You're married now.

590
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,830
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-You have a loving wife.

591
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,300
-Rise above.
-Don't take it personally.

592
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,336
That fan is such a delight.
They're so witty.

593
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,605
Here's one for Jin-kyung.
"I can't seem to forget

594
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,840
how cute you looked
wearing a beret in your 20s."

595
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,575
-See?
-Wait, let's make changes.

596
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,244
You and I should swap places.

597
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,779
-No way, Sook.
-I'm being earnest.

598
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,848
-You were so cute back in the day.
-Here's the thing, Jin-kyung.

599
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,584
-The graduation photos… Take my place.
-We're talking about our school days.

600
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,620
I don't think that's wise.

601
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,754
No, it's a good call.

602
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,956
Why is Sae-ho sitting miles apart from us?

603
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,058
Don't worry about it.

604
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,960
-Are you attached to the sofa?
-Here's my take.

605
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,996
-I see Sook on a higher rank.
-No, no.

606
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,298
-Let's try our luck like this.
-Okay, let's roll.

607
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,968
I'll now announce the results.

608
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,905
On "the person likely to have been popular
among the opposite sex in school…"

609
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,107
WILL THEY SECURE A SPOT
IN THE HOTEL SUITE?

610
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,444
SOURCES: THE CAST

611
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,347
WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?

612
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,781
…your predictions are correct.

613
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,916
Are you serious?

614
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,452
Dang, for real?

615
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,853
-Really?
-Sure.

616
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,922
-Gosh, it's unbelievable.
-I'm getting goosebumps.

617
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,423
Sae-ho, join in on the celebration.

618
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,825
MIXED FEELINGS

619
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,827
Come on, it's a good thing.

620
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,195
What a big-hearted guy.

621
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,330
-It's a win for us.
-I can't believe we got it right.

622
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,732
Come on, Sae-ho.

623
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,735
It's incredible.
My idea to keep our original seats helped.

624
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,903
-It's just amazing.
-We got it.

625
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,006
-I came up with a good theme, right?
-Our final re-touches helped.

626
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,242
Let's all give this guy a hug.

627
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,211
SAE-HO IS LOVELY
WHEN YOU LOOK CLOSELY

628
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,012
It's all right.

629
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,281
Let me sleep in the suite, then.

630
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,917
-Come on.
-All right.

631
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,687
Sae-ho's plan
to keep it consistent worked.

632
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,390
It makes things easier for us,
especially coming up with new themes.

633
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,925
Let me apply a healing balm
over your hearts.

634
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,327
Here's a comment for Sook.

635
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,029
"I couldn't vote for Sook
because I've seen her graduation photo."

636
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,331
-See? I told you.
-That photo…

637
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,801
"With her tall frame and elegant features,
Jin-kyung must have been popular."

638
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,102
See? This is what I thought.

639
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,170
Like I said…

640
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,505
I WAS PRETTY CUTE TOO…

641
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,473
…people will think about us
when we're out of costume.

642
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,776
-Since they were asked.
-We made a solid decision.

643
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,344
PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK

644
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,846
Give me something too.
Why won't you mention me?

645
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,417
Here's one. "I think his sense of humor
would've made him a popular kid."

646
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,653
-Did you just wing it?
-No, I'm reading an actual comment.

647
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,288
It's fun. Can we have one more go?

648
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,790
No, Sook. Let's not do that.

649
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:45,957
We lucked out just now.

650
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,993
-Yeah, that was a miracle.
-Is that right?

651
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,028
At any rate,
I think you underestimated us.

652
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,030
Honestly, I didn't
expect you to get it right.

653
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,465
-We did great.
-I know.

654
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,167
That was a piece of cake.

655
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,570
-It felt like a proper trip among friends.
-Yeah.

656
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,541
We have secured this couch
for one person to sleep tonight.

657
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,410
-We earned that.
-It'd fit me perfectly, wouldn't it?

658
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,712
-Lie down.
-Nope, you're shorter than it.

659
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,115
DEAR FANS,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION

660
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,783
Let's move on to the next game.

661
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,987
Given the results so far,
no one is being evicted for the night.

662
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,457
-All of us may get to stay inside.
-I sure hope so.

663
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,424
Let's make that happen.

664
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,394
-Who says it's impossible for us?
-Yeah, let's do this.

665
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,496
-We'll say, "Go, Screwballs."
-Three, two, one.

666
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,331
-Go!
-Don't forget Screwballs.

667
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,700
WHAT A MESS

668
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,634
Three, two, one.

669
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,069
-Go, Screwballs.
-Go, Screwballs.

670
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,573
If we all get to sleep
in the suite tonight,

671
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,274
I'll give all our staff a special treat.

672
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,275
-Which is?
-What is it?

673
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,176
MY LOVE

674
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,110
SCOFFS

675
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,245
Is that a bullet of love?

676
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,816
-Goodness, I can't believe he did that.
-What was that about?

677
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,018
All the while,
one of the writers over there

678
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,421
-is wriggling like this.
-She's loving it.

679
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,822
Here's your second game.

680
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,692
It can't get easier than this,

681
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,093
and it only takes a few minutes.

682
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,730
Let us begin Human Zero.

683
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,332
I really hate this.

684
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,399
What's this game about?

685
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,168
Suppose Director Park says two.

686
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,936
If the two of us stand, we win.

687
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,172
-No, it's the opposite.
-We lose that round.

688
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,040
You got the rules wrong, dude.

689
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,275
Is it a single-round game?

690
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,276
No.

691
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,178
We'll play five rounds in total.

692
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,946
We have to win five rounds?

693
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,848
That's going to be a challenge.

694
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,483
How so?

695
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,618
Come on, that's difficult.

696
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,219
Are you sure you got the rules?

697
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,787
-Do you know this game?
-Sure.

698
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,689
He said he was giving us multiple shots.

699
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,825
Doesn't that give us the upper hand?

700
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:27,893
Not at all.

701
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,995
SHE DIDN'T GET THE RULES
AS ALWAYS

702
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,397
Can we have some time to strategize?

703
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,532
Okay.

704
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,966
HUDDLE UP

705
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,601
Are we continuing with the shoot?

706
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,304
Are we sure about staying put?

707
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,940
WHISPERING IDEAS

708
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,543
A SINGLE FAILURE, AND ONE MEMBER
MUST SLEEP OUTDOORS

709
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,677
THEY DEVISE PLANS CAUTIOUSLY

710
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,445
That's what I'm going for.

711
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,548
-Can't they hear us?
-I'm not sure about this.

712
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,715
No, we can't.

713
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,052
When I play this game,
I always name zero first.

714
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,755
Let's leave our fate
to each other's instincts.

715
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,356
Let's begin the first round.

716
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,158
Let's go through all five rounds swiftly.

717
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,427
-Okay, nice and neat.
-We won't have any breaks.

718
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,296
Three, two, one.

719
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,330
Zero.

720
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,669
THEY PASSED!

721
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,106
Come on, I gave you a hint.

722
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,243
-Still, we're the ones who made the move.
-We pulled through.

723
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,712
-Didn't we lose?
-I always stand up.

724
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,114
OH, JIN-KYUNG…

725
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,416
These two stood up.

726
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,284
-How did you play it, then?
-Don't ask.

727
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,920
-You've had one successful defense.
-We won, right?

728
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,188
I'm standing up, guys.

729
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,090
HUMAN ZERO, ROUND 2

730
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,858
Three, two, one.

731
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,793
One.

732
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,496
That doesn't count as standing up.

733
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,966
-That doesn't count as standing up.
-No.

734
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,500
BOOS AND JEERS FOLLOW

735
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,002
That's an ambiguous one, right?

736
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,472
Hey, you. Move with more certainty.
Don't make it vague and ambiguous.

737
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,107
My bad. I apologize.

738
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,009
-Let's roll with the second round.
-Let's try again.

739
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,678
Here we go.

740
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,714
PLEASE DON'T BE SO STRICT

741
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,849
Oh, man. It's so thrilling.

742
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,285
That was because I didn't know
where the lines were drawn.

743
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,253
It counts as standing
if your behind leaves the seat.

744
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,723
-Our behinds…
-Oh, we didn't realize.

745
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,058
I had no idea.

746
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,226
Guys, look.

747
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,462
See this? This counts as standing up.

748
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,564
-But not crouching down like this.
-You got it right.

749
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,698
But this counts?

750
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,733
-Yeah.
-Now I get it.

751
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,002
-This doesn't count either, got it?
-You're right again.

752
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,269
-He's good.
-Remember that.

753
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,804
How about this?

754
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,207
-That counts as standing up.
-Really?

755
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,176
So bowing counts as standing up?
I got it now.

756
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,012
-These don't count.
-All right.

757
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,080
I see how desperate you are,
so I'm giving you a do-over.

758
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,449
CURRENT STANDINGS:
1 SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE

759
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,952
ONE MEMBER HAS TO SLEEP OUTSIDE

760
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,253
IF THEY MAKE A SINGLE MISTAKE

761
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,655
Let's begin the second round.

762
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,691
Three, two, one.

763
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:40,725
Two.

764
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,827
Two.

765
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,266
Three, two, one.

766
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,234
Two.

767
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,170
SUCCESS!

768
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,206
RELIEF WASHES OVER THEM

769
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,242
This is driving me insane.

770
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,712
-Okay, you've had two successes so far.
-All right.

771
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,947
MOVING ON TO ROUND 3

772
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,049
Three, two, one.

773
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,083
One.

774
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,720
Three, two, one.

775
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:09,621
One.

776
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,523
One.

777
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,693
DELIGHTED

778
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,295
THEY SAVED EACH OTHER

779
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,497
Good job. We only have two rounds left.

780
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,933
Sae-ho, I kept wondering
about what to do until the end.

781
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,134
-Me too.
-We're doing great.

782
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,403
-We're on fire. Let's keep it up.
-We're amazing!

783
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,439
-You've had three successes so far.
-Okay.

784
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,174
HUMAN ZERO, ROUND 4

785
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,709
Three, two, one.

786
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,609
Two!

787
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,681
THIS IS INCREDIBLE

788
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,883
-I almost didn't stand up.
-My goodness.

789
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,652
WE'RE ALMOST THERE!

790
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,787
Guys, we only have the last round left.

791
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,422
Let's pull through one last time.

792
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,091
We've had four successes, right?

793
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,525
-Yes, that's correct.
-One last time.

794
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,429
From what I know of Director Park,
he'll be feeling pretty desperate.

795
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,132
So his next command
is likely five or zero.

796
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,433
Aren't I right?

797
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,837
Gosh, you must be on edge,
judging by how you're wringing your hands.

798
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,939
My observation likely rattled him.

799
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,875
-So he'll go for 2, 3, or 4.
-You're doing great, Woo-jae.

800
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,210
A FIERY MIND GAME

801
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,680
So, if we all stand up
or stay in our seats,

802
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,081
-we win this game.
-Damn straight.

803
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,950
But he can take this remark into account

804
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,487
and play yet another trick
by calling either five or zero.

805
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,690
We can win this by going for
one among two, three, or four.

806
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,624
-Sure.
-All right!

807
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,493
-We'll win.
-We as good as secured our victory.

808
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,794
Let's call it our win and move on.

809
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,496
Here's our final offer.

810
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,031
Why don't you concede
without playing the last round?

811
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,233
That makes no sense.

812
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,601
-That was manipulative.
-You're good.

813
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,836
What are you even saying?
Now, prepare for the last round.

814
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,311
Three, two, one.

815
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,212
Four.

816
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,815
Four.

817
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,184
Three, two, one. Four.

818
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,821
THEY WON!

819
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,657
WE DID IT

820
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,993
-Told you! You saw that?
-We did it!

821
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,128
See? Shaking him totally worked.

822
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,531
-Guys.
-That was a narrow escape.

823
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,599
-I let you off the hook once.
-What do you mean?

824
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,468
-I gave you a do-over.
-So what?

825
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,869
Don't be so cheap.

826
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,938
BOO, DON'T BE PETTY AND CHEAP

827
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,173
That's low even for you.

828
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,775
-How underhanded.
-You have no idea

829
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,911
-how close I was to standing up.
-Unbelievable.

830
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,712
-Don't be so petty.
-How could you…

831
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,948
-Next game, please.
-Goodness.

832
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:21,686
I was hoping to see one person stay put
and get heaps of criticism.

833
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,723
That's rich considering how you planned
this whole "Besties Trip."

834
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,259
-All right. You won the second game.
-Okay!

835
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,661
HUMAN ZERO
ENDS IN THEIR VICTORY!

836
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,563
What's gotten into us?

837
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:34,132
The chances of each of us

838
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,535
-sleeping here in the suite is at 40%.
-That's nice.

839
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,971
-My point is that we can relax a bit.
-You're right.

840
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,072
-Got it, guys?
-Yeah.

841
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,540
We're on a roll today.

842
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,209
You seem the most on edge here.

843
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,611
HE'S THE BIGGEST CHICKEN HERE

844
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,348
-We have secured two spots in the bed.
-Yeah.

845
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,517
Allow me to introduce the third game.

846
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,686
-Here's the third game.
-I want to sleep indoors.

847
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:55,987
It's jegi.

848
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,089
-I'm no good with jegi.
-This won't be easy.

849
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,691
How many times must we kick it to succeed?

850
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,527
You once tried this game
in our predecessor show.

851
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,929
We took the results back then
into account.

852
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,898
You have to kick it 20 times in total.

853
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,733
-Twenty, huh?
-Twenty times…

854
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,269
-I don't think…
-Handle ten of them, Sae-ho.

855
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,971
No, he can do better than that.

856
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,441
IS IT MY TURN TO SHINE?

857
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,543
Something like Air Force One
would be the best.

858
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,844
-Oh, wow.
-I nailed it, right?

859
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:20,979
Could I borrow one for a bit?

860
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,381
I only need your right shoe.
Thank you, Director.

861
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,717
I'll repay your kindness
by succeeding in the mission.

862
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,987
Could we practice for a bit?

863
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,055
-There'll be no time for that.
-What?

864
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,825
-But practice makes our lives better.
-But what counts is the main game.

865
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,196
We can tell you won't be any good
even at a glance.

866
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,265
Have you decided on the order?

867
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,100
-How about--
-I want to go first.

868
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,302
-Sae-ho can bring up the rear.
-But…

869
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,837
I mean, the ladies should go first.

870
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,740
I don't think I could handle
that much pressure.

871
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:52,143
Let me apologize first.
I can only kick the jegi once.

872
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,444
It's too light for my liking.

873
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,214
SAE-HO IS THEIR ONLY HOPE

874
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,249
AND YET…

875
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,785
THEY REFUSE TO HAVE
ONE OF THEIR OWN SLEEP OUTDOORS

876
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,553
Add two of these.

877
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,357
THUS BEGINS THE IMPROMPTU
JEGI CRAFTING SESSION

878
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,427
It shows how much we don't want
to sleep outside, doesn't it?

879
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,095
-I like this one.
-Let me see.

880
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,697
That's not an ideal movement.

881
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,167
Your foot should reach
this level at the very least.

882
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,670
Oh, dear. What am I looking at?

883
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,739
Good luck, Jin-kyung.

884
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,609
-You're going barefoot?
-Give her the room.

885
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,678
THE GAME FINALLY BEGINS
AFTER A LENGTHY PREPARATION

886
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,578
One.

887
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,048
WHAT'S THIS?

888
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,182
SHE'S NAILING THE FORM

889
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,483
Looking good! Just one more.

890
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,552
-One.
-Looking good! Just one more.

891
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,256
-One.
-Looking good! Just one more.

892
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,558
You were doing so well.

893
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,629
SHE SLIPPED

894
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,931
You were doing so well.

895
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,634
-You had an excellent form just now.
-Totally.

896
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,736
The last kick's force
landed on you and not the jegi.

897
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,907
-I still kicked it twice.
-Jin-kyung scored two kicks.

898
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,142
By the way, Jin-kyung,
you looked like a professional.

899
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,944
She had such a clean form.

900
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,480
-You followed Sae-ho's direction to a T.
-It flew in a perfect arc.

901
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,582
I want to kick it twice at least.

902
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,951
You don't want to kick it like this.

903
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,121
SAE-HO'S JEGI LESSON
BEGINS AGAIN

904
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,291
COULD IT WORK ITS MAGIC AGAIN?

905
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,462
-She kicked it twice!
-It brushed past my foot!

906
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,630
-You only kicked it once.
-I'm not lying. Check the footage.

907
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,898
We need a video challenge.

908
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,070
THAT COUNTS AS ONE KICK

909
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,873
-It's rather overwhelming.
-You can take it easy

910
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,242
-and score ten kicks.
-Ten kicks?

911
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,778
Wait, we can end this game
if Sae-ho can make it to 20 kicks.

912
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,014
-Take it easy.
-Damn. I'm taking my glasses off.

913
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,482
Let's clear the room for him.

914
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,950
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE, SAE-HO

915
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,285
I MUST COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE
HERE AND NOW

916
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,322
"I don't see you receiving many votes,
so I'm giving you my sympathy vote."

917
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,657
I MAY HAVE…

918
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,927
RANKED LOWEST IN TERMS OF LOOKS

919
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,298
BUT I'M THE BEST THERE IS
WHEN IT COMES TO JEGI!

920
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,138
Two. Three…

921
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,606
Oh, no. Four!

922
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,878
Oh, no. Four!

923
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,946
4 KICKS!

924
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,382
-What was that about?
-There's an issue here.

925
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,784
-This is--
-Why did you jump the gun?

926
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,253
What do you… I didn't do anything, did I?

927
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,788
TEARS

928
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:17,889
Let me check this real quick.

929
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,024
JEGI MASTER PERFORMING
A POST-MORTEM

930
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,393
This jegi… It's made wrong.

931
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,696
It seems
you pulled some tricks on our jegi.

932
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,232
There's no way we could succeed with it.

933
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,634
I'm filing a complaint.

934
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,536
We were doomed from the start.

935
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,905
-Sae-ho had four kicks, right?
-Did I manage four kicks?

936
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,573
-How many in total?
-You scored seven kicks.

937
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,874
Split 13 kicks between you guys.

938
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,546
We needn't waste time on this.
I highly doubt we could score 13 kicks.

939
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,649
-Come on, Woo-young is a dancer.
-Kick it six or seven times each.

940
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,684
I had a little chat with Woo-young,

941
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,952
and we can only manage two each.

942
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,287
-Really?
-What?

943
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,456
-But Jin-kyung scored two kicks.
-We're on her level.

944
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,559
Why don't we perform a miracle today?

945
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,329
-That's the spirit, Woo-young.
-You don't want the sea breeze.

946
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,897
Let's do this.

947
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,266
Woo-young, how many can you manage?

948
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,634
Just about two?

949
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,769
Same here.

950
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,938
EVEN SO…

951
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,639
Miracles do happen.

952
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,576
Keep your movement consistent.

953
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,045
Coordinate your moves well.

954
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,648
Hey, focus on having fun with the jegi
instead of kicking it.

955
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,184
Judging by his form, he's bound to fail.

956
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,652
What's wrong with him?

957
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,820
It's not that bad. Try it.

958
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,655
I'll take my turn.

959
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,057
-Let's do this.
-Here I go.

960
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,458
WOO-YOUNG'S ATTEMPT

961
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,796
WOO-YOUNG SCORES 2 KICKS

962
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,332
-Two kicks, right?
-You spent ten minutes in preparation.

963
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,534
Why did you take that out?

964
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,202
-How many in total?
-I love the design.

965
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,138
-Is it nine?
-You had nine kicks in total.

966
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,473
We had only nine kicks
among the four of us?

967
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,742
Woo-jae, we only need 11 more kicks.

968
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,311
ACTUALLY…

969
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,846
Recently on Hangout with Yoo,

970
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,249
I kicked the jegi seven times
for the first time in my life.

971
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,317
Wait, it was ten times.

972
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,319
Woo-jae, we only need 11 more kicks.

973
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,757
Sook, I've never managed 11 kicks
in all my 40 years of life.

974
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,260
But you know what?
I'm going to do that today.

975
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,529
That's the spirit.

976
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,963
I'm rather bored, you see.

977
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,065
I dig the energy.

978
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,234
-I'm giving it a go.
-Good luck, Woo-jae.

979
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,069
Like I said to Woo-young earlier,

980
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,404
the point isn't in kicking the jegi.

981
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,839
I need to have fun with it.

982
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,576
He looks hilarious
with that full-on smokey eye makeup.

983
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,511
Once I've had fun with it

984
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,913
and come down from that high,

985
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,648
we'll have added 11 more kicks.

986
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,083
All right. Rearrange your bangs first.

987
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,219
I'm seeing his left eye
for the first time today.

988
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,288
You've got this!

989
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,423
ONE MORE PERSON CAN SLEEP
INDOORS IF HE BREAKS HIS RECORD

990
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,091
Here I go.

991
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,327
Here I go.

992
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,162
One.

993
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,832
One.

994
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,168
WOO-JAE SCORES 1 KICK

995
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,803
THE JEGI MASTER IS DISAPPOINTED

996
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,471
You were the worst by far.

997
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,906
What on earth was that?

998
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,876
I can't believe it.
Even I did better than him.

999
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,544
I honestly gave it my all.

1000
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,946
I promise I did my best.

1001
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,015
Are you okay, Woo-young?

1002
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,751
There was no helping it.

1003
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,353
At least one of us
will be sleeping outside.

1004
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,388
Review your performances
and consider volunteering.

1005
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,923
HE-HE

1006
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,426
Please return to your seats.

1007
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,561
Let's move on to the fourth game.

1008
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:14,899
Even elementary school students
would have no trouble with this.

1009
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,234
It's a simple calculation.

1010
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,903
-A calculation problem.
-That sounds promising.

1011
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,005
But because it is so simple and easy,

1012
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,773
you only get ten seconds to see the quiz.

1013
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,642
-What if--
-How long do we get to solve it

1014
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,577
-after the ten seconds?
-You can take your time.

1015
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,548
If the question is similar
to what we've seen on the zip-line course…

1016
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,183
I mean, if it runs long,

1017
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,785
let's break it down
and memorize a part each.

1018
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,355
Jin-kyung and Sae-ho,
you can take the first half.

1019
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,490
-The three of us…
-We'll see the rest.

1020
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,058
-That's allowed, right?
-Sure.

1021
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,928
We'll need to grasp the core of the quiz.

1022
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,630
Ready.

1023
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,564
Set…

1024
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,267
Go.

1025
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,069
-Oh, dear.
-Jeez.

1026
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,204
Go.

1027
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,109
Jeez. It runs much longer than we thought.

1028
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,644
MIN-SU AND CHEOL-SU
ARE HAVING A SNACK PARTY

1029
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,746
MIN-SU WENT TO MART A
TO BUY 2 MARINE CRACKERS,

1030
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:02,813
EACH WORTH 1,300 WON…

1031
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,282
-I don't understand it.
-It's too long.

1032
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,816
-Our time is up.
-What the…

1033
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,618
-Your ten seconds are up.
-I don't think so.

1034
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,120
It's not enough to read the whole thing.

1035
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,822
-Hold on, guys.
-There's no way we can read it all.

1036
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,724
We didn't get to read the quiz in full.

1037
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,128
We get that it's an easy one.
But the issue is that it runs too long.

1038
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,298
What we have to do
is decipher the producer's intent.

1039
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,266
They only gave us ten seconds
for that huge block,

1040
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,968
so that must mean the key is at the end.

1041
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,871
By the way, was that a history quiz?

1042
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,072
-No, a math quiz.
-What on earth…

1043
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,207
Could you give us ten more seconds?

1044
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,610
We'll give you five more seconds.

1045
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,179
A TIME-OUT FOR STRATEGY BUILDING

1046
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,449
Forget about Marine Crackers
or Shrimp Crackers.

1047
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,484
We only need to focus on chocolate sticks.

1048
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,420
Cheol-su and Min-su
mess around the whole time,

1049
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,490
but the key information is the difference
in chocolate sticks they each bought.

1050
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,926
So, you can look at the end
and figure out what the producers want.

1051
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,227
Sook and Jin-kyung.

1052
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,030
Skim through the text and find out
how many each bought.

1053
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,198
Could I pull it off?

1054
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,868
Wait, what if the core question at the end
doesn't talk about the chocolate sticks?

1055
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,303
I'm certain about that part.

1056
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,105
-Really?
-Yeah, I saw "chocolate sticks."

1057
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,608
In that case, gather as much information
as you can on chocolate sticks.

1058
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,044
I'll browse the local hidden gems.

1059
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,346
Why would you do that?

1060
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,281
-For dinner--
-By any chance,

1061
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,549
can I try that?

1062
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,352
It's this technique I used as a child

1063
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,022
where I could capture the scene
and store the image in my brain.

1064
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,857
-Can I use that?
-Why didn't you use it earlier?

1065
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,093
-Is that a yes?
-Why didn't you do it before?

1066
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,262
I couldn't have done that earlier
what with all this crowd in the room.

1067
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,964
We'll give you five seconds.

1068
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,299
-Focus on chocolate sticks.
-Okay…

1069
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,768
-Ready.
-We should look at the bottom section.

1070
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,870
Go!

1071
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:33,771
"Min-su's…"

1072
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,005
"Min-su's chocolate sticks."

1073
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,508
We need information
on Min-su's chocolate sticks.

1074
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,043
Min-su's chocolate sticks!

1075
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,245
Oh, yeah? I only read the lower part.

1076
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,049
A pack cost 1,000 won. If we know how much
Min-su's cost, we'll get our answer.

1077
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,784
But one pack cost 1,000 won.

1078
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,120
Did the earlier part mention
Min-su's pack of chocolate sticks?

1079
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,654
He then felt conflicted about something.

1080
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,490
HE WONDERED IF MIN-SU
WOULD'VE BOUGHT MARINE CRACKERS…

1081
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,358
Min-su dropped by
a fried chicken place too.

1082
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,793
…OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BUY
FRIED CHICKEN…

1083
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,696
But the only info above
was on Marine Crackers.

1084
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,598
I only saw how much a fried chicken cost.

1085
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,967
We were asked to compare
how much Min-su paid for the snack

1086
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,903
and its price in a convenience store,
which is 1,000 won.

1087
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,439
We only need those two numbers
to find the answer, right?

1088
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,608
-What?
-All I read was about Marine Crackers--

1089
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,609
-I got it.
-Did you see it?

1090
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,711
-So, no chocolate sticks in your section?
-None.

1091
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,712
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1092
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,080
Then, the answer is 1,000 won.

1093
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,715
That's what I was trying to say.

1094
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,683
-His snack is mentioned only at the back.
-See?

1095
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,786
Min-su might not have bought
the chocolate sticks.

1096
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,687
No one bought them in the upper part.

1097
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,157
Can you say that with certainty?

1098
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,192
If you get it right,
you're sleeping indoors tonight.

1099
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,727
Yeah, I can.

1100
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:30,728
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1101
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,030
-You're sleeping outside if you're wrong.
-I don't want that.

1102
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,699
But you get to sleep here
if you get it right.

1103
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,600
Okay.

1104
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,502
But you're leaving if you get it wrong.

1105
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,538
It's a risk.

1106
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,772
It's risky.

1107
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,107
-How so?
-I don't want it.

1108
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,309
Did your photographic memory skill work?

1109
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,944
Wait, the thing is…

1110
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,913
-I meant to use it.
-Yeah?

1111
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,414
But it only works with images in color.

1112
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,782
The text was in black and white.

1113
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,517
-Jeez.
-This is so difficult.

1114
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,852
-What a lame excuse.
-Excuse me.

1115
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,887
-What is it?
-Would you like an extra second?

1116
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,322
Okay. Wait, just one second?

1117
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,924
Give us three seconds. Even then…

1118
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,126
To be honest, we could fail
even with ten seconds.

1119
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,061
I'll take up your offer.

1120
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,362
Hey, Jin-kyung.

1121
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,364
-This can be…
-Read just this part.

1122
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,434
-Sook, read this much.
-Got it.

1123
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,603
-You can take the middle, Sae-ho.
-Okay.

1124
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,239
The fourth section is yours.
Got it, Woo-young?

1125
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,842
-I'll check one of the four sections.
-Okay.

1126
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,410
We'll give you one second.

1127
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:21,879
Ready.

1128
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,781
Set.

1129
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,785
Go.

1130
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,220
Chocolate sticks, 2,000 and…

1131
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,055
-I saw it up there!
-How much was it?

1132
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,824
-I didn't catch the hundreds part.
-It must be 2,700 won!

1133
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,392
I'm sure it was 2,700 won!

1134
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,429
-Are you sure?
-I can explain why I thought that.

1135
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,600
I caught 1,700 won multiplied by something
and 2,700 won multiplied by 3.

1136
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,135
If that's what Sook saw,
Min-su must've paid 2,700 won a pack.

1137
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,708
No, wait. If 3 packs cost him 2,700 won,

1138
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,276
-each cost him 900 won.
-Hold on.

1139
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,512
I think it said he bought 3 packs
at 2,700 won each.

1140
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,248
Could 2,700 won have been
the total cost like you said?

1141
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,583
Wouldn't 2,700 won have been
the total cost of 3 packs?

1142
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,487
Do you remember where you saw
the mention of the snack?

1143
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,855
It was in the third line.

1144
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,358
Then, it's not 2,700 won. The first line…

1145
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,862
I mean, I caught "Marine Crackers,"
"2,700 won," and "1,700 won" there.

1146
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,697
The number I remember
wasn't on the third line.

1147
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,132
MARINE CRACKERS:
2,700 WON, 1,700 WON

1148
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,200
CHOCOLATE STICKS: 2,*00 WON

1149
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,402
An innocent children's quiz would suggest

1150
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,306
that the children be good friends
and share the snacks.

1151
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,375
I'M GOING TO IGNORE HIM

1152
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:29,580
If 2,700 won is indeed the total cost
of buying 3 packs of chocolate sticks,

1153
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,416
each pack cost him 900 won.
So the answer is 100 won.

1154
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,118
Are we agreed? Let's move on.

1155
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,721
If Sae-ho is right and Min-su bought
3 packs, each costing him 2,700 won,

1156
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,723
then our answer is 1,700 won.

1157
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,359
I was observing
Director Park's face just now.

1158
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,228
I chose not to pay attention to you

1159
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,298
because I'm great
at thinking outside the box.

1160
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,366
-That's why I was eyeing him.
-Okay.

1161
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,834
CHUCKY TOOK A CREATIVE APPROACH

1162
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,469
OF STUDYING
THE MAIN PRODUCER'S FACE

1163
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,772
When you first mentioned 100 won…
That was it, wasn't it?

1164
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,107
He was visibly shaken then.

1165
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,176
His gaze betrayed him.

1166
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,612
Okay. But guys, hear me out.

1167
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,681
We might have to consider 2,400 won.

1168
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,883
He might've bought 3 packs for 2,400 won.

1169
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,885
In that case, we should roll with that.

1170
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:12,089
I saw 2,700 won on the first line.
I'm sure of that.

1171
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,290
Yeah, it was way up there.

1172
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,727
Hey, Sae-ho. Let's say Min-su
paid 2,400 won for 3 packs.

1173
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,495
-In that case…
-The answer is 200 won.

1174
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,563
Exactly.

1175
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,599
So, the answer should be…

1176
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,169
Based on what we've discussed so far,
it's either 100 won or 200 won.

1177
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,873
Let's go with 200 won.

1178
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,008
IF THEY GET IT WRONG,

1179
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,278
ONE MORE CAST MEMBER
MUST SLEEP FACING THE OCEAN

1180
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,515
He smiled ever so slightly
when you mentioned 200 won.

1181
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,285
He smiled ever so slightly
when you mentioned 200 won.

1182
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,187
I DID WHAT NOW?

1183
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,288
Is it 100 won or 200 won?

1184
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:48,192
He panicked at the mention of 100 won
and smiled at the mention of 200 won.

1185
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,728
…each pack cost him 900 won.
So the answer is 100 won.

1186
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,196
DOES HE SEEM PANICKED?

1187
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,199
We might have to consider 2,400 won.

1188
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,634
…and smiled at the mention of 200 won.

1189
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,370
IS HE SMILING HERE?

1190
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,373
Let's leave it to Woo-young.
Make your pick between 100 and 200.

1191
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,841
We'll leave it up to you.

1192
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,942
Three, two, one.

1193
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,044
Maybe it's 300 won.

1194
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,179
DO YOU WANT TO SLEEP OUTSIDE?
GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME

1195
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,415
-Try 200 won. Go on.
-Yeah. In 3, 2, 1.

1196
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,683
The answer is 200 won!

1197
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:17,321
Okay. We'll now show you the full text.

1198
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,089
IS THE ANSWER 200 WON?

1199
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:23,260
-Look, 2,900 won.
-Oh, no!

1200
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,762
…3-PACK BUNDLE
THAT COST 2,700 WON…

1201
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,630
MIN-SU'S CHOCOLATE STICKS
COST 900 WON A PACK

1202
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,631
AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE,

1203
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,066
CHOCOLATE STICKS COST
1,000 WON A PACK

1204
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,834
1,000 WON - 900 WON

1205
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,636
The answer was 100 won, damn it.

1206
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,904
It was 100 won.

1207
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,173
NO WAY

1208
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,142
The answer was 100 won, damn it.

1209
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,209
It was 100 won.

1210
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,578
The answer is 100 won.

1211
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,549
I told you he visibly panicked
when we mentioned 100 won.

1212
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,885
Couldn't these kids have just gone home?

1213
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,021
Did they have to buy all sorts of snacks

1214
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,157
and then stop by another supermarket?

1215
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,893
Must two of us sleep outside?

1216
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,195
Just one thing, though.
I hate placing blame by the end,

1217
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,330
and I rarely do so to Sook.

1218
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,899
But Sook suggested 200 won.

1219
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,801
We might have to consider 2,400 won.

1220
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,502
Yeah, that's true.

1221
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,372
-But you left me with no other choice.
-She's a camping enthusiast.

1222
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,108
You could say she's a professional.

1223
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,710
BUT I'VE NEVER TRIED CAMPING
BY BUSAN'S OCEAN

1224
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,145
Our next game
is another one-off challenge.

1225
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,582
You've played this multiple times
in our predecessor show.

1226
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,718
It's One Syllable at a Time.

1227
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,854
-What is that?
-Like movie titles…

1228
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,689
We did play this countless times.

1229
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,425
If the theme is vegetables,
we can start with beans.

1230
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,560
Find a two-syllable one.

1231
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,095
-Carrot.
-Carrot.

1232
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,329
Cabbage.

1233
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,263
-Cabbage.
-This is rough.

1234
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,799
-I want to name a two-syllable word.
-What?

1235
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,167
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1236
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,502
For your information,

1237
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,504
-you only need to finish a one-way cycle.
-Okay.

1238
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,339
The game ends with a five-syllable word.

1239
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,544
Sae-ho, can you tell me
four-syllable names of fish?

1240
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,146
-Let's begin.
-Hold on.

1241
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,714
Oh, bluefin tuna.

1242
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,915
What should I say?

1243
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,487
Pygmy sperm whale.

1244
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:57,921
IS IT FISH, THOUGH?

1245
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,723
What's a one-syllable one?

1246
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,125
I don't think there's one.

1247
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,259
Bream.

1248
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,261
I think he's clueless. Hey!

1249
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,164
-Hey, come here.
-Come join us.

1250
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,100
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ONE MORE
PERSON FACE THE OUTDOOR CAMPING

1251
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,470
We're continuing
with Besties Trip in Busan.

1252
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,239
PLEASE HELP US…

1253
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,140
Oh, please…

1254
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,543
Let's win this thing
and go enjoy dinner in high spirits.

1255
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,677
We've got this!

1256
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,679
-Go!
-Screwballs!

1257
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,515
LET'S WIN!

1258
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,387
The theme is fruit.

1259
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,955
The theme is fruit.

1260
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,657
The theme is fruit.

1261
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,025
-Pear.
-Melon.

1262
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,226
-Banana.
-Irwin mango.

1263
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,061
-Honeydew melon.
-Okay!

1264
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,063
SUCCESS!

1265
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,765
I told you, didn't I?

1266
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,368
HOORAY!

1267
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,969
I was right!

1268
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:47,838
Honeydew melon.

1269
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,240
WE DID IT AGAIN

1270
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,042
-Our last-minute plan…
-We did well.

1271
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,243
Gosh, the honeydew melon.

1272
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,578
What about fruit?

1273
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,779
Oh, there's pear.

1274
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,849
-Let's consider fruit too.
-I have a couple of themes in mind.

1275
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,751
-Our last-minute plan…
-We did well.

1276
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,353
THEY TURNED IT AROUND
WITH LAST-MINUTE PREPARATIONS!

1277
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,489
-It's insane.
-We came up with…

1278
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,891
-We made some predictions.
-We prepared for a few themes,

1279
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,393
and you chose one of them.

1280
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,328
-We thought of animals, fruit…
-And fish.

1281
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,896
-Yeah, fish.
-It's amazing.

1282
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,199
Does this mean only two of us
must camp outside?

1283
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,100
-For now.
-That's how things stand at present.

1284
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,037
Oh, let me announce the consolation match.

1285
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:21,772
THE FINAL ROUND IS
A CONSOLATION MATCH!

1286
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,041
-We can make a comeback.
-They're not so heartless.

1287
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,242
ONE MORE PERSON
MAY SLEEP INDOORS

1288
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,912
The team's fate hinges on one person.

1289
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,749
-Is he quoting from the scriptures?
-Woo-jae.

1290
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,284
-What?
-Woo-jae,

1291
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,453
please select one of the male crew members

1292
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,856
currently in this room as your opponent…

1293
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,558
-in a game of arm wrestling.
-Dang it.

1294
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,293
Only male crew members?

1295
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,028
-Yes, the female crew…
-Are they off-limits?

1296
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:45,929
Yes, they are.

1297
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:46,964
Male crew members.

1298
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,999
THEIR EYES ROAM BUSILY
TO FIND THE WEAKEST

1299
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,601
He's on the slim side.

1300
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,569
How about Director Park?

1301
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,538
All he does is edit the show indoors.

1302
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,207
I bet he rarely sees the sun.
He's gotten skinny.

1303
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,409
But I don't want to select Director Park

1304
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,144
and make him feel small.

1305
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,615
This man here is super strong.

1306
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,150
Even at a glance,
you can tell he's built like a brick.

1307
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,253
I could never beat him!

1308
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,255
There are a few more guys over there.

1309
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,191
-Guys, wait.
-Hey!

1310
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,993
THEIR SEARCH FOR THE WEAKLING
LEAVES OUT NO ONE

1311
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,160
This guy has a good arm.

1312
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,695
Where's the runaway? There he is.

1313
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,164
If Sook chased after me like that,
I'd feel so scared.

1314
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,399
Nice arms. You're out.

1315
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,569
Let me check your forearm for a second.

1316
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,337
Squeeze for me, okay?

1317
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,007
-I like our chances with him.
-Great!

1318
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,642
I once saw him struggle
with heavy equipment.

1319
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,343
LET'S WAIT FOR SECOND OPINION

1320
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,412
I think you could beat him.

1321
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,914
TEARS

1322
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,916
THE PLAYER ENTERS THE RING

1323
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,584
Hello.

1324
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,753
I'm Kwon Sun-gyu of the sound department.

1325
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:46,089
HE'S A SHY GUY

1326
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,526
Sun-gyu is the gentlest person
among the male crew.

1327
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,728
-He's the kindest one.
-And he's always so friendly.

1328
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:55,499
He's always so shy when he comes up to us
to help us get our mics set up.

1329
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,067
Yeah, I noticed that too.

1330
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,470
Both of you, place your elbows
on the table for support. Go on.

1331
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:02,673
Okay. Just a second.

1332
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,241
Are you ready?

1333
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,409
Okay. On your mark.

1334
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,644
WIN HERE TO SAVE A CASTMATE

1335
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:08,879
-Relax your arms.
-Play fair.

1336
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,648
No contesting the results.

1337
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,816
-Ready.
-Don't get hurt.

1338
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,518
TENSE ATMOSPHERE

1339
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,852
Set, go!

1340
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,055
Goodness.

1341
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,957
It's okay, Woo-jae. You're doing fine.

1342
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,292
It's okay, Woo-jae. You're doing fine.

1343
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,162
That's it. Keep at it. Bring it on home!

1344
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,165
SAVE US, WOO-JAE

1345
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,400
BATTLE CRY

1346
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,136
USING HIS WHOLE BODY
TO WIN A GAME OF ARM WRESTLING

1347
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,839
-Keep going. Go on.
-Oh, dear…

1348
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,478
HE WON!

1349
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,846
Way to go, Woo-jae!

1350
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,149
Sook, my leg is cramping.
Go on, smack it for me!

1351
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,517
Help me with the cramps!

1352
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,820
What do we do for Director Kwon?

1353
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,657
-We're so sorry.
-How can he be helped?

1354
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,959
I'm sure he threw the game on purpose.

1355
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,895
-Thank you so much.
-We appreciate it.

1356
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,431
-Let's give him a big hand.
-Thank you.

1357
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,067
What's up with him?

1358
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,435
My leg is cramping.

1359
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,005
-For real?
-Yeah, I rarely use my thigh.

1360
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,040
That doesn't sound so far-fetched for him.

1361
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,377
WOO-JAE SACRIFICED HIS THIGH
TO SAVE HIS CASTMATES

1362
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,779
-Let me explain. During the game…
-I can't believe you won.

1363
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,981
…he even used his thigh muscle
for extra support.

1364
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,283
-He used his whole body, in fact.
-Smart thinking.

1365
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,719
Kudos, Woo-jae. You were amazing.

1366
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,322
Wait.

1367
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,958
What if I get the penalty after all this?

1368
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,293
-It'd make a good laugh.
-It'd be the highlight.

1369
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,095
Hold on. Excuse me, Sun-gyu.

1370
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,096
You're a lightweight.

1371
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,500
IF YOU SAY SO…

1372
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,401
We did our best today.

1373
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,204
Let me announce the number of people
to spend the night under the bridge.

1374
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,206
The final count is one.

1375
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,877
-Do we decide who after dinner?
-Yes, we do that back here after dinner.

1376
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,813
I can only wonder
who'll have to camp outside.

1377
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,015
That would work wonderfully
as a transition point.

1378
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,818
You can show her lying on the floor
after her line just earlier.

1379
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,689
Guys, isn't that a great idea?
It'd go so well with our show.

1380
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,724
That'd be neat.

1381
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,360
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE PENALTY
AND GO ENJOY DINNER

1382
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,831
Give it a good spin!

1383
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,902
The person who's chosen here
will have to sleep outdoors.

1384
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,004
WHO WILL BE FORCED OUT
OF THE 5-STAR HOTEL

1385
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,539
INTO THE HUMBLE TENT OUTSIDE?

1386
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,707
AND THAT IS…

1387
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,942
Oh, no!

1388
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,611
Okay! Hong Jin-kyung!

1389
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,118
ENJOY THE HIGHLIGHTS
AND THE BTS CLIPS
