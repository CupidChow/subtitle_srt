1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,303
-We've only heard her voice so far.
-That's right.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,771
HOME OF WOO-YOUNG'S LOVING FAMILY

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,240
-Today's theme is "Besties Trip in Busan."
-"Besties Trip"?

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,242
Today may be therapeutic.

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,977
He's my mom's least favorite.

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,645
THEY GOT OFF TO A ROCKY START

7
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,947
Rice puffs.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,582
I've been meaning to say that!

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,051
Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup.

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,320
Did you really have to say that?

11
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,956
WHEN THEY STARTED TO DOUBT
THAT THEY WERE BESTIES…

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,558
For the next leg of our journey,
we'll split into two teams.

13
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,060
Your first option is trekking.

14
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,661
-Your second option is riding.
-Riding.

15
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,464
-Let's depart for the next segment.
-Okay.

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,432
TREKKERS, RIDERS

17
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,436
We'll take off
for our next destination shortly,

18
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,205
and we'll drop off the trekkers
on our way.

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,409
-Hear that? We're driving onward.
-That's what we'll do first.

20
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,877
They get a lift.

21
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,545
-I knew it.
-You three will regret it soon.

22
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,983
Remember what they did with our meal?
There may be a twist with our task too.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,584
-He's got a point.
-Don't jinx it.

24
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,254
-You'll be burnt out by the end.
-You're bringing us bad luck.

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,289
Are any of you afraid of heights?

26
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,825
-Aren't we all, to some degree?
-Why would he ask that?

27
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,994
-Why bring it up?
-You tried bungee jumping.

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,563
-Watch it.
-I doubt there's a similar facility here.

29
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,166
-Hey, don't join him on this one.
-Look.

30
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,735
-Don't feed them new ideas!
-I got it now.

31
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,471
Isn't there a diving facility
on top of Taejongdae, Woo-young?

32
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,106
-Skydiving--
-Stop it, Sook!

33
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,008
There's no such thing on Taejongdae.

34
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,309
I got it, Jin-kyung.

35
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,912
They'll make you get on a plane
so that you can skydive.

36
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,447
Airplane-riding.

37
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,615
-Skydiving?
-You're driving me insane.

38
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,518
Look, the trekking
is bound to wear you out.

39
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,587
-Yeah.
-There's no use in worrying.

40
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,955
-None at all.
-That's true.

41
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:29,923
Just take a nap.

42
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,860
-This isn't it?
-Where are your work ethics?

43
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,061
Did I go too far?

44
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,963
I was just trying to banter.

45
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,931
Oh, this is the place.

46
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,432
ARRIVED WHILE
THEY WERE HAVING A GOOD LAUGH

47
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,334
It's called the Culture Village.

48
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,936
I did a shoot here once before.

49
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:46,139
-So this is the Huinnyeoul-gil.
-Yes, Sook and I get to visit the place.

50
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,476
Wait, you want us
to take a stroll here in our costumes?

51
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,844
Of course.

52
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,078
Oh, man…

53
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,248
-Here's your stop, Sook and Woo-jae.
-Okay!

54
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,749
-All right.
-Have fun, guys.

55
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,952
-Good luck to you too.
-See you later.

56
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,421
A PICTURESQUE OCEAN SCENE

57
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,856
What a killer view.

58
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,158
-Are you familiar with this place?
-Of course.

59
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,360
This is Huinnyeoul Culture Village
in Yeongdo, Busan.

60
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,364
It is said that the water rushing in
to join the ocean seemed like snow,

61
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,933
which led to it being named Huinnyeoul,
meaning white rapids.

62
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,403
Take a stroll along the road
and take in the view of the village.

63
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,339
When you reach the K section,

64
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,841
you'll see a café painted yellow.

65
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,277
Let's take a walk
and look for the yellow café.

66
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,812
Feel free to enjoy the view.

67
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,580
A yellow café in the K section?

68
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,183
OFF THEY GO TO THEIR NEW DESTINATION!

69
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,919
-There are so many cafés here.
-Dang it. Just now,

70
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,822
I saw my reflection
in the mirror back there.

71
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,757
A FEW STEPS BACK

72
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,326
JUST A GLANCE

73
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,862
PEOPLE MAY THINK YOU'RE HERE TO PERFORM

74
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:43,863
Don't worry about it.

75
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,565
-You look good.
-It's mortifying.

76
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,100
No, you look just fine.

77
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,269
Here's what I pictured for our trip.

78
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,671
We'd gather at Busan Station
in our costumes,

79
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,540
-All looking cool?
-shoot a fun opening bit,

80
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,141
and get changed to normal attire.

81
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,978
I thought we'd tour the city
carrying a backpack for each of us.

82
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,447
-What is this place? Wow.
-Oh, my.

83
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,549
That's amazing.

84
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,317
Gosh, is that laser engraving?

85
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,453
-Engraving photos onto wood panels.
-That's neat.

86
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,089
-That's actually cool.
-I like the idea.

87
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,959
Is that a café?
Let's have a cup of coffee.

88
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,994
It's our treat. Let's all get a cup.

89
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,031
-The ice cream also looks good, no?
-That looks amazing.

90
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,267
WHILE THE TREKKERS ENJOY
AN UNEXPECTED MOMENT OF PEACE…

91
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,872
Let's resume our journey.
We can stay on the bus.

92
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,575
Hear that?
We get to ride the bus all the way.

93
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,911
I hope the bus takes us
all the way to our lodgings.

94
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,314
AND YET, THE WINDING ROAD
SEEMS TO TAKE THEM UPHILL

95
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,848
Why are we going high up?

96
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,517
-The Yeongdo area has changed so much.
-What?

97
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,186
Guys, there's something at the top.

98
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,387
Up where, Jin-kyung?

99
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,990
-I'm sure I saw something.
-I should've gotten off the bus.

100
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,458
-I should've gotten off!
-I saw it!

101
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,593
But there's nothing.

102
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,494
Why are you looking away, Director Park?

103
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,397
-I don't see anything.
-Why are you avoiding me?

104
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,367
-Don't you see that up there?
-What do you mean?

105
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,036
Look at the trains of multiple wires.

106
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,271
I bet they're for electricity.

107
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,505
ARE THEY POWER LINES?

108
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,574
Oh, I get it!

109
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,376
It says "Ocean Flying." Dang!

110
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,644
WHAT DID SAE-HO SEE?

111
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,648
That goes on way too long.

112
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,582
It's way up high.

113
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,084
WELCOME TO THE ZIP-LINE

114
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,986
That's not so different
from bungee jumping.

115
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,054
AN INCREDIBLE HEIGHT

116
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,223
I can't handle that.

117
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,992
-Just how…
-Don't put us through it!

118
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,660
Don't you dare pull over!

119
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,794
THE TEAM'S MINIBUS

120
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,130
Are you serious? This is insane.

121
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,967
REACHED THEIR STOP

122
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,336
-Darn it.
-I made the wrong choice.

123
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,838
I did get the weird vibe earlier.

124
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,209
-Did we make a careless choice?
-Obviously.

125
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,710
What do we do now?

126
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,512
CLIMBING UP WITH BITTER REGRET

127
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,581
We're up quite high.

128
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,050
IN FACT, IT'S WAY TOO HIGH

129
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,086
First things first.
Those of you who chose riding,

130
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,187
welcome.

131
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,590
DEEP SIGH

132
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:55,461
The cast has been divided into two teams,
the trekkers and the riders.

133
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:59,766
For this mission, each team
has to find hints at their tour site.

134
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,302
You'll then combine them

135
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:06,439
to find out your accommodations
for the night.

136
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,407
THERE'S A CATCH

137
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,941
If you fail to find the hints,

138
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,611
you won't be able to
check in at your lodgings.

139
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,812
Where do we sleep, then?

140
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,114
I guess you could crash
at Woo-young's parents'.

141
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,017
What is wrong with you people?

142
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,353
ISN'T IT NICE
TO VISIT YOUR BESTIE'S PLACE?

143
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,524
As you can see, this place has
an amazing view of the ocean.

144
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,625
This is Taejongdae.

145
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,294
The Taejongdae zip-line course
traverses Busan's beach area.

146
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,296
It is 653 meters long,

147
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,232
and its top speed
is 70 kilometers per hour.

148
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,637
As you travel down the zip-line course,

149
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,039
you'll see Mr. Hint on the other lane.

150
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,542
Observe him carefully

151
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,577
to learn a hint of our next destination.

152
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,347
Have you ever tried zip-lining, Jin-kyung?

153
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,148
-No.
-How about you, Woo-young?

154
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,351
I can't say I have.

155
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,986
-I tried zip-lining twice.
-I see.

156
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,589
At any rate, we all must try it, correct?

157
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:01,160
If the first to zip-line spots Mr. Hint
and learns the hint correctly,

158
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,229
the others will be off the hook.

159
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,764
-Then--
-You can go first, Sae-ho.

160
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,099
I should go last because--

161
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,834
-No, no.
-Look.

162
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,469
What if I fail to get the hint?

163
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,304
No, you're bound to get it.

164
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,606
I don't think it will be so easy to spot.

165
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,907
-Just…
-I trust you.

166
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,609
Make something up.

167
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,978
Make it up? Our lodging depends on it.

168
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,313
-We have his place.
-Make what up?

169
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,647
Yeah, we have our house.

170
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,817
Anyway, let's go sign a liability waiver.

171
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,253
-Okay, let's get moving.
-Does zip-lining require one too?

172
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,056
H, I, J…

173
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,224
-There it is.
-We're here.

174
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,725
-The yellow building.
-Look, yellow.

175
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,027
THEY'VE REACHED THE K SECTION

176
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,663
Here's the yellow building. We've arrived.

177
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,133
A FEW STEPS MORE,
AND THE YELLOW CAFÉ WELCOMES YOU

178
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,369
Gosh, you look amazing
against this colorful backdrop.

179
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,138
You're a stunner.

180
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,274
SUMMONING WOO-YOUNG FROM '09

181
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,076
You really are killing it today.

182
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,611
With these colors.

183
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,947
Woo-young would hate that dance so much.

184
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,550
Watch out. The stairs are steep.

185
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,620
I'll now tell you your mission.

186
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,956
We have hidden hints
all over the yellow café.

187
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,025
All over the building?

188
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,228
THE MISSION SITE COVERS
THE ENTIRE 3-STORY BUILDING

189
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,397
CLUES IN EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY

190
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,699
The containers holding the clues
have the show's logo.

191
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,635
Oh, do they say "Screwballs"?

192
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,569
MISSION CARD

193
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,238
FIND HIDDEN TASKS AND CARRY OUT MISSIONS

194
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,776
SCAN QR CODES TO OBTAIN HINTS
ABOUT THEIR LODGINGS FOR THE NIGHT

195
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,645
HUNT FOR HINTS STARTS NOW

196
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,679
Shall we, then?

197
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,980
Ma'am.

198
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,715
He's trying to find a shortcut again.

199
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,951
Do you know where the crew hid the hints?

200
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,219
No, I don't.

201
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,421
Let's talk discreetly later.

202
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,656
Okay, then.

203
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,790
I appreciate it.

204
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,759
Let me see. So they have the show's logo?

205
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,360
CURRENTLY IN THE ANNEX'S 1ST FLOOR

206
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,362
The logo…

207
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,198
Oh, I found one!

208
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,300
-Where is it?
-It's here.

209
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,801
SPOTTED: A SAFE HOLDING THE FIRST HINT

210
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,503
-We need a code.
-What's this?

211
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,773
TAKES OUT THE FIRST MISSION CARD

212
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,810
"Review the sentences below

213
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,378
and find ones without errors."

214
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,915
Let's sit down for a bit.

215
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,817
Go on. Sit. We're in for trouble.

216
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,519
"How dare you nitpick?
This is the first time…"

217
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,920
"What's the occasion?" That's correct?

218
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,689
Yeah, options 1 and 5 don't have errors.

219
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,592
I'm not sure about option 7, though.

220
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,493
I got it!

221
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,794
Go on. Tell me the code.

222
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,130
One, five, seven.

223
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,000
Will it open?

224
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,803
-My gosh, Woo-jae.
-There we go.

225
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,339
SOLUTION TIME

226
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,174
TEMPERTURE, ACCOMODATE, LISENCE,
DEFINATELY, BOARING, SEPERATELY

227
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,009
TEMPERATURE, ACCOMMODATE, LICENSE,
DEFINITELY, BORING, SEPARATELY

228
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,478
THE ANSWERS ARE 1, 5, AND 7

229
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,413
-What on earth?
-Hold on. Where's my phone?

230
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,816
How are you so smart?
I can't believe it only took one go.

231
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,085
THE HINT IS ONLY A SCAN AWAY

232
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,520
WHAT DOES THE FIRST HINT SAY?

233
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,025
WOW, AREN'T YOU SMART?

234
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,393
"Wow, aren't you smart?"

235
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,861
What? That's it?

236
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,130
-What on earth?
-It's a dud.

237
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,031
What now?

238
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,033
What does it say? Let me see.

239
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,802
I can't even… What on earth is this?

240
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,237
There are some duds.

241
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,773
ONLY 5 QR CODES LEAD TO ACTUAL HINTS

242
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,308
That's so annoying.

243
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,010
No wonder that one was easy to find.

244
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,712
-There's another one.
-Where?

245
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,980
There, in the kitchen.

246
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,482
-Where in the kitchen?
-Here.

247
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,918
TAKES OUT THE SECOND MISSION CARD

248
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,654
"Jin-kyung has three of these
whereas Sae-ho and Woo-jae have none."

249
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,722
"Solve this riddle to find the code."

250
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,025
WHAT CAN THAT MEAN?

251
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,960
KIM SOOK, SCREWBALLS, JANG WOO-YOUNG

252
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,528
I've got it.

253
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,729
It's talking about final consonants.

254
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,764
We have two final consonants,

255
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,532
zero, and then two more.

256
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,135
He's so clever.

257
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,972
He must be an actual genius.

258
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,841
HIGH HOPES

259
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,314
-"Impressive." Are you for real?
-Jeez, you're asking for a smack.

260
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,584
THAT MESSAGE DOES STIR UP ONE'S BASE URGES

261
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,219
-I really should teach them a lesson.
-Darn it.

262
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,588
I'll go check upstairs…

263
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,022
There's another one here, Sook.

264
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,058
THAT'S THE THIRD ONE ALREADY

265
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,593
-Another one?
-Let's solve this together.

266
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,229
That's 100 times 1 over cos60…

267
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,070
THE SIGHT TERRIFIES THIS MATH-QUITTER

268
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,705
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

269
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,007
I would've been so lost
if I had come alone.

270
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,544
NEXT TO THIS LOST SOUL IS A MUMBLING MAN

271
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,381
RECONNECTING WITH HIS OLD ENGINEERING DAYS

272
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,985
CONTINUES TO MUMBLE WITHOUT MAKING NOTES

273
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,821
Four hundred…

274
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,922
Four hundred?

275
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,090
YOU SOLVED IT ALREADY?

276
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,125
OPEN IN 10 SECONDS

277
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,159
How is it 400?

278
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,397
WOO-JAE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THESE FACTS

279
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,633
If the missions are on this level,

280
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,201
the other team is hopeless.

281
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,836
That's what I'm worried about.

282
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,338
SO, WHAT DOES THE HINT SAY?

283
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,242
"Man, you're smart enough
to go to top schools."

284
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,177
THREE CONSECUTIVE DUDS

285
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,178
We're so screwed.

286
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,814
What do you think you're doing?

287
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,282
Seriously, what the heck…

288
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,151
SPOOKED

289
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,220
If you could explain how you solved it…

290
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,088
Why would I bother? It was a dud.

291
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,158
This is your chance to show off
your splendid math skills.

292
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,593
This really riles me up, Sook.

293
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,829
Regardless, if all mission questions
are roughly on this level,

294
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,398
the other team would have…

295
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,767
Would it be acceptable
to smash the safes open?

296
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,903
-Furthermore, who needs the solution?
-Can we smash it open?

297
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,439
I bet anyone can solve it
with mental math.

298
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,876
-That's a no-brainer.
-What's it about? I have no clue.

299
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,744
What grade level is this covered in?

300
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,113
Grades 10 to 12?

301
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,115
-Gosh, why can't I solve it?
-Sook.

302
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,917
-I'll go check upstairs.
-Okay.

303
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,621
MOVING UP TO THE TERRACE
ON THE ANNEX'S 2ND FLOOR

304
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,822
Did you plant clues outside?

305
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,323
Hey, I found one.

306
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,393
It's annoying how we can't know
which may be a dud.

307
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,696
HIS LUCK ISN'T HELPING HIM
FIND THE REAL HINTS

308
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,898
The place is larger than I thought.

309
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,966
-Did you find another one?
-Yeah.

310
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,501
I see one more in the back.

311
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,772
THIS TIME, SHE TRIES ONE ON HER OWN

312
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,908
"One person died after a clapping sound."

313
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,910
"What were they doing before their death?"

314
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,778
A CLAPPING SOUND? SOMEONE DIED?

315
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,548
WOO-JAE ALSO TAKES OUT
A MISSION CARD OF HIS OWN

316
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,083
"Here is the menu of Café Screwballs."

317
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,284
"Decipher each drink's name

318
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,888
and enter the number of syllables
of their full name in Korean."

319
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,523
IA, MSGR, CORN/SEC LATTE

320
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,093
IA for Iced Americano.

321
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,095
Oh, that's misugaru.

322
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,697
Per second as in "chodang,"
corn, and latte.

323
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,132
That's Chodang Corn Latte.

324
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,069
I've got it.

325
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,304
THIS GUY KNOWS ALL THE NEW LINGOS

326
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,806
THEY'RE BOUND TO GIVE ME
A HINT THIS TIME

327
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,312
DUDE, SPEAK KOREAN, ALL RIGHT?

328
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,747
I'VE HAD ENOUGH

329
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,683
Seriously, what the hell is this?

330
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,184
SOMEHOW, HE KEEPS FINDING THE DUDS

331
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,220
Look, Sook. How can they keep doing…

332
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,223
Hey, I've hit the jackpot.
This has to give us a legit hint.

333
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,325
DID SOOK OPEN A SAFE TOO?

334
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,661
LET'S GO BACK TO THE MOMENT
WHEN SHE FIRST READ THE QUIZ

335
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,963
After a clapping sound?

336
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,264
They were playing the 369 Game.

337
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,700
TRICK QUESTION SOLVED IN ONE GO

338
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,001
Gosh, I did it.

339
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,169
Oh, my.

340
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,972
WILL SHE FIND A TRUE HINT AS SHE HOPED?

341
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,309
"Dae."

342
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,477
-It's a hint.
-We found one.

343
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,645
-A hint!
-Hold on.

344
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,180
-"Dae."
-"Dae."

345
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,415
-Our first hint is "Dae."
-As in Haeundae?

346
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,383
Alternatively,

347
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,185
it can be a part
of our accommodation's name,

348
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,654
-something like "Daemyeong."
-Haeundae…

349
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,156
I cracked the quiz.

350
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,857
"One person died after a clapping sound."

351
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,893
"What were they doing before their death?"

352
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,294
It only took me one go.

353
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,831
One person died after a clapping sound?

354
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,100
What were they doing?
I can't imagine what.

355
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,501
The 369 Game, of course.

356
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,471
Three, six, nine
Three, six, nine

357
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,639
One. Two.

358
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,207
Dang, that's the answer?

359
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,342
Trick questions are right up my alley.

360
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,945
You know what? We're a perfect pair.

361
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,713
Our team has the brain and the trickster.

362
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,048
-Yeah.
-Hurry. Let's crack them all.

363
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,083
-I'm good with these.
-Let's go through all of them.

364
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,287
To be honest, I was getting worried
about facing trick questions.

365
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,890
-With you here, we're invincible.
-I'm the expert with those.

366
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,625
MOVING ON TO THE 3RD FLOOR TERRACE

367
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,526
Here's another one.

368
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,128
A NEW CLUE SPOTTED

369
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,529
Another trick question.

370
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,499
"Complete the formula for your code."

371
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,502
"How wealthy is the richest dressing?"

372
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,370
-That's Thousand Island dressing.
-So, 1,000 islands.

373
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,873
-In Korean, "oil" sounds like five days.
-So, five.

374
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,842
"What's the number
that can get anyone to stand up?"

375
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,845
WHAT IS THE NUMBER
THAT CAN GET ANYONE TO STAND UP?

376
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,981
-This number can get people to stand up?
-One hundred?

377
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,086
WHAT IS THE NUMBER
THAT CAN GET ANYONE TO STAND UP?

378
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,457
A number that makes us get up…

379
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,292
Stand up…

380
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,561
THIS TROUBLES HIM MORE
THAN THE MATH QUIZZES

381
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,231
Would we have to consider English words
or just stick to numbers?

382
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,368
SHE SAID THESE TRICK QUESTIONS
WERE HER SPECIALTY…

383
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,370
A number that makes people stand up.

384
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,405
-Get them up… Stand up.
-Get up.

385
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,774
It could be something like, "Fire!"

386
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,643
Sure, that would get folks on their feet.

387
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,745
WHAT IS THE NUMBER
THAT CAN GET ANYONE TO STAND UP?

388
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,779
What can it be?

389
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,283
Dang. I'll go find other clues first.

390
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,253
-Oh, my! What on earth?
-What happened? What was the code?

391
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,722
TRYING OUT RANDOM CODES ON THE LOCK

392
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,591
SHE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO UNLOCK IT

393
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,326
I don't know what happened.

394
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,428
-It was five.
-You're right.

395
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,763
Five. For high fives.

396
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,298
-High fives!
-High fives!

397
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,100
-Five!
-Five!

398
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,502
-That was the only one I couldn't solve.
-That's true.

399
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,206
MASTER OF TRICKS AND GUESSES

400
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,976
"Gu."

401
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,079
What was it earlier, "dae"?
We have "dae" and "gu," like Daegu.

402
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,848
DAEGU
NO WAY WE'D GO THAT FAR…

403
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,683
-I bet it's Haeundae-gu.
-Haeundae-gu.

404
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,219
It's bound to be a place in Haeundae-gu.

405
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,454
The answer still cracks me up.
Five for high five.

406
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,990
I knew these troublemakers
would try to pull our legs.

407
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,029
Let's have a neat rock-paper-scissors.
There's no reason why I should go first.

408
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,898
How is that game "neat"?

409
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:37,436
Let's time five seconds on a stopwatch.
The one who gets closest gets to go last.

410
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,904
You can't rig that
unlike the rock-paper-scissors.

411
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,972
ANTI-CHEATING MEASURES

412
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,707
I'll go first. Here goes.

413
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,108
Ready, go.

414
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,114
-Okay, so that's 4.92 seconds.
-Goodness.

415
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,016
NEXT UP IS WOO-YOUNG

416
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:52,985
TAP

417
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,588
He got 4.85 seconds.

418
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,257
I get the feeling I'll place last.

419
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,694
-Oh, 4.90 seconds.
-Good. I get to go second.

420
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,796
That's right. Let's review the results.

421
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,398
I got 4.92, she got 4.90, and he got 4.85.

422
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,500
-Please sign your waivers.
-Oh, right.

423
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,868
FEELING UNEASY

424
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,504
I weigh 70 kilograms…

425
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,839
SUPPLIED PERSONAL INFO FOR SAFETY

426
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,842
AND RECEIVED SAFETY TRAINING

427
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,812
Do you have further questions?

428
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,348
Why are we… even doing this?

429
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,749
Just get going.

430
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,653
I should've chose trekking!

431
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,722
Guys, no. I just can't do this.

432
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,490
It's so scary!

433
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,058
CAN THEY OVERCOME THEIR FEAR
AND FIND THE HINT?

434
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,196
That hurt. Sorry about that.

435
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,531
I would never try this in my free time.

436
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,435
I don't get why anyone would pay
their good money to do this.

437
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,505
Okay, let's roll.

438
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,407
-Step over here, please.
-Wait.

439
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,475
Get going.

440
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,844
FORCED ONTO THE PLATFORM

441
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,247
-I think I need to take a dump.
-Excuse me?

442
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,649
-Who says that to a stranger?
-Right, I'm sorry.

443
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,284
-I apologize.
-It's okay.

444
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,519
WE APOLOGIZE FOR THIS MISHAP

445
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,688
-It's slippery here.
-Go for Lane three.

446
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,056
-Don't worry.
-Do I hold it like this?

447
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,959
Good luck! You've got this, Woo-young!

448
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,962
THE VIEW WOULD CHOKE ANYONE UP

449
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,731
AND YET…

450
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,333
We could all crash at Woo-young's place.

451
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,036
TO AVOID HAVING 50 PEOPLE
STAY WITH HIS FAMILY…

452
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,973
HE MUST SECURE THE HINT!

453
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,542
THE SAFETY GATE OPENS

454
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,411
-I'll hold your harness.
-Will you push me?

455
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,080
Yes. Please crouch down
and stretch out your legs.

456
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,216
TAKING HIS FEET OFF THE GROUND CAREFULLY

457
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,418
Stretch out your arms too.

458
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,119
Great. Here we go.

459
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,187
Here we go.

460
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,894
OFF HE GOES WITH A SHRIEK

461
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,962
I totally should've chosen trekking!

462
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,998
Why didn't I choose trekking?

463
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,135
The course goes on forever!

464
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,937
It's too long!

465
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,806
GOING DOWN FOREVER

466
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:54,940
Where is he?

467
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,642
How far does he have to go?

468
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,311
DESCENDING AT A RAPID PACE

469
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,579
LOOKING AROUND

470
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,081
Where is he?

471
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,016
MR. HINT FINALLY COMES INTO SIGHT

472
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,751
Oh, I see him now.

473
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,953
APPROACHING AT A HIGH SPEED

474
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,923
WOO-YOUNG'S POV

475
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:11,824
MR. HINT'S POV

476
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,859
WOO-YOUNG FLASHES BY HIM

477
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,629
Damn it.

478
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,697
How am I…

479
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,466
How am I supposed to catch that?

480
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,268
I hope he got a good look at the hint.

481
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,671
We need him to succeed.

482
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,638
HE'S ABOUT TO CRY

483
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,241
DID WOO-YOUNG SEE THE HINT?

484
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,111
CHOKED-UP WOO-YOUNG
ARRIVES ON THE OTHER SIDE

485
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,748
Can you turn off the camera for a bit?

486
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,183
I think I soiled my pants.

487
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,452
I might have wetted myself.

488
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,089
Come on, Director. Cut me some slack.
I'll treat you to a fancy meal.

489
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,257
I mean it.

490
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,792
Take pity on me this once.

491
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,960
ZOOMING IN INSTEAD

492
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,097
As for the hint over there…

493
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,366
I saw some people, Director.

494
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,335
I mean, there was a group photo.

495
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,904
Like I said, Mr. Hint has a hint for you.

496
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,673
AT 1X SPEED

497
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,774
AT 0.5X SPEED

498
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,675
AT 0.25X SPEED

499
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,310
HE HAD SOMETHING IN HIS HAND…

500
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,313
There's no way we'll find
where we're supposed to go.

501
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,949
-We'll be sleeping on the streets.
-What did you see?

502
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,919
I feel hesitant,

503
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,522
-but it seemed like a family portrait.
-Yes?

504
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,725
Perhaps it featured
a man-woman pair or a girl group.

505
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,661
It could've been a boy band as well.

506
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,164
FEELINGS ANTSY

507
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,798
You'll go next, won't you?

508
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,834
Wait, I won't have to if he got the hint.

509
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,436
-Oh, that's right.
-Let's see if he got it or not.

510
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,872
Director, could we check that?

511
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,574
I'll get right on it.

512
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,309
DID WOO-YOUNG SECURE THE HINT?

513
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,877
SNIFF

514
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,781
If you had to guess,
what do you think is the hint?

515
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,385
Idol.

516
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,787
-Is your answer "Idol"?
-Yeah.

517
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,689
Woo-young, that is incorrect.

518
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,457
No one's going to get it.

519
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,394
For your information,
the photo in Mr. Hint's sketchbook

520
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,095
featured your favorite colleagues,

521
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,064
-TWICE.
-Oh, about that…

522
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,166
TWICE

523
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,067
THEY ARE HIS LABELMATES

524
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,303
Some of the girls wear their hair short…

525
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,471
COULD HIS RAMBLING
BE AN AFTERMATH OF THE ZIP-LINING?

526
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,607
Additionally, the actual hint

527
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,244
was the number on Mr. Hint's helmet.

528
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,483
As a fan of TWICE,
he wanted to give them a shoutout.

529
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,519
HINT IS UP HERE
JUST WANTED TO SHOW MY LOVE FOR TWICE

530
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,957
This won't end well, I tell you.

531
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,526
Look, our Chucky
will come down soon enough.

532
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,262
MENACING MS. CHUCKY WILL BE JOINING THEM

533
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,464
One of the crew…

534
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,800
They might not make it home tonight, okay?

535
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,701
The helmet--

536
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,002
Are you sure about this?

537
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,570
Did you not see his helmet?

538
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,472
As if anyone could've seen that.

539
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,342
If you were my peer,
I would be hurling profanities.

540
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,276
I can't even…

541
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,877
How are you going to deal with her?

542
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,414
-There was a number on his helmet?
-Yes.

543
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,484
The correct answer was there,
without any tricks.

544
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,752
WHERE, EXACTLY?

545
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,420
Okay, here's what we'll do.

546
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,623
When the second zip-liner departs,

547
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,058
you can shout at them
to look at the helmet.

548
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,128
Okay.

549
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,330
MEANWHILE, ON THE OTHER SIDE…

550
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,065
It's your turn, Jin-kyung.

551
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,134
-he didn't catch it?
-No.

552
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,535
Did he miss the hint?

553
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,903
He said, "How could I have seen that?"

554
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,740
-Just a moment…
-Jeez. Let's get you ready, Jin-kyung.

555
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,143
What's wrong with him?
How could he have missed that?

556
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,878
Damn it.

557
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,847
"How could I have seen that?" What a joke.

558
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,050
This is so scary.

559
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,819
THE FEAR ENGULFS HER

560
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,021
You've got this, Jin-kyung.

561
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,222
HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE VERTIGO

562
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,657
Hold on. Just a second.

563
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,025
-She's ready.
-Wait!

564
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,793
Don't let me go just yet. Unhook me.

565
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,728
Please unhook me for just a second.

566
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,830
-Wait, let's send Sae-ho first.
-Do you mean it?

567
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,365
Yeah, for real. I can't do this now.

568
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,633
-Got it.
-I'm so scared.

569
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,734
Okay, I'll go first, then.

570
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,003
Bring it on! This is going to be fun.

571
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,539
I tried zip-lining twice.

572
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,309
THE TWO-TIME VETERAN STEPS FORWARD BRAVELY

573
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,644
-Are you all set?
-Yes.

574
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,479
THIS LADY IS NERVOUS IN HIS STEAD

575
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,350
DEPARTS WITH HIGH SPIRITS

576
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,785
WOOHOO

577
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,855
THE BLUE OCEAN EXPANDS BENEATH YOUR FEET

578
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,460
THE FRESH AIR SURROUNDS HIM

579
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,763
ENJOYING THE EXPERIENCE

580
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,299
MR. HINT COMES INTO VIEW

581
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,901
Sae-ho!

582
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,569
Look at his helmet!

583
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,172
A DESPERATE PLEA

584
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,543
MR. SHORTY PASSES BY LIKE A BULLET

585
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,379
Huh?

586
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,717
DID HIS EXPERIENCE AND WOO-YOUNG'S PLEA
HELP HIM SPOT THE HINT?

587
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,052
Dang, look at his face.

588
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,021
He seemed so triumphant earlier.

589
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,989
MR. SHORTY ARRIVES
WITH AN AWKWARD EXPRESSION

590
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,125
I do think I saw the hint.

591
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,560
What a fun ride.

592
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,362
Let's wait and hear his answer.

593
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,932
Let's check your answer first.
What did you see?

594
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,133
First off,

595
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,068
-I saw a photo of an idol group.
-I see.

596
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,970
-But that's about it.
-So…

597
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,806
How would you sum up the hint in one word?

598
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,242
-In one word?
-Yes.

599
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,311
-Wait, Sae-ho. Did you hear--
-The hint…

600
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,645
-It's "idol."
-Darn it.

601
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,847
-Idol?
-Yeah.

602
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,215
IDOL, ISN'T IT?

603
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,684
Remember how I shouted at you
while you were on your way?

604
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,252
-I even yelled your name.
-Yeah.

605
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,921
-Did you not hear me?
-Huh?

606
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,256
-Shoot.
-Now, Sae-ho.

607
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,657
Jin-kyung won't hear us either.

608
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,828
On the sketchbook
was a group photo of TWICE.

609
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,164
-Mr. Hint happens to be their fan.
-I see.

610
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,866
That's why he had their photo.

611
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,436
As for the hint about your destination,
it was the number written on his helmet.

612
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,037
Is that right?

613
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,540
You guys are peers.
Give him a piece of your mind.

614
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,674
Who cares if he's the director?

615
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,809
You lot are a pain.

616
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,477
-Why did you have him hold that up?
-Wait.

617
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,046
Like I said, he's a fan of TWICE.

618
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,047
DISILLUSIONED

619
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,816
Don't just sigh. Chew him out.

620
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,618
-How? Why?
-You can speak freely as a peer.

621
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,153
I'll do that when the cameras are off.

622
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,458
TURNING HIS BACK
ON THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE BESTIE TRIP

623
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,026
Still, I had so much fun.

624
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,529
Let's be frank.
This isn't as bad as bungee jumping.

625
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,264
-It's fun.
-It's fun no doubt.

626
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,534
HERE IS DEJECTED CHUCKY

627
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,169
SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER

628
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,236
What's the matter?

629
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,137
It's nothing.

630
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,172
HER MAKEUP MADE HER LAUGH

631
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,774
What's so funny here?
I don't see why you would laugh.

632
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,410
I really don't see it.

633
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,180
What's so funny about this situation?
Nothing at all.

634
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,881
I can sort of see your future.

635
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,651
-Mine?
-I think you'll be going down soon.

636
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,986
That is such an odd prophecy.

637
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,721
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT, MS. INSTRUCTOR

638
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,257
THAT PUT HER MORE ON EDGE

639
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,392
Did he catch the hint?

640
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,927
I bet Sae-ho did.

641
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,395
-He didn't.
-I hear he didn't.

642
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,430
Seriously?

643
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,666
Why did they all miss it?

644
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,471
They both have a working set
of eyes, nose, and mouth.

645
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,140
ALL THEY NEED IS THEIR EYES…
AT ANY RATE, DON'T VENT ON US

646
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,542
Seriously, their eyes work just fine.
Why did they miss it?

647
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,044
WHILE CHUCKY IS THROWING A FIT…

648
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,913
Can we lose the gear?

649
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,483
-The harness? I don't think so.
-Do we need to… Oh, I get it.

650
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,251
Would we need to try this again?

651
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,686
CHUCKLES

652
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,589
We have to keep zip-lining
until we get it. I bet I'm right.

653
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,890
How is it funny to you?

654
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,495
By the way, is anyone monitoring
how Mr. Hint is doing?

655
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,231
-Oh, by radio?
-How are you holding up?

656
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,199
I'm doing fine, roger.

657
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,836
-This is going to be the death of me.
-Please climb up one more step.

658
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,205
This is driving me insane.

659
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,440
JIN-KYUNG GETS ON THE PLATFORM

660
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,909
This is terrifying.

661
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,744
ANXIETY ATTACKS HER

662
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,279
SIGHING

663
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,983
This mission only ends
when I go down this course, right?

664
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,519
Only when you get the hint, to be exact.

665
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,454
How come the guys failed to catch it?

666
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,623
What happened?

667
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,025
YOU WILL SOON LEARN WHY THEY FAILED

668
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,094
Please position your legs properly.

669
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,663
JAGGED BREATHING, A BUNDLE OF NERVES

670
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,333
CHUCKY IS READY FOR THE RIDE

671
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,768
Here we go.

672
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,671
SHE'S ON HER WAY

673
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,746
CHUCKY IN THE AIR

674
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,647
SQUINTS

675
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,682
SHE CAN BARELY KEEP HER EYES OPEN

676
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,384
Is that Jin-kyung?

677
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,451
CHUCKY APPROACHES AT HIGH SPEED

678
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,986
The helmet!

679
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,122
His helmet, Jin-kyung! Look up here!

680
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,057
DESPERATE PLEAS

681
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,327
ZIPS PAST MR. HINT

682
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,630
A PECULIAR EXPRESSION

683
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,733
She's having fun.
I think she's enjoying it.

684
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,602
JIN-KYUNG ARRIVES SAFELY

685
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,903
Wasn't it fun?

686
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,139
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah, it was okay.

687
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,040
I thought so.

688
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,274
By the way, you two.

689
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,076
-How did you miss the obvious clue?
-What? I mean…

690
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,011
Let's hear your answer, then.

691
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,846
I don't get why you said
you didn't catch it.

692
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,682
Just give Director Park your answer.

693
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,417
-Jin-kyung.
-Yeah?

694
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,553
-Goodness, Jin-kyung.
-Do you feel confident about your answer?

695
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,522
I saw women in school uniforms.

696
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,158
Five were sitting down in the photo.

697
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,760
DID YOU SAY 5?

698
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,497
How come you turned into Kim Jang-hoon?

699
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,132
What brought on this transformation?

700
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,400
The women were idol singers.

701
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,668
-Idols?
-Yeah.

702
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,170
Is the answer "idol"?

703
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,138
Jin-kyung, that is incorrect.

704
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,306
-What a shame.
-Jin-kyung.

705
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,275
Did you not hear us shouting?

706
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,043
-No.
-Is that right?

707
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,414
Let's talk about the photo
that you saw on the way.

708
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,018
Our Mr. Hint happens to be TWICE's fan.

709
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,720
That's why he had it.

710
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,388
-Try to rein it in.
-As for your hint…

711
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,456
HEH-HEH

712
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,657
-it's on his…
-Don't be mad.

713
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,658
It's on his helmet.

714
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,561
The hint was the number
written on his helmet.

715
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,795
On his helmet?

716
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,430
Don't lose it.

717
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,834
-What is the matter with you?
-Try to hold back.

718
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,735
-Look.
-Huh?

719
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,737
We have a bigger issue here.

720
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,805
It's a whole lot bigger.
It will blow your mind.

721
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,073
We have to zip-line again.

722
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,311
COLLAPSES

723
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,680
Normally, people get to remove
all the harnesses, right?

724
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,948
I'm still wearing it, see?

725
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,485
We have to keep on trying
until we manage to get the hint.

726
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,386
Hang on.

727
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,155
-This is insane.
-What are the others doing?

728
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,399
"Add up all numbers…

729
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,868
in the five cast members' birthdays."

730
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,237
HE'S THINKING ABOUT YOU

731
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,239
I'm so screwed. Hold on.

732
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,974
Did you find all the clues here?

733
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,342
-Sook.
-Yeah?

734
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,077
I'm lost on Woo-young and Sae-ho.

735
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,945
I can't remember Woo-young's birthday.

736
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,348
I remember Jin-kyung's birthday
because of a past mission.

737
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,616
It's December 23rd.

738
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,352
Add up the dates of yours, hers, and mine,
we get 87.

739
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,154
JIN-KYUNG: DECEMBER 23RD
WOO-JAE: NOVEMBER 28TH

740
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,288
It's 87…

741
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,189
SOOK: JULY 6TH

742
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,525
Wait, we can ask Chang-hee.

743
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,226
-We can make calls.
-Ask him about Sae-ho.

744
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,127
Okay, I'll do that.

745
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,397
CALLING NAM CHANG-HEE

746
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,099
Maybe he's on his radio show.

747
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,669
Who else would be close to Sae-ho?

748
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,274
THE 900+ WEDDING GUESTS
FLIT THROUGH THEIR MINDS

749
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,575
In-seok.

750
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,944
AS IN THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER
AND THIS SHOW'S CREATOR?

751
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,479
THE TRIP'S ORGANIZER AND SAE-HO'S FRIEND

752
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,680
AND YES, HE'S THE SHOW'S DIRECTOR

753
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,881
Let's call him.

754
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,717
I'm calling him now.

755
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,885
They said we could call our friends.

756
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,654
AND HE IS INDEED THEIR FRIEND

757
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:48,126
UNFORTUNATELY, HE CAN'T ANSWER
DUE TO THE ONGOING SHOOT FOR THE RIDERS

758
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,161
PARK IN-SEOK, UNREACHABLE

759
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,062
Is he not picking up?

760
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,364
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT FRIEND

761
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,432
Who are you calling?

762
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,268
Our show's head writer, Eun-yeong.

763
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,403
Answer the phone already.

764
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,004
THE SHOW'S HEAD WRITER AND SAE-HO'S FRIEND

765
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,039
ALSO, SHE'S HERE

766
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,274
You said we could call our friends.
So go on.

767
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,009
-Hello?
-Hey, Sook.

768
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,778
-I'm working now. I'm sorry.
-Wait.

769
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,580
Let me ask just one thing.

770
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,481
Dang it.

771
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,151
HE THOUGHT OF A BACKUP
FOR JUST THIS OCCASION

772
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,119
Hi, Woo-jae.

773
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,553
-Hey, Mr. Manager.
-Yes, Woo-jae?

774
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,222
By any chance,

775
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,524
could you ask around
for Sae-ho's birthday?

776
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,160
-I'll see what I can do.
-That was brilliant.

777
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,628
Open the calculator app.

778
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,464
Shouldn't we see your managers
as your fellow castmates?

779
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,032
-How so?
-Don't be ridiculous.

780
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,334
You are joined at the hip.

781
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,702
-But we're different people.
-Sure.

782
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,836
Don't be preposterous.

783
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,838
-Surely we are not the same person.
-You bet.

784
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,406
We had 87 so far.

785
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,475
When is Sae-ho's birthday?

786
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,510
It's August 9th.

787
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,745
-Sae-ho's birthday is August 9th.
-Add 8 and 9…

788
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:41,746
How about Woo-young?

789
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,749
Woo-young's birthday is April 30th.

790
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,117
Got it. Thank you.

791
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,185
-No problem.
-It's 138.

792
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,755
UNLOCKED

793
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,158
THE MISSION TURNS INTO A TEST
OF THEIR WITS AND NOT FRIENDSHIP

794
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,592
This must give us a proper hint.

795
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,464
-"Deung."
-"Deung"?

796
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,267
-What about "Deungdae" as in lighthouse?
-Lighthouse?

797
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,903
HURRYING OVER TO THE ROOFTOP
FOR MORE CLUES

798
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,870
Goodness.

799
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,372
There are two of them.

800
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,975
"King Sejong's birthday

801
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,878
multiplied by the number of BTS members."

802
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,314
King Sejong…

803
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,050
BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR FRIEND, SAE-HO!

804
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,319
I know that there are seven guys in BTS.

805
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,688
I should multiply the date by seven, then.

806
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,557
READS THE OTHER MISSION CARD

807
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,625
"Input the exact time now."

808
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,029
LET ME THINK…

809
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,831
I bet it will be something like,
"In my hour of need."

810
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,769
It is, isn't it?
I'm sure it's another trick question.

811
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,672
Does everyone know King Sejong's birthday?

812
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,141
-You'll get it when you hear it.
-I'll get it when I hear it?

813
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,476
-Woo-jae!
-Yeah?

814
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,345
HE'S WORKING ON ANOTHER QUIZ
IN THE 3RD FLOOR ATTIC

815
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,880
Do you know King Sejong's birthday?

816
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,649
FIGURE OUT THE RULE
AND COMPLETE THE SEQUENCE

817
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,518
I need King Sejong's birthday.

818
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,752
I found two missions up here.

819
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,653
King Sejong?

820
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,955
Yeah, get up and try this.

821
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,425
King Sejong? I somehow get the feeling
he was born on a spring day.

822
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,493
FIGURE OUT THE RULE
AND COMPLETE THE SEQUENCE

823
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,863
I've got it! I have the answer!

824
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,763
Did you really?

825
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,965
YOU MEAN KING SEJONG'S BIRTHDAY?

826
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,434
NOPE, I MEANT THE QUIZ DOWN HERE

827
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,469
8 times 1 is 8. 8 times 2 is 16.

828
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,771
8 times 3 is 24. The first blank is 3.

829
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,841
IS HE RECITING THE TIMES TABLE?

830
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,984
Look. They masked the rule by breaking
the numbers into different units.

831
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,587
Did you get it?

832
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,788
Did you get it?

833
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,557
GOODNESS, I APPLAUD YOU FOR TRYING

834
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,626
What, did we get a dud again?

835
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,628
It was especially tricky, you know.

836
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,662
Let's solve this one.

837
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,931
So, do you know King Sejong's birthday?

838
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,432
King Sejong's birthday…

839
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,201
Do you know when it is?

840
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:44,969
NOT REALLY…

841
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,804
So, is this common knowledge?

842
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,239
Do you know it too, Director?

843
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,174
-Director.
-Is it Hangeul Day?

844
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,976
That is a very smart approach.

845
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,312
So that counts as a smart approach?

846
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,781
We all celebrate this day.

847
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,150
It must be Valentine's Day, then.

848
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,551
Yeah, let's continue in that vein.

849
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,153
Could it be Children's Day?

850
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,988
Is it Parents' Day?

851
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,090
I doubt it's Independence Movement Day.
Hold on.

852
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,191
This is driving me nuts.

853
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,626
We all celebrate this day?

854
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,228
Everyone celebrates his birthday?

855
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,597
I doubt King Sejong knows my birthday.

856
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,933
She said it was common knowledge.

857
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,735
NEW YEAR'S DAY…
INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT DAY…

858
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,537
CHILDREN'S DAY,
PARENTS' DAY, TEACHERS' DAY…

859
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,074
-I bet it's Teachers' Day.
-Hey, I got it.

860
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,309
It's April Fools' Day.

861
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,543
No, it's Teachers' Day.

862
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,679
I think it's April Fools' Day.

863
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,280
IGNORES HER

864
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,015
It's 140.

865
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,383
You can work that with mental math?

866
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,085
-What was the answer?
-May 15th.

867
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,420
HIS BIRTHDAY BECAME TEACHERS' DAY

868
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,056
TO CELEBRATE HIS LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE
WHICH LED TO HANGEUL'S INVENTION

869
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,225
We've got "Seo."

870
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,194
-"Seo…"
-"Seo"?

871
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,095
Yeah.

872
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,498
Haeundae-gu… Seo…

873
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,233
Can it be Seomyeon?

874
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,568
Seomyeon isn't in Haeundae-gu.

875
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,036
-Really?
-Yeah.

876
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,739
We have one more here.
"Input the exact time now."

877
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,342
-Man, I wonder what this is about.
-The time quiz.

878
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,844
-That's our last one.
-"The exact time."

879
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,213
BUT THE TIME IS TICKING EVEN NOW

880
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,881
There must be a clue.

881
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,883
Look around and find a clock, Sook.

882
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,452
Let's see if there's one nearby.

883
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,421
WE SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT TOO!

884
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,857
Hey, I think you're a genius.

885
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,692
There must be a clock
that stopped working.

886
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,927
You sneaky rascals.

887
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,228
I'll check downstairs.

888
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,563
Okay, I'll go check upstairs.

889
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,733
But there are no clocks here.

890
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,370
Where's the clock?

891
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,471
Here it is.

892
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,506
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK SPOTTED

893
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,874
It's 2:35.

894
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,877
THE TIME "2: 35" MEANS
THAT THE CODE IS "235"

895
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,546
He must've found it.
Watch your step, Director.

896
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,382
He's a bright guy.

897
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,417
DID HE FIND A HINT?

898
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,287
IS IT ANOTHER DUD?

899
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,956
IT IS

900
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,991
SCREWBALLS
EVERY SUNDAY AT 5 P.M.

901
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,726
Where are you?

902
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:49,994
Is he another floor below?

903
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,397
You don't have to come, Sook.

904
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,531
Where are you, Woo-jae?

905
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,266
I'm so ticked off.

906
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,601
Did you find the clock?

907
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,102
It was another dud, Sook.

908
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,303
Damn it.

909
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,839
"Screwballs, every Sunday at 5 p.m."

910
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,978
WHY ARE THEY SO MAD ABOUT THAT?

911
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,981
-There must be another safe here.
-Another safe?

912
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,582
Yeah, one more safe.

913
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,789
COULD IT BE IN HERE?

914
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,757
Found it.

915
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,794
Goodness. You rock, Woo-jae.

916
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,595
HE MAY BE UNLUCKY, BUT HE HAS SKILLS

917
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,166
JATANPUNG, PLAVE, NMIXX, DAY6…

918
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,302
GUESS HOW MANY MEMBERS ARE IN EACH GROUP
AND CALCULATE THE FORMULA

919
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,405
BUZZ * (JATANPUNG + PLAVE + NMIXX + DAY6
+ BMK + JANG DEOK CHEOL + BSS + TRIPLE S)

920
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,074
-Member count…
-I've got it.

921
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,942
Sure, it's your area of expertise.

922
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,043
I know this much.

923
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,178
Jatanpung…

924
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,512
WE'LL BE DONE IN A FLASH

925
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,281
How many members does the band have?

926
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,949
Three. At least I think it does.

927
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,018
-Do they have two members or three?
-Isn't it two?

928
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,319
What about DAY6?

929
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,954
-Four members.
-Four. Got it.

930
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,856
-BMK is a solo artist.
-One.

931
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,291
Jang Deok Cheol has three guys.

932
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,859
-BSS has three guys.
-BSS… Three.

933
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,995
-NMIXX has six members.
-Six, okay.

934
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,865
-But PLAVE…
-About PLAVE…

935
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,200
They have five guys.

936
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,768
-Okay.
-I'm right, aren't I?

937
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,604
PLAVE: A 5-MEMBER VIRTUAL BOY BAND
THAT DEBUTED IN MARCH 2023

938
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,139
They have 23 members in tripleS.

939
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,475
IS HE RIGHT, THOUGH?

940
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,976
Does Buzz have four members of five?

941
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,811
No, wait. They have Min Kyung-hoon…

942
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,615
-I think there are three of them.
-They either have three or four guys.

943
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,683
Four, then.

944
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,684
Let's try this anyway.

945
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,285
-Hit me.
-It's 192.

946
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,590
No dice.

947
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,459
-Sook, in the end…
-Did we fall into a trap again?

948
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,129
Are you sure Jatanpung has three guys?
Let's run the numbers again with two.

949
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,098
The ones giving me confusion
are tripleS and Buzz.

950
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,201
Perhaps Buzz has just two members.

951
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,403
You think they only have two guys? Gosh.

952
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,706
There are 23 members
in tripleS, aren't there?

953
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,174
Did I get it wrong?

954
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,109
THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM
FOR HIM TO BE SURE

955
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,944
IF WOO-JAE IS UNSURE…

956
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,613
THEN, IT'S SHOWTIME

957
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,115
I can rely on my assets, right?
I've got a good hearing.

958
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,683
STICKS HER EAR TO THE BOX

959
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,920
SHE DEMONSTRATED HER SKILLS EARLIER

960
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,022
HERE COMES MS. KIM SOOK,
GUESSWORK SPECIALIST

961
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,124
We might end up sleeping on the streets.

962
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,926
I can picture that.

963
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,562
BE AN UPSTANDING GUY, WOO-JAE

964
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,831
I'LL HANDLE THE DIRTY WORK

965
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,133
THE 50 YEARS OF HARDSHIP TAUGHT HER A LOT…

966
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,968
I tried all numbers in the 90s range.

967
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,771
USING EVERY FIBER OF HER BEING,
SHE WILL CRACK THE SAFE OPEN!

968
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,907
Our facial muscles will act up
out on the cold streets.

969
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,442
IS THIS THEIR FIRST BITTER FAILURE?

970
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,444
-What's that? Goodness.
-How did you do it?

971
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,146
JUST WHEN SHE WAS LOSING HOPE…

972
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,449
THE SAFE HOLDING THE HINT
OPENED UP LIKE A PRESENT

973
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,717
Gosh, that's amazing.

974
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,819
-The code was 245.
-Was it?

975
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,022
I've got your back, okay?

976
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,424
-You can count on me.
-I've got the QR code.

977
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,159
Tell us the correct answer.

978
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,135
THE RESULT OF THE EQUATION IS 245

979
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,803
You were like Jun Ji-hyun
from The Thieves.

980
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,973
Like I said, you can always count on me.
My ears are still sharp.

981
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,408
That's incredible.

982
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,210
AGAIN, THESE TWO MAKE AN INVINCIBLE PAIR

983
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,411
Hold on.

984
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,345
I think… Wait.

985
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,248
RO

986
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,449
"Ro"?

987
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,519
I think it's Deungdae-ro.

988
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,688
You think so? I could be Seogu-ro.

989
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,559
THEY FOUND ALL 5 HINTS FROM THE SAFES:
RO, SEO, GU, DAE, DEUNG

990
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,697
THIS IS THE ONLY ROOM
THAT OFFERED NO MISSIONS

991
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,167
What is this? Look!

992
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,037
A SET OF STRANGE QUOTES
IS WRITTEN ON THE BOARD

993
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,806
This must be another hint.

994
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,874
ALL I DID TO AVOID THE BREAKUP
WAS BUT A CHILDISH TANTRUM

995
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,576
OUR LUCKY, HAPPY TIME
PASSED ME BY LIKE A BULLET…

996
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,112
We missed this tiny logo.

997
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,348
-"Let's go to Heundae."
-Is that the title of the song?

998
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,482
Read the first letters together,

999
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,084
and they sound like
"Let's go to Heundae."

1000
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,487
-"Go to Gangalli."
-"Go to Gangalli."

1001
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,357
I think that's it.

1002
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,292
"Let's go to Heundae.
Go to Gangalli."

1003
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,794
Guys, what do you mean by
"Let's go to Heundae. Go to Gangalli"?

1004
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,297
THERE ARE NO PLACES WITH THOSE NAMES

1005
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,365
What do they mean?

1006
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,334
But that's all we can see here.

1007
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,972
IS THAT A DRY ERASER?

1008
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,474
Oh!

1009
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,076
Why did you put this here?

1010
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,112
Maybe a few letters will remain
after I wipe the board.

1011
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,015
I'll go ahead and wipe it clean.

1012
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,783
Yes, some letters still remain.

1013
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,990
That left the letter "byeol" behind.

1014
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,693
ALL THE REMAINING LETTERS SAY "BYEOL"

1015
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,962
I've got the answer!

1016
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,398
DEUNG, DAE, GU, SEO, RO, BYEOL?

1017
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,866
I found them all.

1018
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,901
-Please rearrange them to make sense.
-Oh…

1019
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,971
-Do we have to do that as well?
-Of course.

1020
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,206
Would that give us our next destination?

1021
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,742
You'll have to work with your castmates
to form a complete address.

1022
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,611
-I see.
-I get it now.

1023
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,047
Hey, Woo-young.

1024
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,748
Hey, Woo-jae.

1025
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,384
How many hints did you get?

1026
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,486
Oh, we've got nothing.

1027
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,954
-What?
-You've got nothing?

1028
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,224
I might as well come clean.
We have to ride a zip-line, you see.

1029
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,660
You guys have to ride a zip-line?
Told you.

1030
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,897
LOL

1031
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,534
Are you saying you haven't tried it yet?

1032
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,369
-No, we all took a turn.
-And?

1033
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,237
-We have to do it again.
-We didn't get our hint,

1034
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,772
so we have to keep at it until we do.

1035
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,576
Hey. We're almost done here,
so we'll get there as soon as we can.

1036
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,611
What's your task? Do you just walk around?

1037
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,646
How should I say this?

1038
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,015
We solved about 20 quizzes.

1039
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,617
-Okay.
-Did you call us to brag about that?

1040
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,986
What are you saying, lady?
We are supposed to work together!

1041
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,889
She's had a rough afternoon.
It's a long story.

1042
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,425
-We have a situation with the crew.
-They screwed us big time.

1043
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,060
We are discussing reporting them.

1044
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,664
They're making us zip-line until we tackle
our mission. How ridiculous is that?

1045
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,633
LOL

1046
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,337
We might end up spending the night
on the zip-line course, okay?

1047
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,005
I get that this is a joint project…

1048
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,607
-In that case--
-Hey, Woo-young.

1049
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,008
Is Jin-kyung super upset?

1050
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,777
She's beyond upset.

1051
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,912
She transformed
into Kim Jang-hoon out of the blue.

1052
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,814
THAT CRACKED THEM UP

1053
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,383
She did a flying kick

1054
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,419
and almost sent Director Park
hurtling through the air.

1055
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,023
We barely calmed her down,
persuading her to give the show a year.

1056
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,025
-First things first, Woo-young.
-Yeah?

1057
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,062
Keep on zip-lining without a break
and find the solution.

1058
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,499
Even if we were to zip-line non-stop,
it takes time to return to…

1059
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,767
Whatever. Let's talk later.

1060
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,168
-Okay.
-See you.

1061
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,469
Do we have to get up there?

1062
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,805
We'll put the hint
on the sketchbook this time.

1063
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,373
We'll have it set up properly.

1064
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,641
-Let's go.
-Shall we, then?

1065
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,743
-It won't take long on the bus.
-Let's hurry.

1066
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,677
Let's get that hint.

1067
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,514
-Let's finish this in this round.
-All right.

1068
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,416
-We can't do this twice more.
-Of course not.

1069
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,118
Hello.

1070
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,319
REVISITING THE LAUNCHING AREA

1071
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,754
We've met, haven't we?

1072
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,822
I suppose so?

1073
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,090
REUNION WITH THE OPERATOR

1074
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,826
-Let's do this without a break.
-Get the answer, Sae-ho.

1075
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,228
Do we have
an all-day outdoor shoot tomorrow?

1076
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,630
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

1077
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,033
We'll have breakfast
at the hotel in the morning…

1078
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,202
AT THE HOTEL?

1079
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,905
WE'RE HAVING BREAKFAST AT THE HOTEL?

1080
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,808
-Hey, I just had a breakthrough.
-Like what?

1081
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,143
They booked us hotel rooms.

1082
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,545
Oh, I see.

1083
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,915
-What about it?
-Our next stop is a hotel.

1084
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,283
That's a huge lead.

1085
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,151
-But…
-We can find out which one it is

1086
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,052
using the number.

1087
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,688
No, Jin-kyung.
Let's not put Jong-ho in trouble.

1088
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,590
-I merely tried to feel him out.
-Wait.

1089
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,059
A single question, and he fell for it.

1090
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,327
ON EDGE

1091
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,995
Look, he's all flustered.

1092
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,397
He's panicking, all right.

1093
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,698
Hot damn.

1094
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,068
I've secured a huge lead. A gigantic one.

1095
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,136
WHAT WILL THIS LEAD TO?

1096
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,672
I'm ready to roll!

1097
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,240
Here we go.

1098
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,677
TRYING THE ZIP-LINE AGAIN WITHOUT A FUSS

1099
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,079
Please get the answer, Sae-ho!

1100
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,416
OTHERWISE, I'LL HAVE TO ZIP-LINE AGAIN…

1101
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,252
THAT'S WHEN HE LETS GO OF ONE HAND

1102
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,155
AND STARTS TO WRIGGLE ABOUT

1103
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,791
AS HE IS WELL-HARNESSED,
HE IS PERFECTLY SAFE

1104
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,193
He turned around.
Sae-ho's adjusting his angle.

1105
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,496
RAPIDLY APPROACHING MR. HINT

1106
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,498
TURNS HIS FACE TOWARD MR. HINT
AS BEST AS HE CAN

1107
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,900
TRANSFIXED

1108
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,171
MUMBLING

1109
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,472
HE KEEPS REPEATING SOMETHING…

1110
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,542
DID HE CATCH THE HINT THIS TIME?

1111
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,811
SAE-HO ARRIVES

1112
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,280
That's downright nasty.

1113
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,449
Have you no sense of decency?

1114
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,452
Oops, sorry. I'm rather short.

1115
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,654
Seriously, you went too far.

1116
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,724
You're all so shameless.

1117
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,892
WHAT'S THE ISSUE THIS TIME?

1118
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,393
How could you

1119
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,129
-put a math question there?
-Technically,

1120
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,364
it isn't a math question.

1121
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,698
What do you mean?

1122
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,467
It had 237 something.

1123
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,068
-It's a simple calculation.
-Yeah, that.

1124
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,538
The distinction doesn't matter.

1125
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,708
I think I saw 23, plus symbol, 7,
division symbol, 8, minus symbol, and 9.

1126
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,944
But the thing is,

1127
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,881
you can't get an integer
from that equation.

1128
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,583
-Here's a suggestion.
-What is it?

1129
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,152
-I'll let you call Jin-kyung.
-For real?

1130
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,955
-Sure.
-Okay, I'll tell her what to look out for.

1131
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,690
Answer it.

1132
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,991
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-Woo-young.

1133
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,794
-Yeah?
-These guys are messing with us again.

1134
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:44,695
How?

1135
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,131
Mr. Hint is holding up a sketchbook,

1136
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,966
and you'll see an equation there.

1137
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,401
-Jeez.
-Expect to see

1138
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,837
all the symbols like plus,
minus, multiplication, and division.

1139
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,574
I want you to be ready for it.

1140
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,877
-Focus on the front half, Jin-kyung.
-I'll do that.

1141
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,779
-I'll take care of the rest.
-Good call.

1142
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,415
Don't forget to tie up Director Park.

1143
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,383
-Okay.
-All right, then.

1144
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,785
We're all going down tonight.

1145
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:09,887
Let's end it this time.

1146
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,355
-I'll look at the front half.
-Okay.

1147
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,590
THEY'RE OFF FULLY PREPPED

1148
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,960
I can't take these off yet, can I?

1149
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,062
It's best to be prepared
for all eventualities.

1150
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,430
You're unbelievable.

1151
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,166
CHUCKY IS ON THE LAUNCHING PLATFORM AGAIN

1152
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,968
-You've got this, Jin-kyung!
-You bet!

1153
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:25,603
Let's do this!

1154
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,372
Go get them, Jin-kyung!

1155
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,375
PEEKING

1156
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,444
WHEREABOUTS WAS MR. HINT AGAIN?

1157
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,613
SHE IS APPROACHING MR. HINT ALREADY

1158
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,649
AGAIN, HE WHIZZES BY HER

1159
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,586
Twenty-three plus seven.

1160
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,254
YOU THINK THAT'S ALL THERE IS?

1161
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,557
I get the feeling she's seen it properly.

1162
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,192
Sure, she's the Real Study King.

1163
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,194
EXCHANGING SIGNS FROM DISTANCE

1164
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,528
Oh, okay.

1165
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,297
Did you catch the entire equation?

1166
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,999
-I'm to see the first half.
-I see.

1167
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,266
-I did my part.
-Tell me.

1168
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,968
-It had 23, plus, and 7.
-Right?

1169
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,903
So I was right about 23 plus 7.

1170
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,073
I did my part per our arrangement.

1171
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,309
It had 23, a plus symbol,
7, and a division symbol.

1172
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,343
FULL OF CONVICTION

1173
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,911
Feel free to make another call.

1174
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,881
What? I'm getting a call.

1175
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:11,915
Yo, brother.

1176
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,418
-Hey, brother. Listen closely.
-Okay.

1177
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,287
-I'll tell you what Jin-kyung saw.
-I'm listening.

1178
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,690
-It's 23, plus, and 7.
-Okay.

1179
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:20,924
Then, the answer's 30.

1180
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,993
-A division symbol follows them.
-Yeah?

1181
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,962
What you have to catch
is what follows after that.

1182
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,897
Okay. Consider this mission finished!

1183
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,165
From the symbol, okay?

1184
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,199
-Okay!
-Okay, then.

1185
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,534
I'll catch you later.

1186
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,903
Sure. See you later, alligator.

1187
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,104
-Take care.
-I'll hang up now.

1188
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,372
All right, then.

1189
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,740
-Bye, bro.
-All right.

1190
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,109
-I'll catch you later.
-Sure, hang tight.

1191
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,944
Of course. I hope you've eaten.

1192
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,179
-Let's hang up now.
-Okay.

1193
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,448
-Make sure to clean yourself.
-Come on, dude!

1194
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,983
THIS SKIT WON'T END

1195
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,018
WAS IT ENTERTAINING?

1196
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,354
He told Woo-young to wash himself.

1197
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,526
I can't believe what I just heard.

1198
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:56,927
HANGING UP

1199
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,430
What did he say, though? Seven something?

1200
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,231
Hold on. What did he want me to do?

1201
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,667
I forgot all that
from trying to keep up with the banter.

1202
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,438
THE INTENSE ROLE-PLAYING
MADE HIM FORGET THE HINT

1203
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,673
I remember there being 23, plus, and 7.

1204
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,042
Oh, and a division symbol
comes after them, right?

1205
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,746
-By the way, I secured a huge lead.
-Tell me.

1206
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,281
I know that we'll be staying at a hotel.

1207
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,120
What made you think so?

1208
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,457
-I asked our AD a trick question.
-I see.

1209
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:29,960
I asked him if we'd be having
an all-day outdoor shoot tomorrow.

1210
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:33,130
He then answered, "No,
we'll be having breakfast at the hotel."

1211
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,265
But finding the hotel won't be so easy.

1212
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,768
We now have the upper hand.

1213
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,138
If we look up the combination
of "hotel" and the number from the hint,

1214
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,707
the internet will give us
a hotel with that street number.

1215
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:44,742
TRIUMPHANT

1216
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,110
-I rattled you, didn't I?
-Oh, no.

1217
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,278
-You're bewildered.
-Not at all.

1218
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,681
-Who do you mean by--
-He panicked badly back there.

1219
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,551
ALMOST PASSING OUT

1220
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,420
His neck turned bright red.

1221
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,621
-Still--
-You know what?

1222
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,924
-He made a typo in our group chat.
-He was panic-stricken, that's why.

1223
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,228
Jong-ho may be struggling right now.
We should try to help him out.

1224
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,896
We really should look out for him.

1225
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,564
SAVE OUR POOR ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

1226
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,734
HERE IS ANOTHER PERSON WHO NEEDS HELP

1227
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,037
WOO-YOUNG TAKES OFF FOR THE SECOND TIME

1228
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,039
Let's do this. Come on.

1229
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,076
Oh, please… Allow me
to clear this mission this time.

1230
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,445
I can do this!

1231
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,713
I know I've got this.

1232
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,848
MR. HINT, WOO-YOUNG

1233
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,583
GETS A GLIMPSE

1234
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,887
HE GRITTED HIS TEETH!

1235
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,989
DID WOO-YOUNG CATCH
THE LATTER PART OF THE EQUATION?

1236
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:33,757
Did you see it?

1237
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:34,825
Yeah, we're all set.

1238
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,226
-Okay.
-Okay!

1239
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,395
It's finally over.

1240
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,596
Bring up the navigation app.

1241
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,465
We should be using a web browser instead.

1242
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,001
SMUG

1243
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,171
-Hey, what follows 23, plus, and 7?
-Good work, guys.

1244
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,772
-So, after 23, plus, and 7…
-Tell us.

1245
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,908
-…come a division symbol and six.
-Is that right?

1246
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,544
-The result is five, right?
-Yeah?

1247
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,746
-Oh, no.
-What's the matter?

1248
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,014
It had a minus symbol and nine too.

1249
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,082
-Oh, right.
-There you go.

1250
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,485
-The street number must be 5-9.
-That must be it.

1251
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,519
Hold on.

1252
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,854
Let's write everything down.

1253
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,023
It starts with 23, plus, and 7,

1254
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,425
-followed by a division symbol and six?
-Yeah.

1255
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,794
-Then, a minus symbol and 9?
-A minus symbol and 9.

1256
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,429
The division has a higher precedence,

1257
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,031
but if we applied it here,

1258
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,365
the number gets messy.

1259
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,500
IT LEAVES A REMAINDER

1260
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,368
Are you sure about the seven?

1261
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,937
Are you sure
about the first part, Jin-kyung?

1262
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,138
-Yeah, I saw them.
-Are you sure?

1263
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,306
I have no doubts.

1264
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,375
What's up?
Why did you ask that, Woo-young?

1265
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,611
I missed the first half, you see.

1266
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,680
-From focusing on the other part?
-Yeah.

1267
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:30,981
Could this part be wrong?

1268
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,449
What did you see, Sae-ho?

1269
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,119
I told you what I saw on my arrival.
I saw 23, plus, 7,

1270
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,755
followed by a division symbol and eight.

1271
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:39,790
And?

1272
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,259
Guys, I think it's 8 instead of 6.
Let's roll with that.

1273
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,628
-I saw an eight initially.
-Run the numbers with that.

1274
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,063
Why did you see it as six, then?

1275
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,965
-That's how it looked to me.
-Jeez.

1276
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,200
Seriously, what is his problem?

1277
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,002
-See if it works with an eight.
-Let's try it.

1278
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,004
CALCULATING 23+7÷8-9

1279
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,140
That's 119 over 8.

1280
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,242
Yeah, 119 over 8.

1281
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,810
THE RESULT IS STILL NOT AN INTEGER

1282
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,777
Oh, dear…

1283
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,112
Eight doesn't belong there.

1284
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,715
-Get your ass back up there.
-I'll take another turn.

1285
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,049
I meant Woo-young.

1286
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,584
-He's the one who missed it.
-No, I didn't!

1287
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,487
SQUABBLING UNTIL THE END

1288
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,523
Tell us. Did we misread the numbers?

1289
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,592
-Just a little bit.
-Damn it.

1290
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,795
I'll go up there and make it quick.

1291
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,197
-You, Sae-ho?
-Yeah.

1292
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:21,798
Off you go.

1293
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,433
Okay. Come with me, Woo-young.

1294
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,069
I need backup in case I get it wrong.

1295
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,939
-All right. Let's go.
-Woo-young and I'll go.

1296
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,073
See you, Jin-kyung.

1297
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,775
Good luck.

1298
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,278
Who zip-lines the same course three times?

1299
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:35,646
Thanks for the ride.

1300
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,047
What a shame.

1301
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,016
I'll go first and get things settled.

1302
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,684
No, I'll tidy up things first.

1303
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,618
EXCHANGING SILLY JOKES

1304
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,654
-…nice and neat.
-Hey, isn't that our team's ride?

1305
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,554
You're right.

1306
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,455
HI, GUYS

1307
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:46,723
SPEEDING BY

1308
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,058
It's Sae-ho.

1309
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,326
Where are they returning from?

1310
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,461
CAN'T YOU GUESS?

1311
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,530
They must be heading up for another try.

1312
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,466
My goodness.
We're the true winners of this trip.

1313
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,903
THEY'RE VISITING THE LAUNCHING AREA
FOR THE THIRD TIME NOW

1314
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,905
Do you see how her expression is changing?

1315
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,441
She looks very tired now.

1316
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:05,342
Welcome back.

1317
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,311
Has anyone else zip-lined
three times a day?

1318
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,680
-We operators do that.
-Oh, right.

1319
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,283
I guess we've reached your level.

1320
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,052
Which part do I check?

1321
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,387
Are you sure
about there being "6-9" by the end?

1322
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,056
-It seemed that way.
-Oh yeah?

1323
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,358
But I'm not sure.
I can't be held responsible.

1324
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,495
-Don't chew me out, okay?
-I can't believe what he's saying.

1325
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,231
You're the reason why I feel the need
to check the whole equation.

1326
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,967
Don't try to pin the blame on others.

1327
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,635
Just do your part right.

1328
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,805
-Dang it.
-Focus on pulling your weight.

1329
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,141
-Come on, when have I ever not?
-Enough of this blame game.

1330
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,011
Are they zip-lining now or what?
What's going on?

1331
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,548
-How much progress have you made so far?
-Did you finish your task?

1332
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,050
Tell us your progress, Jin-kyung.

1333
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,886
-As we come down the course…
-Hello.

1334
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,422
-Yeah?
-Can you see the man hanging there?

1335
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,459
We need to see the hint
written on his sketchbook.

1336
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,894
-Is that single task it?
-Yeah.

1337
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,229
And you're still working on it?

1338
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,530
-Yeah.
-What?

1339
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:01,665
SELF-CONSCIOUS

1340
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh, come on, guys.

1341
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,935
-We brought six hints.
-Don't act so surprised.

1342
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,671
-Hold up. So there's just one task?
-Yeah.

1343
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,107
Will we get one letter
from solving this equation?

1344
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,575
Yeah.

1345
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,811
-I've secured a huge lead, though.
-We have six letters.

1346
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,446
-I have something major.
-What is it?

1347
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,016
The crew booked us a hotel.

1348
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,386
Here's the thing.
There are about 300 hotels in Busan.

1349
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,189
A SHARP RETORT FROM A NATIVE BUSANIAN

1350
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,492
It's getting cold now.

1351
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,659
This better be our last round.

1352
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,731
I feel at home being strung up here.

1353
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,133
-Don't forget to call me.
-Okay.

1354
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,503
HERE HE GOES ON HIS 3RD ATTEMPT

1355
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,672
HERE'S TO HOPING THIS IS THE LAST RIDE

1356
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,108
I'm going to get it right!

1357
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,243
Let's do this!

1358
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,310
DESPERATE

1359
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,580
STARTS MUMBLING

1360
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,783
AS SOON AS HE HAS PASSED MR. HINT BY

1361
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:56,153
TURNS AROUND TO SEE UNTIL THE END

1362
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,955
Here he comes. Give us the numbers.

1363
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,058
-Did you see the numbers?
-Tell us.

1364
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:01,992
Did you?

1365
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,293
Did you not see them?

1366
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,063
That punk must've missed them.

1367
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,631
-Dang it.
-Did you see them or not?

1368
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:08,632
That's not it.

1369
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,267
GIGGLING

1370
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,903
-We need those numbers, Sae-ho.
-What is up with him?

1371
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,838
I mean…

1372
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,739
What's wrong?

1373
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,074
TEARS

1374
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,209
-Don't tell me you missed the hint.
-No, not exactly.

1375
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,978
I had my eyes wide open to see it clearly,

1376
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,081
but then the wind blasted into my eyes.

1377
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,483
That made me tear up.

1378
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,219
That made me tear up.

1379
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,255
-So you missed the hint?
-The sketchbook was pixelized,

1380
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,423
all because of those tears.

1381
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,525
-Still, I saw the hint.
-How does it go?

1382
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,993
-Twenty-three.
-Yeah?

1383
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,365
COME ON, SAE-HO…

1384
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,301
I also saw an eight somewhere.

1385
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,236
-Hey!
-Come on!

1386
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:50,207
-What is the matter with you?
-Wait, I just don't get it.

1387
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,642
-What have they been doing?
-What have they accomplished?

1388
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,877
These guys had a rough day.

1389
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,778
-Dude!
-I mean--

1390
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,547
Don't snap at me.
I zip-lined my way three times already.

1391
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,050
I didn't mean to snap.
I only meant to ask…

1392
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,652
-We got the 23 plus 7 part right.
-What's that?

1393
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,421
These are the hints we found.

1394
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,692
We secured six one-syllable letters,
including deung, dae, gu, seo, ro, byeol.

1395
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:12,996
We need the hint that you three
have been working on

1396
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,698
-to get the full address.
-Okay.

1397
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,167
If you ask me, the number here…

1398
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,336
-It's likely a street number.
-The "ro" must mean street here.

1399
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,372
-It must go after the street name, then.
-Yeah, and the number would go with it.

1400
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,174
We need to assemble
the remaining five here.

1401
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,609
I think the district name is Seo-gu.

1402
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,278
-Seo-gu…
-There's a district with that name here.

1403
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,613
-Dongseong-ro.
-What?

1404
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,948
Could it be Byeoldeungdae-ro
or Deungdaerobyeol?

1405
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,550
No, it's probably the former.

1406
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,753
-Look up if there is Byeoldeungdae-ro.
-Byeoldeungdae-ro?

1407
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,321
-Excuse me.
-Can't we use the internet?

1408
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:40,123
You can call your friends,

1409
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,225
-but the internet--
-Why didn't you answer my call?

1410
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,127
-Why didn't you pick up?
-I was working here.

1411
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,463
-You should've answered our call.
-Why didn't you, Director?

1412
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,265
Like I said, I was working here.

1413
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,367
-If only I hadn't teared up…
-Sook.

1414
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,503
-Let's call our Busanian friends…
-I'm sure about Seo-gu.

1415
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,105
How's it going, Woo-young?

1416
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,440
Enough of that. How did it go?

1417
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,775
Anyhow, it's me, your bro.

1418
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,810
-I'll tell you how it went this time.
-So?

1419
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,580
I teared up from forcing my eyes wide open
and didn't get to see clearly.

1420
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,448
…and didn't get to see clearly.

1421
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,449
HANGS UP

1422
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,418
Even a dog wouldn't buy that crap.

1423
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,654
I'm so sick of this.

1424
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,290
-It's driving me insane.
-Same here!

1425
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,625
Don't you have Busanian friends?

1426
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,961
-Woo-young.
-Wait, I need to tell him something.

1427
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:18,862
So, Woo-young,

1428
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,064
I think the latter part is 6 minus 9.

1429
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,699
And that's what I told you earlier.

1430
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,467
-Check out the initial part.
-Heck no!

1431
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,802
Wait, Woo-young.

1432
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,705
-Six minus nine?
-Is there a street called Byeoldeungdae-ro

1433
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,508
in Seo-gu? "Byeol" as in star,
and "deungdae" as in lighthouse?

1434
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,676
Well…

1435
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,477
You'll have to ask the stars.

1436
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,046
-Let me check that.
-I hung up on him.

1437
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,581
Okay. Give me a second.

1438
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,749
SHOULD I DITCH THIS SUPPOSED BESTIES TRIP?

1439
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:40,650
I'm fed up.

1440
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,521
Let's make this count
so we can call it a day.

1441
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,689
I sure hope so.

1442
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,624
LAUGHS ABASHED

1443
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,859
Please!

1444
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,295
-Mr. Hint deserves a raise.
-Let's focus.

1445
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,332
WHETHER EVERYONE CAN CLOCK OUT

1446
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,970
AS WELL AS MR. HINT'S WELL-BEING
HINGES ON WOO-YOUNG!

1447
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,037
-Please…
-Eyes to the front.

1448
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,340
Please… We've had enough.

1449
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,842
-Here we go.
-Please let us call it a day!

1450
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,978
I want to go home!

1451
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,613
LEAVING WORK IS A CHALLENGE TODAY

1452
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,014
Look, here comes Woo-young.

1453
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,449
Please let him see the numbers.

1454
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,050
PLEASE SEE THEM…

1455
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,519
TURNING ON THE EAGLE EYE MODE

1456
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,555
All right, let's all go home!

1457
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,358
I'm going to see those numbers.

1458
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,826
MR. HINT, WOO-YOUNG

1459
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:25,996
DID HE MANAGE TO SEE THEM?

1460
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,531
-Oh, please…
-It's a lot faster than you'd think.

1461
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,204
WHY IS HE GRITTING HIS TEETH
AND SHUTTING HIS EYES?

1462
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,538
Did you see them?

1463
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,506
A CRYPTIC EXPRESSION

1464
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,341
He must've missed them. Did you get them?

1465
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,511
-Write down what you memorized.
-His eyes are bloodshot.

1466
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,179
Go on. Take the pen.

1467
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,248
-There is an eight in the middle.
-See? I told you.

1468
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,050
-Whereabouts is it?
-There was seven.

1469
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,752
I think eight came
after the division symbol.

1470
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,288
Why do you sound so unsure?
Did you not see properly?

1471
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,290
That's rich. You didn't take another turn!

1472
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,891
-I mean…
-Don't be a pill.

1473
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,526
-You aren't sure.
-Twenty-three plus seven.

1474
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,162
-I can't take this anymore.
-Do we get 86, then?

1475
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,898
-I saw an eight here.
-I saw it too.

1476
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,066
-Right?
-Yeah.

1477
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,869
-Eight goes somewhere in the middle.
-He's right.

1478
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,574
I've got it!

1479
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,077
This must be it. I've got it.

1480
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,579
What follows 23 and the plus symbol
must be 78.

1481
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,415
Add a division symbol,
6, a minus symbol, and 9…

1482
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,886
If 78 follows 23 after the plus symbol,

1483
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,555
-we can get 13 from the division.
-So it was 78 all along.

1484
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:26,690
WE GOT AN INTEGER!

1485
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,059
Add 13 to 23 and subtract 9…

1486
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,394
-Then, we get 27.
-The answer is 27.

1487
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,496
The answer is 27!

1488
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,632
What followed 23 was 78!

1489
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,535
Our task was to divide 78 by 6,
add 23, and subtract 9.

1490
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,537
Tell us it's right!

1491
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,705
EXPLODES IN EXASPERATION

1492
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,473
Hurry!

1493
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,476
THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE TIME
OR THE ENERGY TO ZIP-LINE AGAIN

1494
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,812
IS 27 THE ANSWER?

1495
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,880
Sae-ho, that is correct.

1496
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,049
PURE JOY

1497
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,051
Let's turn.

1498
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,455
THE JOINT MISSION ENDS IN SUCCESS

1499
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,658
So what followed 23
after the plus symbol was 78!

1500
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,227
-Gosh, Sae-ho. This thing here…
-It was epic.

1501
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:07,097
-Byeoldeungdae-ro, Seo-gu, Busan.
-Seo-gu.

1502
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,834
Okay, we got 27. So our hotel
is somewhere in Seo-gu, Busan.

1503
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,203
THEY ARE STILL UNCERTAIN
ABOUT THE STREET NAME

1504
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,839
HOW DO YOU MAKE A PROPER ONE
WITH DEUNG, DAE, BYEOL, AND RO?

1505
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,174
Deungdae-ro!
The address must be 27 Deungdae-ro!

1506
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,009
-I'm sure of it.
-What about "byeol"?

1507
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,678
-You said we're booked at a hotel.
-Its stars.

1508
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,679
A five-star hotel?

1509
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,514
Let me count. One. Two…

1510
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,351
Three. Four.

1511
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,054
-Five.
-It's a five-star hotel, then.

1512
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,990
So we're staying at a five-star hotel
in 27 Deungdae-ro.

1513
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,727
Is our destination a five-star hotel
at 27 Deungdae-ro, Seo-gu, Busan?

1514
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,796
COME ON…

1515
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,965
PLEASE TELL US WE'RE RIGHT

1516
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,868
-That is correct.
-Yes!

1517
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,370
That's where we're staying?

1518
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,972
A 5-STAR HOTEL FOR US?

1519
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,974
Let's give him a big hand.

1520
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,643
Thank you for your trouble.

1521
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,012
-Thank you.
-You were amazing.

1522
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,782
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK
MR. KANG WON-IL FOR HIS HELP

1523
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,016
Let's take a photo.

1524
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,851
-Great work, everyone.
-Thank you.

1525
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,487
WE HAD A GREAT TIME THANKS TO YOU

1526
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,523
Our Besties Trip hasn't ended yet.

1527
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,291
Oh, that's our theme today.

1528
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,027
Besties Trip…
That sounds so random, doesn't it?

1529
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,196
-It sounds so forced.
-You have the address, right?

1530
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,966
If the accommodation you found
is indeed the one we prepared,

1531
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,903
you will find a reservation
under Sook's name.

1532
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,105
-You didn't have to, Sook.
-My gosh.

1533
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,006
I guess it feels nice.

1534
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,607
We'll we get great food too?

1535
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:25,675
Of course.

1536
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:26,943
I hope we get a proper dinner.

1537
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,213
-Look forward to one.
-Is the hotel somewhere we might know?

1538
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,147
LOOK, GUYS

1539
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:34,584
-Let's go and see.
-It seems to be in the Songdo area.

1540
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,652
-Oh, my.
-Goodness.

1541
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,387
If you ask me…

1542
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,955
Isn't it a brand-new place?

1543
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,123
ARE THEY STAYING IN A HIP SPOT?

1544
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,026
I bet the hotel has been in business
for less than a year.

1545
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,028
When you get there,
approach the owner discreetly

1546
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,297
and ask if there's a reservation
under Sook's name.

1547
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,765
-That made me anxious.
-Let's go.

1548
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:49,999
-It's all over.
-Let's move.

1549
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,936
-We're finally set. Good work!
-Thank you, everyone!

1550
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,439
-Let's gather at Songdo Beach later.
-Thank you.

1551
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,374
BESTIES TRIP IN BUSAN
TO BE CONTINUED…

1552
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,244
ONE HOUR LATER

1553
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,213
Min-su's chocolate sticks!

1554
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,015
Min-su then felt conflicted
about something.

1555
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,785
Min-su dropped by
a fried chicken place too.

1556
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,920
Perhaps to gain information
on the chocolate sticks?

1557
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,589
But there was only info
on Marine Crackers.

1558
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,624
HERE SHE GOES ABOUT CHICKEN AGAIN

1559
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,526
Min-su stopped midway
to think things over.

1560
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,760
THEIR FRIENDSHIP IS TESTED AGAIN

00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,330
