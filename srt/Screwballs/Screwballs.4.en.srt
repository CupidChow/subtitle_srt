00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,136
KILLER BOOT CAMP
FINAL EPISODE

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,805
-It seems like…
-Are we in an industrial area?

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,507
WHERE ARE THEY?

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,942
Is this a futsal field?

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,245
What the… Are we playing soccer?

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,346
EXPLORING THE SET

7
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:17,217
They must've prepared something
like the pentathlon from Squid Game 2.

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,453
-It does seem that way.
-Isn't it inspired by Squid Game 2?

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,355
-Please come to the center.
-Wow.

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,857
This should be fun.

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,095
Now, only the final training
of the Killer Boot Camp remains.

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,699
One of the key prerequisites of killers

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,934
-is superb physical abilities.
-Sure.

14
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,671
Let me remind you of the code of conduct.
"Killers are strong."

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:39,739
I should warm up.

16
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,008
The physical training we prepared for you

17
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,811
is called the Six-legged Race.

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,314
You'll run across the pitch
with your legs tied together

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,583
as you tackle five missions.

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,153
Take on one mission each.

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,589
You can move on to the next game
only when you succeed.

22
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,991
-Okay.
-I can't believe this.

23
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,660
You have five minutes
to cross the finishing line

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,530
-Only five?
-and complete the race.

25
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,165
Is there a penalty for a failure?

26
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,834
As today is the first shoot of Screwballs,

27
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,503
-a team dinner is planned later.
-Of course.

28
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,372
-And?
-What's this about?

29
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,607
If you fail to complete the race,

30
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,109
you will have to

31
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,678
cover the cost of the team dinner.

32
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,181
A REMINDER:
ALL CREW WILL BE THERE

33
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,382
What if we succeed?

34
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,017
If you succeed,

35
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,819
despite the staggering economy…

36
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,154
WHAT IS THIS TALK
ABOUT THE ECONOMY?

37
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,557
…the small business owner
will pay the bill.

38
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,329
-And that's you, right?
-The economy…

39
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,298
-Okay.
-Why did you bring up

40
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,934
-the economy and small business owner?
-Well…

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,168
What's with the rambling?

42
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,270
I didn't plan to,
but I'm on my knees here.

43
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,005
So? Will you be paying for it?

44
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,509
Actually, the production company will.
But the thing is…

45
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,612
The bill's bound to rack up.
It's going to cost a fortune.

46
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,214
Wait, look.

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,484
Let's say we gave the games a go.

48
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,087
If they turn out to be too much
to finish within two hours,

49
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,689
we'll consider it your ploy.

50
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,491
Oh, we set it up perfectly.

51
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,493
Before you arrived,

52
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,062
-we had run multiple trial simulations.
-I see.

53
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,099
Still, on the off chance you fail,

54
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,934
you can decide whether you'll split

55
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,636
-the bill or not.
-Let's make it fun.

56
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,938
-We'll leave it up to you.
-We'll think of a way

57
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:23,209
to divide up the cost
by 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 8% and 2%.

58
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,410
BUT THAT TOTALS 120%

59
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,246
-That's my proposal.
-That equals 120%.

60
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,480
-What?
-No, it's…

61
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,350
-Add up 50, 30, and 20.
-That's 100.

62
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,152
HEHEHE

63
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,586
Told you. He's a boar.

64
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,888
A BOAR'S IQ IS 80

65
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,122
Me?

66
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,757
Allow me to introduce the games.

67
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,859
-What they are matters.
-Of course.

68
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,960
First up…

69
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,596
Before we do that,

70
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,865
let's decide on the player order randomly.

71
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,000
Come on!

72
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,835
STRONG RESISTANCE

73
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,838
-Didn't you say you watched Squid Game 2?
-But that's--

74
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,974
Each character is allowed to choose
a game that they're good at.

75
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,943
You've gotten sly
now that you're the boss.

76
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,479
This is purely
for the viewer's entertainment.

77
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,482
Won't it be nice to have a game
assigned to you by fate?

78
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,651
I'm no game expert, so I'm clueless.

79
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,587
-Shall we assign games randomly?
-I can't say. I'm freezing.

80
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,422
Must be because
you're wearing short sleeves.

81
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,424
-Yeah.
-Warm yourself up over there.

82
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,226
-Where?
-By the heater.

83
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,827
SKIPPING

84
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,897
It's warm here.

85
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,202
WHILE JIN-KYUNG WARMS HERSELF UP

86
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,104
KNIFE-FOOT
MAKES A SECRETIVE ARRANGEMENT

87
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,773
If we end up failing,

88
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,841
-we'll have to decide who will pay 50%.
-Right.

89
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,410
-When we do…
-Yeah?

90
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,011
Here's what I want.

91
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,446
Let's set her up.

92
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,982
-In a game of rock, paper, scissors…
-She might not realize.

93
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,383
We'll all go with the rock.

94
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,254
We only need to decide
which game will determine who pays 50%.

95
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,156
It's so cold.

96
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,724
Someone with a different sign?

97
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,094
KILLERS DECEIVE EACH OTHER
RIGHT UNDER THEIR NOSES

98
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,763
-Let's go with a different sign.
-Okay.

99
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,031
A SECRET PACT IS MADE

100
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,499
-Is it warm there?
-And the games?

101
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,567
Yeah.

102
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,803
And so… Hey, come here.

103
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,005
We'll have Jin-kyung play the last game

104
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,573
and blame her if she fails.

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,342
-Okay.
-So she'd pay for 50%?

106
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,010
-Let's guilt-trip her.
-That's diabolical.

107
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,347
Okay. Jin-kyung will play the last game.

108
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
WHAT WILL BE JIN-KYUNG'S FATE?

109
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,852
Let me check the order you decided on.

110
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,454
-Number One.
-Sook goes first.

111
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,555
-Woo-jae next.
-Number Two.

112
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,889
-Number Three.
-Sae-ho goes third.

113
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,224
-Number Four.
-Woo-young goes fourth.

114
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,360
-Number Five.
-Jin-kyung plays last. Great.

115
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,761
So, Number One.

116
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,997
-Here I am.
-Here's your mission.

117
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,000
You'll have to whistle
after finishing a hot potato.

118
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,601
I'm no good with hot food.

119
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,069
-I'm so relieved.
-I'm sorry.

120
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,205
-But you're set on playing.
-I could never do that.

121
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,539
So that's why she said that!

122
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,708
When I was taking a tour
to check out the games,

123
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,345
I overheard this lady crew say something.

124
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,315
She said,
"We'll use it when it's piping hot."

125
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,086
I kept wondering what she meant by that.
Now I get it.

126
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,621
Who was it?

127
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:50,923
WOO-JAE PASSING BY

128
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,325
Make it as hot as possible.

129
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,128
Someone definitely said that in the back.

130
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,195
SUCH GOOD HEARING

131
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,299
Listen, guys.
Here's a piece of advice for you.

132
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,900
There are five of you, right?

133
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,568
Blow on it together to cool it down.

134
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,806
LIKE THIS?

135
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,441
That sounds disgusting.

136
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,076
I can't handle that.

137
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,278
I'm squeamish, you know.

138
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,481
-At any rate, that's the first game.
-Could I eat it, though?

139
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,849
Number Two.

140
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,319
You'll have to score goals
over your head while lying down.

141
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,788
And what's that supposed to mean?

142
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,723
All five of you will lie down.

143
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,294
Woo-jae will then have to get three balls
in the box placed above his head.

144
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,431
The people next to him
will have to lift their legs, too.

145
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,567
The third mission is Be a Lady Killer.

146
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,936
You'll wear tights holding a ball

147
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,940
and swish it around to make five women
fall head over heels, literally.

148
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,675
Number Four. Here's your mission.

149
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,244
We have named it the Pelvis Cup.

150
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,312
Isn't Woo-young playing?

151
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,380
-Yeah.
-How's your pelvis?

152
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,815
Good. This sounds promising.

153
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,317
Thrust your hip

154
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,520
to get the dangling ball
in the cone worn around your waist.

155
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,588
What?

156
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,325
He doesn't have much baggage,
so he should be fine.

157
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,260
Why do we keep circling back to my groin?

158
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,065
CHECK OUT EPISODE 1
FOR HIS BATHROOM FIASCO

159
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,234
Here's the fifth and final game.

160
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,435
You must all know this,

161
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,137
but the pentathlon
in Squid Game 2 features

162
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,773
-Flying Stone?
-Flying Stone.

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,677
On our show, you'll throw your shoes
to overturn the water bottles.

164
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,679
But note that you'll have to use
your tied-up leg.

165
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,048
Wait, then I'd have to
kick out my leg, too.

166
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,417
Finish all missions within five minutes

167
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,220
and cross the finish line together
to complete the training.

168
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,922
-You have three chances.
-Damn it.

169
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,759
-Is it a wrap if we succeed at once?
-Sure.

170
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,428
Please go to the starting line
and tie up your legs.

171
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,630
STARTING LINE
1. HOT POTATO

172
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,698
2. BALL CARRIER

173
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,766
3. BE A LADY KILLER

174
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,833
4. PELVIS CUP

175
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,668
5. FLYING SHOE
FINISH LINE

176
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,738
FIRST, A STRATEGY MEETING

177
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,440
On the count of one,
Sook, Jin-kyung, and I

178
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,876
-are moving our right foot.
-Let's link our arms.

179
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,779
When we start the count,
we'll put our right foot down first.

180
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,213
WORKED OUT WHICH FOOT
TO PUT DOWN FIRST

181
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,015
Excuse me, Sun-hui.

182
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,884
I can smell the potatoes burning.

183
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,218
Give it a rest.

184
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,687
Just how hot are you trying to make them?

185
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,822
It's not that bad.

186
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,390
IT GOT A BIT SMOKY, THAT'S ALL

187
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:05,958
HERE'S THE PELVIS CUP

188
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,226
That's hilarious.

189
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,829
I have to keep it on?

190
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,865
I should keep getting hit?

191
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,767
Won't I look…

192
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,536
YOU LOOK JUST FINE

193
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,070
Guys, I'm an idol.

194
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,672
Let's see you try it.

195
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,443
Come on, we have to move together.

196
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,510
Let's go.

197
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,078
That's it. Get the ball moving.

198
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,847
Build it up. This is it!

199
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:28,915
WOW

200
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,082
Well done.

201
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,751
IT'S GREAT HE'S GOOD AT IT, BUT…

202
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,852
But…

203
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,353
But…

204
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,088
-How magnificent.
-I mean…

205
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,458
Still, it's rather awkward, isn't it?

206
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,661
Director, can't we blur my lower body?

207
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,162
This is weird as hell.

208
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,230
IT ONLY LOOKS WEIRDER

209
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,332
-Are you all ready?
-Link your arms with me.

210
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,633
Which foot do we move first?

211
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,268
-The right foot.
-That's correct.

212
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,703
Ready.

213
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,838
FIRST ATTEMPT BEGINS NOW

214
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,907
-One, two.
-One, two.

215
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,109
THEY ARRIVED AT THE FIRST
MISSION POINT IN NO TIME

216
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,644
Wolf it down.

217
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,712
It's so hot.

218
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,682
You can do it, Sook.

219
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,950
Gosh, look at the steam.

220
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,518
-Watch out the spit.
-You can eat anything.

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,554
You can do it.

222
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,990
THEY COMBINE THEIR SPIT…
NO, THEIR STRENGTH TOGETHER

223
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,124
Man, I'm dizzy.

224
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,459
DIZZY

225
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,196
THE POTATO IS WAY TOO HOT FOR
SOOK TO CARE ABOUT HIS DIZZINESS

226
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,365
You can do it.

227
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,000
It's so hot.

228
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,068
DON'T WORRY

229
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,303
SAE-HO'S HERE TO COOL IT DOWN

230
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,541
WE'LL HELP
UNTIL OUR LUNGS GIVE OUT

231
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,977
This is disgusting.

232
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,946
OPEN UP

233
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,015
-There we go.
-Go on. Whistle.

234
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,017
She's got it.

235
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,085
SPAT IT BACK OUT

236
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,987
-What's going on?
-It's too hot.

237
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,989
You can even stomach fishing bait.

238
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,624
You've got this, Sook.

239
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,058
SPITTING IT OUT AGAIN

240
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,960
NOPE, I CAN'T DO THIS

241
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028
Come on, Sook.

242
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,163
Let us hear you whistle.

243
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,099
Let's hear that whistle.

244
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,433
Whistle.

245
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,302
-Okay, let's move.
-Off we go.

246
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,470
-One, two.
-One, two.

247
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,538
PERFECT TEAMWORK

248
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,307
INCREDIBLE SPEED

249
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,409
Lie down! Form a line.

250
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,077
NOT A MOMENT OF HESITATION

251
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,547
GRIPPING THE BALL TIGHTLY
WITH SKINNY LEGS

252
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,782
One, two, three.

253
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,886
THIS WON'T FLY

254
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,022
-Wait, this won't work.
-How do we do this?

255
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,957
HERE'S YOUR NEW BALL

256
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,825
-Tell us when you're ready.
-Listen.

257
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
THE TEAM'S BRAIN
COMES UP WITH A PLAN

258
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,765
Swing up your legs on the count of three.

259
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,335
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

260
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,470
-It was so close.
-Where did it go?

261
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,972
We can do this.

262
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,107
The plan works. Let's try it again.

263
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,677
THEY GOT THIS PART NAILED DOWN

264
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,945
-Three!
-Three!

265
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,113
-Damn it.
-We're getting the hang of it!

266
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,548
We really are. One more time.

267
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,649
I'm sorry,

268
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,319
but the ones next to me… They are…

269
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,854
-They're both too short!
-Shut it!

270
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,922
Sorry, but…

271
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,558
188 CM BETWEEN 160 CM

272
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,793
-Shut it!
-Sorry, but…

273
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,127
START AGAIN ANYWAY

274
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,330
-One, two…
-One, two…

275
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,198
HURRAH

276
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,933
ROLLING AWAY

277
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,468
BUBBLING WITH FRUSTRATION

278
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,803
We just need to get one in.

279
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,004
-Okay.
-Let's just get one in.

280
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,072
Here we go.

281
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,708
1 GOAL CAN FINISH THIS GAME OFF
WILL THEY SUCCEED THIS TIME?

282
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,842
-Three!
-Three!

283
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,344
GOAL

284
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,578
Did it really go in?

285
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,313
DID THEY REALLY SUCCEED?

286
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,348
Are we done?

287
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,983
BUT…

288
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,986
SOMEONE SECRETLY HAD
THEIR HAND ON THE BOX

289
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,624
TO TILT UP THE BOX
THE MOMENT THE BALL WAS TOSSED

290
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,125
NO ONE NOTICED HER CHEATING

291
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,927
A SIDE GLANCE

292
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,396
SOOK-WRECK'S HANDS
ARE FASTER THAN HUMAN EYES

293
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,032
-These guys are too short.
-Here we go again.

294
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,667
-Right, left.
-Right, left.

295
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,836
THEY LEAVE THE TRUTH HIDDEN
AND GO TO THE BLIND DATE SPOT

296
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,671
WADDLING

297
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,739
BALL CARRIER DELAYED THEM

298
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,140
-Move out, everyone.
-Right, left.

299
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,208
Help us out, Sae-ho.

300
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,843
-Get on the floor!
-Duck down.

301
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,212
HONG JIN-KYUNG'S HEART

302
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,081
WHILE THE LINEUP
IS RATHER QUESTIONABLE

303
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,384
SAE-HO IS GEARING UP
TO WIN THEIR HEARTS

304
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,519
SNIPER CHO APPROACHES THE LADIES

305
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,221
-This is scary.
-Okay!

306
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,889
JANG WON-YOUNG, KARINA

307
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,257
HE WON JANG WON-YOUNG
AND KARINA'S HEARTS

308
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,325
IN THIS WRETCHED STATE

309
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,561
HE TAKES JIN-KYUNG'S HEART TOO
WITH HIS SCRUNCHED-UP FACE

310
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,563
Move in. There you go.

311
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,032
Slow down a bit.

312
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,667
We're almost there, Sae-ho.

313
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,769
SURPRISINGLY,
HE EARNED SUZY'S HEART TOO

314
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,438
THE ONLY REMAINING TARGET
IS GO YOUN-JUNG

315
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,407
We need a long stroke.

316
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,142
-Reach out further. Go!
-Just a bit more.

317
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,543
BUT SHE WON'T OPEN UP HER HEART

318
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,811
Just a bit further!

319
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,379
WOO-JAE HAS ALMOST GIVEN UP

320
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,114
AFTER THE LONG
AND PATHETIC COURTSHIP

321
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,849
-He's done it.
-Okay.

322
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,052
HE WON ALL 5 WOMEN'S HEARTS

323
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,020
-Hurry. We're running out of time.
-Ready, go.

324
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,121
THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT

325
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,690
-One, two.
-One, two.

326
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,558
WHY IS HE STILL WEARING IT?

327
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,126
Clear it in one go, Woo-young.

328
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,695
THEY ARRIVED
AT THE FOURTH MISSION POINT

329
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,130
THE STRING GOT TANGLED UP,
COSTING THEM PRECIOUS TIME

330
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,765
HE BARELY MANAGES TO UNTANGLE IT

331
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,201
Finish it in one go, Woo-young.
You were fantastic earlier.

332
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,335
A SUCCESSFUL DRILL EARLIER

333
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,403
Let's do this.

334
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,105
PELVIS REVVING UP

335
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,239
THUD

336
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,607
OH, DEAR

337
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,776
IGNORING THE PAIN,
HE TRIES AGAIN

338
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,844
Two…

339
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,879
SUCCESS

340
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,614
KILLERS HAVE SEXY PELVISES

341
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,682
Here we go.

342
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,485
IN A HIDEOUS STATE

343
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,454
THEY CHARGE
TO THE FINAL BATTLEGROUND

344
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,521
FIFTH GAME
FLYING SHOE

345
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,657
Jin-kyung, give me a cue.

346
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,559
We could kick on the count of three or--

347
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,427
-Hurry. We're running out of time.
-Just do it.

348
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,563
-Two,
-Two,

349
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,264
-three!
-three!

350
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,966
-Three!
-My gosh!

351
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,668
-We have to get it back.
-Oh, man.

352
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,237
WORKING TOGETHER
TO PICK UP A SINGLE SHOE

353
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,305
There you go.

354
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,639
-Let's move back. Here goes.
-Okay!

355
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,610
-One, two!
-One, two!

356
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,778
Jin-kyung.

357
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,714
-Clear out one of the sides.
-I'll take out the left.

358
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,283
FOR WOO-JAE'S IDEA TO WORK,
THEY NEED A DECENT AIM

359
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,518
Damn it!

360
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,186
-One, two.
-One, two.

361
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,489
Didn't we run out of time?

362
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,090
-Well…
-One, two.

363
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,258
Time's up.

364
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,760
THEY TIMED OUT LONG AGO

365
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,862
-Wait, but we still have a chance.
-Even so…

366
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,730
WORN OUT

367
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,665
-This is difficult.
-Ball Carrier ate up our time.

368
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,734
WHILE THE OTHERS
BUSILY DISCUSS STRATEGIES…

369
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,237
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT TO SAY

370
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,304
Woo-jae and I can swap.

371
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,539
These two beside me were too…

372
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,608
I almost thought my ankles
were tied to their wrists.

373
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,577
-They were so short.
-It's a total mistake on our part.

374
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,679
-Give us some time to strategize.
-Go ahead.

375
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,149
-Okay, let's get over there.
-Here we go.

376
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,383
Can't we just untie our legs?

377
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,485
ARE YOU A GENIUS OR WHAT?
THAT NEVER OCCURRED TO US…

378
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,556
WOO-JAE'S INGENIOUS IDEA
GIVES THEM A MOMENT OF FREEDOM

379
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,757
Flying Shoe is difficult.

380
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,993
Would you rather eat the potato?

381
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,262
Can I do that?
I can eat hot food no problem.

382
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,863
If you ask me…

383
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,198
NEED TO CHANGE THE ORDER

384
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,500
-I'd better take Flying Shoe.
-Good idea.

385
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,935
-I have huge feet, you know.
-Right.

386
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,136
NO CHANGE TO WOO-YOUNG

387
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,173
Jin-kyung can tackle Hot Potato,
and I'll handle Ball Carrier.

388
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,274
Okay.

389
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,342
LINEUP SWAP

390
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,410
HOT POTATO: JIN-KYUNG
BALL CARRIER: SAE-HO

391
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,478
BE A MAN-EATER: SOOK
PELVIS CUP: WOO-YOUNG

392
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,379
FLYING SHOE: WOO-JAE

393
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,915
You're now required
to score three goals again.

394
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,184
For your information…

395
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,753
Is Sook playing Be A Man-eater?

396
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,122
-Be A Man-eater? Oh, yes.
-For that game,

397
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,957
-we've prepared five men for you.
-Okay.

398
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,393
They are Lee Jun-ho,

399
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,594
Byeon Woo-seok,

400
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,963
-Gong Yoo,
-I'll gladly take their hearts.

401
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,365
Cha Eun-woo, and Cho Sae-ho.

402
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,867
Do I only need to win four over?

403
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,536
Why leave one out of the five?

404
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,205
-Do I have to win all five over?
-Sure.

405
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,174
Okay. So Jin-kyung, Sook, and I
will take our right foot out on one.

406
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,809
-Yeah, and we'll move our left.
-That's it.

407
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,113
-My legs are spread out too wide.
-Be careful with the potato, Jin-kyung.

408
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,248
-We've got this!
-Let's do this!

409
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,316
All right!

410
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,417
Get ready.

411
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,486
GO!

412
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,188
-One, two.
-Left, right.

413
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,224
-Left, right--
-Wait!

414
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,892
THEY GOT THE STEPS MIXED UP

415
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,093
-Left, right.
-One, two.

416
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,162
COORDINATION ISSUE
FROM THE START

417
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,230
One, two.

418
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,564
Woo-young's not doing it right.

419
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,233
THEY ARRIVED
AT THE FIRST MISSION POINT

420
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,236
WHOOSH

421
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,538
YOUNGER CASTMATES' BREATHS
SURROUND HER

422
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,340
SWOOSH

423
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,743
-Mash it up.
-Cut it in half.

424
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,811
Atta girl.

425
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,814
-She is downing so quickly.
-She meant what she said.

426
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
Whistle. Go on.

427
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,316
HOT POTATO KILLER

428
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
Look at the steam
coming out from her mouth.

429
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,287
-Try it. You can do it.
-How is she managing it?

430
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,355
-Go on.
-The steam.

431
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,092
Does she know how to whistle?

432
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,527
SHE SAID SHE COULD
HANDLE HOT FOOD

433
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,862
BUT DIDN'T SAY SHE COULD WHISTLE

434
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,865
-Can she whistle or not?
-It just looks like she's savoring it.

435
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,005
COME ON, WHISTLE PROPERLY…

436
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,008
ONLY HOT STEAM IS COMING OUT

437
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,076
Go on. Try it.

438
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,144
-Okay!
-Okay!

439
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,212
SUCCESS?

440
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,280
Go on. Try it.

441
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,347
WHISTLE

442
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,451
Go on. Try it.

443
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,819
-Okay!
-Okay!

444
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,888
SUBSTITUTE WHISTLER

445
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,556
THIS TRICK REMAINED UNNOTICED
UNTIL EDITING BEGAN

446
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,293
-One, two.
-Left, right.

447
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,161
THE 5 CON ARTISTS
WORKING IN TANDEM

448
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,364
-One, two.
-Left, right.

449
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,634
-Let's lie down.
-Move slowly, all right?

450
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,371
BALL CARRIER
WAS A CHALLENGE EARLIER

451
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,573
-Here we go. One.
-One.

452
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,008
-Two.
-Two.

453
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,810
Three.

454
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,878
It went in. Okay!

455
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,647
SUCCESS AT FIRST ATTEMPT

456
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,015
-All right.
-One more time.

457
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,450
It helps if you're short.

458
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,452
-One, two…
-One, two…

459
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,920
A SENSE OF STABILITY
FROM SHORT LEGS

460
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,956
-It went in.
-So smoothly, too.

461
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,090
WAY TO GO, SHORTY!

462
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,994
A HACK UNLOCKED

463
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,062
SUCCESS

464
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,965
COMPLETED IN JUST 30 SECONDS

465
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,433
-One, two.
-Left, right.

466
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,903
WADDLING AWKWARDLY

467
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,971
-One, two.
-Left, right.

468
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,207
WADDLING TO THE BLIND DATE SPOT

469
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,677
Sook, you're an expert in this game.

470
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,447
-We know how good you are.
-Win all their hearts!

471
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,514
Here goes.

472
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,484
AUNTIE SOOK
IS COMING YOUR WAY, BOYS

473
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,353
SMACK

474
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,755
EVEN A SLOPPY ATTACK
CAN WIN OVER THIS GUY'S HEART

475
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,924
-Duck down.
-Yeah, sit down.

476
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,926
AUNTIE SOOK SHOWING OFF
HER CHARMS AGGRESSIVELY

477
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,430
Hold on. You should be tall
to nail this game.

478
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,367
It doesn't look like…
We're in huge trouble.

479
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,102
What do we do?

480
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,436
THE BALL WON'T REACH THE DOLLS

481
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,339
It's a sign she has no chance with them,
even in her dreams.

482
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,674
What do we do? Oh, gosh.

483
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,378
-Wait.
-There you go. Move in slowly.

484
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,381
-You're almost there.
-Yeah.

485
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,349
There you go. You took out two guys.

486
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,118
Okay, Sae-ho's out of your way.

487
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,155
-Okay.
-Jun-ho's out, too!

488
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,691
AUNTIE IS SEXY

489
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,926
-Hey, wait.
-Let's get going.

490
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:11,530
-One, two.
-One, two.

491
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,999
THEY'RE MOVING AS ONE NOW

492
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,634
-One, two.
-I'm so tired.

493
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,702
Me too.

494
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,205
-He's become an expert at this point.
-One, two…

495
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,740
You've got this.

496
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,075
MASTER OF DUMBFOUNDING
DOESN'T HESITATE

497
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,210
-One, two.
-One, two.

498
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,012
ONLY ONE MISSION LEFT
THEY HAVE ENOUGH TIME

499
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,680
Here we are.

500
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,649
THE LONG-AWAITED
FINAL LEG OF THE JOURNEY

501
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,819
-One, two…
-One, two, three!

502
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,587
THAT WENT
NOWHERE NEAR THE BOTTLES

503
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,655
Ready, go!

504
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,191
-One, two.
-One, two.

505
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,259
IT'S TAKING THEM FOREVER

506
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,326
It's nice to have a long arm.

507
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,730
-One, two.
-One, two.

508
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,966
Oh, come on. Please…

509
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,969
-One, two…
-One, two, three!

510
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,204
What was that?

511
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,272
Three!

512
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,339
A HOME RUN

513
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,541
-I can't take this.
-Let's go.

514
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,975
One, two.

515
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,778
A CRISIS AT THE END

516
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,482
REACHING OUT IN DESPERATION

517
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,384
I BELIEVE IN YOU, WOO-JAE!

518
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,053
DESPERATE

519
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,157
-Wait.
-Here we go.

520
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,759
-One, two.
-Let's hurry.

521
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh, no. My goodness.

522
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,964
THE DESPERATION
DAMAGED THEIR REVERSE GEAR

523
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,266
-Get up! Do you want to die for real?
-Ready.

524
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,835
-We could all get shot.
-One, two…

525
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,070
-One, two.
-Let's finish this in one go.

526
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,439
-We can do that. Come to the center.
-I'm so tired.

527
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,441
-One, two…
-One, two…

528
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,646
JUST ONE MORE

529
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,982
One… Just one…

530
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,184
DESPERATE STRUGGLE TO AVOID
PAYING FOR THE TEAM DINNER

531
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,953
-I can't move my legs.
-Please…

532
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,020
Here we go.

533
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,589
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER'S
UNEASE GROWS

534
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,691
-One, two.
-One, two.

535
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,758
Focus.

536
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,560
Concentrate, everyone.

537
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,963
THEY MUST TAKE THE BOTTLE DOWN

538
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,565
-One, two…
-One, two… Aim low!

539
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,602
Aim low!

540
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,837
A SPARE

541
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,475
THEY MUST CROSS THE FINISH LINE
TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING

542
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,410
WALKING WITHOUT A SHOE TO WIN

543
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,814
-One, two…
-Guys, I can't walk properly.

544
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,949
FINISH LINE REACHED

545
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,017
Dang it.

546
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,585
Did we succeed?

547
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,053
BUT DID THEY MAKE IT
IN UNDER 5 MINUTES?

548
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,855
How long did it take? Tell us.

549
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,557
Did we succeed?

550
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,293
-I'll now announce your result.
-I'm exhausted.

551
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,662
THE TRICK THAT FOOLED EVERYONE

552
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,798
AND THE HACK WITH SHORT LEGS
HELPED THEM TO BREEZE THROUGH

553
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,966
You took out two guys.

554
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,568
HOWEVER

555
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,770
THEY WERE SLOW TOWARD THE END

556
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,838
I'm exhausted.

557
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,006
Your final record…

558
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,741
WHAT'S THEIR FINAL RECORD?

559
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,579
-…is 5 minutes and 19 seconds.
-Oh, what a bummer.

560
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,014
We were so close.

561
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,249
THE SECOND ATTEMPT
UNFORTUNATELY FAILS

562
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,218
Earlier,

563
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,854
my shoe flew way too far.

564
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,556
I was so desperate, trying to reach it.

565
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,890
KNIFE-FOOT'S
FIXATION ON HIS SHOE

566
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,560
Still, Woo-jae took out
most of the bottles with one shot.

567
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,295
-I did take out most of them.
-Yeah.

568
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,197
-I'll do my best with my game.
-Let's tie our legs.

569
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,264
What do I do?

570
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,766
You can take Ball Carrier a good laugh.

571
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,135
We won't be laughing.
I'm actually good at it.

572
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,070
I'm excellent at scoring.

573
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,274
SAE-HO AND JIN-KYUNG
SWAP MISSIONS

574
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,144
My confidence is suddenly tanking.

575
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,680
-But you assured us you were good.
-Don't worry. You can do it.

576
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,782
Well, sure.
I know failure means our death.

577
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,650
-I'm getting so nervous.
-If we can…

578
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,552
The team dinner bill
is going to be towering.

579
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,653
Yeah, that's for sure.

580
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,622
We have to make sure to succeed this time.

581
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,591
Ready.

582
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,895
THE KILLERS' FINAL ATTEMPT

583
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,097
Set.

584
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,732
WILL THEY MANAGE TO BECOME
TRUE KILLERS?

585
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,437
-One, two.
-One, two.

586
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,672
SWEEPING INTO
THE FIRST MISSION POINT

587
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,976
SWOOSH

588
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,046
STARTS GNAWING

589
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,617
-I like how you're breaking it down.
-He's doing so well.

590
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,718
AS ONE

591
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,586
THEY BLAST AIR
RIGHT INTO HIS FACE

592
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,654
You're the best, Sae-ho!

593
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,322
THE FAMILY MAN'S
SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY

594
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,857
He's done it.

595
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,626
WHY IS SHE STILL
BLOWING ON HIS FACE…

596
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,628
Suck it up! Bear it.

597
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,429
STILL BLOWING ON HIM

598
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,864
What a sight.

599
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,533
HYPER-FOCUSED

600
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,869
HYPER-FIXATED

601
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,638
Okay. Let's roll.

602
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,806
A SUCCESS WITHOUT A TRICK

603
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,576
THE HEAT STILL LINGERS
IN HIS MOUTH

604
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,077
-One, two.
-One, two.

605
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,946
-On your back!
-Let's move slowly.

606
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,549
-We're ready now.
-This isn't about throwing it away.

607
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,618
HER FELLOW MODEL CASTMATE
HAD TROUBLE

608
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,919
BECAUSE OF HIS LONG LEGS…

609
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,288
-Damn it.
-We're getting the hang of it!

610
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,257
-They're both too short!
-Shut it!

611
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,693
HER CONFIDENCE
SCARES US THE MOST

612
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,927
One.

613
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,229
Okay. Let's start at one.

614
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,732
-One sec.
-Hurry up.

615
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,034
-Here…
-We should get moving.

616
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,302
-Here we go.
-All right.

617
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,537
-Bend all the way to the back.
-Just put it in the basket!

618
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,205
-In the basket!
-Okay!

619
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,740
Great job. Keep it up.

620
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,342
SECOND BALL

621
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,144
MASTER TRICKSTER

622
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,478
Do it!

623
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,980
2 CONSECUTIVE SUCCESSES

624
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,581
-Okay.
-Okay!

625
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,784
-Let's slow down a bit.
-Here we go.

HONG-KIM DUO SCORES WITH TRICKS

627
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,553

628
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,655
-Everyone up.
-We made it.

629
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,424
-Is it my turn?
-One, two, three, four.

630
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,893
AUNTIE SOOK

632
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,462
-One, two.
-One, two.

633
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,732
THE WHOLE GROUP IS
ESCORTING AUNTIE SOOK

634
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,968
THEY'RE CLEARING MISSIONS FASTER
THAN EARLIER ATTEMPTS

635
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,539
BACK TO THE BLIND DATE SPOT

636
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,475
-Let's sit down.
-Everyone on the floor.

637
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,243
-We're moving much faster.
-Go on.

638
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,578
-Off I go.
-Okay.

639
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,082
Okay. There you go!

640
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,852
Okay. There you go!

641
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,120
Slow down a bit.

642
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,356
-Okay!
-Two guys are out of the way.

643
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,423
MAN-EATER ON RAMPAGE

652
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,273
WOO-YOUNG HAS SUCCEEDED
IN PELVIS CUP IN ONE GO

653
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,209
-Sae-ho got hit by the ball.
-Bounce it.

654
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,077
Aim at the backboard.

655
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,512
MASTER OF DUMBFOUNDING'S
GODLY LOWER BODY

656
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,680
Now, this is it.

657
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,750
-There you go.
-My goodness.

658
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,651
-We've still got time.
-Take it slow.

659
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,255
We breezed through others,
so you can take your time.

660
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,190
Oh, no.

661
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,226
Stay calm.

662
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,595
One…

663
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,996
-You must stay calm.
-Not again.

664
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,965
KILLERS NEVER WAVER

665
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,566
BUT THESE KILLERS ARE WAVERING

666
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,369
Get your s*** together.

667
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,540
LOWER BODY IN BAD FORM,
GROWING ANXIETY

668
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,608
Don't laugh, okay?

669
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,478
-Pull yourself together, damn it.
-What's going on?

670
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,579
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

671
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,350
THE MISSION THEY EXCELLED IN
IS EATING UP THEIR TIME

672
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,051
Come on, you!

673
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,954

HELL OF SHOE RETRIEVAL

679
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,766
-Three!
-Damn it.

00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,834
SNEAKY DELIVERY

681
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,705
When the director
explained the rules to us,

682
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,543
he only told us to use our shoes
to knock over the water bottles.

683
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,744
Yeah.

684
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,846
So technically,
I don't have to retrieve them.

685
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:08,914
WE CAN USE
ANYONE'S SHOES, RIGHT?

686
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,482
Then, after your shoe is gone,

687
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,917
I'll pass mine on to you.

688
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,419
-Damn it.
-Give it to him.

689
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,554
TOP 1% TRICKSTER

-One, two…
-One, two, three!

691
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,826
This is insane. I'm losing my mind.

692
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,496
-If we end up paying, you can cover 70%.
-The shoe flew over there.

693
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,332
-One, two…
-One, two, three!

694
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,500
-Okay.
-One more.

695
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,936
ONLY TWO PINS REMAIN NOW

696
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,003
Ready, go.

697
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,972
QUICK SUPPLY OF SHOES
REDUCED THE TIME

698
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,040
Three!

699
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,575
-Darn it.
-Here's another, Woo-jae.

700
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,709
-Yours is better.
-Yeah.

701
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,445
-Can't you… No, you can't take yours off.
-Give it some force.

702
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,081
SUCH A SHAME

703
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,983
LAST BULLET

704
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,351
That's the last one.

705
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,153
IF HE FAILS THIS TIME

706
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,555
THEY'LL NEED TO GO
RETRIEVE THE SHOES

707
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,324
-One, two…
-One, two, three!

708
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,593
-Damn it!
-Go get them!

709
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,660
To the right.

710
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,496
A HUSTLE PLAY
USING HIS LONG LIMBS

711
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,664
TOP 1% TRICKSTER,
TOP 1% LONG LIMBS

712
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,299
-I'll use these.
-Go ahead.

713
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,336
AND OVER HERE…

714
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,939
IS ONE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

715
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,941
THE TEAM DINNER'S BILL

716
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,444
HANGS ON WHETHER HE CAN GET
THE LAST SPARE

717
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,813
-One, two…
-One, two…

718
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,316
-Okay!
-Okay!

719
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,384
SUCCESS

720
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,586
-Ready, go. One, two.
-One, two.

721
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,421
FINAL SPRINT TO THE FINISH LINE

722
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,561
-One, two.
-We're here!

723
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,833
WE'RE DYING HERE

724
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,004
DID THEY MAKE IT
IN UNDER 5 MINUTES?

725
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,071
How long did it take?

726
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,206
I'll tell you the seconds.

727
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,175
Okay. Let's hear them. Go ahead.

728
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,979
It's 36 seconds.

729
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,848
-As in 4 minutes and 36 seconds?
-That's for sure.

730
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,716
-I'm certain of it.
-It's 4 minutes and 36 seconds.

731
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,418
Your final record…

732
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,556
DID THEY MAKE IT IN TIME

733
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,126
JUST AS THEY EXPECTED?

734
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,429
…is 3 minutes and 36 seconds.

735
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,964
Congratulations on your success.

736
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,232
JUST AROUND 3 MINUTES?

737
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,201
I knew it. You should've added
a couple more games.

738
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,804
-There he goes again.
-We only needed 3 minutes and 36 seconds.

739
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,472
Your idea with shoes was gold.

740
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,341
It's incredible.
Only 3 minutes and 36 seconds?

741
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,777
Jin-kyung did well with Ball Carrier.

742
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,212
I did, didn't I? I told you I'm good.

743
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,281
This small business owner
will pay for the team dinner

744
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,950
celebrating our first shoot.

745
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,651
-All right!
-Hooray!

746
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,892
That concludes all the training
prepared for Killer Boot Camp 2025.

747
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,027
HERE IS A SPECIAL TREAT FOR
THOSE WHO MISS THEIR PAST LIVES

748
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,529
While the training is over,

749
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,631
-What?
-we have one final challenge for you.

750
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,132
I thought that was the last one.

751
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,200
Are we killing someone?

752
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,570
-This is Shoot Your Colleague.
-Seriously?

753
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,207
We have told you that killers
should be cold-blooded earlier.

754
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,577
A true killer should be ready
to point their gun

755
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:56,781
toward a colleague
with whom they shared a long partnership.

756
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,417
-No, I can't.
-Of course not. We're tender-hearted.

757
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,486
-You will all toss a coin.
-We're all softies.

758
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,022
The first person to get heads

759
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,590
will be the target.

760
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,226
If the remaining four can shoot

761
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,561
at the designated target,

762
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,331
-they'll be qualified as true killers.
-We could never.

763
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,699
Will shooting be all?

764
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,067
Pulling the trigger is easy.

765
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,403
Anyone using a different sign
in rock, paper, scissors goes first.

766
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,471
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

767
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,805
A different sign, okay?

768
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,707
-Okay, the person who stands out.
-Yeah, they go first.

769
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,743
-Not the winner?
-No, the one with a different sign.

770
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,244
Rock, paper, scissors!

771
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,312
ONLY PERSON WITH PAPER SIGN

772
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,747
Okay.

773
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,851
A FEW MINUTES AGO…

774
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,085
Let's set her up.

775
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,420
THESE FOUR PLOTTED AGAINST HER

776
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,988
We'll all go with the rock.

777
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,491
-Gosh.
-How did this happen?

778
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,059
-What the heck?
-What a coincidence.

779
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,460
Isn't this incredible?

780
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,029
What? For real?

781
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,930
-Of course!
-We can't have planned that.

782
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,465
This makes no sense!

783
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,934
As the first to go,
you can choose who goes next.

784
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,936
Who would you like to go second?

785
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,906
-Woo-jae.
-Woo-jae, it is.

786
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,009
AN INSTANT RETALIATION
TO THE INSTIGATOR

787
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,945
-Woo-jae can choose who goes next.
-Yeah, do that.

788
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,915
-I'll go with you, Sook.
-Great.

789
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,350
But why?

790
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,285
-Woo-young can go next.
-Why?

791
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,988
I'm just keeping the order consistent.

792
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,023
You named it our final challenge,

793
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,959
but the remaining four
can decide not to shoot, right?

794
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,795
Of course, it's not exactly necessary.

795
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,997
Put up your hands, guys.

796
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,765
Yeah, this is the reunion
we've longed for.

797
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,767
-We've been friends for ages.
-Loyalty above all else.

798
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,570
Regardless of who becomes the target,

799
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,472
-we won't shoot at them, okay?
-Okay.

800
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,542
Let's have the target
cover their eyes as a sign of their faith.

801
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,711
-The whole world is watching us.
-Right.

802
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,880
-Let's show them our bond.
-For the Korean sense of loyalty.

803
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,682
-Let's go, Screwballs!
-Let's go, Screwballs!

804
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,452
-It's your turn, Jin-kyung.
-Take it easy.

805
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,187
-Tails.
-Here I go.

806
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:43,822
You've gotten better.

807
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,889
Three, two, one.

808
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,357
Tails!

809
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,726
It's looking good.

810
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,793
I'M OFF THE HOOK…

811
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,195
DANG IT…

812
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,329
Gosh, Jin-kyung.

813
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,098
You've got luck on your side, girl.

814
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,967
-He has a 25% chance.
-Oh, man…

815
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,603
Damn it, what's this familiar feeling?

816
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,671
It's disgust.

817
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,039
Three!

818
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,273
Have faith in our loyalty.

819
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,675
There we go. He's it.

820
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,976
-Don't worry.
-Sure.

821
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,711
-Here!
-Oh, gosh.

822
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,080
Tails! It's tails, dang it.

823
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,583
-Geez, I've got the tails.
-I envy him.

824
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,686
We decided not to shoot, remember?
It doesn't matter.

825
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,388
How annoying.
I expected it to be decided earlier.

826
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,357
-Me too.
-How do we turn it around?

827
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,792
NUMBER THREE, SOOK'S TURN

828
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,627
-Turn it over.
-You've got to.

829
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,163
-Sook, I saw it myself.
-You'll have to do that.

830
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,965
I saw the crane on the back.

831
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,367
-I mean that, Sook.
-Trust him.

832
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,702
-You little punk.
-That's heads.

833
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,640
I didn't lie. I meant that the crane
fell down onto your hand.

834
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,109
-I told you the truth.
-Don't worry about it.

835
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,345
We're not shooting.
Just stand there with the blindfold on.

836
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,781
Trust us and wear the blindfold.

837
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,884
Is this really necessary?

838
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,452
It's just for the show.

839
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,120
What about the Korean sense of loyalty?

840
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,791
Our show will be streamed globally
as Korean entertainment.

841
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,860
If we abandon our loyalty,
the world will be disappointed.

842
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,799
I'm not going to shoot,
but my water supply is too low.

843
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,601
And how is that a problem?

844
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,371
YOU WON'T NEED WATER
IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO SHOOT…

845
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,873
Don't get your water tank refilled.

846
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,142
I'm not going to shoot.
It's just that I don't have water.

847
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,313
SOUND OF THE GUNS
CLOSING IN ON HER

848
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,449
We're not going to shoot,
so don't worry. Trust us.

849
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:22,387
Sook, we're lined up along the wall.
You don't have to worry.

850
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,688
-But you sound so close.
-Oh yeah?

851
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,156
Woo-jae.

852
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,524
WHISPER

853
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,028
-Sae-ho.
-Come on.

854
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,529
Show the world our loyalty.

855
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,764
I TRUST MY COLLEAGUES

856
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,600
"Killers are brave."

857
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,869
WE JOINED
THE KILLER BOOT CAMP TOGETHER

858
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,637
She's now fully 50 years old.

859
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:43,074
WE BOLSTERED EACH OTHER'S
MENTAL ENDURANCE

860
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,076
WE LEARNED TO READ
EACH OTHER'S MIND

861
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,177
I must've let out…

862
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,545
WE LAUGHED OFF
PAINFUL MEMORIES TOGETHER

863
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,582
AND STRENGTHENED OUR TEAMWORK

864
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,384
OUR TEAM IS THE BEST

865
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,355
I hope you have made up
your minds, killers.

866
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,825
Those of you who reached a decision…

867
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:02,994
Fire!

868
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,798
Fire!

869
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,101
Look at those guys.

870
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,202
You're unbelievable!

871
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,238
THE TARGET HAS BEEN CHANGED

872
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,607
THEY'RE SHOOTING AT THOSE
WHO THEY HAD BEEF WITH

873
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,676
Are you being serious right now?

874
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,879
THE PRINCIPLED KILLERS REFUSE
TO HURT THE BLINDFOLDED OLD LADY

875
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,181
-What's going on?
-I can't stand you!

876
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,883
Can anyone tell me what's going on?

877
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,019
Let's pretend to shoot at Sook
and aim at Woo-jae instead.

878
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,555
Let's shoot at Jin-kyung,
pretending it's a mistake.

879
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,224
What are you playing at?

880
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,126
Stick to the plan!

881
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,861
Hey, you!

882
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,897
Stop it, okay?

883
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,233
TRUE FRIENDSHIP BEING STREAMED
INTERNATIONALLY

884
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,302
-Here is your souvenir.
-Souvenir?

885
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,438
We prepared some towels,
so please don't forget to take them.

886
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,007
That's giving us mystique.

887
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,342
If someone visits our home
and sees "Killer Boot Camp…"

888
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,713
-Great work with filming.
-Thank you, everyone!

889
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,816
We didn't think this day would come,
but we're back together again.

890
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,051
Great work today!

891
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,220
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE REUNITED

892
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,189
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

893
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,158
A REVENGE MATCH

We're looking for an heir
to lead Dora-Group.

896
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,667
Yo, brother.

897
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,702
FIVE TRAINEES HAVE GATHERED
TO BECOME THE HEIR

898
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,404
I can be the obvious winner.

GOOD KNOWLEDGE

900
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,575
Acting isn't allowed.

901
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,277
I only laughed, okay?

902
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,179
SUCCESSOR'S PREREQUISITE: CLASS

903
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,347
What do you think you're doing?

904
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,648
HAHAHAHA

905
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,150
Don't shoot! Don't zoom in!

906
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,651
I thought he was a model.

907
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,919
Let's go home!

908
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,955
SUCCESSOR'S PREREQUISITE:
GOOD REPUTATION

909
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,190
Who among us seems least likely to pee?

910
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,126
You, Woo-jae.
You're too thin to hold much liquid in.

911
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,294
HAHA…

912
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,762
HAHAHA

Oh, please…

916
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,135
THOSE WHO WISH
TO BECOME THE HEIR

917
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,370
MUST GET ON THE CAPITAL'S FLOW

918
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,605
-I lost everything.
-It reached 100 million won.

919
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:55,907
RESULTS CHANGE EVERY SECOND

920
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,976
You cost me my entire fortune!

921
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,177
Return 500 million won.

922
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,445
A WAR OF
POSSESSION AND DISPOSSESSION

923
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,447
Why trouble us with this annoying device?

924
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,183
CATASTROPHE BROUGHT ON BY GREED

925
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,918
-I'm never coming back.
-Why drive us

926
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,154
to consider stooping to the lowest point?

927
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,057
The winner hasn't been decided yet.

928
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,926
Gee, my stomach hurts!
I might have to poop!

929
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,328
-Where did he go?
-It wasn't us.

930
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,931
AN ENDLESS TUG OF WAR
TO BECOME THE HEIR

931
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,632
IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER

932
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,167
Stay behind after the shoot wraps.

933
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,169
Let's finish off one of us today.

934
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,404
