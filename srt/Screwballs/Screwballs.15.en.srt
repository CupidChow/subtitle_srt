1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs…

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,238
You have been invited
to "Along with the Gods,"

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,306
an exclusive event

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,808
open to only the top elite
of the celestial world.

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,910
Hi, I'm Jin from BTS.

6
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,979
BTS' JIN MAKES APPEARANCE ON SCREWBALLS

7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,948
I'm Eros, the Greek god of love.

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,683
EROS, ONE AND ONLY GOD OF LOVE

9
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,220
GOD OF LOVE'S BESTOWAL OF HIS AFFECTION

10
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,287
PFFT

11
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,491
RANDOM DECLARATIONS OF LOVE
FROM LOWLY GODS

12
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,793
STRESSES HIM OUT

13
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,895
-I love you.
-Heck no!

14
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:30,964
AND YET…

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,767
We have received intel
that one human snuck in.

16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,970
I'm a god.

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,305
AMONG THEM IS ONE HUMAN,
WHO WANTS TO SABOTAGE THE GODS

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,608
Man, it's so upsetting. I'm so ticked off.

19
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,410
We, the gods, have to find the human.

20
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,513
I went last,
so I didn't get to choose my button.

21
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,415
The crew didn't have a hand
in the selection, then.

22
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,849
-It was chosen randomly.
-All right, then.

23
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,551
YOUNGSTERS' TAKE ON IDIOMS
ALONG WITH JIN

24
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,053
-He's dragging it out on purpose.
-I get it now.

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,922
The icing on the cake.

26
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,124
-Your 20 seconds are up.
-What?

27
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,560
I answered in two seconds flat!
What do you think you're playing at?

28
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,262
YOU'RE THE HUMAN, AREN'T YOU?

29
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,365
When I couldn't get the right answer,
Jin accused me way too harshly.

30
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,733
So you don't trust me, do you?

31
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,368
Goose said, "You too, Gander?"

32
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,903
This isn't that difficult.

33
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,971
-He's being blatant about it.
-Just a second.

34
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,106
TIMED OUT

35
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,241
-Hold on.
-You wasted all our time.

36
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,243
THIS MAKES NO SENSE

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,212
He must've known the answer.

38
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,547
I thought so too.

39
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,416
You're in big trouble if you're human
or if you simply had no idea.

40
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,085
INITIAL SUSPECT: WOO-YOUNG

41
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,754
It's the latter, Woo-jae.
My brain is just not working.

42
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,122
Swap your seat with Jin-kyung.

43
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,358
Go on. Maybe the pressure got to you
from having to go first.

44
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,094
My brain's just not functioning.

45
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,329
Why did you drag it out
when you knew the answer?

46
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,131
I HAVE NO ANSWER FOR THAT

47
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,300
In celebration of Jin joining us,

48
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,401
we'll give you 30 seconds.

49
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,002
-A whopping 30 seconds!
-Ready.

50
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,170
We've got this!

51
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,638
Set, go.

52
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,374
70-YEAR-OLD: I'M BETTER THAN YOU
60-YEAR-OLDS: YOU SURE ARE

53
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,243
So a 70-year-old said,
"I'm better than you."

54
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,778
WHY IS SHE READING IT OUT LOUD?

55
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,946
Why would you read that?

56
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,414
What does age have to do with anything?

57
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,015
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

58
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,017
Why is this person bragging
to some 60-year-olds?

59
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,386
HER INNOCENCE HAS NO REGARD
FOR SENIORITY AND RESPECT

60
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,754
-But…
-Are you for real?

61
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,656
What's this with elders?

62
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,525
-Interpretation can be tricky.
-Hurry up.

63
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,027
But that can't be it.

64
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,696
She's gone too far.

65
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,598
-Hold on.
-Wait, I think I'm on the wrong show.

66
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,533
Why is this person telling others
they're superior?

67
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,101
-You failed!
-She's no longer a suspect.

68
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,204
-She's the human for sure.
-Wait, it's "elders and betters."

69
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,039
-That was a nice touch.
-Sure, nice job.

70
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,542
-I appreciated the top-notch acting.
-Elders and betters.

71
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,977
Isn't that the answer?

72
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,645
Jin-kyung and I honestly have no clue.

73
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,547
-Elders and betters.
-That's correct.

74
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,316
I just couldn't…
These quizzes are super weird.

75
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,119
WOO-YOUNG: YOU TOO, JIN-KYUNG?

76
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,754
You two went too far just now.

77
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,022
He's absolutely right.

78
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,057
I just found the quizzes too puzzling.

79
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,026
I know these guys pretty well, right?

80
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,128
They honestly have no clue. I mean that.

81
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,730
HOW COULD YOU…

82
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,131
We're on the same side, remember?

83
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,799
These two are gods.

84
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,201
They're just dim ones.

85
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,103
THEY'RE GODS OF INNOCENCE, THAT'S WHY

86
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,871
-But gods…
-Leave behind after the shoot wraps.

87
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,073
-Let's pick up the pace this time.
-Okay.

88
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,875
Ready, set, go.

89
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,943
GOSH, LIT SILVER LINING

90
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,144
Every cloud has a silver lining.

91
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,779
YOUR DISGUSTING STABLE
FORCED YOUR HORSES AWAY

92
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,481
Lock the stable door
after the horse has bolted.

93
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,283
-That's so easy.
-Totally.

94
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,084
DROPS: WE'LL GATHER HERE
FLOOD: HERE I COME

95
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,786
The drops…

96
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,854
Wait, many drops…

97
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,223
-What on earth?
-Many drops make a flood.

98
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,291
That is correct.

99
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,126
The words got mixed up in my mind.

100
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
TEA ABOUT THE SPOILED BROTH

101
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,395
Spoiled broth.

102
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,997
-What now?
-What the heck?

103
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,000
There is no idiom
that only consists of "spoiled broth."

104
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,436
-Come on!
-What's going on?

105
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,071
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

106
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,372
-That is correct.
-Seriously!

107
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,675
"You can't appreciate
your neighbor's green lawn--"

108
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,543
Your time is up.

109
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,478
HMM…

110
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,880
YOU FEEL IT TOO, RIGHT?

111
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,948
YEAH

112
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,717
-Here's the thing.
-I swear it isn't me, Woo-jae.

113
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,553
No, wait. I'll tell you
why I suspect Jin-kyung.

114
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,921
I thought you were suspecting me.

115
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,557
What she's doing right now…
She can be very clever, right?

116
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,959
She doesn't want it to be obvious.

117
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,795
That's why she's reading the texts.
It's to eat away the time.

118
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,330
-I noticed that too.
-Right?

119
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,432
-But she always does that.
-We'll see.

120
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,001
-She doesn't have to do that.
-Keep on slandering me. Go on.

121
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,837
-Okay, let's move you up there.
-I dare you.

122
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,206
-Even your antennae look suspicious.
-It's not me.

123
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,642
Why would she read the texts?
I can't clear up my doubts.

124
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,578
-Ready.
-Let's see this through!

125
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,914
Set, go.

126
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,148
PETTY THIEF:
I'LL TAKE A CAR NEXT

127
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,383
-On a slippery slope.
-Correct.

128
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,585
THAT WAS QUICK

129
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,653
THIS BARREL ISN'T YOURS ALONE

130
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,556
One apple going bad

131
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,957
can spoil the barrel.

132
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,359
I'll allow that.

133
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,627
MOVE HEAVEN WITH CAN-DO SPIRIT

134
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,861
What is this?

135
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,463
MOVE HEAVEN WITH CAN-DO SPIRIT

136
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,732
-What is this, really?
-What is this supposed to be?

137
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,835
You can move heaven?
I can't even guess the idiom.

138
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,969
BLINK, BLINK

139
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,006
-Heaven helps those who help themselves?
-That's correct.

140
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,341
-All that glitters is not gold.
-That's correct.

141
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,409
-What on earth?
-Come on!

142
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,611
BEGUN, DONE

143
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,180
-Come on, you must know this!
-What's this anyway?

144
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,416
-Unbelievable!
-What's the idiom?

145
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,717
I told you Sook was the human.

146
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,452
-Well begun, so what?
-How could you?

147
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,955
-Well begun, half done.
-Seriously, Sook.

148
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,724
-You have 30 years of experience.
-I thought it might be a blink of an eye.

149
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,028
-Guys, I swear I'm not the human.
-It's Sook.

150
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,462
Guys, I mean it.

151
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,765
-That was just…
-I'm an idiot, that's all.

152
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,734
SHE'S THE MASTER OF TRICK QUESTIONS

153
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,836
HOW COULD
THE GOD OF WIT NOT CATCH THIS?

154
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,339
-I'm sure it's Sook.
-I'm a Gen X, that's all.

155
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,808
-Let's play another round in this setup.
-Okay.

156
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,876
We'll reuse this lineup.

157
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,411
-Are you all ready?
-Yes.

158
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,478
Let's begin the next round.

159
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,213
ROUND 7
GODS 1 : HUMAN 6

160
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,315
Ready, set, go.

161
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,418
MOTH: FLAMES ARE IRRESISTIBLE

162
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,753
Like a moth to a flame.

163
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,021
That's correct.

164
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,122
DOG: I FELT DUMB AFTER A WHILE

165
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,091
Bark up the wrong tree.

166
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,392
That's correct.

167
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,493
POT: MY PARTNER IS LID

168
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,829
-There's a lid for every pot.
-That's correct.

169
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,564
A STREAK OF CORRECT ANSWERS

170
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,632
NOW? INSANE BAD LUCK

171
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,733
Now…

172
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,102
WHAT IDIOMS TALK ABOUT BAD LUCK?

173
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,236
Bad luck can get you down.

174
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,873
-What's this for anyway?
-You know the one.

175
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,575
-When it rains, it pours.
-Correct.

176
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,044
Like gold dust.

177
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,913
Too bad, you timed out.

178
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,715
-How long did we have again?
-You're a god, Jin.

179
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,817
-I'd say you're suspicious.
-What?

180
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,118
-Me?
-Your question was so easy.

181
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,220
Hey, Sae-ho. That was a nice diversion.

182
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,122
-You flattered Jin…
-Not at all.

183
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,291
I find it hard to believe
you didn't catch that.

184
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,426
Cut me some slack.
I got all the others right.

185
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,096
-Those are separate issues.
-That was my first miss.

186
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,598
SAE-HO HAS BEEN
THE GOD OF QUIZZES SO FAR

187
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,999
Every cloud has a silver lining.

188
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,602
WHY IS HE STRUGGLING
RIGHT WHEN THE OTHERS DO WELL?

189
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,372
But his question was on the tricky side.
What was it again?

190
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,341
-Can you show us his again?
-"Bad luck." When it rains, it pours.

191
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,442
I still don't get it.

192
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,478
Was that really difficult?

193
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,279
You bet it was.

194
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,447
I only got the "bad luck" part.

195
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,852
Let's discuss who we suspect
comfortably among ourselves.

196
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:26,919
Who do you think it is?

197
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,987
-Sook.
-Got it.

198
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,156
-What about you?
-I'm just an old-fashioned Gen X.

199
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,325
I suspect…

200
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,393
Woo-young.

201
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,428
I'll tell you why I suspect Sook.

202
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,430
I just openly accused her, right?

203
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,132
See how she retaliated right away?

204
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,701
She pointed her finger at me
after a second of hesitation. It's her.

205
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,736
Who do you think the human is, Jin?

206
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,071
I find…

207
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,740
Jin-kyung is a bit…

208
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,409
He hasn't gotten a sense of her yet.

209
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,446
Reading out the quiz aloud
affected my decision greatly.

210
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,781
-For real?
-That did look off.

211
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,550
I'll tell you the absurd scenario
I've considered.

212
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,354
Jin has been doing amazing so far.

213
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,124
If he were the human,
here's what he'd be thinking.

214
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,726
FIDGETING

215
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,062
He's decided that we had no shot
at winning even if he did well.

216
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,298
-Right.
-Since we weren't likely to win.

217
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,934
he could've decided to do his best.
That's what I thought.

218
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,102
That was my second thought.

219
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,772
I think it can be Woo-jae.

220
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,376
He is unusually fussy today.

221
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,877
I am always fussy.

222
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,679
I too thought his energy level today…

223
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,449
-He's too talkative.
-…was rather off.

224
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,919
WHEN HE WAS DRIVEN INTO A CORNER
FROM ROUND 1…

225
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,887
Dang it. I'm screwed.

226
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,590
…WOO-JAE SHIFTED GEARS INTO CASTING DOUBT

227
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,960
INSTIGATORS TEND TO BE THE BAD GUY

228
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,196
Don't do anything you'll regret
after the game.

229
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,263
Listen to me instead.

230
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,265
-Let's change the lineup.
-In that case,

231
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,468
why don't we have Woo-jae
bring up the rear

232
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,336
-to check his energy level again?
-Okay.

233
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,705
THE ICE GOD TAKES THE LAST SEAT

234
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,806
OH, SNAP

235
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,942
HEY, WOO-JAE

236
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,577
-You're a god, right?
-Yeah.

237
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,412
-I really am a god.
-Same here.

238
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,947
HEH

239
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,182
In that case,
one of these guys is the human.

240
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,817
We're all set.

241
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,887
-I'm awful with quizzes.
-We'll see how Sook does this time.

242
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,189
THE CULPRIT IS AMONG YOU

243
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,225
-What now?
-Please cover for me if I don't get it.

244
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,759
Sae-ho and I had a hunch.

245
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,228
I'm dense, that's all.

246
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,330
-Same here.
-That I know.

247
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,332
DISQUALIFIED AS A HUMAN

248
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,800
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

249
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,301
ROUND 8
GODS 0 : 7 HUMAN

250
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,503
Ready, set, go.

251
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,704
MARCHING DRUMS:
DID THEY FEED YOU?

252
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,139
-An army marches on its stomach.
-That was easy!

253
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,508
IF I EAT, YOU EAT

254
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,243
-Sharing is caring.
-That's correct.

255
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,310
MONKEY'S LIT PERFORMANCE

256
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,812
"Monkey's lit performance."

257
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,181
Monkey see, monkey do.

258
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,249
Correct.

259
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,917
-Kill your enemy with kindness.
-Correct.

260
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,418
NONSTOP SUCCESSION OF ANSWERS

261
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,287
WILL SAE-HO GET THE ANSWER
RIGHT AWAY THIS TIME?

262
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,155
PRO TIP: DON'T MUNCH TOO MUCH

263
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,558
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

264
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,059
-Correct.
-Did I get it?

265
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,429
-A dog says poke, and the bear… What?
-There he goes again.

266
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,431
LOOK AT HIM

267
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,000
There he goes again.

268
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,801
-How could you not get this?
-I knew it.

269
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,903
Don't poke the bear.

270
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,338
-Don't poke the bear.
-Correct!

271
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,874
-Why would you tell him that?
-Correct!

272
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,044
Because the gods need to win!

273
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,246
Who knows if he's a god or not?

274
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,682
-What do you mean? Gods won the round.
-Are you human?

275
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,218
-We won the round.
-Why fault a god for helping a fellow god?

276
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,321
-Surely you knew that.
-Why did you play dumb?

277
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,557
-Things can get confusing.
-I honestly had no idea.

278
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,726
Let's be real.
Some didn't get the correct answers.

279
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,563
-A dog says poke, and the bear… What?
-There he goes again.

280
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,065
DID WOO-JAE TRIP OVER HIS WORDS
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW?

281
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,100
I'll now announce the result.

282
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,103
-It was so difficult.
-We had eight rounds in total.

283
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,472
The human won, leading 7 to 1.

284
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,808
-The game ends in their victory.
-See if anyone's smiling.

285
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,810
THE SMILING ONE IS THE HUMAN

286
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,245
As the human won the game,

287
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,913
we'll have the Night of the Human.

288
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,315
Which prize did you choose?

289
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,216
-Prize Five.
-It was number five.

290
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,619
Please close your eyes
and lower your heads.

291
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,321
Only the human should raise their head

292
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,923
and select the prize they want.

293
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,758
WHO IS THE DEVIOUS HUMAN…

294
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,428
Human, please raise your head

295
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,597
and tell us the prize you want.

296
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,532
…THAT FOOLED THE ALMIGHTY GODS?

297
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,134
PRIZE SELECTION TIME

298
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,136
The sun has risen.

299
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,372
Everyone, please raise your heads.

300
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,208
The human chose Prize Five.

301
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,643
-Prize Five?
-They didn't make a change.

302
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,980
-They chose the same one we did.
-Yes, they did exactly that.

303
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,548
Was that our last game of the day?

304
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,149
-No, there are a few more.
-There's more?

305
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,518
-Geez.
-That was so hard.

306
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,820
WHO IS THE HUMAN THAT SNUCK
INTO THE CELESTIAL WORLD?

307
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,489
Look, the human is having some tea.

308
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,258
-Even the gods don't get any.
-I don't like how you gave him the answer.

309
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,194
What are you trying to say?

310
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,795
DURING YOUNGSTERS'
TAKE ON IDIOMS,

311
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,863
WOO-JAE'S MIND WENT BLANK

312
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,164
Don't poke the bear.

313
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,400
HE GOT THE ANSWER WITH JIN'S HELP

314
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,502
Why would you tell him that?

315
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,304
WHAT EXACTLY DID I DO WRONG?

316
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,973
I obviously should help
because he was the last to go.

317
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,108
Here's my question.

318
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,610
Why did no one help me
with "Well begun, half done"?

319
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,479
-Because you weren't the last to go.
-I see.

320
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,149
You weren't the last to go,
and we still had plenty of time.

321
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,851
You know what? He's a smooth talker.

322
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,853
-A true god speaks with reason.
-He's persuasive.

323
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,920
-Of course.
-I guess.

324
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,622
All right. We've had two phases,

325
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,924
"Along with the Gods"
and "Along with Jin."

326
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,426
Here's our last one,
"Along with the Human."

327
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,494
"Along with the Human"?

328
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,195
We're continuing with the third phase.

329
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,830
You have a human among you.

330
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,799
As matters stand,
a certain human among you

331
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,669
has been carrying out
their mission successfully.

332
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,039
Unlike humans,
gods happen to be spiritual beings.

333
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,740
Using their supernatural powers,

334
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,743
they can read one another's minds
without exchanging comments or looks.

335
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,845
Gods will now have to
tap into those powers

336
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,747
for the Hive Mind Game.

337
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,815
-All right.
-Hive Mind.

338
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,183
This is a classic game.

339
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,086
All six people must collaborate
for this group game.

340
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,487
Please listen to the key word

341
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,891
and assume a fitting pose
within three seconds.

342
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:36,162
If all six of you take the same pose,
your attempt will be considered a success.

343
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,564
Gods win a point
if you assume the same pose.

344
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,466
If not, the human wins the point.

345
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,103
Now, please discuss and select a prize
you want to claim for this game.

346
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,238
WHAT SHALL WE CHOOSE?

347
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,840
Just a second.

348
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,908
Prize Five disappeared?

349
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,310
You removed the prize

350
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,778
-the human chose, right?
-Yes.

351
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,948
THE GODS CALLED DIBS ON PRIZE 5
BEFORE PLAYING THE FIRST GAME

352
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,683
AFTER THE HUMAN'S NIGHT,

353
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,252
THE IMPERTINENT HUMAN
DARED TO STEAL THAT VERY PRIZE

354
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,821
-Prize Five?
-They didn't make a change.

355
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,257
The fact that the human chose
the prize we selected initially

356
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,461
suggests that the person who coveted
the Apple Watch is likely the human.

357
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,529
-That makes sense.
-That rules out Jin.

358
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,064
Fess up, Jin-kyung.

359
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,934
Why me? Surely there's no one
who craves the Apple Watch

360
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,502
-more than…
-So you admit it?

361
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,636
WAIT, THIS ISN'T IT

362
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,339
-I mean, I can't be the only one.
-Jin-kyung, don't fall apart like this.

363
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,041
-What is wrong with you?
-Stay on your toes.

364
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,977
COULD FLUSTERED AND STUTTERING
JIN-KYUNG BE THE HUMAN?

365
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,012
-This looks quite fancy too.
-What about this?

366
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,315
LET'S GET BACK TO PRIZE SELECTION

367
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,317
-How about this one?
-Let's go for the big box.

368
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,119
-Let's go with Prize Two.
-What's this one's number?

369
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,487
-But this looks promising.
-Prize One.

370
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,755
Let's select the big box.

371
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,757
We'll now begin a game for Prize Two.

372
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,292
The gods can take the prize if they win.

373
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,561
-Are you all ready?
-Yes.

374
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,796
Here's your key word.

375
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,231
ROUND 1
KEY WORD

376
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,634
Ending fairy. Three, two…

377
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,371
ENDING FAIRY: REFERS TO THE PERSON
CAUGHT ON THE CAMERA LAST AT MUSIC SHOWS

378
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,741
THESE TWO HAD ENOUGH EXPERIENCE
TO GRASP THE CONCEPT

379
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,911
WHEREAS THESE FOUR ARE NEW
IN THE ENDING FAIRY BUSINESS

380
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,880
-Three, two, one.
-Isn't this…

381
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,182
HUFF-AND-PUFF, CHIN ON HER HAND,
V FOR VICTORY WITH A SMILE

382
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,618
HUFF-AND-PUFF,
UNKNOWN, V FOR VICTORY

383
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,953
Hold on.
There's no one right answer for this.

384
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,090
-Wasn't my pose the intended answer?
-You're right.

385
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,858
I'm the model answer.

386
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,426
-I did that too.
-Show us what you did.

387
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,629
Surely Jin and you know this, Woo-young.

388
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,897
Of course I did this.

389
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,198
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE

390
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,535
Jin-kyung did this pose just now.

391
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,904
Who'd end their performance with this?

392
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,773
How should I know?
I never performed on music shows.

393
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,408
Sae-ho held up his hand with a V-sign too.

394
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,744
I don't know much about this field,
so I found it challenging.

395
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,446
EVEN SO, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT

396
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,681
Hang on. I don't get you.

397
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,483
What sort of an idol would do this
after performing?

398
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,551
This does seem off.

399
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,187
-You're wrong.
-You'd have to go this far at least.

400
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,088
Are you posing
for a yearbook or something?

401
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,557
I stretched my arm out like this.

402
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,758
This doesn't make any sense.

403
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,560
Guys do the V pose too. It's acceptable.

404
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,995
Yeah, I've seen people do that.
But not your pose, Jin-kyung.

405
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,163
All right.

406
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,433
Let's capture your ending fairy moment
with the pose you just took.

407
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,135
You can look at this camera.
Kick us off, Sae-ho.

408
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,870
Do it with style, please. Standby, cue.

409
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,472
I ASKED YOU TO DO IT WITH STYLE

410
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,074
What idol would use that pose?

411
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,409
A good many idols do that pose.

412
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,411
Next up, Sook. Standby, cue.

413
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,582
THE OLDEST ENDING FAIRY

414
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,952
POV: THE YOUNGER CASTMATES
FORCED TO ENDURE SOOK'S CUTESY ACT

415
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,054
Next is Jin. Standby, cue.

416
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,423
-That's the standard.
-Really?

417
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,757
It's the textbook pose.

418
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,826
-It sure is.
-Jin-kyung. Standby, cue.

419
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,295
I'LL KEEP TRYING UNTIL THIS POSE MAKES IT

420
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,363
Standby, cue.

421
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,865
POSE WITH CONFIDENCE

422
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,300
That's a cut from a yearbook!

423
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,236
-Now, Woo-young.
-What was his pose?

424
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,637
-I just…
-Standby, cue.

425
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,305
IS HE TRYING TO TAKE A BITE?

426
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,974
-You're suspicious.
-I've seen them do that.

427
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,041
What was that?

428
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,109
Jin keeps saying that.

429
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,278
-Because I actually saw people do that.
-Right?

430
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,780
-Now, Woo-jae. Standby, cue.
-Which camera do I look at? This one?

431
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,848
Standby, cue.

432
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,916
HUFF

433
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,484
That's exactly it.

434
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,053
If someone's this messed up after a song,
they should take a break.

435
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,924
You have to monitor
your physical condition closely.

436
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,525
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE MIGHT LEAVE THIS WORLD SOON

437
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
You should sing pop ballads.

438
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,229
Get ready for your next key word.

439
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,866
Shower. Three, two, one.

440
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,501
UNKNOWN, WASHING HAIR,
HOLDING SHOWERHEAD

441
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,569
Hold still.

442
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,938
GUYS: HOLDING SHOWERHEAD
SOOK: WASHING HAIR

443
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,539
You failed. You may see others' poses now.

444
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,275
-Hold still.
-This is the way to go.

445
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,810
Water will be running anyway.
Why bother holding the showerhead?

446
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,312
Of course we hold our showerheads.

447
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,881
Place it up in its holder
and have your hands free like this.

448
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,616
-Sook and I took a similar pose.
-Yeah.

449
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,184
Here's the thing.

450
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,353
-Woo-jae's pose…
-What are you trying to get at?

451
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,856
-Who does this in a shower booth?
-What on earth?

452
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,226
You have to rinse the bodywash off you.
Don't we all do it like this?

453
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,194
Who does this to remove the bodywash?

454
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,463
IT LOOKS LIKE A PROPER DANCE
WHEN JIN DOES IT

455
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,933
Especially with one foot
to the front like this?

456
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,201
That's for the show, obviously.

457
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,536
But this is what I do.

458
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,872
-That's you rinsing off the bodywash?
-Yeah.

459
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,841
See? I told you he was an oddball.

460
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,143
HE DOES SEEM TO SHOWER IN AN ODD WAY

461
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,111
-Just look at him.
-I shower like this.

462
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,479
COULD HE BE THE HUMAN?

463
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,215
-Let's move on to the next one.
-Okay. Here's your next key word.

464
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,617
We've got this. Let's do this!

465
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,018
-We can do this.
-Focus!

466
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,219
Get ready.

467
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,989
Sulking. Three, two, one.

468
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,824
Three, two, one.

469
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,626
ALL THREE CROSSED THEIR ARMS
ACROSS THEIR CHESTS

470
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,827
THESE TWO TOO

471
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,062
Hold steady and look around.

472
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,129
You failed!

473
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,131
HE HAD HIS HANDS ON HIS WAIST

474
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,434
ROUND 3 ENDS IN FAILURE
AS JIN TOOK A DIFFERENT POSE

475
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,502
HEY, JIN, ARE YOU PERHAPS…

476
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,771
The five of us
should be ashamed of ourselves!

477
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,740
You obviously sulk this way.

478
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,275
-This is the new trend.
-What did you do?

479
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,409
What did you do?

480
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,445
-I did this.
-You did that?

481
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,780
You even shower like this.

482
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,582
GOT A PROBLEM?

483
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,285
-He's sulking as he's taking a shower.
-Why is he holding that pose?

484
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,586
Wait, Jin.

485
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,188
-Let me…
-What's your sulking pose?

486
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,024
Kids these days all take this pose.
They go, "Hmph."

487
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,492
And he's right.

488
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,995
-When they get mad, their hands move up.
-Exactly.

489
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,262
Jin.

490
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,765
Give us a single shot
to add persuasiveness.

491
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,066
I can't believe this.

492
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,402
Standby, cue.

493
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,437
That's how you sulk.

494
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,106
No one sulks like the way we did.

495
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,941
IT'S ILLEGAL TO BE SO CHARMING
WHEN SULKING

496
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,642
Here's your next key word.

497
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,511
-Sexy.
-What?

498
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,579
Sexy.

499
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,548
Three, two, one.

500
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,451
AS EVERYONE TAKES
A DIFFERENT POSE,

501
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,120
ROUND 4 ENDS UP AS A FAILURE

502
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,989
-Jin!
-Woo-jae and I are really vibing.

503
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,224
-So are Sook and I.
-Woo-young.

504
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,226
Woo-young and I are
on the same wavelength today.

505
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,660
What do you think you're doing?

506
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,831
Seriously, what the heck is that?

507
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,066
IS THAT THE OLYMPIC FLAME?

508
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,267
Doesn't this look sexy?

509
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,002
It's not sexy at all, Sae-ho.

510
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,671
-Come on. Let's try to think alike.
-What is a sexy pose, exactly?

511
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,140
-What pose did you do?
-Show us.

512
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,808
What the heck?

513
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,209
You look like you're taking a dump.

514
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,277
Hey…

515
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,546
Who on earth does that like this?

516
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,948
Sae-ho, we're working here.
Remove that tube from your waist.

517
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,017
WHAT DISH DID YOU ENJOY SO MUCH?

518
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,552
I gained some love handles.

519
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,853
Here's your next key word.

520
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,556
Son Heung-min.

521
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,958
-Three, two, one.
-That's a piece of cake.

522
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,760
ALL THREE TAKES
A SHOT FOR THE GOAL

523
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,895
…one.

524
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,029
JIN TAKES A SHOT, SOOK FREEZES…

525
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,097
This is the answer!

526
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,165
…AND SAE-HO TAKES A PHOTO

527
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,700
ROUND 5 ENDS AS A FAILURE

528
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,669
The only correct pose
for Son Heung-min is this.

529
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,539
If you ask me, Sae-ho is taking
a unique pose deliberately.

530
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,973
You're wrong. I'm a god.

531
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,209
DOUBT IN THEIR EYES

532
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,411
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
THIS LOOKED SEXY!

533
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,280
POPSICLE, FISH CAKE BAR,
CHILI SAUCE, OLYMPIC FLAME…

534
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,347
YOU'RE ANYTHING BUT SEXY

535
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,682
Here's your next key word.

536
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,617
Cutesy act.

537
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,519
Three, two, one.

538
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,821
…two, one.

539
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,355
A POKE TO THEIR CHEEKS

540
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,423
CHIN ON HER HANDS

541
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,658
FAIL BECAUSE OF JIN-KYUNG?

542
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,992
A POKE TO THEIR CHEEKS

543
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,060
Wait, you…

544
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,129
THE HIVE MIND DIDN'T WORK WITH HIM EITHER

545
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,565
Obviously,
that is the standard cutesy act!

546
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,166
Have you not seen this pose?

547
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,302
Come on, this is the standard cutesy act.

548
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,803
-It's a textbook pose.
-This right here.

549
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,071
I did that too,

550
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,806
but Jin had the right idea.

551
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,075
You're taking a weird approach today.

552
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,844
You're all so narrow-minded.

553
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,612
So what do kids do these days?

554
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,582
To be honest, this is a dated concept.
You put up your fists like this.

555
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,649
…two, one.

556
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,985
THIS IS CUTE, ISN'T IT?

557
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,954
-Here's your next key word.
-We can do this.

558
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,021
It may be BTS.

559
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,957
BTS. Three…

560
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,191
HIS CONCERN TURNS INTO REALITY

561
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,227
BTS. Three…

562
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,697
THIS MAN HERE HAS SPENT 13 YEARS
AS A MEMBER OF BTS

563
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,932
This is so difficult.

564
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,870
Are you taking a shower again?

565
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,172
SHE MUST'VE LIKED WOO-JAE'S SHOWER POSE

566
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,774
Jin, could you rate the cast's pose,
starting from Sae-ho?

567
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,077
-I can explain what this is.
-What is this?

568
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,311
That's a move from "Run."

569
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,213
Gosh, you got it right.

570
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,349
I'M SAFE NOW!

571
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,850
SAE-HO MANAGED TO MIMIC

572
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,719
"RUN" CHOREOGRAPHY

573
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,588
I'm amazed by how nimbly
Jin-kyung copied Jin's hand gesture.

574
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,123
GUILTY AS CHARGED

575
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,391
WHEN THE KEY WORD "BTS" WAS GIVEN

576
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,459
BTS?

577
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,194
OH, HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO ME

578
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,296
COPIES HIM WITHOUT
A SECOND THOUGHT

579
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,032
I did notice you watching and copying me.

580
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,133
What about his pose?

581
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,903
-That's from "Dynamite."
-That's an acceptable pose.

582
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,138
IT REALLY IS A SNIPPET
FROM THE DANCE OF "DYNAMITE"

583
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,306
But what about you?

584
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,642
Mine hit the essence of BTS.

585
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,145
BLANKLY STARING

586
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,413
What exactly did you do?

587
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,881
He isn't doing anything.

588
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,416
Only Jin can get it.

589
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,085
-Let me take a look. Give me another go.
-I'm sure you'll get it.

590
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,787
Here goes. BTS.

591
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,156
YOU WANT HIM TO INTERPRET THIS?

592
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,258
DIFFICULTY: 11 STARS

593
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,160
CAN JIN READ THE FELLOW IDOL'S MIND?

594
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,095
-What are you doing?
-What the heck?

595
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,498
That's us after a full day of work.

596
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,166
-Exactly.
-So that's what you were going for.

597
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,368
-I'll have to give it to you, then.
-I knew he'd get it.

598
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,572
That's how things are
for all the popular singers.

599
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,340
Cheers, Woo-young.

600
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,376
Here's your next key word.

601
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,911
IVE.

602
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,514
Three, two, one.

603
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,182
DANCE MOVE FOR "LOVE DIVE"
THIS IS IT FOR IVE

604
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,951
-That's rather…
-Geez.

605
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,719
What does he think he's doing?

606
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,821
ANOTHER MOVE FROM "LOVE DIVE"

607
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,123
WE MEANT THIS GUY
AND NOT YOU, WOO-JAE

608
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,993
HE'S AT IT AGAIN

609
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,129
But IVE also happens
to be a successful group.

610
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,931
They must experience fatigue as well.

611
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,633
That's what you had in mind, right?

612
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,001
Seriously?

613
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,569
GREAT K-POP ARTISTS THINK ALIKE

614
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,638
Now, this is the final key word.

615
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,974
-Woo-young, keep it together.
-This is the last one.

616
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,143
-Marriage proposal.
-What?

617
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,712
SHE RECEIVED ONE BACK IN THE DAY

618
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,447
HE'S DONE IT RECENTLY

619
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,849
EVEN THOSE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE
WOULD KNOW THIS POSE

620
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,085
-There are no alternatives for this one.
-Of course not.

621
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,286
There's only one answer.

622
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,754
-You succeeded!
-Okay.

623
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,789
But we still lost the game.

624
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,958
Once again,
the game ends in the human's victory.

625
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,627
Dang it, that human.

626
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,995
Why are we doing so poorly?

627
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,263
WHISPERS SECRETIVELY

628
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,598
-Sorry?
-Isn't Woo-young suspicious?

629
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,233
HE DIDN'T DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN TWO IDOL GROUPS

630
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,002
There was no way we could do this well.

631
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,203
It was difficult.

632
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,572
COME ON, I'M NOT THE HUMAN

633
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,607
STAND BACK, YOU MORTAL!

634
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,011
COULD WOO-YOUNG BE THE HUMAN
DISGUISED AS KING OF THE UNDERWORLD?

635
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,346
We'll have the Night of the Human
when the music plays out.

636
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,315
Please play the music.

637
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,117
Will the human please raise their head…

638
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,485
WHICH ONE OF THEM IS THE HUMAN?

639
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,388
…and tell us the number
of the prize they want?

640
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,225
HUMAN'S PRIZE SELECTION TIME

641
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,793
Please lower your head.

642
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,928
Please turn off the music.

643
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,063
The sun has risen.

644
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,498
Everyone, please wake up.

645
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,999
The human chose…

646
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,734
-Which one is it?
-…Prize Two.

647
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,336
They're taking everything from us!

648
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,339
I suppose their goal
was never the Apple Watch.

649
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,442
They're just taking
whatever we chose first.

650
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,744
-Let's move on to the final game.
-We have to get them now.

651
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,546
WILL THE GODS BE ABLE
TO TRIUMPH IN THE LAST GAME?

652
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,582
WHAT GAME WILL BE THEIR FINAL SHOT
AT FINDING THE HUMAN?

653
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,217
Please gather round, everyone.

654
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,386
You want us to play that game with Jin?

655
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,423
I think I recognize these tools.
Are we really playing that with Jin?

656
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,590
What are they for?

657
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,228
-Jin has to play this?
-What's the game?

658
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,097
This is one of the show's old classics.

659
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,734
Let me introduce today's last game
and your last shot at finding the human.

660
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,571
They say gods are almighty beings.

661
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,440
From what we have learned,

662
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,709
-you have great footwork, Jin.
-Really?

663
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,577
I suppose it's not too shabby.

664
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,716
ACTUALLY, JIN IS KNOWN
TO HAVE MASTERFULLY NIMBLE TOES

665
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,585
-We've heard of your nimble toes, too.
-Can you pick stuff up?

666
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,121
-Oh, I can do that easily.
-I see. Then you'll do well.

667
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,856
-Really?
-Not that I know what we're doing.

668
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,527
The final game is called
the Gods' Foot Basin.

669
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,628
Come on.

670
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,797
It's the Foot Basin Game,
plain and simple.

671
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,367
-No, no.
-It's the God's Foot Basin.

672
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,237
I'm sure you looked over the past games,
hoping to find one involving water.

673
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,605
It is one of our favorites.

674
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,741
This was the last game you played
in our predecessor show.

675
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,808
That's true.

676
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,578
In a way,
this is one of our most treasured games.

677
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,180
-We prepared it in Jin's honor.
-Thank you.

678
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,750
To think we're playing it with Jin…
This should be fun.

679
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,185
-I'm super excited.
-What's this about anyway?

680
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,887
Once again,
you'll be playing a group game.

681
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,156
All six of you will lie down on the lawn.

682
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,759
You'll be given small basins full of water

683
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,162
to pass along using your feet.
Please use them to fill up the water tank.

684
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,232
IF THE WATER LEVEL REACHES 5 CM
WITHIN 5 MINUTES, THEY WIN

685
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,067
What do we do about the lineup?

686
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,335
Jin-kyung should go first.

687
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,937
In that case, the one next to Jin-kyung
is bound to get drenched.

688
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,005
So, Jin should go next.

689
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,374
What do you think?

690
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,042
-I'll decide after I get drenched first.
-Okay.

691
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,644
Jin-kyung goes first.

692
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,146
NO ONE EXPECTS HER TO DO WELL

693
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,914
-You remember, don't you?
-Wait.

694
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,616
If Sook takes the spot next to me,

695
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,385
it will be like pulling up a bucket
from a well for me.

696
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,887
Before we begin,

697
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,356
can you see the prizes?
Which one do you want to wager this time?

698
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,826
Put your faith in me.
Let's go with the small and long package.

699
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,261
-What number is that?
-Number Six.

700
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,096
-So Prize Six.
-Prize Six it is.

701
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,798
Woo-young is good at this.

702
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,332
I'll count on you, Woo-young.

703
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,903
Before all that,
I'll have to count on you,

704
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,739
and you'll have to trust her.
You'll see what I mean.

705
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,240
HEH

706
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,375
CRACKS UP

707
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,211
Can you take those glasses off for me?

708
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,979
You have five minutes.

709
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,715
The basin won't reach me
until the two-minute point.

710
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,783
Ready.

711
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,084
Set, go.

712
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,387
HERE'S YOUR WATER BASIN

713
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,226
WATERY WELCOME GIFT

714
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,628
-Wait.
-That was just pouring it on me!

715
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,731
AND SO IT BEGINS

716
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,701
That's why you have to collect
the basin soon. Where's the bowl?

717
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,003
-Jin, take it from her quickly.
-Let's hurry it up.

718
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,873
-The time is ticking!
-Remove your socks for better friction.

719
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,408
Go on, Jin. Take it from her.

720
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,679
-You have to catch it.
-That was so blatant!

721
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,080
Why didn't you take it from me?

722
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,448
CRYING-LAUGHING

723
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,950
Why didn't you take it from me?

724
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,352
What do you mean?
It has to reach me first!

725
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,387
-I'll take his place.
-Hey, Jin.

726
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,989
-I'll do better.
-Really?

727
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,824
Dang. Hold on a second.

728
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,860
REGRET WASHES OVER HIM
30 SECONDS INTO THE GAME

729
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,261
Here. Take it.

730
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,296
-There you go.
-He's good.

731
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,631
-I'll get it.
-You're doing great.

732
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,699
CLUTCH

733
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:01,766
Good job.

734
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,002
HE JUST BARELY PASSED
THE FIRST BASIN

735
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,037
No! Dang it.

736
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,506
I look like I peed myself!

737
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,342
REGARDLESS,
ANOTHER BASIN APPROACHES HIM

738
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,544
SPLASH!

739
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,746
Hold very still, Jin. I'll get it.

740
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,849
Hold it right there, Jin-kyung.
I'll come get it.

741
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,919
-Here. There you go.
-Just stay right there!

742
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:21,987
Good job.

743
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,989
BASIN FINALLY REACHES HUNGRY GOD

744
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,158
Woo-jae! Hey, Woo-jae!

745
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,226
HEY, TAKE THIS

746
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,328
UNEXPECTED SPLASH

747
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,064
-You should've reacted quickly!
-What on earth?

748
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,134
How was I supposed to do that?
You poured that on me!

749
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,503
-Get ready, Woo-jae. Quickly!
-Okay.

750
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,571
Good job, Jin!

751
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,439
How am I supposed to react quickly

752
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,842
when you're just intent on…

753
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,243
splashing water all over me?

754
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,778
I told you Sook was the human!

755
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:47,979
No, I'm not!

756
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,548
-We're doing great.
-Well done.

757
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,016
We're a great pair.

758
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,585
THESE TWO ARE THE WEAKEST LINK

759
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,587
THROWING THE BASIN AWAY

760
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,356
THE BASINS KEEP ON COMING

761
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,758
TAKING OFF HIS SOCKS

762
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,859
Hey, Woo-jae!

763
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,895
THIS TIME,
HE'S TACKLING IT BAREFOOT

764
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,031
FINALLY, THE FIRST ONE

765
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,669
-Hold it right there. Don't move!
-Good. I'm staying right here.

766
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,803
Good job.

767
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,772
-Well done.
-We're good.

768
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,241
BASIN DELIVERY FAILED

769
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,643
NO MATTER HOW AWFUL JIN-KYUNG'S PASS IS

770
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,314
IF ONLY JIN CAN HANG IN THERE
AND HOLD IT STEADY…

771
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,583
THE ACE PLAYER OF SCREWBALLS
WILL GET THE BASIN

772
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,785
INCREDIBLE PRECISION

773
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,020
FLYING SPEED

774
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,855
THE BASIN MOVES ALONG SMOOTHLY

775
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,158
We can do this. You're doing great, Jin.

776
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,926
THE SECOND BASIN
FILLS UP THE TANK

777
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,261
Great.

778
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,430
EVEN IF JIN-KYUNG MAKES A SLOPPY PASS

779
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,864
You're good.

780
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,067
JIN CAN TAKE IT

781
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,102
WHILE HE DID GET THE BASIN…

782
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,237
SHAKING DANGEROUSLY

783
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,672
-It's cold!
-Here.

784
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,575
-The tank is almost filled up.
-Damn it!

785
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,310
ANNOYED OUTBURST

786
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,912
-The tank is almost filled up.
-Damn it!

787
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,814
DODGING INSTINCTIVELY

788
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,450
Why aren't you taking it?

789
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,353
-If it gets shaky, pour it over her.
-Okay.

790
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,455
-Got it, Woo-young.
-We're doing great.

791
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,924
LESS THAN 3 MINUTES NOW

792
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:06,992
Hurry up!

793
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,293
CLENCHES HER TEETH

794
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,596
Oh, no. Let's be careful.

795
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,732
-Steady.
-I don't get it!

796
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,868
WHY WOULD YOU SHAKE THE BASIN?

797
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,704
THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU TO BE CAREFUL

798
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,872
Sae-ho.

799
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,775
JIN-KYUNG IS THE HUMAN, 100%
AGREED

800
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,277
SHE ISN'T GOOD AT GAMES TO BEGIN WITH

801
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,214
BUT SHE'S TROLLING ESPECIALLY HARDER TODAY

802
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,084
Why didn't you take the basin?
You should've taken it from me.

803
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,687
WHETHER DECEPTION IS INVOLVED OR NOT,
HER PERFORMANCE IS FRIGHTENING

804
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,923
-Focus, Jin-kyung.
-Let's try again.

805
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,059
Sorry.

806
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,561
ULTRA-LOCALIZED DOWNPOUR

807
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,931
-Can't you do better, mister?
-Look at her.

808
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,501
-Way to show us that you're human.
-Geez, Jin-kyung.

809
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,236
-The day is almost up…
-And you're being obvious.

810
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,638
JIN DOESN'T EVEN GET MAD NOW

811
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,340
How long do we have left?

812
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,342
-Two minutes? Let's switch up.
-Let's do that.

813
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,010
-Let's swap our places.
-Take it. Hurry.

814
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,080
THE DOWNPOUR CAME EARLIER

815
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,782
Go to the back.

816
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,151
GRATIFIED

817
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,519
On your feet.

818
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,854
-I can't believe you.
-We're running out of time.

819
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,058
I'm soaked down to my underpants.

820
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,627
SEEMS LIKELY

821
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,496
Jin gave me amazing satisfaction.

822
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,332
NOW THE CAPSAICIN GOD KICKS THE GAME OFF

823
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,168
-Wait a second.
-It's coming.

824
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,303
STARTLED

825
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,606
WHAT ON EARTH?

826
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,076
AIM AT YOUR TARGET

827
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,410
AND FIRE!

828
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,778
Gosh, that's freezing!

829
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,582
HIT IN THE CROSS FIRE WHILE LAUGHING

830
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,284
-What was that?
-What on earth?

831
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,154
DO YOU HAVE TO ASK?
THAT'S THE GRASSHOPPER'S KARMA

832
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,623
Guys, hurry up. We have a tank to fill up.

833
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,727
Wait. Hang on. I should start the game.

834
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,062
I'm no good at receiving the basin.

835
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,531
Dang it! Take it from me!

836
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,934
-My legs are cramping!
-Wait, we need to discuss something.

837
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,570
Help me! My legs are cramping!

838
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,038
TORTUROUS

839
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,607
-We need to clear something here.
-Help!

840
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,076
NONE OF OUR BUSINESS

841
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,345
I need someone
to put the basin on my soles.

842
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,380
RETURNS TO HER INITIAL SPOT

843
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,850
SCURRIES AWAY

844
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,486
-Sae-ho is great at receiving the basin.
-You bet.

845
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,054
IS THAT RIGHT?

846
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,388
TAKE THIS, THEN!

847
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,458
In that case, the one next to Jin-kyung
is bound to get drenched.

848
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,526
SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

849
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,827
Sorry.

850
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,797
GIGGLING

851
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,466
-Seriously?
-I think she's worn out.

852
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,468
Woo-young.

853
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,137
She's the human.

854
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,538
I think she's worn out.

855
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,540
My legs have gone weak. There we go.

856
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,777
-Here it comes.
-It's okay.

857
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,678
AFTER THE DEPENDABLE JIN
AND WOO-YOUNG

858
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,946
Steady.

859
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,681
Why is it so high up?

860
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,216
BLAME YOUR HEIGHT DIFFERENCE

861
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,418
BASIN HELD ASKEW

862
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,587
MR. LONG-LEGS JOINS IN

863
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,524
THE CURSED BERMUDA TRIANGLE

864
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,161
DELIVERY CHAIN FACED WITH ROADBLOCKS

865
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,862
THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRUST

866
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,131
I'M MERELY HOLDING ON THROUGH SHEER WILL

867
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,499
Dang, it's warm now.

868
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,935
It feels like I wet myself.

869
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,237
It's like I peed on myself upside down.

870
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,440
-Everyone is holding a basin each.
-Just a second.

871
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,543
INSANE BASIN PARTY

872
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,646
IN THE END, ONE FALLS DOWN

873
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,749
Who was next to me earlier?
I had no trouble then.

874
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,450
-It was Sae-ho.
-Oh, right.

875
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,985
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?

876
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,755
-He's the perfect fit here.
-Your time is up.

877
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,423
THEY GAIN PROFOUND INSIGHT
AS THE GAME ENDS

878
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,392
Seriously, Jin-kyung.

879
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,626
We got our human.

880
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,695
Let's just have a water fight.

881
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,031
-I'm sure of it.
-Hold on. How was the game for you, Jin?

882
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,999
I think I'm up for it

883
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,069
as long as Jin-kyung is not next to me.

884
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,172
From what I've seen,
Jin has the potential to be amazing.

885
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,842
If you ask me,
Jin should take the first spot.

886
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:47,879
No, that should be me.
I can't hold on to the basin without help.

887
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,583
I need Sae-ho next to me
to receive the basin well.

888
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,386
-Really? In that case--
-Jin-kyung, me, Jin, then you.

889
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,688
-Okay.
-All right.

890
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,591
-This is your last attempt.
-Okay.

891
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,893
Jin-kyung and Jin
worked pretty well together.

892
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,862
She basically poured it on me.

893
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,931
You did your fair share yourself.

894
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,934
I only fought back
because I couldn't take it anymore.

895
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,069
HAS NO RETORT FOR THAT

896
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,104
If I had known
I'd have to play this crappy game,

897
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,306
I would've worn waterproof underpants.

898
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,676
-Is there such a thing?
-Why the waterproof underpants?

899
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,944
No, there isn't.

900
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,446
BTS WOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE
GETTING A PAIR

901
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,581
-Let's do this!
-We've got this!

902
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,018
Your target is 5 cm,
and the current water level is 3 cm.

903
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,120
-So we're almost there.
-You're almost there.

904
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,391
CURRENT STANDINGS
HUMAN: 1, GODS: 0

905
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,760
CURRENT STANDINGS
HUMAN: 2, GODS: 0

906
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,229
-Let's go. No fooling around this time.
-It's gotten chilly.

907
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,297
Ready.

908
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,365
CAN'T STOP HERE

909
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,033
Set, go.

910
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,470
Good. Hold it right there.

911
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,473
THIS COURIER IS ANNOYED AT BEING
ASKED TO HOLD STILL ALL THE TIME

912
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,375
SPILL

913
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,676
She's awful!

914
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,944
Let's hope we can get that water.

915
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,846
THEY HAVE TO SECURE
THE WATER IN THE BASIN

916
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,715
Oh, no!

917
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,017
Many a little makes a mickle.

918
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,685
Hey, Jin.

919
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,589
-Speed isn't the issue.
-There we go.

920
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,790
Nice and slow.

921
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,925
Dang it.

922
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,159
Dang it.

923
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,427
SECOND DELIVERY FAILURE

924
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,561
Should I remove my socks?

925
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,698
Hang on.
Is Jin dropping the basin on purpose?

926
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,804
Jin-kyung is awful at this.
She's hopeless.

927
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,039
Hold it right there.

928
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,573
-There we go.
-Okay.

929
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,643
-This is the way. That's good.
-Nice and steady.

930
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,413
-We don't have much time.
-And after this…

931
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,248
And after this…

932
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,783
FLAILING WITHOUT PURPOSE

933
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,520
SPLASH!

934
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,088
Sae-ho's legs don't go that high.

935
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,290
DELIVERY MADE DIRECTLY TO MR. SHORT-LEGS

936
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,961
The basin is here. I got it now. Good.

937
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,028
Okay.

938
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,497
FIRST BASIN DELIVERED NEATLY

939
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,067
-We're working well.
-We're almost there.

940
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,102
You've got this.

941
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,236
ON THE ROPES

942
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,073
DESPERATE EFFORTS

943
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,008
-Okay.
-No.

944
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,543
SPILLING

945
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,645
HOLDS UP HIS WIG

946
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,280
What now?

947
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,949
What is that for?

948
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,617
WHAT ON EARTH?

949
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,354
Put it in the tank.

950
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,389
MR. CHILI-SAUCE'S WIG
ALSO LANDS IN THE TANK

951
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,458
Dang. I'm soaked through.

952
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,759
THEY ONLY HAVE 3 MINUTES NOW

953
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,930
-Why do you keep dropping the basin?
-Come on, Jin-kyung!

954
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,698
-I passed it to you fine.
-Jin-kyung!

955
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,634
-Are you a part of the grass?
-Jin-kyung has never been good at this.

956
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,036
It feels like I'm talking to the grass…

957
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,939
-Come on, Jin-kyung!
-Goodness, Jin-kyung.

958
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,008
She's doing that on purpose.

959
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,510
WOO-YOUNG TURNS LIKE REVOLVING
DOORS TO PASS THE BASIN

960
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,412
-I'll pass it to you.
-Okay.

961
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,980
-Hold it steady.
-Okay.

962
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,815
Hey, Sae-ho. Wait.

963
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,751
-Hang on.
-Move it this way.

964
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,352
ANOTHER SPLASH!

965
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,254
-Here's an unspilled one.
-Okay.

966
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,456
Just a second. Hey, Sae-ho.

967
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,992
Wait. Why can't we get it right?
Hey, Woo-jae.

968
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,293
Dang it.

969
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,296
-Here's another one.
-Come collect it yourself, Woo-jae.

970
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,198
We're almost there, aren't we?

971
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,034
I think the guys by the end
spilled them all.

972
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,102
AND JIN IS RIGHT

973
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:02,073
WHEN THE FOREMAN OF THE GROUP
HEARD THIS NEWS…

974
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,307
SNEAKS A GLANCE

975
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,610
-Damn you.
-What?

976
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,713
ADDS MOISTURE TO THE SPICY CHICKEN

977
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,314
HE COULDN'T HOLD BACK ANY LONGER

978
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,716
-Who did that?
-Woo-young.

979
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,818
Get it together, Woo-young.

980
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,354
I've done better than anyone so far!

981
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,422
Oh, I got it.

982
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,791
BUT THE TIME KEEPS ON TICKING…

983
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm too cold now. I need some warm water.

984
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,828
I'm so cold. I need some on me.

985
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,329
POURING WATER ALL OVER HIMSELF

986
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,500
We did our best to deliver that safely,
and he's pouring it to warm himself up.

987
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,303
HUMAN(?),
YOU'RE ADDICTED TO SHOWERS

988
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,806
I'm sorry. I was too cold.
I needed some hot water.

989
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,008
Your costume makes you look the warmest.

990
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,743
HOT BODY

991
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,012
-Oh, good. This is great.
-This way.

992
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,613
GAINING MOMENTUM

993
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,715
CLASPING THE BASIN
WITH HIS LONG TOES

994
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,083
Let's go!

995
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,351
We're almost there!

996
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,388
-How far are we?
-We only need 0.2 cm more.

997
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,190
-We can fill it up with one more basin.
-One more.

998
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,759
SUCCESS IS WITHIN SIGHT!

999
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,827
PINCER-FEET

1000
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,728
-Nice and neat.
-Nice and neat?

1001
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:58,796
Yeah.

1002
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,932
NICE AND NEAT DELIVERY SO FAR

1003
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,801
-Just a bit further to this side.
-Okay. Nice and neat.

1004
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,869
Nice and neat.

1005
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,238
NICE AND NEAT FINISH

1006
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,941
-Nice and neat.
-Jin and I are on fire.

1007
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,210
WILL SHE EVER IMPROVE?

1008
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,978
We're doing great.

1009
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,247
-We're doing fine.
-I'm getting the hang of it. Okay!

1010
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,615
I mastered it!

1011
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,585
You're really close to the goal.

1012
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,154
Just a bit more. It's okay, Jin-kyung.
No, we can deliver it.

1013
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,856
-Pass it along.
-I'll try…

1014
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,391
-No way. Give that one up.
-You think so?

1015
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,960
THAT BASIN IS DONE FOR

1016
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,329
Ditch the basin
if you don't think you can deliver it.

1017
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,864
Okay. No, I can't get that.

1018
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,934
SAVE THIS GRASSHOPPER

1019
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,270
Sorry.

1020
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,406
-It feels like we're watering the lawn.
-Dang it.

1021
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,542
By next week, we may see trees here.

1022
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,511
DRENCHED

1023
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,179
You have 30 seconds left.

1024
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,081
-Dang it. My legs feel like jelly.
-Got it.

1025
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,483
-Collect the basin yourself.
-Okay.

1026
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,019
SECURE GRIP

1027
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,088
HYPER-FOCUSED

1028
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,689
Finish strong, Woo-jae!

1029
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,458
-Here.
-Finish strong, Woo-jae!

1030
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,559
You've got it, Sook.

1031
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,094
-Here you go.
-It's done.

1032
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,295
LAST BASIN REACHES
ITS DESTINATION

1033
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,429
All right.

1034
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,499
Please help us out, Woo-jae!

1035
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,901
All right.

1036
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,069
THERE'S ONE MORE BASIN LEFT

1037
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,739
-We passed the goal!
-What?

1038
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,975
AS WOO-JAE SHOUTS OUT,

1039
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,777
TIME RUNS OUT

1040
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,379
Did we reach it?

1041
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,647
See for yourselves.

1042
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,948
Wait, we might not have enough

1043
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,750
-when we take out the wig.
-No, we're good.

1044
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,319
-Wouldn't it have soaked up the water?
-Why is it there anyway?

1045
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,355
-Can you take out the wig?
-Wring it out.

1046
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,657
As much as possible.

1047
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,562
WILL THEY HAVE REACHED THEIR GOAL?

1048
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,464
-It's over the 5 cm mark.
-Okay!

1049
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,534
The gods won the Foot Basin Game.
Congratulations, everyone.

1050
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,938
THE TRIUMPH OF THE GLORIOUS GODS

1051
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,775
-The gods secured Prize Six.
-Let's give each other a big hand.

1052
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,177
-Congratulations.
-Let's go.

1053
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:59,483
SUPPOSEDLY HOLY AND SACRED
PARTY OF THE GODS

1054
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,955
AND YET,
ONE IMPUDENT HUMAN SNUCK IN

1055
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,725
THE HUMAN'S IDENTITY
CAN ONLY BE CONFIRMED

1056
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,461
BY THESE 6 MYSTERIOUS BUTTONS

1057
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,529
Hold on.

1058
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,932
THE HUMAN DARED TO TRICK THE GODS

1059
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,336
-The human chose Prize Five.
-They took what was ours.

1060
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,273
-The human chose Prize Two.
-They're taking everything from us!

1061
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,976
THE HUMAN STOLE
THE GODS' BOUNTY IN SECRET

1062
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,646
AND CAUSED STRIFE AMONG THE GODS

1063
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:33,451
ONE IRREGULAR BEING
HID THEMSELVES AMONG THE GODS

1064
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,388
AND ORCHESTRATED
THE RIFT BETWEEN THE GODS

1065
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,391
AND NOW,

1066
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,694
THE BOLD HUMAN'S IDENTITY WILL BE REVEALED

1067
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,597
That concludes today's games.

1068
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,201
Now, please decide on the human's identity
Shall we hear your opinions?

1069
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,671
I think it's either Jin-kyung or Sook.

1070
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,906
-Why me?
-Sook dropped the basin loads of times.

1071
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,108
It's not me!

1072
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,909
Jin-kyung just poured water
all over my face.

1073
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,612
-I really did my best.
-As for today…

1074
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,014
-Same here.
-I actually did fine

1075
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,049
compared to my usual performances.

1076
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,984
She's always been terrible at games.

1077
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,586
-Really?
-She did well.

1078
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,955
Still, Jin-kyung gets my vote today.

1079
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,457
-Come on, Sae-ho. You're wrong.
-Me?

1080
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,694
-I'm not the human.
-You got it wrong, Sae-ho.

1081
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,962
-Who is it, then?
-It's Sook.

1082
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,563
Here's my final deduction.

1083
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,766
If Woo-young were the human,

1084
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,268
he would've stayed silent
when we all blamed Jin-kyung.

1085
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,638
Seeing how he didn't,
I'm pretty sure he's a god.

1086
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,873
Oh, man.

1087
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,309
Gosh, Woo-jae.
This is why you've had so many successes.

1088
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,510
We four are gods.

1089
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,112
-Two ladies, please step forward.
-What, me?

1090
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,848
You two made a total mess with the water.

1091
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,351
I too would like to see
Jin-kyung and Sook step forward.

1092
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,887
-Me too.
-Okay. Then Jin-kyung…

1093
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,123
-You guys are driving me insane.
-I swear I'm not human.

1094
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,626
It will be crazy
if it turns out to be Jin-kyung.

1095
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,594
-It's not me.
-You can then forget about soju.

1096
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,730
I really am not the human.

1097
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,599
If I were the human, I would've been
out front with you from the beginning.

1098
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,767
Woo-jae, look me in the eye.

1099
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,937
THESE TWO ARE SO UPSET THAT
THEY FORGET ABOUT THE CAMERAS

1100
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,672
No, I'm sure it's Sook.

1101
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,107
I swear it's not me!

1102
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,975
-I'm wavering between these two.
-It's really not me.

1103
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:08,679
-Hear me out. It's Sook. I'm sure of it.
-You think it's Sook?

1104
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,516
It's because we have food here.
I'm the Hungry God.

1105
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,586
SOOK DREW SUSPICION AFTER
THE HUMAN'S EXISTENCE WAS ANNOUNCED

1106
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,687
What on earth?

1107
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:20,758
IT WAS UNLIKE HER TO FAIL
AT CATCHING THE REINVENTED IDIOM

1108
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,593
SHE KEPT THROWING BASINS OFF COURSE

1109
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,696
WHENEVER THEY WERE CLOSE
TO POURING THE WATER IN THE TANK

1110
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,066
GODS' EMERGENCY SUMMIT

1111
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,570
IMPROMPTU VOTE WITH ONE FINGER
FOR SOOK, AND TWO FOR JIN-KYUNG

1112
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,972
-The human can't be among us, right?
-No way.

1113
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,909
-We're all done for if otherwise.
-One for Sook, two for Jin-kyung.

1114
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,311
-Three, two, one.
-Three, two, one.

1115
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,580
You think it's Sook?

1116
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,014
-I'm sure of it.
-It's Jin-kyung.

1117
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,316
No, Jin.

1118
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,917
Jin, it's not me.

1119
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,019
-We reached our decision.
-Really?

1120
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,623
Please point to the human on three.
One, two, three.

1121
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,226
-Jin-kyung.
-You human.

1122
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,162
Are you sure? Will you have no regrets?
You won't change your minds?

1123
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,964
Please bring us the buttons--

1124
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,769
Suppose the crew didn't set up the buttons
and the decision was made randomly.

1125
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,138
What are the odds of the human button
being left until the end?

1126
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,407
I was the last to go.
You should reconsider.

1127
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,610
GODS HAD INTERVIEWS ONE BY ONE

1128
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:13,677
Please take a seat.

1129
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,947
Goodness. What are those?

1130
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,816
What are these?

1131
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,619
THE BUTTONS USED IN THE PROCESS
OF IDENTIFYING THE HUMAN

1132
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,454
HAVE BEEN REMOVED ONE BY ONE

1133
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,990
You'll see one button in front of you.

1134
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,525
Please press it.

1135
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,394
THERE WAS ONE BUTTON LAID OUT
IN FRONT OF JIN-KYUNG

1136
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,997
COULD THE LAST REMAINING BUTTON

1137
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,765
HAVE BEEN THE ONE
IDENTIFYING HER AS HUMAN?

1138
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,604
-Is it Sook, then? This is driving me mad.
-Please reach a decision.

1139
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,906
Let's leave it up to Jin.

1140
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,941
I swear I'm not human!

1141
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,910
HE MEANT YOU TO DECIDE
BETWEEN THE TWO…

1142
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,546
-I thought you were suspecting me again.
-It's not me.

1143
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,848
CLAIMING HER INNOCENCE
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE

1144
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,751
-Okay, then I'll go with Sook.
-Well done!

1145
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,886
IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT

1146
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,922
SUSPICION SHIFTED TO THE HUNGRY GOD

1147
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,958
-Are you all idiots or what?
-Press your button, Sook.

1148
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,259
SOOK IS THEIR FINAL CHOICE

1149
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:05,996
Please press your button
on the count of three.

1150
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,531
-I told you not to choose me.
-Hey, human.

1151
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,732
It's Sook for sure.

1152
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,035
-…two…
-I swear I'll beat you up, Woo-young.

1153
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,102
-I'm certain.
-…three.

1154
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,608
SHE WILL UNCOVER HER IDENTITY

1155
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,811
USING THE BUTTON
SHE CHOSE EARLIER

1156
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,451
-I'm a god.
-She's a god!

1157
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,954
SOOK TURNED OUT TO BE A GOD!

1158
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,822
THEN WHO IS THE HUMAN?

1159
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,024
-It's incredible.
-I swear it's not me.

1160
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,193
SHOCKED

1161
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,195
NO! CAN IT BE THE ICE GOD?

1162
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,864
What the heck? I'm a god.

1163
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,931
Get out!

1164
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,700
-You said you'd go all in.
-And I will.

1165
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,001
Press your button.

1166
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,669
-Go ahead and press yours.
-Why me?

1167
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,171
I'm a god for sure.

1168
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,608
-I'm a god for sure.
-I'm a god.

1169
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,676
-He was right.
-What on earth?

1170
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,545
-What about Woo-young?
-I'll press mine.

1171
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,480
-It must be Jin!
-I'm a god.

1172
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,482
You're a menace, then. Press your button.

1173
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,484
-Maybe it's Jin.
-It must be Jin!

1174
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,820
COULD JIN BE THE HUMAN?

1175
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:03,888
It's not me!

1176
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:07,091
-Press your button, Jin.
-I'm telling you it's not me.

1177
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,492
I'm telling you it's not me.

1178
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,462
-I'm a god.
-What the heck?

1179
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,798
ONLY 2 CANDIDATES REMAIN

1180
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,800
-What's up with you?
-Jin-kyung!

1181
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,704
Weren't these two the last two remaining
in a similar game before?

1182
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,907
ONE OF THEM IS LYING

1183
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,575
-Is it you, Jin-kyung?
-Press your button.

1184
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,179
STARTING FROM HER SLOPPY PERFORMANCE

1185
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,918
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER HAS BEEN HELD
UNDER SUSPICION FROM THE START

1186
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,253
WHILE WOO-YOUNG STRANGELY

1187
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,256
HAD NO IDEA ABOUT SIGNATURE
MOVES OF BTS OR IVE

1188
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,259
AS WELL AS IDIOMS

1189
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,295
IS HE TRULY CLUELESS?

1190
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,563
OR IS HE A MASTER ACTOR?

1191
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,598
Press your button, Jin-kyung.

1192
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,268
JIN-KYUNG PRESSES HER BUTTON FIRST

1193
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,270
I can't believe Woo-young.

1194
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,672
Geez, you foolish human.

1195
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,340
Geez, you foolish human.

1196
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,775
Damn it.

1197
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:01,545
-I knew it!
-See? I told you she was human!

1198
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,047
JIN-KYUNG WAS THE HUMAN

1199
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,050
THE THREE GUYS WERE
ACKNOWLEDGED AS GODS FIRST

1200
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,351
See?

1201
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,620
Jin might get the human role at this rate.

1202
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,989
YET…

1203
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,958
JIN AND SOOK WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS GODS

1204
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,459
I'm a god, you see.

1205
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,029
TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE…

1206
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,332
What was that?

1207
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,834
-I'm the human?
-Apparently so.

1208
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,436
AND SO THE GOD OF TV SHOWS
BECAME HUMAN

1209
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,272
You must make them lose the games.

1210
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,541
THE DIRECTOR EVEN REMINDED HER
OF THE RULES JUST IN CASE

1211
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,878
HER LOOK ALONE WAS ENOUGH
TO FOOL THE DISTRUSTFUL WOO-JAE

1212
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,414
This is how she would've looked
if she had been human.

1213
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,849
She would say this as she entered.

1214
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,017
"I'm the human."

1215
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,054
WHILE THE GODS RIDICULED HER

1216
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,125
THE HUMAN HAD BEEN SMILING
BEHIND THEIR BACKS

1217
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,162
THE DARING HUMAN WHO TOYED WITH THE GODS

1218
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:55,599
HER NAME IS HONG JIN-KYUNG

1219
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,936
THE DAY ENDS IN VICTORY FOR THE HUMAN

1220
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,671
SHOCKED

1221
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,507
-What's gotten into you, Woo-young?
-You dummy.

1222
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,809
I've got chills running down my spine!

1223
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,712
-It's too late for that, don't you think?
-You idiot, Woo-young!

1224
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,315
DEEPLY GRATIFIED

1225
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,451
I spent the whole day covering for her!

1226
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,388
There's no way it is her.
It just can't be her.

1227
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,856
HE TRUSTED HER FULLY FROM THE START

1228
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,557
Jin-kyung and I honestly have no clue.

1229
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,426
PUTTING ON AN ACT

1230
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,929
HE WASTED HIS DAY
MAKING EXCUSES FOR THE HUMAN

1231
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,099
KING OF THE UNDERWORLD
GOT PLAYED BY THE HUMAN

1232
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,136
-I'll enjoy the prizes.
-As the final results stand--

1233
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,505
If I had won as the human,

1234
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,508
-I would give the prizes to Jin.
-Of course.

1235
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:38,575
That's a given.

1236
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,544
Seriously, you jerk!

1237
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,180
-He's such a gentleman.
-That's what I would've done. That's all.

1238
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,182
You really are a gentleman.

1239
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,984
I do the same thing on Run Jin too.

1240
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,653
If we have any presents,
I always give them to my guests.

1241
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,691
ISN'T THAT THE NORM ON VARIETY SHOWS?

1242
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:56,860
Jin-kyung's prizes
have been displayed over there.

1243
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:01,065
I mean, hear me out.
I won these fair and square.

1244
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,167
-Yeah, that's right.
-They're yours, obviously.

1245
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,135
I won them,
so aren't they rightfully Jin's?

1246
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,806
-Oh, no.
-It was Jin's to begin with.

1247
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,308
-I insist.
-I still think you should take it.

1248
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,376
-Jin.
-I wouldn't feel--

1249
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,378
You'd be saving my neck here.

1250
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,547
Save me here. Please accept my gifts.

1251
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,684
THE VIRTUOUS JIN SAVES A LIFE

1252
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,153
-I can't wait to see what's inside there.
-Me too.

1253
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,956
-Is this really an Apple Watch?
-I don't think so.

1254
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,825
I doubt it too. It could be a charger.

1255
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,327
-It's not it. No, you're right.
-Really?

1256
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:35,299
-Is it a bracelet?
-It's a strap for your phone.

1257
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,502
-This one is a portable power bank.
-That can be useful.

1258
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,404
OPENS UP THE REMAINING BOX

1259
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,306
-That's cute.
-Is that a hole puncher?

1260
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,574
This is a speaker.

1261
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,577
-The color fits my costume perfectly.
-It's an umbrella.

1262
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,545
You were right, Sae-ho.

1263
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,615
-All these should be yours.
-I was just joking.

1264
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,451
Why should a useless guest get the prize?

1265
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,086
What are you saying?

1266
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,022
I wasn't caught in the same frame
as Sae-ho, right? I'm good, then.

1267
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,090
I have enough…

1268
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,426
Please go easy on me, Jin.

1269
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,195
-You should take it. Really?
-I have about forty of these at home.

1270
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,100
Could you share your thoughts
on your day together with us?

1271
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,037
I book appearances on variety shows
simply to have fun.

1272
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,774
I had great fun, just as I had hoped.

1273
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,742
So I feel amazing.

1274
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,877
Originally,

1275
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,080
I was planning to appear
on Real Study King next.

1276
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,449
But after today's unbelievable betrayal,

1277
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,985
-I'll have to cancel that appointment.
-That's a good idea.

1278
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,554
-What betrayal?
-There are plenty of options for you.

1279
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,257
There are Today's Joo Woo-jae,
Channel Cho Sae-ho…

1280
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,992
-That's true.
-…Mr. Jang: A Man of Leisure,

1281
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,660
and Kimsook TV.

1282
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,896
THERE ARE PLENTY OF GREAT CHANNELS

1283
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,399
IF YOU HAVE SOME SPARE TIME,
PLEASE VISIT STUDIO++'S CHANNEL

1284
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,635
Before we say goodbye,

1285
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:48,338
since Jin will be promoting
a new song after his long break,

1286
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,541
let's wish him luck together.
What should our chant be?

1287
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,310
"Good luck,
'Don't Say You Love Me' and Screwballs."

1288
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,611
-Okay.
-That's good.

1289
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,679
Good luck,

1290
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,515
-"Don't Say You Love Me" and Screwballs!
-"Don't Say You Love Me" and Screwballs!

1291
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,450
-Good work, everyone.
-Thank you.

1292
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,454
-Thank you, guys.
-Same to you, Jin.

1293
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,957
-See you soon.
-Sure, I'll see you on your show.

1294
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,192
WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST, JIN

1295
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,527
Next episode on Screwballs…

1296
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,462
Single's Inferno.

1297
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:16,033
I'm Sherry Hong, a hairstylist
and entrepreneur based in Hong Kong.

1298
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,868
HERE ARE HOT GUYS AND HOT DOLLS

1299
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,103
WHO CRAVE EXCITEMENT
FROM NEW ROMANCE

1300
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,506
THERE ARE 3 GUYS,
BUT ONLY 2 GIRLS

1301
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,842
We have a guest joining us
to even out the numbers.

1302
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,577
Could it be Suzy?

1303
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,911
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING

1304
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,546
It seemed like I was the hottest girl.

1305
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,382
THE UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL OF AN HEIRESS

1306
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,884
Oh, dear.

1307
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,719
I WANNA GO HOME

1308
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,421
SHE'S GOT SPIRIT

1309
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,488
Would you look at that?

1310
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,225
I'll find the right guy for me.

1311
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,893
HER CHARMS ARE IRRESISTIBLE

1312
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,462
Hye-seon's unique qualities drew me in.

1313
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,797
ROMANCES BLOOM

1314
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,966
I felt drawn to Hye-seon.

1315
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,134
It seemed like
she's been working out regularly.

1316
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,470
TO WIN YOUR LOVE OVER,

1317
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,672
YOU MUST PROVE YOUR STRENGTH

1318
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,608
RISK YOUR LIFE FOR YOUR LOVE

1319
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,677
-I want to steal Woo-young from her.
-How dare she?

1320
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,012
CAN SHE KEEP HER LOVED ONE?

1321
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,947
Which middle school did you attend?

1322
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,282
Kimsang Middle School.

1323
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,117
Isn't it an all-boys school?

1324
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,552
CONFUSED AND BEFUDDLED

1325
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,854
I'm a graduate
of Lan Kwai Fong Girls' Middle School.

1329
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,029
CURRENT FLING, FORMER FLING

1330
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,064
IRRESISTIBLE FLUTTERING,
TICKLISH SENSATIONS

1331
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,066
What did you find so appealing about me?

1332
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,335
THEY HAD ENOUGH OF SUGARY SWEET AFFECTION

1333
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,670
OR SO IT SEEMED

1334
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,839
Damn it! Jin-kyung!

1335
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,774
YOU CAN'T FIND A LIKE-MINDED SOUL

1336
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:31,842
IN THE COUPLE'S INFERNO

1337
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,645
Singles will go to Paradise,
while couples will end up in Inferno.

1338
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,246
Relationships are optional.

1339
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,682
I'll do whatever it takes to get payback
for my humiliation and remain single.

1340
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,183
WHAT YOU NEED TO GO TO PARADISE

1341
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,451
IS AN ENEMY, NOT LOVE

1342
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,653
I'll avoid that no matter what.

1343
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,254
I'm most at ease when I'm single.

1344
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,390
I'll work harder
than in any of the episodes so far.

1345
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,457
WHO WILL END UP IN INFERNO?
