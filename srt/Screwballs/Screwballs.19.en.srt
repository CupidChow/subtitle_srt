00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs…

00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,804
TODAY'S DRESS CODE: REPLY 1995

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,706
Come back home

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,742
WALKING A FINE LINE
BETWEEN NOSTALGIA AND DISRESPECT

5
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:09,876
I'm Cool's Lee Jae-hoon.

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,213
"Nobody for Deungchon-dong?
Then we're rolling."

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,848
Where's our angler, anyway?

8
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,451
It's "Celebration
of the 30th Year in Sook's Career."

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,353
So we got here early to prepare for it?

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,490
ROPING IN SPECIAL ENVOYS
RIGHT ON THE SPOT

11
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,395
WILL THE ROPED-IN SPECIAL ENVOYS
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS?

12
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,364
LOOKS AROUND

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,665
There's Chimchakman.

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,234
WHERE?

15
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,537
CHIMCHAKMAN

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,573
-Hey, Chimchakman!
-What a chill guy.

17
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,376
MR. CHILL GUY APPROACHES CALMLY

18
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,680
HERE'S CHIMCHAKMAN

19
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,082
-Hello.
-Hello!

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,117
Thank you so much for coming.

21
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,319
What a loyal friend you are.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,056
ROPED-IN SPECIAL ENVOY NO. 1

23
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,824
-Docking 100 billion points?
-How childish.

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,559
THE STAR YOUTUBER
WITH 2.83 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS

25
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,728
THIS TEASE IS AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARMER

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,064
INTRODUCING WOO-JAE'S FRIEND

27
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,265
CHIMCHAKMAN (LEE BYEONG-GEON)

28
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,733

CHIMCHAKMAN'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,968
Let's give it up for Chimchakman.

30
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,005
I rarely make a request like this.

31
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,073
What were you doing earlier?

32
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,041
My family and I came to Gangnam

33
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,377
to read some books
at the Kyobo Book Center here.

34
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,212
-Really?
-Yeah, we had some free time.

35
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,947
So your wife and Sso-yeong were with you?

36
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,682
Sso-yeong loves reading.

37
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,118
By the way, where is Sook?

38
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,653
The banner outside would've told you,

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,488
but she's celebrating
the 30th year in her career.

40
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,056
The milestone…

41
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,258
Why are you laughing?

42
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,627
-Who is he dressed up as?
-He's noticed the look just now.

43
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:35,695
Who's your inspiration?

44
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,796
-Make a guess.
-The thing is,

45
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,532
this getup isn't so different
from the way he dresses usually.

46
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,135
This is so tricky.

47
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,837
The Nightmare Before Christmas?

48
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,105
-I'm Cool's Lee Jae-hoon.
-I see.

49
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,074
But you hardly look like him.

50
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,142
I'm not feeling it at all.

51
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,677
EVEN A GUEST CRITICIZES
WOO-JAE'S COSTUME

52
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,278
Hi, I'm the show's producer.

53
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,980
-Hello. It's nothing.
-I'm sorry and grateful.

54
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,048
I'm a huge fan of yours.

55
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,649
-It's an honor to meet you.
-The honor is mine.

56
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,153
We'd appreciate it if you could say
a short celebratory message for Sook.

57
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,754
We also have…

58
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,024
-Quizzes for prize money?
-You're spot on!

59
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,559
Quizzes, right?

60
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,961
I love quizzes.

61
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,028
-You do?
-Yes.

62
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,097
If you complete
a simple mission successfully,

63
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,499
-you'll win prize money.
-I see.

64
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,700
AND HOW MUCH IS IT?

65
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,802
It's 10,000 won.

66
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,936
-It's 10,000 won.
-Come on!

67
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,271
MEASLY 10,000 WON?

68
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,641
-I guess production costs are rather…
-Director Park.

69
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,110
You're making us lose face
before our guest.

70
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,713
-Okay. I'll make it 20,000 won.
-Really, 20,000 won?

71
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,982
-After the long deliberation?
-So it's 20,000 won?

72
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,917
Okay, we'll take that.

73
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,553
Are you sure you can join us for games?

74
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,888
-Sure.
-Aren't your family waiting?

75
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:35,955
Sso-yeong must be waiting.

76
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,991
-Here's a shocker. They went home.
-Really?

77
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,894
-That's why I was waiting outside.
-Is that right?

78
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,196
There are only a few games
you can play on the bus.

79
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,465
-Let's try Exclusion Challenge.
-Geez.

80
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,367
-It's Exclusion Challenge.
-"Exclusion Challenge"?

81
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,702
Name a profession
except three-syllable ones.

82
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,070
-Comedian.
-Renovator.

83
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,438
"EXCLUSION CHALLENGE" EXAMPLE

84
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,140
-Sweets vendor.
-Wrong.

85
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,208
THAT'S HOW YOU FAIL

86
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,644
If you succeed, you'll get your 20,000 won

87
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,945
in hard cash.

88
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,213
GOOD LUCK, GUYS…

89
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,048
-Sae-ho will kick you off…
-Okay.

90
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,050
…followed by Woo-young, Chimchakman,

91
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,351
Woo-jae, and then Jin-kyung.

92
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,953
-This is hard.
-And it's a one-way cycle?

93
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,621
-Is it a one-off game?
-Yeah.

94
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,391
-Let's roll.
-Ready.

95
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,260
Name a girl group
except four-syllable ones.

96
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,662
All right.

97
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,497
IVE.

98
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,900
-Red…
-Wrong!

99
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,001
You could've said Fin.K.L.

100
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,570
UNDER HEAVY FIRE

101
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,637
Let's count it as a drill.

102
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,673
-I mean, we were all over the place.
-Totally.

103
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,876
-Man, Gangnam. Am I right?
-The characters--

104
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,245
The AC's way too distracting.

105
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,015
Chimchakman gave up his time
with his daughter to join us.

106
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,217
-Give us another shot.
-Yeah.

107
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,252
I hear she went home crying,
asking for her dad.

108
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,486
I wasn't sure about the rules.

109
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,755
So that's a demonstration
of how we lose the game, right?

110
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,923
-Exactly.
-That's how it is?

111
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,358
SO HE "FINALLY" UNDERSTOOD
THE RULES

112
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,093
I'll give you another shot, then.

113
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,161
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

114
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,029
-Here goes.
-Hit us.

115
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,431
ANOTHER SHOT

116
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,800
Name a snack
excepting ones that mention fruit.

117
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,836
"Excepting ones that mention fruit"?
One, two, three.

118
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,904
Marine Crackers.

119
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,505
Two.

120
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,573
Banana… Damn it.

121
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,141
Banana… Damn it.

122
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,509
WHAT'S WRONG, WOO-YOUNG?

123
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,379
You could've said Potato Snack
or Shrimp Crackers.

124
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,549
-There are also Matdongsan or Tako Chips.
-And Changgu.

125
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,651
-Swap seats with me, damn it.
-One more thing.

126
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,354
Sso-yeong went home crying,
and his wife was upset too.

127
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,822
Today's their wedding anniversary.

128
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,057
-Me? Oh, well…
-Really?

129
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,959
Let's try again with a new resolve.

130
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,730
-We want to see Chimchakman compete too.
-Oh, sure.

131
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,797
IT'S ALL WOO-YOUNG'S FAULT

132
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,532
-This is really your last shot.
-Of course.

133
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,834
This really sucks you in.

134
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,304
Name a movie title
except ones using English loanwords.

135
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,839
Yeong-gu and Ttaeng-chil.

136
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,173
-Silmido.
-Shiri.

137
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,575
Inside Men.

138
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,744
WOO-YOUNG HAS TO FINISH THEM OFF

139
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,880
Cold Eyes.

140
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,383
-This counts, right?
-But does Shiri count?

141
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,450
Is that an English word?

142
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,052
I think that's a Korean word.

143
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,353
-Is it, though?
-He's right.

144
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,323
DOES "SHIRI" REALLY HAVE
ITS ROOT IN KOREAN LANGUAGE?

145
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,557
Let me look it up.

146
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,825
Is "shiri" an English word?

147
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,161
-Maybe it's North Korean?
-It's Korean!

148
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,796
-It's a Korean word!
-Yes!

149
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,897
The AI told me that.

150
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,199
"A name of a species
native to the Korean Peninsula"!

151
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,401
We'll count that as a success.

152
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,503
SECURED 20,000 WON
FOR THE CELEBRATION FUND

153
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,804
It's quite fun.

154
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,172
-Was it to your liking?
-Yes.

155
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,107
Here's an offer for you, Chimchakman.

156
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,243
-You can try another game by yourself.
-Okay.

157
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,879
If you succeed,
I'll throw in another 10,000 won.

158
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,315
-Sounds great.
-Okay, I'm up for it.

159
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,352
You must give your answer
in under three seconds without a break.

160
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,454
-Hit us. Let's hear what it is.
-Get ready.

161
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,522
This is the last game.

162
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,956
-Good luck, Chimchakman!
-Thanks.

163
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,992
Win us 10,000 won. It's a cakewalk.

164
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,327
ALL FIRED UP

165
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,663
Name five snacks
that have four-syllable names.

166
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,398
Chocolate Pie. Banana Kick.

167
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,800
Cuttlefish Chips.

168
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,601
WILL HE SUCCEED
ON THE FIRST TRY?

169
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,204
Sweet Potato.

170
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,739
-What else is there?
-You failed.

171
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,174
TIMED OUT

172
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,109
Wait, there's Potato Chips.

173
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,610
Don't forget Madecassol.

174
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,912
That's not a snack.

175
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,447
-Wait, I meant Margaret.
-That's not cool.

176
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,615
-That's distracting.
-I kept silent during the game.

177
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,784
-You got me confused!
-What do you mean?

178
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,887
SEEING HOW HE'S BLAMING OTHERS,
HE'S BLENDING IN PERFECTLY

179
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,723
-Would you like to try again?
-Sure.

180
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,157
I almost had it, though.

181
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,928
Name five boy bands
whose name is in foreign languages.

182
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,397
2PM, 2AM,

183
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,599
H.O.T., Sechs Kies…

184
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,834
-Wait!
-You failed!

185
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,602
-Who else is there?
-Seventeen.

186
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,637
Oh, Seventeen. I could've said that.

187
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,839
HE SLAPS STUFF WHEN HE'S EXCITED

188
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,073
I admire your energy.

189
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,209
-I love it too.
-I'm usually not this energetic.

190
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,378
-Let's keep it up for one more round.
-I'm not, really.

191
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,146
-Let's give him one last round.
-Come on.

192
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,048
I got so worked up because of the quiz.

193
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,519
-Name five Korean supermodels.
-I've got this.

194
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,355
Joo Woo-jae, Lee Soo-hyuk,

195
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,257
Lee Hyuk-soo…

196
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,059
SHE'S A SUPERMODEL TOO

197
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,094
-Hong Jin-kyung.
-Hong Jin-kyung.

198
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,596
-You failed!
-Cha Seung-won!

199
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,331
Oh, man… Geez.

200
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
You mentioned Jin-kyung.

201
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,901
Only because Woo-jae fed him that answer.

202
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,969
-Jin-kyung--
-Really?

203
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,571
I was right here,
but he didn't even consider me.

204
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,840
And you named Soo-hyuk
and then said his real name.

205
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,309
He's worked as a model under both names
but with different personas.

206
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,078
Soo-hyuk and Hyuk-soo are not the same.

207
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,480
Jang Yoon-ju. I should've said her name.

208
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,349
-She counts, right?
-Sure.

209
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,217
Could we edit that?

210
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,253
Can you shout her name with urgency?

211
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,922
How? I'm no expert on how TV shows work.

212
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,323
How? Like this, "Jang Yoon-ju"?

213
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,159
Like this. Jang… Jang Yoon-ju.

214
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,927
I get it now. So that's the trick.

215
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,462
Could you try that? Shout her name.

216
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,098
-Jang Yoon-ju!
-Okay, he's done it!

217
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,166
-Have I really?
-Five names!

218
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,233
-Really?
-Another 10,000 won!

219
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,301
Do we get 30,000 won?

220
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,103
We won't be using that footage, though.

221
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,738
That's awful. He's a guest, remember?

222
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,773
Are you taunting our guest?

223
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,841
Come on. He's our guest.

224
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,209
SO WE USED THAT CUT

225
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,745
…Lee Soo-hyuk,
Lee Hyuk-soo, Hong Jin-kyung…

226
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,846
AND?

227
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:27,947
…Jang Yoon-ju!

228
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,749
GOODNESS, HE'S SUCCEEDED!

229
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,350
"I DID IT!"

230
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,820
We never planned on spending this much,

231
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,055
-but here's 30,000 won for your good work.
-Thank you.

232
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,491
-Thank you.
-Thank you for your time.

233
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,660
All right, Chimchakman!

234
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,729
Hello. This is Chimchakman, Sook.

235
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,566
Your 30th anniversary came up so soon.

236
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,601
Back when I was a young boy,

237
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,937
I used to watch you sing
"Lend Me 40 Million"

238
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,205
in that skit, "Pigeon Choir."

239
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,608
-Don't forget the bratty girl character.
-Honestly, even I feel emotional.

240
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,577
Congratulations on your big milestone.

241
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,812
I hope you live long

242
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,881
and continue to work
even as a centenarian.

243
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,616
I wish you good health and happiness.

244
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,320
Take this 30,000 won
and order in amazing fried chicken.

245
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,222
Thank you!

246
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,391
I always had a thing for games
people play on the road in variety shows.

247
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,160
-Have you wanted to try it?
-Sure.

248
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,063
You've got a very friendly vibe
going here on the set.

249
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,165
It doesn't seem
like your typical workplace.

250
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,234
-I'd love to have you on Real Study King.
-Sorry?

251
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,602
-Don't bother my friend.
-I'd love to.

252
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,237
-I'd be delighted.
-She's booked him.

253
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,938
Why are you butting in?

254
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,074
-Because he's my friend.
-I'm grateful.

255
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,976
He thinks I'm bothering his friend.

256
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,211
-I'm not bothered at all.
-I know you don't mean it.

257
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,247
You're the one making me feel awkward.

258
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,314
He has a point.

259
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,517
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't be. Why does he keep saying that?

260
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,852
I didn't think
your family would leave you behind.

261
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,654
-Thank you so much.
-Likewise. I had fun.

262
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,524
-We'd love to have you again.
-Thanks. I enjoyed it today.

263
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,892
Thanks for having me.

264
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,360
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

265
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,761
Have a nice weekend!

266
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,465
Chimchakman just sent me a text.

267
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,301
He says we're such a wholesome bunch.

268
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,837
-He loved it today.
-Really?

269
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,839
I'm glad to hear that.

270
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,141
"WE'LL BE MEETING MY FRIEND NEXT…"

271
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,343
I'm getting butterflies.

272
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,611
My heart feels fuller somehow.

273
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,848
THEY'RE MUNCHING ON SNACKS
SOMEWHERE IN CHEONGDAM-DONG

274
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,050
-Shrimp Crackers taste amazing.
-My gosh.

275
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,253
It's holding its place
in the market for a reason.

276
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,321
You dropped this.

277
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,789
I'll take it.

278
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,258
Don't make the mistake of eating it.

279
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,193
You might go,

280
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,361
"What's this here?"

281
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,898
Soo-hyuk is indoorsy

282
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,166
much like Woo-young here.

283
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,334
-Really?
-You bet.

284
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,570
Whenever I ask him where he is
while we're on the phone,

285
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,972
he's either working or staying at home.

286
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,407
-Just like me.
-Yeah.

287
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,075
-Gosh, Sae-ho.
-Oh, he's here.

288
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,710
-Gosh, Sae-ho.
-Oh, he's here.

289
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,679
He's here, right? Hey.

290
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,514
ONE MORE GUEST
TO CONGRATULATE SOOK'S MILESTONE

291
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,748
-Soo-hyuk!
-Where is he?

292
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,485
-Hello!
-Soo-hyuk.

293
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,621
SPECIAL ENVOY 2, LEE SOO-HYUK

294
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,490
NATIONAL TREASURE NO. 1
WITH INSANELY GOOD LOOKS

295
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,126
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE,
HE'S A TOTAL ICY PRINCE

296
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,361
Thank you.

297
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,929
BUT WHEN HE'S SMILING,
HE'S A WHOLESOME BABE

298
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,997
AN ALL-AROUND ARTIST

299
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,699
WITH SUCCESSFUL MODELING
AND ACTING CAREER

300
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,767
LEE SOO-HYUK
VIDEO SOURCE: YG STAGE YOUTUBE

301
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,736
It's been ages, Soo-hyuk.

302
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,671
My gosh, you're so handsome.

303
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,207
Our writers here actually squealed.

304
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,475
Come to the center.

305
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,244
MEANWHILE, OUR HEAD WRITER WITH
MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

306
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,048
Hello, viewers of Screwballs.
It's a pleasure. I'm Lee Soo-hyuk.

307
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,687
We all heard that you had work today.

308
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,956
Thank you for joining us on short notice.

309
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,692
-It's nothing. But what do I do next?
-Sorry?

310
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,095
What should I do?
I don't think I earned any gratitude.

311
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,563
Are you acquainted with Sook?

312
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,633
We worked together on a sitcom
back in the day.

313
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,700
ON VAMPIRE IDOL

314
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,768
-Vampire Idol?
-Yeah.

315
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,970
Thanks to Sook's appearance on the show,

316
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,839
I got to know her.

317
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,874
When we run into each other
at award shows,

318
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,011
we later exchange DMs
to ask how each other's been doing.

319
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,278
I love your voice.

320
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,514
Soo-hyuk must be feeling
pretty uncomfortable

321
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,650
because Jin-kyung
is inching closer to him.

322
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,519
Actually, Soo-hyuk
had the foresight to put this

323
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,355
as some sort of a barrier between them.

324
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,190
But Jin-kyung removed it.

325
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,592
10 MINUTES AGO

326
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,360
THE BUBBLE WAND WAS RIGHT HERE

327
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,295
GLANCE

328
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,798
Hello, viewers of Screwballs.
It's a pleasure.

329
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,866
I'm Lee Soo-hyuk.

330
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,169
-Seriously, Jin-kyung.
-That's your weapon for emergency?

331
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,538
By the way, you've always invited Ji-yong
on other shows.

332
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,907
-How come you asked me over here?
-What do you mean?

333
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,175
-Oh, no.
-He wasn't available?

334
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,511
It's all a misunderstanding.
You're my best friend, Soo-hyuk.

335
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,046
-But he has a point.
-I mean that.

336
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,448
I mentioned Soo-hyuk first
back in our Beat Coin days.

337
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,685
During the time we worked together
on Beat Coin and Screwballs,

338
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,987
this is the first time
I heard Sae-ho mention Soo-hyuk.

339
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,889
Enough with that nonsense.

340
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,024
I remember hearing about Ji-yong
plenty of times.

341
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,526
It wasn't me. It was all this guy.

342
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,795
-What are you talking about?
-He did it first.

343
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,363
He did that, not me.

344
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,265
-He's pinning it on the showrunner.
-With my friends,

345
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,901
I don't want to bother them
when they're already busy.

346
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,202
You know how I am, right?

347
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,603
Does that mean he's not busy?

348
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,671
He must be busy too.

349
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,306
Let's hear his excuses anyway.

350
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,374
For what?

351
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,975
-Quick, just apologize.
-You called Soo-hyuk.

352
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,777
I only brought it on as a joke.

353
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,079
I apologize.

354
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,147
You may get the impression

355
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,249
that Soo-hyuk is an icy type.

356
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,653
He's pale and tall.
He has that urban vibe too.

357
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,455
But Sae-ho would always tell me,

358
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,857
"Soo-hyuk is the real deal, Jin-kyung."

359
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,359
But he doesn't look that way.
He's a cosmopolitan.

360
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,261
No way. I don't think so.

361
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,830
Even at a glance, he's the real deal.

362
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,632
Who here looks the part?

363
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,267
I mean, he's an ultimate cosmopolitan.

364
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,269
-He's got that New Yorker vibe.
-I get it now.

365
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,538
-But he's genuinely nice.
-Funny too.

366
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,906
-Isn't he nice?
-I see.

367
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,141
-Aren't you nice?
-Me?

368
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,809
I guess I'm not awful.

369
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,846
He's the sweetest. He comes running
if anything happens to you.

370
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,547
I'm facing all of you now,

371
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,850
and Sae-ho's face is…

372
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,619
-I'll stop here.
-Don't. Say it.

373
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,687
-No.
-Let's have a listen.

374
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,922
-No, never mind.
-I get what he wanted to say.

375
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,024
It's exactly three times the size.

376
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,494
Of what, exactly?

377
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,496
-Just three times.
-Three times what?

378
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,565
-You look three times kinder than him.
-Yeah?

379
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,367
LET'S GET INTO THE MISSION

380
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,935
Sook will be joining us after 7:00 p.m.

381
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,738
-when her previous shoot ends.
-Okay.

382
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,741
We're rather short on funds, you see.

383
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,077
So we have to play games

384
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,046
-to win some prize money.
-I see.

385
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,449
So technically,
there's nothing in it for me.

386
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,950
-That's true.
-Well, yeah.

387
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,553
-I'm sure Sae-ho will compensate you.
-You think so?

388
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,488
Strictly speaking,
this has nothing to do with me.

389
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,023
-Well, that's true.
-You're right.

390
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,793
I'm flattered you're asking…
Wait, do I have a say in this?

391
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,927
-Sure.
-Of course.

392
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,128
Can I not play the games?

393
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,231
But he's going to play anyway.
He's a nice guy.

394
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,934
-He may look like an icy city dweller…
-He's the real deal.

395
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,369
…but he's the kindest person.

396
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,006
-It won't take long either.
-I bet Sae-ho will reward you handsomely.

397
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,574
Don't forget to pick up

398
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,910
the one million won from Sae-ho
after the shoot.

399
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,379
Soo-hyuk isn't swayed by material gains.

400
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,048
-It's a gift. Who said he's materialistic?
-Right? Would you take it?

401
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,383
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

402
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,652
Don't we all work for the money?

403
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,021
Don't we all work for the money?

404
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,088
PREACH

405
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,058
You got your friend all wrong!

406
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,494
-You don't know him at all.
-How amusing.

407
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,062
What a funny guy.

408
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,398
What game are we playing?

409
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,466
Are you familiar with Zero Game?

410
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,235
The one where we have to stand up?

411
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,770
-Sure.
-We call it Human Zero here.

412
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,939
The cast has to stand up
to express a number.

413
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,874
-I think I saw you jump and kneel.
-One!

414
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,776
-Yeah, we did that.
-I kicked us off with one.

415
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,511
-That's the Instinct Game.
-Sae-ho is right.

416
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,880
PFT

417
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,481
-With Human Zero…
-Seriously, though.

418
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,317
It hasn't been that long
since we played it.

419
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,852
ON A SHOOT IN BUSAN, TO BE EXACT

420
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,487
Three, two, one. Two.

421
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,923
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU REMEMBERED

422
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,526
-You get it, don't you?
-Do we get 10,000 won per round?

423
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,827
For five successful defenses--

424
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,362
-That's far too many.
-Come on!

425
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,531
-For five defenses--
-Give us 50,000 won.

426
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,399
-Offer 50,000 won.
-Do that.

427
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,268
Just 10,000 won for 5 rounds…

428
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,569
But you won last time.

429
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,172
-We barely managed that, remember?
-Give us 20,000 won at least.

430
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,607
There's a neat trick for this.

431
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,909
We can assign a number to each person.

432
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,044
-You think so? Let's hear it.
-If the director says three,

433
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,613
you two can stand up.

434
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,047
Excuse me,

435
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,149
-but your plan doesn't make any sense.
-How so?

436
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,918
When he says three…

437
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,386
We have to move as he gives the order.

438
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,755
And we'll have the responses ready.

439
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,890
We don't know what he'll say.

440
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,425
He's saying that we can use
that split second to respond.

441
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,295
Why can't you idiots understand him?

442
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,464
I got it right away.

443
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,165
-Tell us.
-Explain it to us.

444
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,967
-Look--
-If he said, "Three, two, one. Five,"

445
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,802
all of us will stand except for Woo-young.

446
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,171
Yeah, Woo-young will stay as is.
That's what he meant.

447
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,239
GOAL: DIRECTOR'S NUMBER-1

448
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,707
Okay. Let's see you try it.

449
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,175
Let's give it a go.

450
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,977
For "five," you have to remain seated.

451
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,445
For "four," you have to do the same.

452
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,547
For "three," Soo-hyuk will join you.

453
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,882
If we can use the split second well,

454
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,384
-it might actually work.
-Yeah.

455
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,085
-Let's see if we can do it.
-Okay.

456
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,153
I like our chances.

457
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,389
-My idea does make sense, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

458
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,658
If your behind leaves your seat,
that counts as standing up.

459
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,093
Consider my lymph nodes
and excuse me if I move about this much.

460
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,629
Enough with the lymphatic nodes!

461
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,998
-His surgery scar is quite huge.
-Even so!

462
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,600
-Even the slightest movement counts.
-Okay.

463
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,668
Here goes.

464
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,070
WILL SOO-HYUK'S PLAN WORK?
ROUND 1

465
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,272
ONLY THOSE ASSIGNED
SMALLER NUMBERS

466
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,474
THAN DIRECTOR PARK'S NUMBER
MUST STAND UP

467
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,009
Three, two, one.

468
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,077
Zero.

469
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,345
ZERO?

470
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,815
Zero.

471
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,284
It's because of my lymph nodes.

472
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,520
It's honestly because of his lymph nodes.

473
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,356
-Shall I show them to you?
-His lymph nodes are playing up.

474
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,424
You can see them.

475
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,125
-But my lymph nodes…
-They trouble him.

476
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,794
OOPSIE

477
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,296
I totally forgot about the zero.

478
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,831
We prepared for all other numbers.

479
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,734
IT'S STILL A BATTLEFIELD
RIGHT HERE

480
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,235
We didn't prepare for zero.

481
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,838
We're all settled on other numbers, right?

482
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,342
I've kept thinking about Soo-hyuk's plan,

483
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,444
and I think it'll work
if we can utilize that moment.

484
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,511
-Yeah.
-For sure.

485
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,380
You look like a pair of con men
with those sunglasses.

486
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,515
WE'LL BUY THAT LYMPH NODE STORY
AND LET IT SLIDE ONCE

487
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,551
Let's begin the second round.

488
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,720
We're using Soo-hyuk's plan, then?

489
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,787
Yeah, we're doing that.

490
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,923
-One, two, three, four, five.
-I'll stand up at zero.

491
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,991
-Okay.
-Okay.

492
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,759
Three, two, one.

493
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,094
Two.

494
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,196
Three, two, one. Two.

495
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,698
AS PLANNED, WOO-JAE STANDS UP
AS HE WAS ASSIGNED NUMBER 1

496
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,734
Three, two, one. Two.

497
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,739
GAME COMMANDER'S PLAN WORKED

498
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,474
Let's keep playing like this, okay?

499
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,742
-Okay.
-It worked!

500
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,243
-I told you it would.
-It totally worked!

501
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,045
You're quite sneaky, Soo-hyuk.

502
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,547
We have to stay on our toes.

503
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,882
Three, two, one.

504
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,950
One!

505
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,318
PER PLAN, NO ONE SHOULD MOVE

506
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,452
Three, two, one.

507
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,520
One!

508
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,821
THE TRIO STAYED PUT

509
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,423
Three, two, one.

510
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,524
One!

511
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,395
JUMPS TO HIS FEET

512
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,164
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT

513
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,766
Come again? I didn't get it.

514
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,867
I said one.

515
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,335
-What was the plan for one?
-One?

516
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,003
-Let's scrap the plan.
-The idea…

517
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,572
-But we're losing even with a plan.
-Yeah, that's true.

518
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,040
Are you sure we can win five rounds?

519
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,275
We'll scrap the plan…

520
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,244
-We'll play it the usual way.
-…and leave it to chance.

521
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,979
You will? Okay.

522
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,415
-Let's do this.
-If we can't win even with a plan…

523
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,749
Yeah, it's challenging.

524
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,518
Let's leave it to our gut feeling.

525
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,819
Yeah, I'm standing up.

526
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,287
IT'S THEIR FOURTH YEAR
WORKING TOGETHER

527
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,389
Three, two, one.

528
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,491
YOU KNOW HOW IT'S DONE, RIGHT?

529
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,626
One!

530
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,195
ONE?!

531
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,563
FAILURE

532
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,931
Three, two, one.

533
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,332
One!

534
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,400
SIGH

535
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,570
Why do you keep getting up? Didn't you say
your lymph nodes were hurting you?

536
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,372
It's a misunderstanding.

537
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,842
I need to go apply some ointment here.

538
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,177
Gross.

539
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,711
-Unbelievable.
-How gross.

540
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,481
He keeps leaping to his feet
after all that talk about the surgery.

541
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,816
-Get back there.
-Got it.

542
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,350
Here's an idea.

543
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,053
This game won't work
what with the lymph node situation.

544
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,421
Let's play something else.

545
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,123
Yeah. Let's set this aside.

546
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,724
-I mean, Soo-hyuk's here.
-He's recovering.

547
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,094
We could play something that he favors.

548
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,328
Okay.

549
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,930
How about "One Syllable at a Time"?

550
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,565
So? I'll give you an example.

551
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,266
If the theme is vegetable,

552
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,901
our answers should be, bean, onion…

553
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,103
Does tomato count?

554
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,804
-Yeah.
-Oh, sure. So tomato.

555
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,206
-Asparagus.
-Okay, asparagus.

556
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,273
Cherry tomato.

557
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,575
That way, we can win the round.

558
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,642
ADD A SYLLABLE TO WIN

559
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,544
We'll take out 5,000 won from 10,000 won.

560
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,846
Care to play for 5,000 won?

561
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,215
Our prize should be 10,000 won,
cut from the original 30,000 won.

562
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,318
Am I the only one who knew
the original amount to be 50,000 won?

563
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,855
-You're a liar.
-Soo-hyuk is quite the talker too.

564
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:43,956
HE'S NOT TO BE MESSED WITH

565
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,057
I'm sure it was 50,000 won.

566
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,025
FULLY IN SYNC WITH
THE SHOW'S SPIRIT

567
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,260
Could you just give us the money?

568
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,962
Sure, I've long been ready to do that.

569
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,029
Hey, Director Park.

570
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,398
We'll cut you some slack
and only ask for 10,000 won.

571
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,566
-Just 10,000 won.
-Appreciated.

572
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
Okay.

573
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,503
-Let's go easy on him.
-So, One Syllable at a Time.

574
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,570
It's for 10,000 won.

575
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,005
-Good luck. Stay alert.
-All right!

576
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,907
I'm not comfortable
with a four-syllable word.

577
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,342
-Let's swap seats.
-Two-syllable words?

578
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,476
Four-syllable words are rough.

579
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,777
SAE-HO AND JIN-KYUNG SWAP SEATS

580
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,045
Three-syllable words.

581
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,982
Get ready. Here goes.

582
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,683
-Wait.
-I'm having trouble hearing.

583
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,952
Songs.

584
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,721
"Why."

585
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,222
"My love."

586
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,592
You failed!

587
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,928
FAILURE

588
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,596
You failed!

589
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,064
What's wrong, Soo-hyuk?

590
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,599
Come on, Soo-hyuk.

591
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,134
-Hey.
-One three-syllable title.

592
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,936
It's just that my brain sort of…

593
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,404
I got so confused.

594
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,472
EMBARRASSED SUPERMODEL

595
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,806
Think of your friend, G-Dragon.

596
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,708
There's "Coup D'etat."

597
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,844
-Out of Ji-yong's songs?
-Or "Bang Bang Bang."

598
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,679
Let's try another round. Quick.

599
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,247
Sit down. We're short on time.

600
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,982
A challenge for 10,000 won!

601
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,250
Another round for 10,000 won.

602
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,518
The game can throw you off.

603
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,420
Wait, one-syllable words are so difficult.

604
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,555
I can't hear so well.

605
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,523
Animals.

606
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,091
-Crow.
-Giraffe.

607
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,159
Gorilla.

608
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,061
One.

609
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,863
-Two.
-Does "young impala" work?

610
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,765
-You failed!
-Dang it.

611
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,101
DID WE HEAR THAT RIGHT?
"YOUNG IMPALA"?

612
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,304
-"Young impala"?
-You think it'd work?

613
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,838
-"Young impala"?
-It doesn't?

614
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,440
Why didn't you go for "good impala"?

615
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,675
"Kind impala" is also a good one.

616
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,512
I hear one of the side effects
of the surgery I had

617
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,980
is reduced brain activity.

618
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,215
But your brain is way up here.

619
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,716
The distance affects the brain.

620
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,518
Okay, you can then play for 5,000 won.

621
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,120
Let's give it one more shot for 5,000 won.

622
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,622
I'm sorry, Soo-hyuk.

623
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,390
If we fail again…

624
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,458
Yeah, that's a possibility.

625
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,093
-Get ready.
-You still did great.

626
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,595
What could I have said, though?

627
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,563
"King co-oh-bra" won't work.
Oh, there's armadillo.

628
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,265
"King co-oh-bra"? Are you serious?

629
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,833
LOVES THIS KIND OF SILLINESS

630
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,835
-Get ready.
-Do your part right, Sae-ho.

631
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,537
-Focus, okay?
-Okay.

632
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,539
All right. This is your last shot.

633
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,975
-I hope you'll succeed this time.
-Geez, a five-syllable word?

634
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,777
To prevent confusion,
I'll give you a detailed instruction.

635
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,179
Let's make things clear first.

636
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,548
Soloists or groups, both are acceptable.

637
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,617
Male singer.

638
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,518
Rain.

639
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,121
Hyun Cheol.

640
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,389
J. Y. Park.

641
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,590
Heuningkai.

642
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,562
-You've got something under your nail?
-Looks that way, right?

643
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,430
-He's got a nail emergency.
-It started hurting.

644
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,932
-Wait.
-I think it's a splinter.

645
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,368
-One must've gotten underneath his nail.
-It's a splinter.

646
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,435
HE SEEMS TO BE A KINDRED SOUL

647
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,004
-I'm afraid I'll have to leave.
-Wait.

648
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,538
-Call an ambulance.
-Wait.

649
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,940
-HIGHLIGHT.
-Call an ambulance.

650
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,341
Please stop recording.

651
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,577
-Do I still get a turn?
-For a five-syllable name, yeah.

652
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,345
-HIGHLIGHT.
-And he's correct.

653
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,546
That's correct!

654
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,015
SUCCESS AT LAST

655
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,783
-HIGHLIGHT.
-And he's correct.

656
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,886
HOORAY!

657
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,755
How dramatic is this?

658
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,056
ANSWERED IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS

659
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,224
But I'm still concerned.

660
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,159
-The splinter seems quite large.
-Are you okay?

661
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,727
You should see a doctor.

662
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,497
-His lymph nodes can act up.
-Great job getting him on board.

663
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,098
-Right?
-The splinter can fester.

664
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,166
We got 5,000 won.

665
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,236
-Shall I talk to that camera?
-Yeah, that one.

666
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,671
Please look into the phone's camera.

667
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,473
-Huh? Isn't that Soo-hyuk?
-It's him.

668
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,541
Why was he with you?

669
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,776
He said you were acquainted.

670
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,444
I worked on the same series as him.

671
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,680
Hello, Sook. It's me, Lee Soo-hyuk.

672
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,582
I hear this year
marks the 30th year in your career.

673
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,650
Congratulations.

674
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,586
My gosh. He's somehow gotten prettier.

675
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,256
I don't think I've seen him
for at least a decade.

676
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,526
I hope you'll enjoy good health
and continue to have success.

677
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,362
I'll try to check in with you more often.

678
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,930
-Thank you.
-I'd love to meet him too.

679
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,500
You guys met
all these fine people earlier.

680
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,635
And that's it.

681
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,437
-Just two guests.
-We didn't have much time.

682
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,405
I see. Still, thank you so much.

683
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,442
-I'll tell you how we did it.
-I'm listening.

684
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,644
We called our friends right on the spot

685
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,913
-and went to see those available.
-Just like the old shows?

686
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,582
Yeah, that's why we couldn't get
as many guests as we hoped.

687
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,684
Actually, tons of people
wanted to congratulate you.

688
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,053
DAY6 had a concert today,

689
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,688
but the guys still wanted to come.

690
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,957
Really? We're not exactly close.

691
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,693
That's how much you mean
to your colleagues in the industry.

692
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,129
So many people are eager
to celebrate your milestone, Sook.

693
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,664
-In fact, there are three.
-Yeah.

694
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,100
-Really?
-My goodness.

695
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,434
How amazing is that?

696
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,603
When are you having a concert
as Chonam Zone?

697
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,171
I'd love to try it by the end of the year.

698
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,775
Jin-kyung has agreed to appear
as a guest at the concert earlier.

699
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,077
Thankfully, Woo-jae agreed as well.

700
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,278
-She's going alone.
-Come on.

701
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,813
Hey.

702
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,149
-You're coming. Period.
-I said I'd go if you were going too.

703
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,885
When I attended the VIVO SHOW as a guest,

704
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,553
I was so moved.

705
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,122
The fans in the audience

706
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,657
-were so welcoming to the guests.
-Totally.

707
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,127
Why didn't you ask me
to appear on your shows, Sook?

708
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,295
Can you spare some time this year?

709
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,564
If he's going,
I'll be there to sing along.

710
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,199
-Gosh.
-Oh dear.

711
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,801
I'll go as well as Chonam Zone.

712
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,836
-What?
-How about it?

713
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,904
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

714
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:26,972
You're acting funny.

715
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,306
-So?
-What?

716
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,010
On one condition.
I'll gladly attend if you invite me.

717
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,745
But I'd like to sing alone.

718
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,252
-Don't hurt Jin-kyung's feelings.
-You're ruining the evening, dude.

719
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,319
IT SOURED

720
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,788
-She adores you.
-I'm done eating.

721
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,424
-I actually have my reasons--
-I'm too upset to eat more.

722
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,792
She had three bowls.

723
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,894
-Hang on, Jin-kyung.
-She polished them all off.

724
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,662
-Come on.
-That's rich after all you've eaten.

725
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,230
Are you upset or simply full?

726
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,901
I'm way too upset to take one more bite.

727
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,702
Even so, you should clean up the dishes.

728
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,172
Pass me the kimchi, then. I'll have it.

729
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,240
-Isn't it amazing?
-Yeah, it's so good.

730
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,542
Braised short ribs are great too.

731
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,345
Gosh, this is insane.

732
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,582
You can't check it out just yet,
but there's another one on the other side.

733
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,084
My gosh, guys. I'm so touched.

734
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,354
-Is this from the blind date episode?
-Yeah, the one we shot recently.

735
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,156
Did I have a blind date recently?

736
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,325
Look, Sook. I brought this with me.

737
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,260
I've waited the whole day
to do this for you.

738
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,697
WOO-YOUNG'S PROP SHINES
AT LONG LAST

739
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,432
How pretty.

740
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,267
Congrats on reaching the milestone!

741
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,703
I love this.

742
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,339
Three, two, one.

743
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,576
SADLY, EVERYONE IS LOOKING
AT A DIFFERENT CAMERA

744
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,344
I have coffee for you, Sook and Jin-kyung.

745
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,912
Do you have something warm?

746
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,914
I can warm it up with my butt.

747
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,319
THEY NOW DEPART
FOR THE UNKNOWN NEXT PARTY SPOT

748
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,554
Young K from DAY6 insisted

749
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,723
that he'd wait to video call Sook.

750
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,425
-How is he so sweet?
-Really?

751
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,626
-He's an angel.
-Call him.

752
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,794
-He's so nice.
-Gosh.

753
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,162
Okay, call him.

754
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,030
-Young-hyun.
-Young-hyun.

755
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,066
-Goodness.
-Hello.

756
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,734
Gosh!

757
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,603
-My gosh!
-Hello.

758
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,738
-Hello.
-Gosh, hi.

759
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,106
Congrats on a successful concert!

760
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,008
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

761
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,643
How was the show, Young-hyun?

762
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,446
We should've been there.

763
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:18,216
This year is the 30th year
in Sook's career,

764
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,151
-and it's her milestone birthday soon.
-Right.

765
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,121
-So we'll be having a party shortly.
-"Milestone birthday"?

766
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,525
Can you tell her congratulations, please?

767
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,662
Happy birthday to you

768
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,965
AN UNEXPECTED LIVE SERENADE
MELTS THE LADIES' HEARTS

769
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,602
Congratulations on your 30th anniversary

770
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,706
-My dearest Sook
-How incredible is this?

771
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,743
Happy birthday to you

772
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,547
Happy birthday and congratulations
on your 30th anniversary.

773
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,749
How is he such a good singer?

774
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,218
Hit us up if you need our help in any way.

775
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,687
Why didn't you invite me to your wedding?

776
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,022
-That's because…
-You didn't?

777
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,290
That was mean, Sae-ho.

778
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,292
-Wait.
-What's the matter with you?

779
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,360
I don't have his number.

780
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,829
I thought it'd be rude to send an invite
when we're not so close.

781
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,897
"I don't have his number"?

782
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,199
Still, you should've invited Young-hyun.

783
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,369
You could come join us as a guest later.

784
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,204
-We'll prepare a wonderful day for you.
-Good idea.

785
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,506
I can join you even now.

786
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,874
He says he can still come join us.

787
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:16,942
He said he could come.

788
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,311
Why don't we send you an address?

789
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,113
He kept telling me that too.

790
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,181
I can't even…

791
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,317
-Hey, Young-hyun.
-What's going on? He's coming?

792
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,752
But you must have other engagements.

793
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,555
-That's not an AI version of him, is it?
-There's no need to push yourself.

794
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,292
-Did you really mean what you said?
-He always means what he says.

795
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,460
I'll go if you'll have me.

796
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,662
-He means that.
-Director Park, he means it.

797
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,931
-He's always like that.
-Seriously?

798
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,433
Look at his eyes.

799
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,069
-I'm going! Send me the address.
-Gosh, he's coming.

800
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,737
-What's with this guy?
-He said he'd come.

801
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:46,972
I'll be there.

802
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,473
This is crazy.

803
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,575
-I left the hall.
-Okay.

804
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,910
I'm really outside.

805
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:53,845
That's in real time?

806
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,115
He's outside the KSPO Dome, and there are
about 10,000 people in the background.

807
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,084
Let's go pick him up.

808
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,919
-I wasn't exaggerating.
-See you in a bit.

809
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,687
WILL YOUNG K REALLY SHOW UP?

810
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:07,025
In a way, Sook and DAY6
have something in common.

811
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,426
Both are late bloomers.

812
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,528
-In terms of popularity.
-For DAY6,

813
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,965
it's only been a couple of years
since they gained widespread popularity.

814
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,902
DAY6 debuted in the same year as TWICE.

815
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,639
-My gosh.
-They've gone through a lot too.

816
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,040
They still hung in there, then.

817
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,043
That's how they've become
such a solid group.

818
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,678
They won the public over with their music.

819
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,713
Gosh, this year is their 10th anniversary.

820
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,317
Did you choose 1995 as the theme

821
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,985
-because I debuted then?
-Of course.

822
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,787
-Did you catch that just now?
-Yeah.

823
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,491
-What on earth?
-Honestly, you're unbelievable.

824
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,693
Had I known,
I wouldn't have dressed like this.

825
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,396
I would've recreated the look
from the College Comedian Festival.

826
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,132
-I'm curious about your first show.
-That's the College Comedian Festival.

827
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,900
SEARCHING ON THE WEB

828
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,435
I found it. The festival in 1995.

829
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,537
-Don't pull it up. I said don't!
-I have it here.

830
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,938
-I remember watching it.
-Okay.

831
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,407
I was just 19 back then.

832
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,775
19-YEAR-OLD SOOK'S COMEDY SET

833
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,343
-That's you, Sook?
-My goodness.

834
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,811
-The one in the black jacket?
-It's her.

835
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,379
SEARCH "KIM SOOK
COLLEGE COMEDY FESTIVAL"

836
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,447
ON YOUTUBE FOR THE VIDEO

837
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,085
That kick-started my career,
and I'm super embarrassed about that!

838
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,920
Gosh, it's too embarrassing.

839
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:16,261
THE UNTOLD STORY OF
HOW SOOK BEGAN HER CAREER

840
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,732
I hear your father opposed your decision
to pursue a career in comedy.

841
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,800
He sure did.

842
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,135
Did you just come to Seoul
to compete in the festival?

843
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,037
-I kept it a secret.
-Really?

844
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,839
So your father didn't get to watch this?

845
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,341
I told him I was going out with a friend.

846
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,910
-All the time?
-Then, I came to Seoul.

847
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,645
I'll tell you when I told him the truth.

848
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,213
The College Comedy Festival

849
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,216
was televised on the Lunar New Year's Day.

850
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,452
I told him around then.
He was bound to find out anyway.

851
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,421
I told him that I'd become a comedian.

852
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,623
"Why are you lying to me?"

853
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,992
"Who are you to become a comedian?"

854
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,729
He said only a few could become one
and told me to get married.

855
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,664
-That's how he was.
-He was against it until the end.

856
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
There weren't so many comedians
back in the day.

857
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,201
-That's true.
-Back in the day,

858
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,737
TV appearance itself
was a very rare event.

859
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,338
-Yeah.
-Was your father against it

860
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,841
even after seeing you on TV?

861
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,876
He said that I didn't have the talent

862
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,545
since he had never seen me
make people laugh.

863
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,147
Gosh, he's very critical, isn't he?

864
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,717
But Sook, the bit we just saw together
was actually boring.

865
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,952
WE FEEL YOUR FATHER

866
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,121
-Wait, Sook--
-It's honestly not funny.

867
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,691
But you must've won
his approval at some point.

868
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,526
-That only happened…
-Did he come see your set?

869
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,862
-…after seven years.
-After the festival?

870
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,464
After the long period you spent
playing games and smoking?

871
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,367
After all that,
I had a break with Gag Concert.

872
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,704
When the show became a hit,
the whole team toured the country.

873
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,405
-Did he come see you perform?
-He did.

874
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,807
What role did you play back then?

875
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,942
-The bratty girl.
-Oh, you played that around then.

876
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,944
-I did a tour with that character.
-Right.

877
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,946
When we had a show in Busan,

878
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,948
my parents and my older sisters

879
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,784
-all came to see it.
-Really? That's insane.

880
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,585
-And what did they say?
-You should know

881
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,622
that my family didn't know any celebrity,
especially anyone from Busan.

882
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,191
And that was almost 30 years ago.
It's practically ancient times.

883
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,427
-So, the show was held at BEXCO in Busan.
-Oh, okay.

884
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,797
When I said "Father," my signature line…

885
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,199
-I'm getting sudden chills.
-…the crowd went wild, screaming.

886
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,235
-That startled my whole family.
-That would've startled them.

887
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,037
"Why are they reacting that way to Sook?"

888
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,907
-The hall buzzed with excitement.
-I'm getting chills.

889
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,642
The set had been performed multiple times,

890
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,144
so it was hilarious.
I mean, it was tested material.

891
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,946
My family watched the whole thing,

892
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,183
-feeling both nervous and amused.
-I bet they enjoyed it much better.

893
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,652
They then said,
"You've really become a celebrity."

894
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,187
It took seven years to hear that.

895
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,956
-Seven long years.
-What did they say at home after that?

896
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,025
I didn't go home.
I had to go to another city.

897
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,092
Just like a celebrity.

898
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,562
-"See you, Mom and Dad!"
-They would've been so happy…

899
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,696
-So then…
-…and so proud of you.

900
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,232
…for the first time ever…

901
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,467
I mean, Gag Concert had stars
like Hyun-sub and Sung-bum.

902
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,236
My father must've been really jazzed

903
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,805
because he offered
to treat the team a meal

904
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,873
and took them to a buffet.

905
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,975
A BUFFET MEAL FOR THE WHOLE TEAM

906
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,710
-That just came back to me.
-That's amazing.

907
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:46,845
Honestly, it just came back.

908
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,347
We've been friends with Sook for so long,

909
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,049
but this is the first time
we're hearing this.

910
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,550
This is the first for me too.

911
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,019
That memory came to me
for the first time after a long while.

912
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,821
But the story of your father,

913
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,256
the story of how you debuted,

914
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,692
and what happened in between…
I haven't heard any of them before.

915
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,462
A FEW HOURS LATER

916
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,130
What have you done to my father?

917
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,565
I've kept saying this since Beat Coin.

918
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,167
Let's not get our families involved.

919
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,369
This kind of stuff makes you choke up.

920
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,940
THE NIGHT MAKES YOU GO OVER THE
STORIES YOU NEVER SHARED BEFORE

921
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,075
For me…

922
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,711
Well, Sook and Young-ja
were pretty close back in the day.

923
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,213
-Well?
-I remember thinking

924
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,249
that I wanted to get to know Sook better.

925
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,583
-Really?
-Yeah.

926
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,784
Even before Sister's Slam Dunk?

927
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,019
-Yeah.
-How come?

928
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:32,357
I just always wanted to be your friend.

929
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,893
-Even when…
-Even when I didn't really know you.

930
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,060
SOOK DREW YOU IN EVEN THEN

931
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,597
We hope you'll love "Shut up"!

932
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,700
AFTER MANY TWISTS AND TURNS,
THEY FINALLY BECAME A "TEAM"

933
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,138
AND THEN A FANTASTIC COMEDIC DUO

934
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,107
HONG AND KIM

935
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,643
To think you performed this role in 1995.

936
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,578
You were just a baby then.

937
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,646
HEH

938
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,016
Let's be good friends.

939
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,517
Let's stay close, okay?

940
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,087
-Okay. Please hop off and follow me.
-Where exactly are we?

941
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,355
-I have no idea.
-Everyone, hop off.

942
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,423
THE SPECIAL NIGHT WEARS ON

943
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,724
Everyone, hop off.

944
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,827
-Where are we?
-Thank you for your troubles, crew.

945
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,697
-Goodness.
-This is Lotte World.

946
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,232
-Yeah, it is.
-Gosh, Lotte World.

947
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,300
Lotte World?

948
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,868
It's been ages since I last came here.

949
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,069
You mean the amusement park?

950
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,871
-It must be closed now.
-It must be.

951
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,506
-Do they have a night opening today?
-Wait.

952
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,741
Surely they can't have rented
the whole place, can they?

953
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,610
Could they have done that
for your 30th anniversary?

954
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,678
I doubt it.

955
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,380
RENTING THE WHOLE PLACE LIKE
CHAEBOL MALE LEADS IN TV SHOWS?

956
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,049
THEY'VE KEPT SAYING
IT COULDN'T BE TRUE,

957
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,417
BUT THEIR HEARTS
KEPT FLUTTERING…

958
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,419
AND WE DID IT

959
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,987
-Are we in Lotte World?
-My gosh.

960
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,221
This leads to Lotte World, right?

961
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,090
TONIGHT'S OUR
"CHAEBOL MALE LEAD" EVENING

962
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,194
SPARKLY LIGHTS ARE EVERYWHERE

963
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,531
LOTTE WORLD, THE LAND OF
ADVENTURE AND FANTASY

964
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,435
YOUR LONG-LOST INNER CHILD
WAKES UP

965
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,739
IN THIS PLACE OF DIZZYING THRILL
AND PEAL OF LAUGHTER

966
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,910
YOUR DREAMS AND FANTASIES
COME TO LIFE HERE

967
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,313
AND OUR SPECIAL PARTY
IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE HERE!

968
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,383
I want to hit that milestone too.

969
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,586
So you went this far
for her 30th anniversary?

970
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,356
-We're really in Lotte World.
-Is this really for Sook's milestone?

971
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,358
-Notice how it smells different?
-My gosh, Lotte World.

972
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,459
Lotte World!

973
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,160
-Magic Boong Boong Car.
-Here we are

974
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,897
-In Lotte World
-In Lotte World

975
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,867
We really are in Lotte World!

976
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,003
-It still looks amazing.
-The Conquistador.

977
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,637
THE CONQUISTADOR
(A.K.A. PIRATE SHIP)

978
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,773
The monorail there
will take you around the place.

979
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,142
-Yeah, and there's the French Revolution.
-French Revolution.

980
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,645
THRILLING ROLLER COASTER,
FRENCH REVOLUTION

981
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,381
The carousel.

982
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,616
It looks so beautiful.

983
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,717
ROMANTIC CAROUSEL

984
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,054
YOUR DREAMS AS A CHILD
ALL COME TRUE HERE AND NOW

985
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,156
How did this happen?
Did you rent the whole place?

986
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,058
Our team's the only people here.

987
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,126
IT'S THE LEAST WE COULD DO

988
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,661
Did you really rent the place after-hours?

989
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,463
They closed up at 9:00 p.m.

990
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,633
-We're the only ones--
-This is incredible.

991
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,834
For real?

992
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:57,935
-Man, it's so pretty.
-Hey.

993
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,270
Join us for a photo, Director.

994
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,672
I can't believe we're actually here.

995
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,275
Look.

996
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,578
-This is so cool.
-It's a great souvenir.

997
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,313
We all look so good.

998
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,448
K-POP TOP 10
90S MUSIC GROUP VIBE

999
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,516
What a nice photo.

1000
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,018
Congrats on your 30th anniversary.

1001
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,086
I'm so excited!

1002
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,788
SUPER EXCITED

1003
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,524
I'm sure you recognize this place.

1004
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,792
Of course!

1005
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,226
-We sure do.
-Here we are

1006
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,396
-Lotte World
-Lotte World

1007
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,864
We know it so well.

1008
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,934
We're holding
a special celebration for Sook,

1009
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,971
the eldest and the anchor of the cast
right here tonight.

1010
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,474
We have also prepared
an amazing set of gifts.

1011
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,943
MIND-BOGGLING SURPRISE GIFT!

1012
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,048
For Sook to receive the presents,

1013
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,584
you have to successfully complete
the group games we prepared.

1014
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,652
All right.

1015
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,420
-Let's win them for her.
-Good luck, guys.

1016
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,189
Can you tell us what we'd have to ride?

1017
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,857
I'd like to check if I can ride them.

1018
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,293
First off, French Revolution.

1019
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,594
Does it take you outside?

1020
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,929
No, it's the roller coaster.

1021
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,231
-That's right.
-It's a fun ride.

1022
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,766
-I assume you can ride it, Woo-jae.
-Sure.

1023
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,835
I'm good with anything
so long as it doesn't spin around.

1024
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,369
-How about you, Woo-young?
-Hard pass.

1025
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,238
-Really?
-Suck it up.

1026
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,306
Just ride it.

1027
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,841
-Hey.
-What?

1028
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,709
Sook is celebrating her 30th anniversary.

1029
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,877
Can you ride it?

1030
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,580
SILENCE

1031
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,348
IT GOES ON WAY TOO LONG
CONSIDERING HER SCOLD

1032
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,549
Seriously? What a hypocrite.

1033
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,917
-Unbelievable.
-So, Jin-kyung?

1034
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,819
She's plain ridiculous.

1035
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,521
DEAFENING SILENCE

1036
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,856
Breaking the silence

1037
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:25,957
-is our guest!
-He's here?

1038
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,391
-Gosh, Young-hyun.
-Hey, he's here.

1039
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,459
Young-hyun!

1040
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,061
LET'S CELEBRATE! YOUNG K IS HERE

1041
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,796
-You really came.
-What's going on?

1042
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,698
You must be so tired.

1043
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,765
We have a party tonight.

1044
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,000
-What's going on?
-Thank you.

1045
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,502
I wanted to congratulate you in person.

1046
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,403
I can't believe what's happening.

1047
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,906
We all know how draining it can be

1048
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,307
-after a concert.
-For sure.

1049
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,443
-My gosh, Young-hyun.
-Call me, and I'll be there.

1050
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,111
-Hello, Young K.
-Hi.

1051
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,713
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

1052
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,749
Can you say hello to our viewers?

1053
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,584
Hi, I'm Young K from DAY6.

1054
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,119
YOUNG K FROM DAY6

1055
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,421
I'm so grateful.

1056
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,357
-Congratulations.
-Gosh, thank you.

1057
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,691
Do you like rides in amusement parks?

1058
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,959
I love them,

1059
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,861
-but I can't visit amusement parks.
-Ride all you want.

1060
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,363
Can you go on the Gyro Drop?

1061
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,198
-I love it.
-Really?

1062
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,299
We're good, then.

1063
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,834
-Okay. First off…
-Please follow me.

1064
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,403
I know this must be confusing
for you, Young K,

1065
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,672
-but let's get moving.
-To the French Revolution.

1066
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,774
-Let's go!
-Let's go.

1067
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,409
WHAT A CHEERFUL GUY

1068
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,477
THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY

1069
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,078
IN FULLY-RENTED LOTTE WORLD
BEGINS NOW

1070
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,347
I've never ridden this one before.

1071
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,583
I'll break it down for you.

1072
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,352
This gives you a tour of Lotte World.

1073
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,154
-I see.
-It goes super slowly.

1074
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,455
Doesn't it take you outside?

1075
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,024
That's Atlantis.

1076
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,759
-So this ride isn't scary?
-Not at all.

1077
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:35,993
Okay, let's try it.

1078
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,396
-It only moves at low speed.
-Really?

1079
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,864
Stop it, you swindler.

1080
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,532
I'll tell you what it's like, Sook.

1081
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,269
-Really?
-That's what it is.

1082
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,839
The ride you're about to go on in
is called the French Revolution,

1083
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,541
as you all know.

1084
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,176
FRENCH REVOLUTION MISSION

1085
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,912
It's the signature roller coaster
of Lotte World Adventure.

1086
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,349
The breathtaking drop
and the mind-blowing loop…

1087
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,850
-But it still goes slowly.
-…will give you

1088
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,119
a thrilling experience like no other.

1089
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,057
It has loops with a 360-degree spin
and a 540-degree spin.

1090
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,194
Wait. I got the bit
about the 360-degree spin,

1091
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,295
but not the 560-degree spin.

1092
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,564
-It goes like this.
-I can describe it in detail.

1093
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,234
The rail takes a spin like a tornado,
and it feels like this.

1094
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,502
"Uh-huh, that's the 540-degree spin?"
And that's it.

1095
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,504
"Uh-huh, that's the 540-degree spin?"
And that's it.

1096
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,608
I mean it. I'm not lying here.

1097
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,875
-He's right.
-Believe me.

1098
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,577
-It does go at that speed.
-See?

1099
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,181
-I'm not feeling it.
-It's your anniversary.

1100
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,450
-You're riding it, then?
-If you're riding it, I will.

1101
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,919
Wait, here's the thing about Sook.

1102
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,454
She doesn't enjoy any of the rides.

1103
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,923
We shouldn't torment her
when we're here to celebrate her.

1104
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,057
That won't do.

1105
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,327
So, her fellow castmates
will be taking on the mission

1106
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,997
on her behalf.

1107
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,632
-Let's hear him out.
-So, here's the mission.

1108
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,435
We've named it "Where's Sook?"

1109
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,605
-"Where's Sook?"
-Everyone except Sook

1110
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,841
-will go on the roller coaster.
-Okay.

1111
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:00,945
While the others are on the moving ride,
Sook will be elsewhere,

1112
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,780
-holding up a sign.
-Dang it.

1113
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,848
-Damn it.
-Goodness.

1114
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:04,915
That's insane.

1115
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,117
-Come on.
-That sounds fun.

1116
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,485
Don't you know how fast it goes?

1117
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,986
-It rushes past like this.
-I assure you

1118
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,588
that we've checked that it was feasible.

1119
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,590
WE RAN OUR TRIAL SIMULATIONS

1120
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,592
I'll probably stand out. Look.

1121
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,260
-You'll be able to see me.
-Wait.

1122
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,664
We prepared something
to help you pop even more.

1123
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,799
You'll be given a red cloak.

1124
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,936
So, Sook will be wearing a red cloak.

1125
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,004
This sounds fun.

1126
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,674
Your task is to spot her
and read the message.

1127
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,276
And it still counts
even if only one of them sees me?

1128
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,345
-Yes, it does.
-Of course.

1129
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,847
All right. I'll tell you the present
we have prepared for Sook.

1130
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:37,915
I'm dying to know.

1131
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,983
THE BIG REVEAL

1132
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,752
It's a voucher
for laser skin tightening treatment.

1133
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,587
I could use it.

1134
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,957
You see its importance, right?
That's exactly what you need at 50.

1135
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,759
-It's for Ulthera shots.
-Ulthera?

1136
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,861
I've tried it,
so I'll give you the voucher if we get it.

1137
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,663
-It's okay, Sook.
-She took 600 shots.

1138
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,700
I'm not kidding around
when I say she's manly as hell.

1139
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,168
She skipped the anesthesia.

1140
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,235
Really?

1141
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,538
When I asked her how it felt,

1142
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,773
she said it felt like a truck
was going over her face.

1143
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,175
-My gosh.
-Who needs anesthesia?

1144
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,144
She just balled up her fists
and endured it like a champ.

1145
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,813
-I took the shots just like that.
-Sook.

1146
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,348
Why did you skip anesthesia?

1147
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,615
-Huh?
-Why didn't you get it?

1148
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,284
Come on. Women don't need that.

1149
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,519
-We can all just take whatever.
-She's incredible.

1150
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,054
-That's nothing.
-But anesthesia is a must.

1151
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,622
That's what I heard too.

1152
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,690
HOW HAS LIFE TREATED YOU?

1153
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,626
All right. Those who are up for it,
please raise your hands.

1154
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,228
Three, two, one.

1155
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,430
-So you're all riding it?
-I will if Sook's riding it.

1156
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,765
What's your problem, punk?

1157
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,833
-Hey.
-What's your deal?

1158
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,235
You asked me to join you.
You can't bail out now.

1159
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,303
He's here on your request.

1160
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,238
I got here to do all this with you.

1161
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,073
I never called you over.
You volunteered to come.

1162
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,441
Fine! You can head home, Young K.

1163
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,843
-Let's just hop on.
-I'm so sorry.

1164
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,578
-But I want to try it.
-What's he doing?

1165
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,012
I mean, I want to get on the ride.

1166
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,714
You're hopping on too.

1167
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,549
-But I can't.
-Suck it up, dude.

1168
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,618
WOO-YOUNG KEEPS WHINING,
AND ONE PERSON OBSERVES HIM

1169
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,220
Come here, you.

1170
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,521
-Come here.
-Give him an earful.

1171
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,956
It looks like you're in trouble.

1172
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,290
You're coming to me?

1173
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,959
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY

1174
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,694
IS TAKING A KID AWAY
TO TAKE HIS MONEY

1175
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,463
You're not riding it?

1176
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,233
No. Let's skip it, the three of us,
you, Sook, and me.

1177
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,001
OKAY

1178
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,202
-Get your act together.
-Sure.

1179
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,438
HEH-HEH, WE'RE SKIPPING THE RIDE

1180
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,573
I get it.

1181
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,908
I don't think I can ride it.

1182
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,444
The safety bar rests here,
so it might tap my scar and stuff.

1183
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,913
-You never know, right?
-We don't want it ruptured.

1184
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,182
-Sae-ho's still recovering.
-Right.

1185
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,684
-So Young K will take his place.
-Okay.

1186
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,386
Please take good care of Woo-young.

1187
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,855
-Sure, I'll hold your hand, Woo-young.
-You can ride with him.

1188
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,524
-Okay, Sook.
-Yeah?

1189
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,293
Please follow the crew
and go to your designated spot.

1190
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,061
Let's do a cheer first.

1191
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,263
Three, two, one.

1192
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,597
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1193
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:34,665
Let's get that prize.

1194
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,333
You're loving it, right?

1195
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,401
Doesn't it feel amazing?

1196
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,236
This will make my voice go out.

1197
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,238
Don't worry. I've got you, Woo-young.

1198
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:44,542
-Doesn't the ride scare you?
-You just made me more anxious.

1199
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,076
I'm just doing it for you.

1200
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,713
GOSH, THAT'S SO MOVING

1201
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,416
I'm really no good with rides.

1202
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,484
I'm so worried.

1203
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,554
FAKE RI-NA ON HER WAY
TO THE MISSION SITE

1204
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,924
Get me that treatment voucher.
I could really use the skin tightening.

1205
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,625
IRRESISTIBLE
ANTI-AGING TREATMENT

1206
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,762
I don't think I've ridden this.

1207
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,097
Hey, Young-hyun.
Have you ever gone on a roller coaster

1208
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,999
after holding a concert for 3.5 hours?

1209
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,435
Won't it be more worrying
if I've actually done that before?

1210
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,837
So this is your first-ever experience?

1211
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,371
"I'LL BE TRYING THAT SOON!"

1212
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,507
Gosh, it's going down.

1213
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,076
To tell you the truth,

1214
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,080
this is the first time
I'm carrying out missions on shows.

1215
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,983
Jin-kyung, he's never tried
something like this on variety shows.

1216
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,518
-Really?
-It can be fun.

1217
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,619
I'm looking forward to this.

1218
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,054
-My gosh.
-I actually came to try them.

1219
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,456
-This is his first time.
-We all saw how excited Chimchakman was

1220
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,192
-to tackle the quizzes earlier.
-Jang Yoon-ju!

1221
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,195
He got hyped up to try the games
he's only seen on TV so far.

1222
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,197
Try it and see for yourself.

1223
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,066
-Here's the thing.
-After a couple of rides…

1224
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,134
It won't be as easy as it looks on TV.

1225
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,536
-I guess it's far from that.
-Okay.

1226
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,073
You can choose
between the front row and the back row.

1227
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,140
2 SEATS EACH

1228
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,042
Let's take the front row. It's better.

1229
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,411
Who are you to decide that?

1230
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,380
It's far scarier in the back.

1231
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,715
-Really?
-You bet.

1232
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,750
They say it's scarier in the back.

1233
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,685
Because it keeps lurching
at the tail for the ride.

1234
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,823
Like this. At the front row,
you only have to deal with the drop.

1235
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,324
But the back?
They have to feel everything.

1236
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,094
-Okay. Let's take the front row.
-Okay, please get on board.

1237
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,929
JIN-KYUNG AND WOO-YOUNG
TO THE FRONT

1238
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,034
You're all so smart.
The others are going to flip, though.

1239
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,102
DRESSING UP

1240
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,904
Okay, I'm good.

1241
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,305
ALL DONE!

1242
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,508
WHY AREN'T YOU GETTING ON BOARD?

1243
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,609
No way.

1244
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,979
WHAT IS HE DOING?

1245
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,414
I think I just pissed myself.

1246
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,616
Just hop on already.

1247
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,451
What do you think you're playing at?

1248
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,520
Don't be so heartless
just because you're not getting on.

1249
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,556
Come on, it's not scary at all.

1250
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,958
430TH DUTY OF THE CAMERA
DIRECTOR: CAJOLING WOO-YOUNG

1251
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,726
Come on, Woo-young.

1252
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,795
Just a short spin, and you're done.

1253
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,530
-I'm getting off too.
-Close your eyes and…

1254
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,566
It's your responsibility
if I crap my pants tonight.

1255
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,833
CUT THE CRAP AND HOP ON

1256
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,535
THESE GUYS ARE OUT OF IT TOO

1257
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,037
Will we be able to see her?

1258
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,205
To think Kang Young-hyun of DAY6

1259
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,575
had a 3.5-hour concert

1260
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,877
and ended up here in French Revolution.

1261
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:00,945
ONLY 1 HOUR HAS PASSED

1262
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,580
Where exactly are we?

1263
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,647
How crazy is this?

1264
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,115
Who am I?

1265
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,320
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
IS ALMOST UPON THEM

1266
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,255
-What do I do with this?
-That's it, isn't it?

1267
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,990
-You're right.
-Gosh, I'm terrified.

1268
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,292
Just press this in the back?

1269
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,128
NOW THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY
GETTING READY

1270
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,064
THE FEAR IS CREEPING INTO
WOO-JAE TOO

1271
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,266
I think Woo-jae will see me.

1272
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,701
He should manage this much.

1273
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,369
Isn't the answer too easy?

1274
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,505
I mean, we talked about this
on our way here.

1275
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,942
I was working on ***.

1276
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,979
WHAT CAN THE ANSWER BE?

1277
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,748
All right, everyone.
Please enjoy the fun journey.

1278
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:41,251
I hope you'll be able to
make loads of great memories here.

1279
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,555
That man was here 15 years ago.
And he's still around, waving at people.

1280
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,357
All right.
Let's say our goodbyes with a wave.

1281
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,992
Let me see your hands.

1282
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,027
-You must have a long-term contract.
-Well… Wait.

1283
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,128
I think I remember you.

1284
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,197
You were here
when I was back in high school.

1285
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,465
HE'S BEEN HERE FOR 30 YEARS

1286
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,001
-Here we go, French Revolution!
-I'm terrified!

1287
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,335
This is Lotte World.

1288
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,237
IT'S CLEAR THEY'RE EXPERIENCING
DIFFERENT FEELINGS

1289
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,472
You're awful, Screwballs!

1290
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,074
-I want you to stay behind, Director!
-I'm so exhausted!

1291
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,676
I want all other crew members too!

1292
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:06,744
FEAR-INDUCED DEMANDS

1293
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,713
Seriously, Jin-kyung.
You should've put your foot down.

1294
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,716
I can't believe we're actually riding
this thing this late at night.

1295
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,686
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1296
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,955
-Make sure to find Sook!
-See you!

1297
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,491
-We'll make it back alive.
-I forgot about the mission!

1298
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,725
We have a mission.

1299
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,960
ALMOST FORGOT IT

1300
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,428
Jin-kyung!

1301
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,231
SCREAMING FROM THE ONSET

1302
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,500
-I'm so pissed.
-Here goes nothing.

1303
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,201
You've got this, Woo-young!

1304
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,736
-Where is she anyway?
-How annoying!

1305
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,239
Damn you, Young-hyun!

1306
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,674
TEARS UP AS THE RIDE GOES UP

1307
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,710
As a kid, I used to marvel at the height

1308
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,478
when a ride started climbing up.

1309
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,313
It's still incredible.

1310
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,715
We sure are high up in the air.

1311
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:45,949
It's taking us far up.

1312
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,119
IN THE MEANTIME,
SAE-HO IS LEFT ALONE

1313
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,289
-I have a surprise just for you.
-All right.

1314
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,791
-I'm letting you in on a secret.
-Okay.

1315
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,526
-As you know, I'm tight-lipped.
-Sure.

1316
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,396
THERE'S A SECRET BEHIND
THIS MISSION?

1317
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,932
I see ghosts sometimes.

1318
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,368
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW THIS…

1319
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,404
BEFORE YOU HOP ON

1320
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,041
-Damn it.
-I can't believe I'm actually here.

1321
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,976
Wait, where is Sook anyway?

1322
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,612
We have to find her.
Otherwise, we'd have to do this again.

1323
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,714
-Here we go.
-We must find her.

1324
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,950
THEY'VE FINALLY REACHED
THE HIGHEST POINT

1325
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,252
I haven't ridden
a roller coaster for ages.

1326
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,021
-Oh, dear.
-Keep your eyes wide open.

1327
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,823
Jin-kyung!

1328
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,459
SUDDEN ACCELERATION

1329
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,728
THE DIZZYING SPEED

1330
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,364
WILL MAKE YOUR EYES BUG OUT
AND YOUR JAW DROP

1331
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,536
THESE GUYS ARE FULLY ENJOYING IT

1332
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,606
A SPLIT SECOND LATER,
THEY ENTER THE CAVE

1333
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,710
THIS LADY IS
ON THE VERGE OF TEARS…

1334
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,947
-Oh, man.
-Is it supposed to be this dark here?

1335
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,282
-Did they turn off the lights?
-The lights are off.

1336
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,319
THE CRAZY SPEED

1337
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,421
HAS THE FRONT-ROW OCCUPANTS
IN A DAZE

1338
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,123
We have to keep our eyes open, Jin-kyung.

1339
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,292
Keep your eyes on the front, Jin-kyung.

1340
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,195
-How on earth will we find Sook?
-Are you here, Sook?

1341
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,463
Are you here, Sook?

1342
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,531
SHE'S NOT THERE

1343
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,466
My treatment voucher!

1344
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,602
-My voucher!
-Eyes to the front.

1345
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,237
We have to find Sook.

1346
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,806
We must… We're going down!

1347
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,608
PAST THE CAVE
WITH DAZZLING LIGHTS

1348
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,077
COMES THE PLUNGE

1349
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,479
We're going down! Wait, focus.

1350
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,882
THE 360-DEGREE SPIN
WILL MAKE YOUR MIND WHIRL

1351
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,286
THIS IS DOING MORE DAMAGE
THAN THE TIGHTS

1352
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,155
Find Sook!

1353
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,528
THE ROLLER COASTER PASSES BY
A FIGURE IN RED CLOAK

1354
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,595
ON ITS WAY DOWN

1355
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,164
Find Sook!

1356
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,432
HIS DYNAMIC VISION
IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL!

1357
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,768
THE BACK ROW EXPERIENCES
THE DROP TOO

1358
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,270
And we're supposed to find her?

1359
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,405
Guys, I'm here!

1360
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,207
Don't just look ahead. Look here!

1361
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,877
YOUR COSTARS ARE PREOCCUPIED

1362
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,946
Where is she? Dang it, the sign!

1363
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,749
-We just passed by her!
-I missed the sign!

1364
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,018
-I didn't get to see the sign!
-We missed her!

1365
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,086
THESE GUYS ONLY CAUGHT
A GLIMPSE OF THE RED CLOAK

1366
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,355
It's not cool for her
to just appear like that.

1367
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,259
Where is she?

1368
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,395
-Do pay attention, Jin-kyung.
-Where is she?

1369
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,363
And where is she? I can't find her!

1370
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,266
WITHOUT A MOMENT
TO COMPOSE THEMSELVES

1371
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,702
THEY'RE IN FOR THE GRAND FINALE,
THE 540-DEGREE SPIN

1372
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,243
HOPEFULLY, HE'S FINISHED
RECORDING HIS ALBUM

1373
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,812
-Wait… The sign!
-There she is.

1374
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,113
We need to see the sign!

1375
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,449
-Hold on--
-This is it, guys!

1376
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,717
-Here!
-Where is she?

1377
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,052
Guys, I'm right here.

1378
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,520
Please let me see the sign!

1379
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,388
Just one more time. I saw it right there.

1380
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,090
-Where was she?
-Over there.

1381
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,558
MS. RED CLOAK DISAPPEARED
IN A FLASH

1382
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,763
THE ROLLER COASTER REACHED
ITS DESTINATION

1383
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,067
Whenever I have a shoot for Screwballs…

1384
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,802
-Welcome back!
-…I lose my voice.

1385
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,503
NOT IN A SHAPE TO COMPLAIN

1386
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,571
PASSED OUT

1387
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,840
I always lose my voice
whenever I have a shoot with you.

1388
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,142
Welcome back. Did you find Sook?

1389
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:00,878
-Fat chance.
-Did you see her?

1390
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,246
How are we supposed to do that?

1391
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,413
THE DUO IS MAD

1392
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,549
Hey, Director.

1393
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,251
THEY'VE GROWN VISIBLY PALE

1394
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,353
Why did you hop on anyway?
You couldn't see anything.

1395
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,255
HEH

1396
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,322
Sae-ho!

1397
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,591
What on earth is this about?

1398
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,060
Your dynamic vision
must be extremely good to catch her.

1399
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,563
-So you missed her?
-It was so dark to begin with.

1400
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,631
Did you not find her?

1401
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,733
-We did find her.
-We saw her red cloak.

1402
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,668
We did see the person in a red cloak,

1403
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,838
but we barely noticed that
because of the vivid color.

1404
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,906
Really?

1405
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,242
Is it over?

1406
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,311
YES, IT IS

1407
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,580
Did you see the sign?

1408
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,749
Well, yeah.

1409
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:39,883
What did it say?

1410
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,252
I think we can wrap this mission up.

1411
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,320
-Seriously?
-Sure.

1412
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:44,521
Don't worry. I saw the sign.

1413
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,722
-Really?
-Yeah.

1414
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,057
This is new.

1415
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,494
You're in for another ride.

1416
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,129
-What? Wait!
-But I know the answer!

1417
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,230
-Hold on!
-Come on!

1418
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,332
-Over here, Director Park!
-Let me out.

1419
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,633
I know the answer.

1420
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,435
-You know the answer?
-What?

1421
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,270
-What is it?
-You saw it?

1422
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,638
He said he saw the sign.

1423
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,641
AND YET…

1424
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,276
I swear no one saw me.

1425
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,245
Not a single one.

1426
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,546
I saw them, okay?

1427
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,982
No one looked in my direction.

1428
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,951
They were all out of it.

1429
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,018
WHAT IS THE TRUTH?

1430
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,220
-What is it?
-You saw it?

1431
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,189
The answer is Sister's Slam Dunk.

1432
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,958
-Sister's Slam Dunk?
-Yeah.

1433
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,026
-What did you see, Jin-kyung?
-The same thing.

1434
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,594
-Sister's Slam Dunk?
-Exactly.

1435
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,096
-For real?
-What about you two?

1436
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,832
The sign said Sister's Slam Dunk.

1437
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,969
-And you, Young K?
-I saw the sign saying that.

1438
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,036
JUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON

1439
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,838
-It was as clear as day.
-It had three words

1440
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,239
written in two rows.

1441
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,307
All right.

1442
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:38,675
That's it, Woo-jae.

1443
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,578
-It said, "Sister's Slam Dunk."
-Yeah, exactly!

1444
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,879
Let's find out the result.

1445
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:43,981
COULD THIS BE THE ANSWER?

1446
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,950
WHILE WOO-YOUNG IS CONVINCED…

1447
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,852
They failed 100%.

1448
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,355
I mean, nobody saw me.

1449
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,190
Let's find out the result.

1450
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,093
You failed. That is incorrect.

1451
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,195
-What exactly did you see?
-What did you do?

1452
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,264
Okay, here's a hint.

1453
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,034
First off, the answer
is indeed one of the shows

1454
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,635
that Sook appeared in.

1455
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,939
You will find a show's title
written on the sign.

1456
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,775
Just go for another ride. Quick.

1457
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,111
Will she be staying at the same spot?

1458
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,746
We meant to send her elsewhere,

1459
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,247
but we'll let her stay in place.

1460
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:18,548
Where was she?

1461
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,051
-I saw her almost right away.
-There were two people in cloaks, no?

1462
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,519
Right. Director Park.

1463
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,721
-Yeah?
-Do we have two cloaked people?

1464
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,556
ARE THERE TWO PEOPLE WEARING
A RED CLOAK?

1465
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:28,925
-Well--
-No, there was only one.

1466
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,494
-But we saw two people.
-You got it wrong.

1467
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,062
We clearly saw two red-cloaked people.

1468
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,032
THERE IS ONLY ONE SOOK…

1469
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,967
SO HOW CAN THERE BE
TWO CLOAKED PEOPLE?

1470
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,738
I have a surprise just for you.

1471
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,707
-All right.
-I'm letting you in on a secret.

1472
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,375
Okay. As you know, I'm tight-lipped.

1473
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:49,112
Sure. As your costars
ride the French Revolution,

1474
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,081
they will meet…

1475
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,818
-five Sooks on the way.
-Seriously?

1476
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,086
Five, did you say?

1477
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:58,755
THAT IS CORRECT

1478
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,025
A TOTAL OF FIVE WORE A RED CLOAK

1479
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:06,730
THEY MET MS. RED CLOAK NO. 1
WHILE ON THE 360-DEGREE LOOP

1480
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,866
THE ANSWER WOO-YOUNG SAW

1481
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,903
WAS ON THE SIGN OF
MS. RED CLOAK NO. 1

1482
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,541
MS. RED CLOAK NO. 2
WAS RIGHT HERE

1483
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,909
THEY ALL MISSED
MS. RED CLOAK NO. 3

1484
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,110
RIGHT AFTER THE 360-DEGREE LOOP

1485
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,513
AND MS. RED CLOAK NO. 4
WAS BY THE 540-DEGREE SPIN

1486
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,917
NATURALLY, THEY MISSED HER TOO

1487
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,386
THE WOMAN OF THE HOUR
ONLY APPEARS AT THE END

1488
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,621
FORGET ABOUT THE OTHERS,
LOOK AT ME!

1489
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,290
Dang it. I'm here!

1490
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,560
THE SECOND MS. RED CLOAK
YOUNG K SPOTTED

1491
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,462
TURNED OUT TO BE THE REAL SOOK!

1492
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:40,997
They'd never find me.

1493
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,399
TRUTH ABOUT THE MS. RED CLOAKS
REVEALED

1494
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,567
It's hilarious, though.

1495
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,837
The fact that I'm in this
is hilarious in itself.

1496
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,572
THE END OF THE CHILLING TALE
OF THE MS. RED CLOAKS

1497
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,474
You'll find five people
wearing a red cloak.

1498
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,541
Five, did you say?

1499
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,609
RUNS AWAY IMMEDIATELY

1500
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,710
Jin-kyung! Hey, Director!

1501
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,078
-She's running away.
-Wait, Jin-kyung.

1502
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,146
Jin-kyung! Hey, Director!

1503
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,415
-She's running away.
-Wait, Jin-kyung.

1504
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,784
-Come on, Jin-kyung.
-Where is she going anyway?

1505
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,320
I'll just stay here. Let me stay here.

1506
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,288
Hey, we have five people in a red cloak.

1507
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,957
We have to find out which is Sook

1508
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,725
and check out the sign she's holding.

1509
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,761
It'd still be a challenge
even if there were just Sook.

1510
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:12,829
SHE MISSED ALL FIVE

1511
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,698
Okay, then.
The decoys will just stand there

1512
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,032
-without a sign.
-Good.

1513
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,468
THE DECOYS WILL LOSE
THEIR SKETCHBOOKS

1514
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,137
Let's not get too excited.

1515
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,638
-Yeah, this requires focus.
-Concentrate.

1516
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,440
-We shouldn't get excited.
-Let's not yell either.

1517
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,408
Come on, guys.

1518
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,878
I do badly need that treatment voucher!

1519
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,112
THE BELL OF DESTINY RINGS

1520
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,514
-Good luck!
-We'll see you later.

1521
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,815
We'll go check out that sign.

1522
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,651
Yeah, we really must win
that voucher for her.

1523
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:35,719
Wish us luck.

1524
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:36,786
OFF THEY GO WITH A FIRM RESOLVE

1525
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,322
I'm trying to enjoy it
because I can't avoid it.

1526
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,991
-Aren't you doing the same?
-I guess.

1527
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,659
But I'm not enjoying this.

1528
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,094
To be honest, me neither.

1529
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,262
BUT THEY ARE RESIGNED NOW

1530
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,063
Bye-bye.

1531
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,131
Get lost!

1532
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,503
GLUM

1533
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,372
I clearly saw Sister's Slam Dunk earlier.

1534
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,407
THEY'RE BACK ON
THE 70-DEGREE INCLINE

1535
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,279
PASSES OUT IN JUST 10 SECONDS

1536
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,481
-Focus.
-Where is she?

1537
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,183
No, I'll just look ahead.

1538
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,385
Wasn't there one early on to our right?

1539
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,153
Yeah, they kept cropping up to our right.

1540
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,289
But there's a high chance
that those people weren't Sook.

1541
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,192
Right? They have five people out there.

1542
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,259
There's one right there.

1543
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,994
Wait, she's lost her sign.

1544
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,062
I saw one over there.

1545
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,230
SPOTTED ONE ALREADY

1546
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,464
Here we go.

1547
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,969
THEY'VE REACHED
THE HIGHEST POINT

1548
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,541
It's far scarier in the back.

1549
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,210
-Told you, didn't I?
-Damn it.

1550
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,048
TOO SCARED EVEN TO SCREAM

1551
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,149
I saw one hereabouts.

1552
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,684
-Here?
-Right past this point.

1553
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,220
Right past this point?

1554
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,288
-We're almost there.
-After the lights…

1555
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,356
-Now!
-Here!

1556
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,226
NEXT UP IS THE DROP

1557
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,796
-No one's to our right.
-That's not Sook.

1558
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,831
THIS IS THE DECOY THEY SAW FIRST

1559
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,833
MS. RED CLOAK NO. 1
IS EMPTY-HANDED

1560
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,868
-That's not Sook.
-She's empty-handed.

1561
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,904
CHECKING MS. RED CLOAK NO. 2'S
HANDS AS THEY TAKE THE SPIN

1562
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,138
She's empty-handed.

1563
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,441
THEY SPOT MS. RED CLOAK NO. 3,
WHO'S WELL-HIDDEN

1564
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,910
-She's empty-handed. Her, too.
-That's not Sook either.

1565
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,011
We spotted three of them!

1566
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,980
Sook must be at the end.

1567
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,081
ONLY ONE DECOY AND SOOK REMAIN

1568
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,616
All three were empty-handed.

1569
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,452
-My goodness.
-Where on earth is Sook?

1570
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,887
There they come.

1571
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,256
THE TRAIN IS HERE

1572
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,358
Woo-jae!

1573
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,193
-Let's find the camera.
-There!

1574
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,728
Over there! What does it say?

1575
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,297
What does it say? My vision is awful!

1576
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,133
-Woo-jae!
-My vision is awful!

1577
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,568
Young K!

1578
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,336
What does it say? My vision is awful!

1579
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,771
I saw it.

1580
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,640
Young K!

1581
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,642
-I saw it. We're good.
-Infinite Girls!

1582
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,709
Infinite Girls!

1583
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,879
INFINITE GIRLS

1584
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,715
CRYING OUT IN DESPERATION

1585
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,517
THEY ARE TOO BUSY
OVERCOMING THEIR FEAR

1586
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:48,585
TO CARE ABOUT THE SIGN

1587
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,554
Infinite Girls!

1588
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,857
-Infinite…
-Girls!

1589
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:54,958
All right, Infinite Girls.

1590
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,160
We finally saw it.

1591
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,296
IT'S AS IF A WEIGHT
HAS BEEN LIFTED OFF THEIR CHEST

1592
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,366
HUFFING AND PUFFING

1593
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,869
They must've seen the sign.
It wasn't visible here.

1594
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,304
-No.
-We couldn't see a thing here.

1595
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,072
It feels amazing.

1596
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,940
-To think we saw that.
-So much thrill.

1597
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,475
The experience helped. We saw them all.

1598
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,877
Is that right?

1599
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:14,944
I loved it.

1600
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,379
SO THERE'S
A LEARNING CURVE HERE TOO

1601
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,849
They did scream out loud,
but maybe it was because they got scared.

1602
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,153
I can't be sure if they screamed
because they saw my sign.

1603
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,888
SOOK ISN'T SO CONVINCED
AS WOO-JAE AND YOUNG K

1604
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,423
-Did you see it?
-You startled me.

1605
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,590
REUNION AT LAST

1606
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,059
-Did you see me?
-We did it, of course.

1607
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,827
-You did see me, right? So you got it?
-We did!

1608
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,862
-Three, two, one.
-Three, two, one.

1609
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,332
-Infinite Girls!
-Infinite Girls!

1610
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,466
That's not it?

1611
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:38,902
That's not it?

1612
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,137
ICY GLARE

1613
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,672
-What do you mean?
-That must not be it.

1614
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,909
-Cut it out.
-I even shook the sign for you.

1615
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:46,976
And we saw Infinite Girls.

1616
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,144
What about you two?

1617
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,046
You guys didn't look in my direction.

1618
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,114
Hold up.

1619
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,017
Were you dressed like this the whole time?

1620
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,219
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE WEARING
THE WHOLE TIME?

1621
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,921
This is the first time
I'm seeing her getup.

1622
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,622
While in the middle of the ride…

1623
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,691
I mean, I see ghosts sometimes.

1624
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,460
-And I thought she was a ghost.
-Young K!

1625
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,527
ACTRESS IN HAUNTED HOUSE?

1626
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:07,097
-We saw Infinite Girls on the sign.
-We're certain it's the answer.

1627
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,965
-We're sure.
-Then why did she make that face?

1628
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,700
She's just acting.

1629
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,435
I'm sure. She's just pulling our legs…

1630
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,471
Wait, why is she doing that
when her gift's on the line?

1631
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,473
Should we get it wrong on purpose?

1632
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,774
-Sook.
-Yeah?

1633
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:18,842
Don't you want the gift?

1634
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,076
I want to have it, of course.

1635
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,279
-Then why get us riled up?
-I do need that voucher.

1636
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,481
Why irritate us?

1637
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,616
-We could give the wrong answer.
-I won't irritate you.

1638
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:30,353
Three, two, one.

1639
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,989
-Infinite Girls!
-Infinite Girls!

1640
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,358
Infinite Girls, it is.

1641
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,426
That's correct!

1642
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,294
Congratulations.

1643
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:39,763
I can explain why she did it.

1644
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,932
Tricking people is second nature to her.

1645
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,201
-It's become a habit for her.
-But I couldn't understand

1646
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,505
why she'd trick us when we were
only trying to get her the present.

1647
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:52,375
Thanks to your costars' efforts,
you've won the gift. Congrats.

1648
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,878
-All right. We did it!
-Thank you.

1649
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,715
CELEBRATORY GROUP HUG

1650
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,885
OPENING UP THE GIFT

1651
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,521
I half expected to find something else.
I guess you weren't lying.

1652
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,889
-I badly needed this.
-Of course not.

1653
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:09,092
-I wouldn't joke on her important day.
-Thank you. I really needed this.

1654
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,060
All of you have firm skin.

1655
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:15,498
Now, let's move on to your next ride.

1656
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,566
Which is?

1657
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,502
Before we do that,
can I go empty my stomach?

1658
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,440
30 MINUTES LATER

1659
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,676
SOOK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY
CONTINUES

1660
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,779
I'm keeping Sook safe. Don't worry.

1661
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,181
-Where are they? Oh, there.
-Found them.

1662
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,482
WHAT GAME IS AWAITING THEM NEXT?

1663
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,117
-SISTAR!
-SISTAR!

1664
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,852
Come on. It's SISTAR!

1665
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,887
THEY GET SCARED
BY THE PIRATE SHIP RIDE

1666
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,856
AND THEIR COSTARS' DANCE MOVES

1667
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,324
Wait, what are the moves she's doing?

1668
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,660
-Don't mind her. Don't consider Jin-kyung.
-What are they?

1669
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,962
EVEN IF YOU COLLAPSE
FROM THE FATIGUE OF DANCING

1670
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,198
THE GAMES CONTINUE

1671
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,299
That's a success, right?

1672
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,401
One more. We're doing one more, damn it.

1673
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,903
ARE WE ABOUT TO MEET A SUPERHERO

1674
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,673
WHO WILL TURN THE GAME AROUND?

1675
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,545
