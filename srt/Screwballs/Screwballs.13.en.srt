1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:05,171
A SECRET GEM SITTING SNUG
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:10,710
LUSH GREEN LANDSCAPE
AND ANIMALS WELCOME YOU

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,380
Hello.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,887
PERHAPS THIS PLACE IS GODS' SANCTUARY

5
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,924
ON THIS VERY DAY…

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,894
A PARTY OF THE GODS IS BEING HELD HERE

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,664
WHICH GOD WILL JOIN THE PARTY FIRST?

8
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,738
ALONG WITH THE GODS

9
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,711
I'm the Hungry God.

10
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,613
Can I have a bite to eat?

11
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,048
I'm starving.

12
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,149
TODAY'S DRESS CODE: GODS

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,850
WE DIDN'T SEE THIS TWIST COMING…

14
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,951
I'm so hungry.

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,287
Oh no. My stomach grumbles.

16
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,723
FULLY IN CHARACTER

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,558
Try tiptoeing.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,759
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,566
Is he joining us or not?

20
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,636
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS?

21
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,638
Here. I'll give you a hand.

22
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,773
-Is there something here?
-Hold my shoulder.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,676
-Is she supposed to be a ghost?
-Hold my shoulder. Go on.

24
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,412
I'm so hungry.

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,482
This guy barely has enough meat on him.

26
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,517
HE'S PUT IN MORE EFFORT THIS TIME TOO

27
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,152
Jeez. What's he doing now?

28
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,555
What are you supposed to be?

29
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,657
Master of Ice!

30
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,126
I'm the Ice God.

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,729
Well, you do look like an idiot.

32
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,531
Like I said, I'm the Ice God.

33
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,000
He kind of looks the part, doesn't he?

34
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:41,901
I like your concept.

35
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,002
HE DOES LOOK THE PART

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,504
GET A GRIP

37
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,572
Jeez.

38
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,207
Oh no. What's this now?

39
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,375
A RED SPECK OF CHILLI POWDER RUSHES IN

40
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,477
What's this now?

41
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,378
-What on earth?
-All souls of this earth

42
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,180
shall know the sting of the spice!

43
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,816
I'm here to give you that burning taste.

44
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,185
I am the Capsaicin God!

45
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,687
-I'm Capsaicin
-Hey!

46
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,721
I'm Capsaicin

47
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,491
I'm here to make your tongue burn
I'm Capsaicin

48
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,792
I'm Capsaicin

49
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,528
You'll feel the might of spice.

50
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,498
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM
EVEN IN OUR NIGHTMARES

51
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,299
I'm the Capsaicin God!

52
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,768
-It suddenly feels like a children's show.
-I'm Capsaicin

53
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,505
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE RED CHILLI POWDER'S BIT…

54
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,044
FULLY IMMERSED

55
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,313
He's that guy from the Slave Hunters.

56
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,182
Capsaicin!

57
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,283
POSE

58
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,652
HA-HA

59
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,320
We've got a bum there.

60
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,688
"Isn't it just grand?"

61
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,023
Is he the guy from the Slave Hunters?

62
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,225
But that character wasn't a god.

63
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,729
No human is free from committing sins.

64
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,265
Freeze!

65
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,434
SHE GETS IT NOW

66
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,602
-Along with the Gods.
-I see.

67
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,571
-Is he that god from Along with the Gods?
-The hairy one.

68
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,939
You have committed many sins.

69
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,641
HE'S THE KING OF THE UNDERWORLD,
OR SO HE SAYS

70
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,608
NOM

71
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,310
I'm the Hungry God.

72
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,713
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT
IS THEIR OWN CHARACTERS

73
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,016
-Hello, everyone.
-Sinners.

74
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,084
What a fine day for TV entertainment.
I'm your host,

75
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,953
the Grasshopper Yu Jae-seok,
God of TV Shows.

76
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,057
We have a stellar set of guests today.

77
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,026
Welcome, everyone!

78
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,460
AT ANY RATE, ALL FIVE GODS ARE HERE

79
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,429
Please get rid of this pest for us.

80
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,999
-As the God of TV Shows, I thought…
-Will you be our host for the day?

81
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,801
-What a nice idea.
-You even sound different.

82
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,905
Over the last few weeks,
I've monitored our show's performance.

83
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,473
When the show first launched…

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,608
ACK

85
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,076
THE HOST IS HAVING EXCESS PHLEGM

86
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,678
You have sinned a lot.

87
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,081
-When our show first launched,
-She's a shady one.

88
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,519
Netflix hadn't released
When Life Gives You Tangerines yet.

89
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,587
Are you wearing a wig?

90
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,722
-Well, yes.
-Oh, so that's a wig.

91
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,625
It was before the launch
of When Live Gives You Tangerines--

92
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,094
Give it a rest
and let me do my part, okay?

93
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,830
Jae-seok would've pulled through
no matter what his castmates did.

94
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,999
Jae-seok can keep it going no matter what.

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,500
You should try that too.

96
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,903
When the show first launched,

97
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,571
-it performed--
-Look at that camera.

98
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,908
-Hello.
-Don't forget to show your teeth.

99
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,877
Hi, when our show first launched,

100
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,213
-it performed very well--
-Look right in here.

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,350
-Let me share my Screwballs analysis!
-Oh, you're looking good.

102
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,085
DOESN'T CARE THAT SHE'S MAD

103
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,920
FLAP, FLAP

104
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,355
Let's try the intro one last time.

105
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,724
Kick us off with a greeting. Standby, cue!

106
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,891
Hello--

107
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,859
ACK

108
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,893
FLAP, FLAP

109
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,062
Spit it out or something.

110
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,767
-I didn't realize Jae-seok was so amazing.
-That was hilarious.

111
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,535
I'm seeing you in a new light.
You're admirable.

112
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,671
-I love you, Jae-seok.
-You nailed it.

113
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,040
What were you trying to say, Jin-kyung?

114
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:34,941
Here goes.

115
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,144
We had a great buzz
when Screwballs first launched.

116
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,481
We held first place
in the Top Ten Shows in Korea for days.

117
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,583
It seemed like we were on the rise.

118
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,853
-Then came When Life Gives You Tangerines.
-She has a point.

119
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,889
After that, our show has almost
disappeared from the charts.

120
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,790
But here's the thing.

121
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,860
Are you trying to throw shade
at the When Life Gives You Tangerine team?

122
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,695
No, of course not.

123
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,497
You want to blame them for our downfall?

124
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,931
I watch that show.

125
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,833
-It's my favorite.
-I never said that.

126
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,702
I cried buckets watching it.

127
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,971
-"The throne was ours."
-Wait.

128
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,006
-Stop it!
-"We want to put our roots down

129
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,875
right there on the throne."

130
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,576
"But with When Life Gives You Tangerines…"

131
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,048
Please add a subtitle saying
that this is Jin-kyung's personal opinion.

132
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,750
-It doesn't reflect our team's opinion.
-That's not what I intended.

133
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,386
I absolutely adore the show.
It's my all-time favorite.

134
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,521
Yeah, that's true.

135
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,289
But the show ended, you see.

136
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,559
This is the perfect opportunity
for us to go full steam ahead.

137
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,194
That's what I thought.

138
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,396
That's what I thought.

139
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,831
SLIDING DOWN

140
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,066
DARN IT

141
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,234
You sure are the God of TV Shows.
The heavens are helping.

142
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,071
-What with the phlegm and the headband…
-When Life Gives You Comedic Moments.

143
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,740
EXHAUSTED

144
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,975
-Sorry, Jae-seok.
-Tell us.

145
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,444
What is it that you want?

146
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,280
-What do you want us to do?
-Reclaim first place?

147
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,283
I mulled over this issue last night

148
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,286
and realized that there was a reason
why the first episode did so well.

149
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,756
AND WHAT IS THIS REASON
THAT EXPLAINS THE FIRST EPISODE'S SUCCESS?

150
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,660
Let me spell it out for you.
It's Byeon Woo-seok.

151
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,762
When Life Gives You Tangerine
has been updated in full,

152
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,330
-so we could--
-So this was your angle?

153
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,734
-We have hard-working crew--
-Have you ever thought long and hard

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,602
-for the show?
-I talk to Director Park on the phone…

155
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,937
-Let's hear your pitch.
-My pitch?

156
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,638
What can we do to reclaim the top spot?

157
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,107
Let's hear your take. Mine is Woo-seok.

158
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,242
We just have to do our best!

159
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,610
We just have to do our best!

160
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,780
-Let's give it our all!
-Hey.

161
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,617
CRACKING UP

162
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,755
GOOD LUCK, GUYS!

163
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,723
You'll be attending an exclusive event

164
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,260
open to only the top elite
of the celestial world.

165
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,864
You've been invited to the party
of the gods named "Along with the Gods."

166
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,901
IN TRUTH, THEY'RE RATHER DIM
TO BE CALLED "TOP ELITES"

167
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,971
While the five of you were having fun,

168
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,306
-one more god has arrived.
-Really?

169
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,941
-Are we having a guest?
-Is that it?

170
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,511
Could it be him?

171
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,379
-Don't tell me…
-Guys!

172
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,481
Is the God of Drama Series here?

173
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,482
Can he really be here?

174
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,084
-Is this for real?
-Oh, my.

175
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,287
Hey, Jin-kyung. The crew rented
this whole place for today's shoot.

176
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,123
-What?
-What on earth?

177
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,391
SERIOUSLY, WHO IS THE GUEST?

178
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,260
Can't you give us a hint?

179
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,661
Is this person a global star?

180
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,029
Our guest is a god.

181
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,764
A god? Really?

182
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,666
What if…

183
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,935
What if it's Lee Su-ji, the God of Acting?

184
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,970
I love you, mister.

185
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,706
-Su-ju? I love her.
-That sounds likely.

186
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,543
It may be Hye-seon
dressed as the God of Mothers.

187
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,045
IT'S NOT NAM CHANG-HEE, IS IT?

188
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,815
THEY LOST INTEREST IN THE GUEST IN A FLASH

189
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,185
-We've kept our guest waiting for long.
-Oh, dear. Really?

190
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,454
-Let's invite them here.
-It's our first guest on Screwballs.

191
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,256
I'll now give you
a brief introduction about our guest.

192
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,726
He is the God of Beauty,
voted the most handsome man in the world.

193
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,094
"The God of Beauty"?

194
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,530
Voted as the man
with the best sculpted face in the world.

195
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,665
Gosh, really?

196
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,899
Scientific analyses

197
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,036
crowned him as the Asian man
with the most perfect face.

198
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,140
He was also handpicked by current idols
as the most handsome one of them all.

199
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,643
After his group's debut in 2013,

200
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,146
they were hailed as the best newcomer
in and out of the country.

201
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,714
-In 2013? That's BTS.
-It has to be them.

202
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,151
They were the first group to reach No. 1
on Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200.

203
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,152
-Oh my.
-It must be BTS.

204
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,620
It's Jin.

205
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,090
They were the first Koreans to perform
at the Grammys or give a speech at the UN.

206
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,358
-Goodness.
-It's Jin, all right!

207
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,660
Good looks, physique, talent, charms,

208
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,462
-tact, and sense of humor.
-Hey, Jin!

209
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,465
This God of K-Pop has indeed everything.

210
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,100
GOD OF K-POP

211
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,773
Here's our first-ever guest on the show.

212
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,141
-Seriously?
-Please come in!

213
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,243
-For real?
-It's not a joke?

214
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,777
Don't pull our legs, okay?

215
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,979
-Is this real?
-Can it be him?

216
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,049
FIRST GUEST ON SCREWBALLS
JIN FROM BTS

217
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,318
-Oh, man!
-Goodness!

218
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,554
ON THE VERGE OF TEARS

219
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,756
THIS IS JAW-DROPPING

220
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,391
BEDAZZLED BY THE WORLD-CLASS STAR'S VISIT

221
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,959
-Jin is here!
-Hey, I mean…

222
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,262
I watched the BTS… just yesterday…

223
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,330
I swear I watched clips
of their live performance.

224
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,298
UNABLE TO HOLD BACK

225
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,766
-Can this be real?
-I can't believe it!

226
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,701
-Goodness, welcome.
-It's incredible.

227
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,871
-Hey. It's been so long.
-It really has been so long.

228
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,841
It's so nice to meet you.

229
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,643
AN IMPROMPTU MEET-AND-GREET EVENT

230
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,412
-I can't believe Jin is really here.
-Goodness, what's going on?

231
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,381
-What are you playing at?
-Coming through.

232
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,918
You useless boots!
Jin was giving me a handshake.

233
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,620
-Hey, it's been a while.
-It's so nice to see you again.

234
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,690
-What are you doing over there?
-Gosh, you're so handsome.

235
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,691
And she's right.

236
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,495
HE FEELS AWKWARD STANDING BETWEEN
THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE HUNGRY GOD

237
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,201
THE NATION'S TREASURE, BTS

238
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,204
THE GROUP'S ELDEST MEMBER AND ITS PILLAR

239
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,776
HIS AURA AND GOOD LOOKS ARE UNMATCHED

240
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,844
"NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM FOUND
THAT JIN'S FACIAL FEATURES

241
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,980
OVERLAP WITH THE FEATURES
OF THE BUST OF ZEUS, THE GREEK GOD"

242
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,183
THE ARTIST WITH ENTICING SILVER VOICE

243
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,354
THE FRIENDLY AND CHEERFUL MEMBER
WHO ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE GROUP'S YOUNGEST

244
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,823
HE NEVER SHIES AWAY FROM DOING SLAPSTICK

245
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,826
NO ONE IS MORE DEDICATED
AT MAKING THE FANS SMILE AND LAUGH

246
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,696
GOD OF K-POP, JIN OF BTS

247
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,832
Hi, I'm Jin from BTS.

248
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,535
WELCOME

249
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,338
-This is insane.
-You can say that again.

250
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,407
I was told
that today's dress code was gods.

251
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,943
Goodness. His costume has wings
just like Sae-ho's.

252
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,012
-I'm not sure what…
-See? Sae-ho's has them too.

253
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,781
MOM, I'M SO ASHAMED RIGHT NOW

254
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,451
-Go stand next to him.
-I heard that the theme was gods,

255
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,252
but you're all dressed as ghosts.

256
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,654
You can step away now.

257
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,123
-Seriously, guys.
-What are you dressed up as?

258
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,558
I'm the Capsaicin God.

259
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,026
I'm Capsaicin

260
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,895
Did you have to invite him here
when we're in silly costumes?

261
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,365
Yeah, give us a heads-up.
This is embarrassing.

262
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,301
Let us look presentable, okay?
Look at the state of her.

263
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,104
We have a special guest, and she's a mess.

264
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,739
Come on, I'm the God of TV Shows.

265
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,308
I was taken aback when I saw the wings.

266
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,646
But when I actually saw you guys,
I realized how neat my costume was.

267
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,880
Who's your inspiration today?

268
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,449
Eros, the Greek god of love.

269
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,684
-Oh, right.
-Eros, huh?

270
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,853
-He's also known as Cupid.
-That's right.

271
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,255
-If he truly existed, he'd look like you.
-Agreed.

272
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,690
WE AGREE TOO

273
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,025
-Surely not.
-I meant it.

274
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,093
-I have a question for you, Jin.
-Ask away.

275
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,562
-How come you're here on our show?
-I'm curious too.

276
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,830
Because Screwballs…

277
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,699
-Can I be perfectly honest?
-Sure.

278
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,868
Your show's the hottest.

279
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,102
GOSH, HOW CONSIDERATE!

280
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,871
Let me hear you scream!

281
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,639
Lift up your arms! We're doing the wave!

282
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,675
-Let me hear you scream!
-Come on, the wave!

283
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,543
DNA

284
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,013
What's going on over there?

285
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,150
-We never had that move in our choreo.
-Oh, my bad.

286
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,518
I got so worked up.

287
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,886
DNA

288
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,888
Are there really no moves like this one?

289
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,058
I'm sure you're aware, but we customize
our show to any superstar guests.

290
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:32,992
Really?

291
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,060
We're like tailors.

292
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,328
If there's anything
you want to add or take away,

293
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,697
-we'll oblige.
-Really?

294
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,799
That sounds like a show
worth visiting again.

295
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,036
-While you were watching our show,
-He's so witty.

296
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,606
did any of us perhaps spark your interest?
Is there anyone you'd like to know better?

297
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,377
-I've worked with Jin-kyung before.
-I see.

298
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,846
ME?

299
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,216
Even then, I was puzzled
because I couldn't understand her.

300
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,551
In a good way.

301
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,919
-Look at her.
-It's a compliment.

302
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,487
-Jin-kyung.
-Let him finish.

303
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,723
-I meant that in a compliment.
-Think positive.

304
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,459
Watching episodes of Screwballs
made me think

305
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,462
that she was wilder
than I originally thought her to be.

306
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,097
-But in a nice way, right?
-Sure.

307
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,532
Show us your beaming face
just when Jin first joined us.

308
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,467
It was a compliment.

309
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,569
-He says it's a compliment.
-But back then, Jimin…

310
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,603
I meant Jin…

311
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,871
But back then, Jimin…

312
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:19,772
JIMIN?

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,907
-I can't believe you got us mixed up.
-No!

314
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,043
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

315
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,446
-I can't believe you got us mixed up.
-No! Please, it wasn't like that.

316
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,914
-Just a second.
-Take her away.

317
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,549
-I didn't mean…
-This way, please.

318
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,884
-I meant that Jin--
-Over there.

319
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,286
-Take some time for self-reflection.
-When Life Gives You Lemons.

320
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,856
-Have you lost it?
-She's too far gone to make lemonades.

321
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,624
-She's rather forgetful.
-That can happen.

322
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,493
Hear me out. Jin visited my place,

323
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,628
and I was a nervous wreck.

324
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,929
I didn't know what to do

325
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,965
-or what to say.
-He visited your place?

326
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,234
Honestly, I was a bundle of nerves.

327
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,568
That's understandable.

328
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,204
Now that we've become friends,
could we exchange numbers?

329
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,507
-Of course.
-Really?

330
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,209
He can choose not to answer your call.
Exchanging numbers is nothing.

331
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,079
-Save her number under "Don't Answer."
-You look so scary up close.

332
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,715
We did say we should meet up for soju,

333
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,483
but I forgot to ask for your number
by mistake.

334
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,252
"By mistake"? Are you sure?

335
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,987
-Was it really just an error?
-Of course.

336
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,322
But I do tend to make mistakes a lot.

337
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,659
-Will you be making a few more today?
-I'll have to consider that.

338
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,929
I've heard enough stories about you
being a natural on variety shows,

339
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,265
but you really have no trouble
coming up with counters.

340
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,166
He's so sharp-witted.

341
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,868
-He never falters.
-He's got certain charm of his own.

342
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,204
I saw your pictures from the Gucci show.

343
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,105
YOU LOOKED AMAZING

344
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,174
-I looked breathtaking there, didn't I?
-You were so…

345
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,241
Bragging, much?

346
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,910
The photos blew my mind away.

347
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,145
-I went, "Who's that good-looking guy?"
-Hold up.

348
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,647
Are we sure this is the real Jin?

349
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,681
THE REAL JIN

350
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,982
-Are we sure?
-Of course.

351
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,518
-He's not an imposter.
-Really?

352
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,788
After your discharge from the army,

353
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:47,259
we've seen you everywhere including
streaming platforms, TV, and YouTube.

354
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,228
-You've been very active lately.
-That's true.

355
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,730
-What are your plans for the future?
-What on earth?

356
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,532
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

357
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,935
-You wrote it up for us to read.
-I'd appreciate a smoother segue.

358
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,369
-A smoother segue?
-That was off.

359
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,371
Are you that eager to wrap things up?

360
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,640
-No one's ever said that on our show.
-Seriously.

361
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,442
-I got so startled.
-What on earth, dude?

362
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,643
I saw the cue card there.

363
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,679
You shouldn't just read it
like a textbook.

364
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,614
-I thought you were saying goodbye.
-You're a veteran.

365
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,049
Seriously, you're an experienced MC.

366
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,852
You took 30 minutes to film your intro.
I spent half an hour over there.

367
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,355
-Let's keep it natural, please.
-You know the drill.

368
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,923
Let's return to our original topic.

369
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,526
Right, Kian's Bizarre B&amp;B
is being released today.

370
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,028
-That's right.
-The day of this shoot, that is.

371
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,999
I'm releasing an album
as a solo artist, too.

372
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,133
HIS SOLO ALBUM IS IN THE WORKS

373
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
The main track's title is
"Don't Say You Love Me."

374
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,338
-"Don't Say You Love Me"?
-That's right.

375
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,373
Sorry, but "Don't Say What"?

376
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,142
I know my pronunciation isn't the best,
but that was in English.

377
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,745
Are you warning the other person
not to tell you they love you?

378
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,381
The song is about lovers
on the verge of breakup going,

379
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,816
"I'd die without you."

380
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,385
Oh, so thematically,
it's similar to Chonam Zone's songs.

381
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,553
-Dang it.
-What on earth?

382
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,255
Knock it off, okay?

383
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,490
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-Seriously, keep it down.

384
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,325
Maybe there are some similarities.

385
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,661
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T LISTENED TO THEM YET

386
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,696
Tell you what,
if our shoot is to your liking…

387
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,398
What I'm leading into is this.

388
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:04,470
We've had an idea floating among us
about adding one more cast member.

389
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,171
But as Sae-ho's replacement, right?

390
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,340
Oh, as your replacement?

391
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,876
-Woo-young is right.
-For real? You'd be my replacement, then.

392
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,878
-The promise--
-Would I be paid the same amount?

393
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,914
I don't think you'd agree
to the level of my salary.

394
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,249
Naturally, you'd need to negotiate terms.

395
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,085
-Sure, I'll have to do that well.
-How much do you charge per episode?

396
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,322
Jin-kyung has some funds,
so we can lean on her for some dough.

397
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,723
You have a grand place.

398
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,125
-She sure does.
-If you sold it,

399
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,460
I'd join you as a regular.

400
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,263
Let's do that, Jin-kyung.

401
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,431
-Hey, Jin-kyung.
-Jin-kyung.

402
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,167
-Just put it up for sale.
-We could have Jin as our colleague.

403
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,803
I'll sign up right away.
I can cancel a few engagements.

404
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,172
-It's not too much for you, is it?
-Stand strong, Jin-kyung.

405
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,407
You can't back down just yet.

406
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,742
I'll list it up for now.

407
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,044
Yes, do that. We're all set.

408
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,346
Jin can join us
the moment the sale is finalized.

409
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,949
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING GOOD NEWS

410
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,851
There's a café on the grounds here.

411
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,787
-They have excellent coffee.
-The 9 Block Cafe.

412
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,123
-The crew are very grateful to Jin--
-No, he can't have!

413
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,192
He paid for 70 coffees in advance for us.

414
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,194
That's incredible.

415
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,929
We should be treating him instead.

416
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,030
Gosh, you didn't have to.

417
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,598
The credit goes to my agency.

418
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,467
-I had no knowledge of this.
-My goodness.

419
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,869
So modest, so cool.
He's feigning ignorance here.

420
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,571
Sure, I'm footing the bill.

421
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,873
I might have made a small contribution
by suggesting it,

422
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,743
but I couldn't have arranged it
without the help of my agency.

423
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,379
-Are all members of BTS like this?
-They're on another level.

424
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,380
ANOTHER LEVEL INDEED

425
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,550
Does that mean
that we can enjoy Jin's treat?

426
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,352
All the cast and crew?

427
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,687
It's really nothing.
I do this quite often.

428
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,755
Still, kudos.

429
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,857
That may be the case,
but it's the first for us.

430
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,126
If you'd like,
I could do a repeat for your next shoot.

431
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,161
Are you serious?
Gosh, you're so incredible.

432
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,032
We appreciate the kind gesture,
but if you're not joining on the shoot…

433
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,400
-Let us enjoy free drinks.
-Really?

434
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,969
-I'm taking back the offer, then.
-Just take the free drink.

435
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,905
-You and your nit-picking.
-Ride along and leave the set.

436
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,908
-Who are you to stop Jin anyway?
-I only meant we'd love to see him again.

437
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,745
-What is your problem?
-Hang on. When's our lunch break?

438
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,748
Shut it. Who cares about lunch breaks?

439
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,316
What is the matter with you?

440
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,686
Just a moment, everyone.
We have a world-class star guest today,

441
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,721
so we need a few shots
of his grand entrance.

442
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,424
-You want some insert shots? Go ahead.
-Exactly, we'll be doing just that.

443
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,527
If you have a moment, Jin,
could you do the slate?

444
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,796
-So we can use it for a transition point?
-Yeah.

445
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,099
Come on, though.
"If you have a moment," really?

446
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,834
Just a second, Director Park.

447
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,337
You're the authority figure here.
Try not to grovel, okay?

448
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,539
-You're going too far.
-I'm no different from you.

449
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,708
-I have a ton of time.
-He might be busy.

450
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,709
Three, two, one.

451
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,645
Gosh, he looks picture-perfect.

452
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,480
Standby. Cue!

453
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,482
IT'S LIKE A MASTERPIECE

454
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,285
Jin is coming our way.

455
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,687
-Here he comes.
-You can tell it's him from his lips.

456
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,725
If gods were ever born in human form,
I'm sure one would look like him.

457
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,326
-I'm no model.
-How handsome.

458
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,162
-You're not one either.
-My goodness.

459
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,697
His features are beautiful.
The light looks lovely on him too.

460
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,033
-Good job.
-Thank you.

461
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,235
-I appreciated your responses.
-Did you like them?

462
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,871
-He knows he's hot.
-One more? Okay.

463
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,474
-Do we get to shoot the inserts too?
-What?

464
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,709
-I know how tired you must be.
-So it's for our sakes?

465
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,178
But I'm not tired at all.

466
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,547
How would he know if we're tired or not?
I'm wide awake.

467
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,949
I'm doing great, in fact.

468
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,051
-"I know how tired you must be"?
-Excuse me.

469
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,554
Do you usually shoot people so up close?

470
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,621
What's going on here?

471
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,658
-He always rushes us.
-What on earth are you doing?

472
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,359
What's going on here? Seriously.

473
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,499
Jin, do you mind walking
at 60% of your pace earlier?

474
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,468
-Got it.
-Take it a bit more slowly.

475
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,837
This looks like a shot
from a drama series.

476
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,072
-Is this the camera you use for us?
-That's how it looks.

477
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,942
-Have you always used this camera?
-That looks unfamiliar.

478
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,845
-Is it a bigger battery?
-Why does the picture look different?

479
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,180
Standby. Cue!

480
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,351
-Just standing there…
-It's like a shot from a drama series.

481
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,920
-Why do we never get a shot like this?
-He has great proportions.

482
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,256
-You can say that again.
-He looks amazing.

483
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,559
-Director Park always asks us to run.
-Why is life so unfair?

484
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,827
How is his face so small?

485
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,396
-We're always told to run to save time.
-Life is unfair, truly.

486
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,536
HELLO, HANDSOME

487
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,537
-Nice.
-Thanks.

488
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,139
-Great job.
-You're on another level.

489
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,607
-Who's next?
-No, that's it.

490
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,475
It was awkward to do that
before professional models.

491
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,710
Turns out I never was one.

492
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,245
-What on earth?
-The slate, please.

493
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,046
Three, two, one.

494
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,749
-Dear God.
-While they're both Asians…

495
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,818
YOU CAN GUESS THE REST, RIGHT?

496
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,854
To celebrate Jin joining us
as a special guest,

497
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,257
we brought what precious souvenirs
we had at our office.

498
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,525
Is that right?

499
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,560
-Thank you.
-We brought all we could.

500
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,096
Wait, what is that?
Isn't that Netflix merchandise?

501
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,300
-We made special preparations.
-What are those?

502
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,169
-Really?
-I'd love to have the towel set.

503
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,570
Those are the gifts for today.

504
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,707
As you can see, the towels are color-coded
for each day of the week.

505
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,042
-How cool is that?
-I dig it.

506
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,410
The towel set is so cute.

507
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,245
What's the best item on your list?

508
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,914
We have an Apple Watch.

509
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,016
WE DIDN'T HOLD BACK TODAY

510
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,184
Really?

511
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,985
Hold on. Is it really a smartwatch?

512
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,287
Of course.

513
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,889
We wouldn't have crafted a watch
with an apple, would we?

514
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,892
Wait, here's what I think.
Seeing how they piled them together,

515
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,994
they're going to remove an item
one by one.

516
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,830
Oh, no. We would never play tricks
when we have Jin joining us.

517
00:19:58,897 --> 00:19:59,965
This is such a lovely show.

518
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,001
I'll tell my guys to make an appearance
after their discharge.

519
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:03,902
Applause, everyone!

520
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,839
YOUR COMMENT JUST NOW…

521
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,808
WE'RE SAVING THIS CLIP AS PROOF

522
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,211
Applause, everyone!

523
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,746
NEXT TO FINISH THEIR MILITARY DUTY
ARE RM, JIMIN, AND V…

524
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,684
Let's save that clip
and use it in all our previews.

525
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,086
-I can't exactly force them.
-Of course not.

526
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,722
-It's for them to decide.
-But I can make recommendations.

527
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,391
I'll tell them that there's
this amazing show called Screwballs

528
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,894
where the crew offers
very expensive gifts.

529
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,964
We're excellent hosts, if nothing else.

530
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,268
Let's get the party of the gods in
full swing. This is Along with the Gods.

531
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,272
Now, Jin-kyung.
Jin told us the title of his main track--

532
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,473
Just a second.

533
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,509
PADDING OVER

534
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,111
-Don't, okay?
-Don't do what?

535
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,547
-Just don't do it.
-I don't get it.

536
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,949
Can she say that to our showrunner,
"Do you have a death wish?"

537
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,484
JUST A FRIENDLY CONVO

538
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,520
I think she said,
"Are you such a daredevil?"

539
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,290
-That's what I heard too.
-I never said such a thing.

540
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,892
-When Life Gives You Threats.
-We were only fooling around.

541
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,394
She sure can swear like a sailor.

542
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,463
I noticed that
when we shot Run Jin together.

543
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,431
WHAT, ME?

544
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,566
Hey, Jin!

545
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,800
I PROMISE TO DO BETTER

546
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,002
That was a joke.

547
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:14,273
Jin shared the title of the main track
on his upcoming solo album earlier.

548
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,141
It's "Don't Say You Love Me."

549
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,244
That gave us the inspiration
for the first game of the day.

550
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,179
It's called Don't Say.

551
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,282
-"Don't Say"?
-We're not to talk, then.

552
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,716
The name speaks for itself.

553
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,352
-Certain keywords will be off-limits.
-Okay.

554
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,789
-You'll each be given a headband.
-It won't be easy.

555
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,126
The signboard on it will show

556
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,129
one restricted phrase
and one restricted action.

557
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,297
Actions too?

558
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,234
The person who made the least violations

559
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,803
-will be the winner.
-Do they get the prize?

560
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,273
-The winner can take one from the pile.
-So they can only choose one?

561
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,108
Are there any penalties
for whoever places last?

562
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,177
There is indeed a penalty.

563
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,079
It's something of a variety show staple.

564
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,648
-The loser gets a finger flick.
-A finger flick?

565
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,251
-But if Jin places last…
-I don't want to hurt him.

566
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,485
Oh, no. It's all right.

567
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,588
Jonathan once gave me a headlock,
making my tongue stick out.

568
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,923
-Really?
-You bet.

569
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,159
That must be why he's rarely on TV lately.

570
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,193
SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

571
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,630
-I haven't seen him around lately.
-That explains his recent absence.

572
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,366
-I finally get it.
-That's what must've happened.

573
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,935
But these days,
the fans don't get so upset

574
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,304
even if I get pushed around a bit
on variety shows.

575
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,707
-Really? Then can we sort of relax…
-Could we push you around?

576
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,141
Sure, feel free to do that.

577
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,610
Hey, guys. Let's make a promise
not to tiptoe around Jin.

578
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,279
-All right.
-We're in agreement, right?

579
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,015
You won't mind us getting in your hair
as we get to know each other better?

580
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,517
-No, and you don't have to brush my pants.
-Oh, it's nothing.

581
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,952
-I noticed some dirt.
-Thanks.

582
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,354
I'd do it for Woo-young too.

583
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,689
-Don't touch me.
-What's your problem?

584
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,859
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY
THAT WE ALL BECOME GOOD FRIENDS WITH BTS

585
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:45,197
Please remove the covers
on my count of three.

586
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,232
Here goes. Three, two, one.

587
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,000
Nice and slow.

588
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,003
KEYWORD: JIN-KYUNG
ACTION: COVERING HIS MOUTH

589
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,774
KEYWORD: ANY REJECTIONS
ACTION: SHAKING HER HEAD

590
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,678
KEYWORD: THE CURSE "IC"
ACTION: POINTING A FINGER

591
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,415
KEYWORD: BRO / BROTHER
ACTION: SPREADING OUT BOTH ARMS

592
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,816
-Nice and slow.
-Okay.

593
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,152
KEYWORD: BUNGEE (JUMP)
ACTION: HOLDING UP BOTH ARMS

594
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,289
KEYWORD: YES
ACTION: NODDING HIS HEAD

595
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:13,992
This won't be easy.

596
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,395
Give me those covers.
I'll take care of them. Go on.

597
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,096
-It looks so simple.
-Let me take them.

598
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,068
-You're such a gentleman, bro.
-It was nothing.

599
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,672
Gosh, it finally dawned on me.
Jin is wearing wings today.

600
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,275
His and mine give off
completely different vibes, right?

601
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,411
-Doesn't he wear it better?
-They are of different sizes.

602
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,646
-He has long arms and a fine proportion.
-Go on.

603
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,882
-Compare your reach.
-I bet his is much longer.

604
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,918
COMPARE OUR REACH, ALL OUT OF THE BLUE?

605
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,686
-Compare your reach.
-I bet his is much longer.

606
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,188
-Let's see.
-Raise your arms like this.

607
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,624
-He has such long arms.
-Can you stand up for a second?

608
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,592
-Then…
-His arms are as long as Woo-jae's.

609
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,228
Why don't you hold up your arms too?
Let's see how far they go.

610
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,596
HOLD UP OUT ARMS?

611
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,631
+1 VIOLATION

612
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,366
Wait, that's not right.

613
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,535
We should hold them like this
to prepare their length.

614
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,337
-My arms aren't on the short side.
-I wanted to compare your heights too.

615
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,072
I wanted to compare your heights too.

616
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,874
+1 VIOLATION

617
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,277
-You'd tower over any of us.
-See? Notice the difference?

618
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,778
HE TENDS TO DO AS HE IS TOLD

619
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,046
Why don't you try it, Sook?

620
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,381
-Try what?
-Go ahead.

621
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,348
I'm just…

622
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,517
-Why don't you try it, Jin-kyung?
-Go on.

623
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,618
What about you?

624
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,554
THE WHOLE GROUP JOINS IN
TO KEEP SAE-HO IN THE DARK

625
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,122
Woo-jae sure has the longest reach.

626
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,991
But you're so tall, bro.
How tall are you exactly, bro?

627
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,694
You want to know my height?
I'm 188 cm tall.

628
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,296
You're 188 cm tall? My goodness.

629
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,699
BARELY HOLDS IT IN
AS JIN MAKES 2 VIOLATIONS

630
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,968
Okay. Hey, Jin-kyung.

631
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,471
Why don't you play
a one-on-one game with Jin?

632
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,873
I'd love to see you two play a game.

633
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,408
-How about Look This Way?
-Look This Way?

634
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,909
Okay.

635
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,812
Here's a suggestion.
Let's not do this motion as we play it.

636
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,348
-How else do we play it?
-Look this way.

637
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,416
SPREAD OUT YOUR ARMS

638
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,684
Look this way.

639
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,952
SNORTS OUT A LAUGH

640
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,155
I'll take the first turn, Jin-kyung.
Look this way.

641
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,456
COME ON

642
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,492
I'M SPREADING OUT MY ARMS!

643
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,427
Come on, focus on our game!

644
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,496
SHE MAY AS WELL TELL HIM
HIS FORBIDDEN ACTION

645
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,398
After the day's shoot ends,

646
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,503
-we're bound to have the losing player.
-And?

647
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,271
Let's pick a penalty for that person.

648
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,508
-But Director Park laid out one.
-No, forget about that.

649
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,775
We need something proper.

650
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,210
Like what?

651
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,745
You know, the thing Jin-kyung did.

652
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,547
THE THING THAT JIN-KYUNG WOULD OBJECT TO

653
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,782
-All right.
-Me?

654
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,351
It's bungee jumping.

655
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,653
-All right. It's bungee jumping.
-Me?

656
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,922
-That's it. How about it?
-Bungee jumping.

657
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,957
-That's it. How about it?
-There's a platform nearby.

658
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,360
-You want us to bungee?
-Yeah, bungee.

659
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,262
There's a bungee jumping site close by.

660
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,131
-That came out of nowhere.
-How's bungee jumping?

661
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,032
Let's bungee.

662
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,467
YOU HATE THE IDEA, RIGHT?

663
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,468
Bungee?

664
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,436
All right. Let's go!

665
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,938
YOU'RE GOING ALONG WITH THIS?

666
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,139
+1 VIOLATION

667
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,441
-All right. Let's go!
-We're doing what now?

668
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,943
Guys, just a second.

669
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,113
-You're bungeeing if you place last, Jin.
-How does that sound?

670
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,514
I just can't do that.

671
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,650
Can you do it, bro? Have you tried it?

672
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,151
Well, the bungee jumping…

673
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,287
Let me give you a simulation.

674
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,123
You hold up your arms like this
and jump from the platform.

675
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,793
THE RED IMP TRIES TO SET UP JIN,
NOT REALIZING HE IS BEING PUNKED

676
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,228
HE'S ONE DEVIOUS HYENA

677
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,130
Let's do a quick role-play.

678
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,767
-Play the part of the instructor.
-Okay.

679
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,868
Give me the countdown.

680
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,537
All right. Three, two, one. Bungee!

681
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,039
ALL IT TOOK WAS A SMALL BAIT

682
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,274
TO GET HIM TO SAY HIS KEYWORD NON-STOP

683
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,577
-One more time.
-Three, two, one. Bungee!

684
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,679
-I missed the beat. One more time.
-Hey, focus.

685
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,647
Three, two, one. Bungee!

686
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,583
Do I jump like this?

687
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,817
One more time.

688
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,452
-Why are we even discussing this?
-Come on.

689
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,588
Let's do it. Three, two, one. Bungee!

690
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,490
-Have you tried bungeeing?
-Yes, I love it, actually.

691
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,225
How many times have you bungeed?

692
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,561
More than 10,000 times, I think.

693
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,598
I meant it.
Whenever I got bored, I'd go try it.

694
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,033
LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE BUNGEEING TODAY TOO

695
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,802
You must really enjoy bungeeing.

696
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,971
Sure, I'm a huge fan. Have you tried it?

697
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,306
I did try it once,
but I teared up on my way down.

698
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,374
-Really?
-Sure.

699
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,743
So are we all set
on having the losing person jump?

700
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,079
-Shall we, then?
-But it's so terrifying.

701
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,581
In that case, let's have a casual game.

702
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,782
-A casual one?
-That's right.

703
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,518
We'll take turns to ask questions.

704
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,121
The person asked
must answer either yes or no.

705
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,522
For instance, "Do you know BTS?"

706
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,026
How's this instead of speaking out loud?

707
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,528
Let's do something else
to make the game a silent one.

708
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:14,466
THE ICE GOD IS TRYING TO TRICK
TWO FELLOW GODS WITH ONE GAME

709
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,468
IN THAT CASE…

710
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,572
Okay, then we'll cover our mouths
since we're not to speak out loud.

711
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,107
Cover them up.

712
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,044
-Shall we start the game like this?
-Yes, cover it up.

713
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,379
Hold your hand like this.

714
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,813
+1 VIOLATION

715
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,750
-Don't show it.
-Okay.

716
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,120
-But we're allowed to ask a question?
-Speak only then. Stay silent otherwise.

717
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,088
Nod if you agree
and shake your head if not.

718
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,156
Yes, that's it.

719
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,758
HEH-HEH

720
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,026
+1 VIOLATION

721
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,694
Here goes.

722
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,295
+1 VIOLATION

723
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,530
COVER UP YOUR MOUTH TO GET READY

724
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:46,865
+1 VIOLATION

725
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,566
-Who asks the question?
-Who goes first?

726
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,801
OH, SNAP

727
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,103
Who's going to ask
if we all have to cover our mouths?

728
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,406
At least one of us should not cover it up.

729
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,306
And who's it to be?

730
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,708
Why don't you kick us off?

731
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,276
Does he have to cover his mouth
as he asks?

732
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,047
-Why don't we all move in that direction?
-Okay, that's a good call.

733
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,816
It seems Jin is the only one
with a clear head.

734
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,151
Why don't you come to the center?

735
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,886
Can I do that? Thank you.

736
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,321
Ready, go.

737
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,623
+1 VIOLATION

738
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,591
This is a multi-player game, okay?

739
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,694
-Goodness!
-Gosh, the wind.

740
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,462
I didn't take a peep.

741
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,497
-I doubt it.
-I swear I didn't.

742
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,166
I have a question for Woo-young.

743
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,903
-Don't speak out loud.
-Did you tell the truth about not looking?

744
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,271
If you didn't see it, do this.

745
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,173
If you did see it, do this.

746
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,808
LET ME THINK

747
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,009
Yes.

748
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,210
+2 VIOLATIONS

749
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,146
You're not supposed to speak.

750
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,548
You either nod or shake your head.

751
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,317
Did you look at it or not? Go on.

752
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,153
Did you see your signboard?

753
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,188
No.

754
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,557
-Nod or shake your head.
-Why aren't you getting this?

755
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,459
-Jin-kyung.
-Let's continue, nice and neat.

756
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,728
You adore me, don't you?

757
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,363
KEYWORD: ANY REJECTIONS

758
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,398
Woo-young.

759
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:54,966
Yes?

760
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,868
-Woo-young.
-Can't you tell me you adore me?

761
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,969
Woo-young.

762
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,938
-Woo-young.
-Can't you tell me you adore me?

763
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,072
GO ON, REJECT IT

764
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:01,973
Woo-young.

765
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,241
ANSWER MY QUESTION

766
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,309
Yeah?

767
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,511
-Woo-young.
-Just tell me you like me.

768
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,580
You're not listening to each other at all.

769
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,548
Tell me you like me.

770
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,650
-Woo-young.
-At least admit you liked me.

771
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,652
-Please tell me you like me.
-Woo-young.

772
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,321
Just kiss already.

773
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,857
So you know our history?

774
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,826
-We're a married pair on the show.
-Really?

775
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,429
-We didn't get a divorce yet.
-Please tell me you cherish me.

776
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,697
I'll do that if you answer.

777
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,465
WHAT ARE YOU, A KID?

778
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,967
DO BETTER, WE HAVE A WORLD-CLASS GUEST

779
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,535
Let's play a game!

780
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,338
-Have you heard about the new 369 Game?
-How does it go?

781
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,574
You're supposed to say numbers out loud
and clap on multiples of three, right?

782
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,245
But in the updated version, you cover
your mouth for non-multiples of three.

783
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,579
LOOK CLOSELY, WOO-JAE

784
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,480
That counts as two.

785
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,949
The next person says, "Three!"
And we go back to mouth-covering.

786
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,850
For five…

787
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,786
DO THIS AS MANY TIMES AS THE NUMBER
EXCEPT FOR MULTIPLES OF 3

788
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,021
Let's say we reach 30.
Do we have to do that 30 times?

789
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,157
Here's an idea for multiples of five.

790
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,992
-Okay.
-We'll do this.

791
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,827
-For multiples of six…
-I have a suggestion.

792
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,362
-Okay.
-No, take a look at mine.

793
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,730
We'll do this for multiples of five

794
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,899
-and this for multiples of six.
-Just a minute.

795
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,801
You made it too complicated
with so many rules.

796
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,137
Let's do this for multiples of seven.
This is what we'll do.

797
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,006
Let's do this for multiples of eight.

798
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,974
THE INTENTS ARE MORE THAN BLATANT

799
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,709
Let's try the game
without additional rules.

800
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,611
My nephew taught me this.
They play this at school.

801
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,915
For three, say the number out loud.
For four, do this.

802
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,383
-I got it.
-Really? Let's try it, then.

803
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,151
-Do we scream for all other numbers?
-Yes.

804
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,085
Let's roll.

805
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,454
Three.

806
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,825
Dang, I lost.

807
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,927
TOO BAD

808
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,361
What the… Get on playing.

809
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,663
That wasn't funny.

810
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,531
-But I already lost.
-Go on so Jin-kyung can play.

811
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,500
Come on, don't hang my nephew out to dry.

812
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,368
THAT WOULD BE VERY ILL-MANNERED OF US

813
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,071
Jin-kyung, do you like me?

814
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,206
Woo-young.

815
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,774
Others would play mind games,

816
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,176
but you guys do whatever
that comes to mind.

817
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,212
Wait, is Sae-ho older than you?

818
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,513
Of course, Jin-kyung.

819
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,248
He can't be younger than Jin, can he?

820
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,351
Jin was born on December 4th, 1994.

821
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,786
Gosh, you got it wrong.

822
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,454
Really? But I can't be wrong.

823
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,956
I mean, I was born in 1992.

824
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,190
Oh, in 1992.

825
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,393
Are all other members of BTS
younger than you, Jin?

826
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,095
Yes, I'm the eldest brother, so to speak.

827
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,897
Do they always call you "bro"?

828
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,533
Well, I guess they do call me "bro."

829
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,134
You can use the same title to her.

830
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,536
Oh, really?

831
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,904
-Me too.
-Call me "bro."

832
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,873
-You want me to call you "bro"?
-Yes.

833
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,274
You can add my name if you'd like.

834
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,209
Can you call me "bro" too?

835
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,310
Bro.

836
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,278
He's so polite.

837
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,412
Gosh, I love it.

838
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,781
Can you call me "bro" too?

839
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,884
DOUBTFUL

840
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,919
-Go on. Try it.
-What's wrong?

841
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,955
You go ahead and say it to me first.

842
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:31,990
Jin-kyung, bro.

843
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,959
That's no biggie. Go ahead and do it.

844
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,262
If you won't do anything,
why bother with the games?

845
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,763
-He's right!
-It's just that

846
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,732
I'd love to get that Apple Watch.

847
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,001
-Let's play the Times Table Game.
-Okay.

848
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,970
Here's another neat game
my nephew taught me.

849
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,572
-Nephew again?
-I'm not making it up.

850
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,374
Just how old is he?

851
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,910
He's ten ears old.
I mean, he's ten years old.

852
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,578
-Ten what?
-He's ten years old.

853
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,047
Ten-year-olds don't play the 369 Game.

854
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,183
I hear kids these days
use English for their games.

855
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,419
It's called, "Don't You Say Korean."

856
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,855
-You can't speak Korean. Just English.
-Okay, got it.

857
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,258
Let's start with you. Point a finger
at the person you want to go next.

858
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:11,229
If your question is, "Seven times three,"
they should go, "I see. Twenty-one."

859
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,565
SOOK'S KEYWORD "IC"
IS DISGUISED AS "I SEE"

860
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,501
Seven times seven.

861
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,103
I see. Forty-nine.

862
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,238
There we go.

863
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,206
One, two, three, four.

864
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,009
Sook, three times four.

865
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,412
I see. Twelve.

866
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,614
HEH-HEH

867
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,749
Good job. Go on.

868
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:32,951
+1 VIOLATION

869
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,453
Jin-kyung, nine times seven.

870
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,089
I see. Sixty-three.

871
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,224
You're so smart, Jin-kyung.

872
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,126
-Call me "bro."
-Right, my bad.

873
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,227
Try it again.

874
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,829
I'm sorry. I apologize.

875
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,764
Let's resume the game.

876
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,533
One, two, three, four. Go on!

877
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,202
-Sook.
-Again?

878
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,704
Four times five.

879
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,405
I see. Twenty.

880
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,107
Man, you're good at this.

881
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,476
-One, two, three, four.
-Hurry it up.

882
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,144
Jin, seven times seven.

883
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,946
I see. Forty-nine.

884
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,948
One, two, three four.

885
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,118
Don't act all cutesy.
You're getting on my nerves.

886
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,754
Hurry it up, okay?
You're supposed to dance, actually.

887
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,656
We should all be dancing.

888
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,890
-One, two, three--
-Sae-ho.

889
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,459
-Yeah?
-Nine times seven.

890
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,561
I see. Sixty-three.

891
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,297
One, two, three four. Sook, two times two.

892
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,298
I see.

893
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,866
LOL

894
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,602
Woo-jae, eight times eight.

895
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,738
One, two, three, four.

896
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,474
YOUNGSTERS ARE DELIGHTED BY THE JACKPOT

897
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,843
-Sook.
-Come on, not again.

898
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,711
Let me think. Nine times nine.

899
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,847
THE KIND-HEARTED ELDEST MEMBER
DOES HER BEST

900
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,382
I see.

901
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,649
-Jin.
-Yeah?

902
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,851
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS

903
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,386
-Seven times…
-Seven?

904
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,387
two.

905
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,556
-Let's do jumping jacks while we're at it.
-You, Seok-jin.

906
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,191
Let's add jumping jacks to the game.

907
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,626
Let's go. Come on.

908
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,662
LET'S DO THIS

909
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,031
I'M GOING TO POINT AT YOU

910
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,399
I'M GOING TO MOVE MY ARMS

911
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,800
I'LL DO MY BEST TO KEEP UP

912
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,702
THERE'S NO WAY I'M FALLING FOR THAT

913
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,171
Someone's not getting on with the program.

914
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,839
I'M GOING TO BE SO OBVIOUS

915
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,076
I'm afraid the jumping jacks
might make my headband slip.

916
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,912
Why don't we hold on to the headband
and dance like this?

917
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,514
-I see, you see
-I see, you see

918
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,382
SHE ENDS UP SABOTAGING HERSELF

919
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,819
-I see, you see
-Like this?

920
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,987
I see, you see

921
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,455
-Like this?
-What's gotten into you?

922
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,193
VIOLATIONS KEEP PILING ON
EVEN WITHOUT THE CREW'S DIRECTION

923
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,496
WE'LL SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW

924
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,298
Wait, let's try this.

925
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,467
-I see, you see
-Just a second.

926
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,502
-I see, you see
-Let's do this instead.

927
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,972
We'll each make a signature move.
Let's take turns to introduce it.

928
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,541
What's your move, Jin-kyung?

929
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,209
-Me? I guess…
-One, two, three, four.

930
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,745
I see, you see

931
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,813
-That's me.
-Here's mine.

932
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,582
WHO'D FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS NOW?

933
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,917
I see, you see

934
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,586
DEAR ARMY ACROSS THE GLOBE,
WE REALIZE OUR CAST MAY SEEM DIM

935
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,022
You could sprain your neck that way.

936
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,257
That's why I suggest this instead.

937
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:58,196
PLEASE BE PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING

938
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,231
I see… Darn it.

939
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,933
Here's my signature move.

940
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,203
THE ULTIMATE VERSION

941
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,604
-I like the idea.
-I see, you see

942
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,705
-What's going on?
-What?

943
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,273
You added so many moves.

944
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,341
IS THIS A BTS DANCE?

945
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,010
It's too complicated.

946
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,114
I've never seen anything like it.

947
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,349
Here's what I'd like.

948
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,985
I see, you see

949
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,454
You need to point at the next person.
I see, you see

950
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,089
That's not for me, personally.

951
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,924
-Why?
-The moves are too feminine.

952
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,593
BELATED FOREBODING WASHES OVER SOOK

953
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,328
-It was too much.
-How's this?

954
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,230
I see, you see

955
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,565
-I dig the move.
-I'll take a pass.

956
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,766
IS THIS NOT TO YOUR LIKING?

957
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,604
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS?

958
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,540
You could point your fingers
as you play along. It's neat.

959
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,942
No, it doesn't seem that way to me.

960
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,978
I suddenly don't like playing at all.

961
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,279
How's this?

962
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,681
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS ONE?

963
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,352
For goodness' sake.
You might as well just spell it out.

964
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,053
LOL

965
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,523
Just read them out loud.

966
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,358
There's no way we'd do as you asked.

967
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,361
Don't be absurd.

968
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,662
All together!

969
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,430
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four!

970
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,968
EVERYONE IS TRYING OUT
OTHER PERSON'S FORBIDDEN ACTION

971
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,803
We could try another game.

972
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,106
It's a fun game.
Let's give it a go, one last time.

973
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,342
It's called the Swimming Game.
My nephew introduced it to me.

974
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,777
Swimming Game

975
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,345
If someone says "freestyle," we do this.

976
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,614
If the command is breaststroke,

977
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,750
we have to do this.
If you don't, you're out.

978
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,585
-Okay, I like it.
-For butterfly stroke, do this.

979
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,619
I dig it, actually.

980
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,788
-Ready, go.
-Go.

981
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,156
Swimming Game

982
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,958
-Swimming Game
-Your nephew plays weird games.

983
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,493
Freestyle!

984
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,429
-Do we have to do this as a group?
-Yeah.

985
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,598
It's your turn.
Make it fun while you're at it.

986
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,501
-Your style, bro!
-You'll then all imitate what I do.

987
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,902
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY TARGETING ME

988
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,872
-Jin can go next. Ready, go.
-Which style do you want?

989
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,207
Swimming Game

990
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,442
WHAT STYLE SHOULD I GO FOR?

991
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,377
I'm not familiar with swimming styles.

992
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,214
Freestyle, brotterfly…

993
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,548
"Brotterfly"?

994
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,550
YOU WENT TOO FAR WITH THAT ONE

995
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,153
-Brockstroke. What else is there?
-"Brotterfly."

996
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,955
-Broggy paddle.
-Hold up.

997
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,856
Those were mispronunciations,
nothing more.

998
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,858
Still, good work, Jin-kyung.
I appreciated it.

999
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,993
Let's move on.

1000
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,829
Please check your cards
on the count of three.

1001
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,464
Three, two, one.

1002
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,800
CHECKING THE KEYWORDS AND ACTIONS

1003
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,368
Oh dear. Goodness!

1004
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,869
Goodness!

1005
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,872
Never did I imagine
having "bungee" on my card.

1006
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,341
Three, two, one. Bungee!

1007
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,444
Woo-jae, Woo-young, and I
are probably neck-and-neck at the top.

1008
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,580
-I'll announce fourth place first.
-Let's hear it.

1009
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,315
-It's Jin-kyung.
-Oh, my.

1010
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,851
-Jin-kyung placed fourth?
-She's in fourth place?

1011
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,020
-She must've shaken her head a lot.
-I didn't, though.

1012
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,655
-But you did while dancing.
-She sure did.

1013
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,124
Oh, you're right!

1014
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,493
-I made quite a number of violations.
-Did I make many too?

1015
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,629
I'd say it's down to "IC" or "bungee."

1016
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,664
Really? Did I say "bungee" that often?

1017
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,032
I'll announce third place.

1018
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,534
It's Jin.

1019
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,169
-I placed third.
-Jin?

1020
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,105
-He didn't spread his arms.
-Did he only do that once?

1021
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,339
He did so way more than that.

1022
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,807
No, I didn't. I did this instead.

1023
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,844
We'll review the video.
I think that's in order.

1024
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,713
An ARMY member tallied it up,
so the result may be compromised.

1025
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,382
Who is it?

1026
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,283
WE KEPT IT FAIR

1027
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,885
-Let's see. He has such long arms.
-Raise your arms like this.

1028
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,588
-We have a tie in first place.
-A tie in first place?

1029
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,157
They made nine mistakes each.

1030
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,726
-We have a tie?
-Congrats, Woo-jae and Woo-young.

1031
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,695
-How cool. I wish I did better.
-Brothers for life.

1032
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,366
One of you said
the forbidden keyword 15 times

1033
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,268
and did the forbidden action 14 times,

1034
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,670
making 29 violations in total.

1035
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,639
The other person said
the forbidden keyword 15 times

1036
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,775
and did the forbidden action 53 times,

1037
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,476
making 68 violations in total.

1038
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,078
Did I make so many, though?

1039
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,547
You placed last, Sook. Congratulations.

1040
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,216
-Congrats!
-I pointed at someone 58 times?

1041
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,152
-Me?
-Back when we were playing the game…

1042
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,720
We danced, remember?

1043
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,723
We don't have much time,
so let's hurry things up.

1044
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,925
-We have to give her the finger flick?
-If that's the case,

1045
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,894
-let's slap her wrist instead.
-Whatever.

1046
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,562
-I'll let Jin take the honors.
-But why?

1047
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,130
-We can do it too.
-Don't bother.

1048
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,833
I don't want to, though.
Please hear me out.

1049
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,003
My finger flick won't be fun at all
because it's neither strong nor weak.

1050
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,473
But she can pull off a double roll.

1051
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,008
-Really?
-She has it in her repertoire.

1052
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,276
Understood.

1053
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,511
When he taps your forehead, take a roll.

1054
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,713
Choose your gift first.

1055
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,348
-How are you settling it?
-Rock-Paper-Scissors?

1056
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,783
I'll let Woo-jae take the prize.

1057
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,118
How come?

1058
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,287
Do Rock-Paper-Scissors
and yield after you've won.

1059
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,955
That'll be much better.

1060
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,123
I make my own decisions.

1061
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,192
-Come on, follow my advice.
-Just this once.

1062
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,626
What are you, a crayon?

1063
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,795
Sure, I'm the color red. Go on now.

1064
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,498
You'd look much cooler when you yield
after winning Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1065
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,100
I'm taking back my initial offer.

1066
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,968
Rock, paper, scissors!

1067
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,903
I'll take the winner's prize.

1068
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,972
JEEZ…

1069
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,508
Wow, that was so smart.

1070
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,709
WHICH ONE WILL HE CHOOSE?

1071
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,144
Leave a good one for me, Woo-young.

1072
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,879
-So?
-Pick this one.

1073
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,247
-I want this one.
-Okay.

1074
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,616
It must've been placed
in the center for a reason.

1075
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,651
-I bet it's a tumbler!
-Unwrap it.

1076
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,653
-You can do it sitting down.
-Hooray!

1077
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,621
Is it a pair of shoes?

1078
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,427
-What are those?
-A hat and a pair of socks.

1079
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,697
-Are these official Netflix merchandise?
-Of course.

1080
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,866
-How cute!
-I'm so jealous!

1081
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,101
They only give you these
when you participate in their show.

1082
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,538
Gosh, how stylish.
An idol can always pull off a look.

1083
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,974
WOBBLY

1084
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,343
I'm so jealous.
You're a lucky guy, Woo-young.

1085
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,579
-Okay, let's move on to the finger flick.
-Please do.

1086
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,349
It's been 20 years since I've tried.

1087
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,317
Step forward when you do it.

1088
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,487
-What? That's not necessary.
-Step up to her when you flick.

1089
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,823
It's not easy to land a precise hit.

1090
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,859
My flick doesn't pack a punch.

1091
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,862
DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT YOU

1092
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,765
My flick doesn't pack a punch.

1093
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,768
A LIGHT TAP

1094
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,777
THE HALF-CENTENNIAL'S
PASSIONATE PERFORMANCE FOR JIN

1095
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,746
I'm just not used to hitting people.

1096
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,449
See how devoted she is?

1097
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,185
-I never got the hang of the trick.
-I feel bad, though.

1098
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,220
Look, blood is coming out of her mouth.

1099
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,055
I can't believe you, Jin.

1100
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,391
Gosh, he gave me
the gentlest finger flick.

1101
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,059
He barely placed his finger there.

1102
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,828
CONTRARY TO HIS WORDS, HE ONLY MADE A TAP

1103
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,463
He's such a gentle soul.

1104
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,664
-Okay.
-Let's move on.

1105
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,299
I wanted to land a strong hit.

1106
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,234
My flick doesn't pack a punch.

1107
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,570
YOUR BEAUTY ALONE
IS ENOUGH TO MAKE US SMILE

1108
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,805
YOU'RE ALREADY AN AMAZING COMEDIAN

1109
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,475
A FEW HOURS LATER

1110
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,578
Here we are at the party of the gods.

1111
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,248
While this is an exclusive event
open only to the gods,

1112
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,516
-we have…
-What is it?

1113
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,953
We have received intel
that one human snuck in.

1114
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,287
I see.

1115
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,856
How amusing.

1116
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,925
We have such an impudent mortal among us?

1117
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,227
That's what the intel says.

1118
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,165
THAT MORTAL, COULD IT BE JIN?

1119
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,669
Man, it's so upsetting.

1120
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,638
-I'm so ticked off.
-What's wrong?

1121
