1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,836
The farmhand that worked hard,
take a leave.

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,270
Today's theme is

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,672
Farmhand Holiday.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,842
-That's so sweet.
-I love it.

5
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,977
CAN'T LEAVE BEAR OUT OF A HOLIDAY

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,113
BUT ALL THEY GOT WAS ONE GLASS

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,815
AND THIS GUY DRANK ALL OF IT

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,786
THE TASTE OF HOLIDAY
EVEN MADE THE LOW-TOLERANCE GUY DRUNK

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,188
Gosh. I think I'm drunk.

10
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,325
My gosh. What do we do with you?
You only had one drink.

11
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,926
Come over here, Woo-jae.

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,429
I think we're here.
The Seo's at Byeongyeong.

13
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,430
THE SECOND SPOT IN THEIR HOLIDAY

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,967
I am simply amazed at this.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,503
We're starting off
with a table full of food.

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,873
The basic side dishes include
soy sauce marinated crab and skate?

17
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,175
So this is
a typical dinner table of Jeolla-do.

18
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,611
-It's incredible.
-It's insane.

19
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,813
THE JEOLLA STYLE FEAST
LIVES UP TO ITS NAME

20
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,215
-Let me scoop out the rice.
-Sure.

21
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,184
Get it ready since it's hot pot rice.

22
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,619
Scoop it out and pour water in it.

23
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:54,988
STEAMING

24
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,957
I'll give you a piece of jeon.

25
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:58,992
Wow.

26
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,794
Can I eat this?

27
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,962
I think there's a huge misunderstanding.

28
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,931
-You can't just eat it.
-Come on.

29
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,066
Who just ate it?

30
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,700
-Not even what's stuck on it?
-No.

31
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,837
We already played the games

32
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,472
to drink beer, didn't we?

33
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,573
That's for beer.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,077
This is a signature tourist spot where
you can taste the flavors of Gangjin.

35
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,846
We're at a restaurant located
in Byeongyeong Bulgogi Street.

36
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,482
You'll find restaurants
grilling marinated meat

37
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,650
over charcoal briquettes

38
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,018
throughout the street.

39
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,220
The table's packed
with all kinds of side dishes.

40
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,622
Which one are you drawn to, Woo-young?

41
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,858
THE BIGGEST DILEMMA OF HIS LIFE

42
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,359
-Definitely this.
-Bulgogi, of course.

43
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,394
Of course, the bulgogi.

44
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,495
The two of you chose that.

45
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,796
I'm really curious

46
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,531
-about the grilled herring too.
-Yeah.

47
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,533
But we have to eat these
while they're still hot.

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,235
-Then, let me explain.
-Okay.

49
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,803
How about omitting the games?

50
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,672
This was prepared with

51
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,007
the hope that you'll understand
the ways of the world

52
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,743
and grow into someone even greater.

53
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,778
It is called

54
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,746
-Get Bigger.
-Get Bigger?

55
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,582
Do we get bigger?

56
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,885
It is shortened from
Saying Words That Get Bigger.

57
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,253
Words that get bigger?

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,555
Each person takes turns saying a word

59
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,991
that starts with a specific letter.

60
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,926
You have to say a word

61
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,796
that's physically bigger
or broader in scope than the one

62
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,197
the person before you said.

63
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,266
For example, it would be
strawberry, Korean melon,

64
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,467
cantaloupe, then watermelon?

65
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,669
-The first letter has to match.
-What?

66
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,571
The first person has to
say the smallest one.

67
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,472
That's important.

68
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,940
-The order matters too.
-Yeah.

69
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,175
Let's say it starts with M.

70
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,376
-What can I say?
-Okay.

71
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,477
M? Let's see.

72
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,612
Mieum.

73
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,046
-Mieum?
-Yes, mieum.

74
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,515
-That's very small.
-Sook.

75
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,650
Miyeok soup.

76
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,418
Museum.

77
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,753
-Museum. Good.
-Yeah.

78
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,322
At that point, all I have left is Myanmar.

79
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,358
-It's okay.
-You have America.

80
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,226
The mournful heart.

81
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,363
So which one is bigger,
mieum or miyeok soup?

82
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,466
And the mournful heart
is abstract so it can be controversial.

83
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,701
-If you use your art of persuasion…
-Okay.

84
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,137
-Use your art of persuasion.
-No problem.

85
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,274
If whether we accept it or not

86
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,808
becomes to close,

87
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,078
we're going to ask
ChatGPT to judge for us.

88
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,313
The paid version?

89
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,548
Of course, it's the paid one.

90
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:02,715
Then, let me ask you this.

91
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,851
If you say it's good, we get to eat?

92
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,953
If all five of you succeed in a row,

93
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,190
you may each freely eat
one bulgogi lettuce wrap.

94
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,192
If you can't give an answer,

95
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,395
we'll take away one side dish
as a penalty for being unfunny.

96
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:16,796
The game will begin.

97
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,365
-We can't say "One piece and two pieces."
-No, you can't.

98
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,300
Ready.

99
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,201
NO REPEATING COMPOUND WORDS
OF SAME CATEGORY

100
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,669
S.

101
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,337
Sour candy.

102
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,838
Sabina apple.

103
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,807
Swedish ladder.

104
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,875
Sika deer.

105
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:29,876
Sahara desert.

106
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,778
Okay!

107
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,845
-Nice.
-Wait.

108
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,047
-What was it?
-Swedish ladder.

109
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,348
-Swedish ladder.
-Sika deer.

110
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,749
Oh, Swedish ladder and sika deer.

111
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,451
Come on. The deer is way bigger.

112
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,086
How tall is the ladder?

113
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,721
-Yeah, just tell them.
-Two tiers.

114
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,122
Come on.

115
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,324
Deer are huge!

116
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,758
Is the deer a baby or an adult?

117
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,493
-It's a huge one, Sook.
-It's huge.

118
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,697
-It's insanely big.
-It's humongous.

119
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,333
-They're big!
-You know the ones in Northern Europe.

120
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,901
-Yeah.
-They're enormous.

121
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,436
-They're the size of cars.
-Yeah.

122
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,104
They're incredibly big.

123
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,374
It all depends on
how far you go in classifying them.

124
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,742
If the deer are biggest,

125
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,777
-we should--
-Since we had a good vibe,

126
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,646
-let's eat a lettuce wrap and move on.
-Yeah.

127
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,647
Sae-ho,

128
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,483
can you describe this enormous sika deer?

129
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,752
They are seriously this big.

130
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,921
-Their horns are this big!
-Yeah.

131
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,356
Their eyes are huge.

132
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,992
They eat carrots super fast. Like this.

133
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,226
They're gigantic. Lettuce?

134
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,661
CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP

135
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,296
-It eats so much.
-They sound huge.

136
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,898
ALMOST PASSING OUT LAUGHING

137
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,134
They are gigantic.

138
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,837
All right. We have asked ChatGPT.

139
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,338
I'll tell you.

140
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,741
He looks happy
so we probably got it wrong.

141
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,543
ChatGPT thought about it for nine seconds.

142
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,145
"It depends--"

143
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,880
If "it depends," then it's the deer.

144
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,348
"Typically, ladders are bigger."

145
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,683
Come on.

146
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,620
Why would you say the sika deer
after the Swedish ladder?

147
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,455
I know. If she said Swedish ladder,

148
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,557
you should have said some kind of place.

149
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,458
SNIFF

150
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,526
Just say it's wrong.

151
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,262
-Let's move on before the food gets cold.
-Geez.

152
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,330
Fail.

153
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,564
We gave it a shot.

154
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,267
I thought he would give it
to us if I described how big it is,

155
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,435
but he didn't.

156
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,736
He just made me jump through hoops.

157
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,972
Moving on to the next one.

158
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,041
NEXT LETTER

159
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,142
B.

160
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,109
B?

161
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,111
-One.
-Beetle.

162
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,681
-One. Two.
-Boulder.

163
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,282
One.

164
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,250
-Two--
-Bimbo.

165
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,252
What the heck?

166
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,788
Go ahead for now, Sae-ho.

167
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,723
-One.
-Boat.

168
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,857
-Boat?
-Boat.

169
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,225
-Woo-jae.
-Barcelona.

170
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,193
-Barcelona.
-Barcelona.

171
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,494
-Okay.
-We did it.

172
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,063
Persuade us with "bimbo."

173
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,001
Bimbos are typically between 150 cm…

174
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,769
-And 2 meters.
-…and 2 m in height.

175
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,504
Right?

176
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,673
What about a boulder?
Have you been to Seoraksan Mountain?

177
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,574
HAVE YOU BEEN TO SEORAKSAN MOUNTAIN?

178
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,875
The boulder there…

179
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,744
The rocking boulder is humongous.

180
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,979
-The rocking boulder.
-Shut up.

181
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,715
Shut up. Why are you chiming in?

182
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,916
Why are you chiming in?

183
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,050
I haven't seen it.

184
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,453
-Didn't it end when she said "boulder"?
-It's not that big.

185
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,754
It can't be that big.

186
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,023
Does she not know what a boulder is?

187
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,624
Your second attempt is a fail.

188
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:00,960
Britches.

189
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,395
-Britches.
-Why'd you say "bimbo"?

190
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,397
-A bimbo isn't a thing.
-Are you a bimbo?

191
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,365
-Britches.
-You see…

192
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,201
That depends. Is it Sae-ho's britches
or Woo-jae's britches?

193
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,936
-That's rude.
-This is hard.

194
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,838
-You're quite rude.
-Honestly…

195
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,406
Honestly, this is how far I thought.

196
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,275
I had Barcelona in mind,
but I felt like he would say it.

197
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,677
So you know what I thought?

198
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,011
Breeze.

199
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,113
WOW

200
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,848
-You're so smart.
-Stop showing off.

201
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,683
-Then, do better.
-What?

202
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,051
-I did well.
-What?

203
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:25,952
You said sika deer.

204
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,920
That was ages ago, man.

205
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:28,821
The previous round.

206
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,990
Let's move on to the third round.

207
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,458
It's hard to stick to that letter.

208
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,494
Woo-young.

209
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,096
-D.
-D?

210
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,531
One, two.

211
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,432
Deli-box.

212
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,367
One.

213
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,268
Dorado.

214
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,003
-One.
-Delftware.

215
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,172
-One.
-Doberman.

216
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,507
One, two.

217
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,008
-Do.
-Wrong!

218
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,977
-Do.
-What?

219
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,311
-Hey.
-Like Gyeongsangbuk-do.

220
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,447
You could have said "Deutsch."

221
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:55,848
Gyeongsangnam-do.

222
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,816
Do, like the region.

223
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,284
-Do.
-Yeah, that works.

224
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,552
-Oh, like that "do"?
-Do.

225
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,154
If you don't accept this,

226
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,790
you will look very petty and pathetic.

227
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,724
Yeah, he's right.

228
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,926
-No need to ask ChatGPT.
-This is a correct answer.

229
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,328
You will look knowledgeable
if you accept this answer.

230
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,363
-Success.
-Okay.

231
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,631
Just one wrap.

232
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,833
Do. Gosh, Do was a good one.

233
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,101
Good job on D.

234
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,403
Woo-jae. Actually,
we expected this from you.

235
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,971
We expected our show's name in Korean.

236
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,706
Such a shame.

237
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,475
Yeah, Woo-jae.

238
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,310
He practically gave you the answer.

239
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,978
Who do you think you are?

240
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,147
-He's our producer.
-The Korean name for our show.

241
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,883
This is going to make me look bad.

242
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,452
This one is… No.

243
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,352
BUT FIRST, LET'S EAT A WRAP

244
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,787
Gosh, this meat looks legit.

245
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,557
Once you wrap it, it's over.

246
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,791
I'll start with a small one

247
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,193
since it's the first round.

248
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,498
SHOVING IN THE "SMALL" ONE

249
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,499
WOW

250
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,768
Once you wrap it, it's over?

251
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,537
Hand me a lettuce.

252
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,538
Should I add this too?

253
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,840
I'm going to add some tofu.

254
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,677
TAKING A HUGE BITE

255
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,413
HIS CHEEKS ARE ABOUT TO BURST

256
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,248
The tofu seasoning is awesome.

257
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,316
I have to pick carefully.

258
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,784
Hand me a lettuce.

259
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,952
Should I add this too?

260
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,720
It looks so good.

261
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,555
I'm going to add some tofu.

262
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,456
Wow.

263
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,724
SHE CAREFULLY ADDS JAPCHAE ON IT

264
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,059
Gosh, this is…

265
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,994
CAREFULLY TAKING A HUGE BITE

266
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,295
The tofu seasoning is awesome.

267
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,431
YUM!

268
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,200
The aroma really
seeped into the briquette-grilled bulgogi.

269
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,935
BULGOGI IS FILLED WITH BRIQUETTE'S AROMA

270
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,440
THE DUDE SHOVES IT IN
AS IF HIS MOUTH MAY BURST

271
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,743
THE BUDDY THAT HAS A LARGE MOUTH

272
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,846
AND THE BUDDY THAT DOESN'T

273
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,682
WOW, YUMMY

274
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,817
YUM

275
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,019
The bulgogi is really good.

276
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,921
Gosh, this is insane!

277
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,290
Okay, I'm done.

278
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,528
You know, fish is also good
in lettuce wraps.

279
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,929
SHE CHOSE HERRING OVER BULGOGI

280
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,164
-You aren't eating the bulgogi?
-I wanted to try the herring.

281
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,467
How interesting.

282
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,636
But the bulgogi is so good.

283
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,603
It's really good.

284
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,640
That one bite made me hungry.

285
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,141
-On to the next round.
-Let's do this.

286
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,042
Let's do this.

287
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,044
-We'll move faster.
-Okay.

288
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,946
-Faster.
-That was so good.

289
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,614
J.

290
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,949
One, two.

291
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:10,983
Jelly sandwich.

292
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,852
-One, two--
-Jowar bowl.

293
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,920
Jowar bowl?

294
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,555
Jelly sandwich, jowar bowl.

295
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,156
FEELING THE FAILURE ALREADY

296
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,859
-Why did he say "jelly sandwich"?
-Why did you say that?

297
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,460
-Hey, Woo-young.
-Yes.

298
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:22,962
Why did you say that?

299
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,597
-What's that?
-I had nothing.

300
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,065
Just do the grain, jowar.

301
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,935
Fine, give me jo-nother one.

302
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,370
GIVE ME JO-NOTHER ONE

303
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,673
I've gotten hungrier after that one bite.

304
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,474
Moving straight to the next round.

305
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,842
NEXT ROUND

306
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,777
U.

307
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,912
-U?
-Unpasteurized milk.

308
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,348
-One, two--
-Us.

309
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,350
-One--
-Umbrella.

310
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,118
Hang on.

311
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,954
Okay, let's move on for now.

312
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,989
-One, two--
-Uzbekistan.

313
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,090
-One--
-Universe.

314
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,358
-Universe. Okay.
-Okay.

315
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,728
ANYWAY, THEY MADE IT TO THE END

316
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,097
The five of you that make up "us."

317
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,732
Wait, what did you say?

318
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,800
-Unpasteurized milk.
-Yes.

319
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,301
-I did "us."
-What did you say?

320
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,937
-Us and umbrella.
-There are very big umbrellas.

321
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,472
SHE WANTS TO HIDE BEHIND AN UMBRELLA

322
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,674
WHEN "US" FIVE GET TOGETHER,

323
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,978
THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN SCARE US

324
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,245
Screwballs!

325
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,448
-Screwballs!
-Screwballs!

326
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,950
ARE WE SMALLER THAN AN UMBRELLA?

327
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,218
Us and umbrella.

328
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,287
Let me be honest.

329
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,623
I have never thought
of the five of us as "us."

330
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,992
-We're all individuals.
-Of course.

331
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,326
Who are these people?

332
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,561
They're just strangers.

333
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,762
There's no "us."

334
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,097
-We're this small.
-It's abstract.

335
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,066
In-seok, we are this small. You got that?

336
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,401
She said "umbrella," right?

337
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,004
I have a gigantic umbrella in my car.

338
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,205
-Go get it.
-Tell my manager

339
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,173
to show them my umbrella. I'm serious.

340
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,241
It's a parasol.

341
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,676
Can you describe the umbrella?

342
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,844
Seriously.

343
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,246
Typical ones are this big.
Mine's this big.

344
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,515
-Mine's this big, so it covers everyone.
-Really?

345
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,783
Can he show you the umbrella?

346
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,652
I can't possibly explain it.

347
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,687
That deer I mentioned before?
It uses this umbrella.

348
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,823
-Ask my manager. It's huge.
-Yeah.

349
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,492
That sounds gigantic.

350
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,527
The song that talks about three umbrellas?

351
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,495
They can't walk together

352
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,331
because it's so big.
The other ones have to follow.

353
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,666
-I'll show you.
-Show him.

354
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,000
Bring the umbrella.

355
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,836
-Do you accept if we all fit under it?
-Yes, it would make sense.

356
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,138
-I'll accept that.
-Okay.

357
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,606
-Even if we gather together?
-Okay.

358
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,041
Then, let's leave this for now.

359
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,676
-Okay.
-Okay.

360
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,310
Moving on to the next round.

361
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,913
-H.
-H?

362
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,981
-One--
-Hoisin sauce.

363
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,349
Hairless cat.

364
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,084
Hedgehog.

365
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,886
-Darn it.
-Geez.

366
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:27,820
Humpback whale.

367
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,355
-Come on.
-What did she say?

368
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,823
She said "hedgehog."

369
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,491
-What's wrong with you?
-Why?

370
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,959
Let's keep going, Sae-ho.

371
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,927
Hippogriff.

372
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,896
Havana.

373
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:37,863
-Nice.
-Havana.

374
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,265
What's wrong with you?

375
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,666
Hedgehog. Fail.

376
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,634
-Did you see that?
-Why?

377
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,003
If you go to Northern Europe,
the hedgehogs are…

378
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,038
-They're humongous.
-I'm serious.

379
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,773
Their needles are this big.

380
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,042
-They're this big.
-Yeah.

381
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,343
They're huge.

382
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,546
Aren't hedgehogs bigger than cats?

383
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,947
Yeah, she's right.

384
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,348
Hedgehogs are huge.

385
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,317
-Ask ChatGPT.
-Yeah.

386
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,886
He said needles instead of spines.

387
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,154
-Ask AI.
-He said needles.

388
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,189
Let's ask AI.

389
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,725
-Yeah, let's ask.
-We have a chance.

390
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,793
SO WE ASKED CHATGPT

391
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,731
I asked, "Is there
a giant hedgehog in Northern Europe?"

392
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,798
It said no.

393
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,867
What the heck does ChatGPT know?

394
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,335
Has he seen it?

395
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,170
This is all a secret, you know.

396
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,006
Ask which one is bigger,
a cat or a hedgehog.

397
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,942
You know what? Let me tell you.

398
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,176
It's on the verge of extinction

399
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,444
so ChatGPT wouldn't know.

400
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,379
People might try to capture it.

401
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,549
"Typically, a cat is
much bigger than a hedgehog.

402
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,187
Cats are twice as long
and weigh much more than hedgehogs."

403
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,289
AT THAT MOMENT!

404
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,791
Okay.

405
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,692
SAE-HO'S UMBRELLA ARRIVED

406
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,961
-It seems like the umbrella shrunk.
-Hand it to him.

407
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:42,862
Bring it over.

408
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,530
-Is it your umbrella, Sae-ho?
-Yes.

409
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,665
-All of us have to fit under it, right?
-It's big.

410
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,967
Open it. We have a chance.

411
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,435
-We'll fit.
-It's worth a shot.

412
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,604
-I'll help you.
-It's hard to even open it.

413
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,205
-Be careful.
-It's worth a shot.

414
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,573
-It won't shoot out, will it?
-No.

415
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,075
-Like this?
-Yeah.

416
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,209
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

417
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
HE CAREFULLY OPENS IT

418
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,679
Wow.

419
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,449
-All right. Come on in.
-Let's all go under it.

420
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,550
Come on in.

421
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,753
-Come on in.
-Okay.

422
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,221
THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER IT IS BIGGER THAN "US"

423
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,090
-Come on in.
-Okay.

424
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,391
We have room to spare.

425
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,326
-There's so much room.
-There's so much room.

426
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,995
Everyone in Gangjin can fit in here.

427
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,530
-Lift it up.
-We have room to spare.

428
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,597
There's room to spare.

429
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,698
-Plenty.
-Plenty of room.

430
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,267
-We did it.
-Do you accept?

431
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,268
He has to accept.

432
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,003
The "us" seem so close right now.

433
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,571
-Accept it.
-Conversely.

434
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,641
Us? We're only this big.
The umbrella is much bigger.

435
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,042
-It's bigger than us.
-Yeah.

436
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,510
We're so tiny.

437
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,778
-Success.
-Yes!

438
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,779
PROVED UMBRELLA IS BIGGER THAN US

439
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,581
-Well done, guys.
-One wrap.

440
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,483
-Good job.
-Your umbrella is really big.

441
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,450
Good job.

442
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,919
-Let me fold it.
-It's really big.

443
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,821
-We did it.
-Go ahead and have one wrap.

444
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,322
THIS TIME, THE PICKY EATER
AIMS FOR THE MEAT ONLY

445
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,124
-Wow.
-You want one too?

446
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,293
LOOK AT MY WRAP! ISN'T IT AWESOME?

447
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,762
ROLLS UP BOTH SLEEVES

448
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,431
AND TAKES A HUGE BITE

449
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,101
HE ATE AND DRANK TOO MUCH,
NOW HE'S IN TROUBLE

450
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,204
SAE-HO DOESN'T FORGET THE KIMCHI

451
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,609
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE MARRIED

452
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,411
-I have a question.
-Yes.

453
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:06,946
The toasted rice

454
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,215
can't go in the wrap.

455
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,317
-Okay.
-Can I scoop up

456
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,886
just one spoonful of toasted rice?
Just one bite.

457
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,688
I'll let you have one bite of toasted rice

458
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,755
with the wrap.

459
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,957
ONE SPOONFUL OF TOASTED RICE WITH THE WRAP

460
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,091
SLURP

461
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,361
Gosh! The toasted rice is so good.

462
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,329
THIS MUST BE HEAVEN!

463
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:24,964
The meat is insane.

464
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,132
THE DUDE TASTES THE TOASTED RICE TOO

465
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,702
Geez. I can't believe we have to
eat such delicious food like this.

466
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,503
This is insane.

467
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,239
-Let's do another round. It's so good.
-Hurry.

468
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,440
Even if we get it wrong.

469
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,507
-Yeah.
-Even if it's wrong.

470
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,642
We'll start immediately.

471
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,244
We'll make it speedy this time.

472
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,612
Here we go.

473
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,646
N.

474
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,715
-One--
-Nobleman.

475
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,217
What? Namsan.

476
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,454
Oh, no. That was too big.

477
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,122
-One, two…
-We're in trouble.

478
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,857
Nairobi.

479
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,892
-Nice.
-Nairobi?

480
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,260
-One, two--
-Namibia.

481
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,961
Namibia. One…

482
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,230
BIGGER THAN NAIROBI

483
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,299
AND NAMIBIA?

484
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,768
Namibia.

485
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,203
One, two…

486
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,572
North America.

487
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,274
-We did it!
-Let's do it!

488
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,209
-Hang on.
-Let's check.

489
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,611
-Sae-ho, how could you say Namibia?
-Why?

490
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,413
It can't get that big all of a sudden.

491
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,115
She said Nairobi.

492
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,816
Things went wrong from here.

493
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,485
It's my fault. I said Namsan.

494
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,453
-Nobleman, Namsan…
-Namsan.

495
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,855
-…Nairobi…
-Nairobi.

496
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,390
-…Namibia…
-Namibia.

497
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,291
…and North America.

498
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,359
Wow. You overcame Nairobi?

499
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,260
Success.

500
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,296
What has gotten into us?

501
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,365
-I can't believe I said North America.
-Lettuce.

502
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
-Can we have more meat?
-Lots of lettuce.

503
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,969
North America saved me.

504
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,306
We're all very serious about the wrap.

505
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,708
Can I eat this?

506
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,810
MOUNTAIN OF MEAT?

507
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,645
Can you eat this, Woo-young?

508
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,880
Can you eat it?

509
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,383
UNLIKE HIS VERY FEEBLE FRIEND

510
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,487
THIS IS NOTHING FOR THE COOL DUDE

511
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,558
HIS FROWN TELLS THE TRUTH

512
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,293
-Gosh, the meat is so good.
-Yeah.

513
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,162
Are you getting full?

514
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,563
-Yes.
-No.

515
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,898
We hardly ate.

516
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,799
I'm so happy.

517
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,968
MAYBE SHE SWALLOWED IT
INSTEAD OF EATING IT

518
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,736
All right. Now,

519
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,505
that was enough for the Get Bigger game.
We'll move on to another one.

520
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,076
This one's called
Sneaky Show-of-Hands Vote.

521
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,945
-Sneaky Show-of-Hands Vote.
-Three or two, like that?

522
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,880
After everyone closes their eyes,

523
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,415
I will give you a topic.

524
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,318
If the topic applies to you,
you must raise your hand.

525
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,453
-Okay.
-Yes.

526
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,222
Before you raise your hands,
I'll call on someone.

527
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,725
That person must predict
how many will raise their hands

528
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,829
using their fingers
while keeping their eyes closed.

529
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,163
It's almost like telepathy.

530
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,366
And if the number matches

531
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,500
the hands raised,

532
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,302
everyone gets to eat a wrap.

533
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,436
This is what we should do.

534
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,473
THE FARMHANDS EXCHANGE A CERTAIN LOOK

535
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,875
NODDING, WHISPERING

536
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,044
GIGGLING

537
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,278
-Done. We got it sorted.
-Okay.

538
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,713
-Okay.
-Okay.

539
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,448
-It's simple. Just be honest.
-Okay.

540
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,151
-No problem. We have to come together.
-Yeah.

541
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,020
Okay. Please close your eyes.

542
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,321
Here's the topic.

543
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,522
"To be honest,

544
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,092
I have very bad breath."

545
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,994
Okay. Let's just be honest about this.

546
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,062
One moment.

547
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,998
Sook, use your fingers to tell me
how many will raise their hands.

548
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,967
SOOK PREDICTS 5 PEOPLE

549
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,968
Okay.

550
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,271
Raise your hand at the count of three.

551
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,839
One, two, three.

552
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,109
Okay.

553
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,979
THE COMEDIANS, SINGER, AND MODEL
ALL COME TOGETHER

554
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,349
TO CONFESS THAT THEY HAVE BAD BREATH?

555
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,319
A LITTLE EARLIER

556
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,387
Just raise your hand.

557
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,388
JUST RAISE YOUR HAND!

558
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,323
We'll all just raise our hands.

559
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,292
-Done. We got it sorted.
-Okay.

560
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,460
-It's simple. Just be honest.
-Okay.

561
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,062
"US" IS BIGGER THAN AN UMBRELLA RIGHT NOW

562
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,931
All right. You may have one wrap.

563
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:46,999
OKAY, SUCCESS

564
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,567
-Did you all raise your hand?
-Why?

565
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,070
-Did you all think you had bad breath?
-Yeah.

566
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,471
-My goodness.
-You know,

567
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,840
-no one's breath is as bad as mine.
-Geez.

568
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,776
-Seriously.
-We're honest.

569
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,478
-We're all honest.
-Gosh.

570
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,547
Gosh, we're so bad.

571
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,948
How are we so in sync?

572
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,451
Where's the camera?

573
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,820
-Gosh.
-The cameras are everywhere, right?

574
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,456
-I feel bad.
-I feel so bad.

575
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,324
Sorry.

576
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,826
It's just a game.

577
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:14,860
Yeah, but…

578
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,928
THE GAME WENT WRONG FROM THE FIRST ROUND

579
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,329
I do feel bad.

580
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,897
-No, it's okay.
-Is it okay?

581
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,499
THE WRAP THEY WON BY THROWING AWAY

582
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,301
THEIR IMAGE, CONSCIENCE,
DIGNITY, AND STATUS

583
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,672
SO THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE, IS IT?

584
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,341
Okay. Please close your eyes.

585
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,509
Here's the topic.

586
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,211
"The written apology

587
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,080
that I wrote to the public recently
is a lie."

588
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,649
Woo-jae.

589
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,719
"Currently, I'm on
an overseas business trip."

590
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,124
TEARS SHED IN AN APOLOGY FOR PAST WRONGS

591
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,260
-"I deeply regret this late apology."
-You can't use her real apology.

592
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,362
I would like to apologize once again.

593
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,396
JIN-KYUNG TRULY REPENTED

594
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,134
"The written apology that I wrote
to the public recently is a lie."

595
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,735
THE PRODUCTION TEAM'S BOLD MOVE

596
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,904
Woo-jae, show us with your fingers.

597
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,307
HE IS ALSO IN DILEMMA

598
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,644
WOO-JAE FINISHED DECIDING HOW MANY

599
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,412
One, two, three.

600
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,248
AS PROMISED

601
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,116
THE FOUR FARMHANDS
RAISE THEIR HANDS UP HIGH

602
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,386
BUT ONE FARMHAND WILL NOT BUDGE

603
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,287
Success.

604
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,288
Why?

605
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,489
I used my brain.

606
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,091
-Why?
-You know…

607
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,759
-What is it?
-I knew everyone would do it,

608
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,862
except for one person.
I thought this person

609
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,697
couldn't bear raising her hand.

610
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,167
-So I did this.
-Really?

611
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,135
-Good, Woo-jae.
-Who didn't do it?

612
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,570
-I didn't.
-Jin-kyung, of course.

613
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,238
-How can I do it?
-How could she?

614
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,173
Woo-jae did well.

615
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,342
Do you want me to be destroyed
just for one bite of this food?

616
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,345
What did you write on your apology?

617
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,446
-The red outfit.
-"Hello."

618
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,881
"Currently, I'm on
an overseas business trip."

619
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,650
HE PRACTICALLY MEMORIZED IT

620
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,985
-I should've chosen Sae-ho instead.
-Woo-jae.

621
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,122
I picked the one that's too smart.

622
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
What? I would have
raised four fingers too.

623
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,659
You didn't even understand it.

624
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,660
No, I didn't.

625
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,861
I was going to do five.

626
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,196
THEY WOULD HAVE FAILED IF HE CHOSE SAE-HO

627
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,798
I think we're eating
more than usual at this rate.

628
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,133
THANKS TO THE SHARP FARMHAND
THEY EAT 2 WRAPS IN A ROW

629
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,367
It's good when it's hot.

630
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,805
THE WRAP THEY WON WITH SCHEMES AND TRICKS

631
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,373
Woo-jae did a really good job.

632
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,075
Woo-jae was really smart.

633
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,176
THE FARMHANDS ARE NO PUSHOVERS

634
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,012
-We got this!
-We got this!

635
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,948
-I'm ready.
-Here we go.

636
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,551
"I am so happy to be in Gangjin

637
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,153
and I love Gangjin so much

638
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,388
that I want to pay for the food
at this restaurant."

639
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,624
Darn it.

640
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,793
Sae-ho, show us with your fingers.

641
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,127
AIMING FOR THE DIM-WITTED FARMHAND

642
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,230
Raise your hand at the count of three.

643
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,699
One, two, three.

644
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,937
SILENT

645
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,205
Lower your hands.

646
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,940
Open your eyes.

647
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,811
The three men will be paying
for the food today.

648
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,813
Thank you very much.

649
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,416
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

650
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,751
-You didn't raise your hand?
-No.

651
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,586
They didn't raise their hands?

652
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,923
To be honest, I don't know
about these games,

653
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,291
but we did save some money.

654
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,892
-Good.
-What I don't get--

655
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,694
That isn't an issue but--

656
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
It isn't an issue.

657
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,098
-What's up with you two?
-What's up?

658
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,799
Do you not love Gangjin that much?

659
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,068
You don't love Gangjin?

660
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,503
-I do.
-I love it but…

661
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,738
Wait. No.

662
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,972
What's up, Jin-kyung?

663
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,942
No, I do love Gangjin,

664
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,745
but I love my wallet more.

665
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,079
She wants you to pay.

666
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,683
This is what surprised me.

667
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,419
All we needed to do
was for the five of us to come together.

668
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,354
HE CANNOT DESCRIBE THE FEELING OF BETRAYAL

669
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,857
I didn't think
you could do this to us, Sook.

670
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:32,891
But I am…

671
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,726
-I am so shocked.
-Then…

672
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,927
I love it so much.

673
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,329
Let's try one more time.

674
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,431
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

675
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,133
-Let's keep it clean.
-Yeah.

676
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,434
Let's just not scheme.

677
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,003
"This isn't a lie.

678
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,906
I am really dating someone right now."

679
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,543
Tell us with your fingers, Woo-young.
How many will do it?

680
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,644
-Currently dating?
-Yes.

681
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,547
Hang on. Close your eyes, Jin-kyung.

682
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,715
Really?

683
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,251
Did she just say "Really?"

684
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,752
Show us, Woo-young.

685
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,621
WOO-YOUNG PREDICTS 1 PERSON

686
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,856
Okay, please close your eyes.

687
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,558
Raise your hand at the count of three.

688
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,093
-One, two, three.
-Gosh.

689
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,129
THE PENDING MEMBER OF MATCHMAKING SERVICE
DOESN'T MOVE A MUSCLE

690
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,798
THE NEW GROOM HOLDS STILL

691
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,200
WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT,
WOO-JAE DOESN'T MOVE

692
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,568
Is this possible?

693
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,470
Did he get it?

694
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,738
You got it.

695
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,907
-What?
-How many did you predict?

696
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,342
One person.

697
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,643
You were the only one.

698
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,946
Are you seeing somebody?

699
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,980
I was so surprised.

700
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,148
SOOK IS DATING SOMEONE

701
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,049
Only one person?

702
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,051
SO WHO IS THIS MYSTERY GUY?

703
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,786
-I was just--
-Weren't we all supposed to

704
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,755
-raise our hands?
-I predicted Sae-ho.

705
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,691
Since he got married,
I figured it would be like dating.

706
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,226
But you raised your hand, Sook!

707
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,294
Awesome.

708
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,062
I was so surprised about that.

709
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,297
Sook,

710
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,331
are you seeing someone?

711
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,067
-First of all, have a wrap.
-Okay.

712
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,369
Congratulations, Sook.

713
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,436
CONGRATULATIONS, SOOK

714
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,605
The most important thing is
that we get to eat a wrap.

715
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,207
This is awesome. I was so surprised.

716
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,910
I thought everyone was
going to raise their hands.

717
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,647
Except Sae-ho, I thought
everyone would do it.

718
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,349
I thought only Sae-ho would be dating.

719
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,753
Let's not plan beforehand.

720
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,187
-Okay.
-Let's do it for real.

721
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,088
Individual match?

722
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,457
-We'll switch to an individual match.
-Yeah.

723
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,860
When Woo-young indicates with his fingers,

724
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,194
only Woo-young gets to eat

725
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,262
-if he gets it right.
-Okay.

726
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,564
-Just answer honestly.
-Okay, let's go.

727
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,333
-It's an individual match.
-Do as you want.

728
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,368
Close your eyes.
We'll start with Woo-young.

729
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,036
"When a member of Screwballs called,

730
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,505
I purposely did not answer it."

731
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,840
Guess with your fingers, Woo-young.

732
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,043
Okay. Close your eyes.

733
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,845
If this is about you, raise your hand.

734
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,252
THEY CAREFULLY RETRACE THEIR MEMORIES

735
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,319
Woo-young,

736
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,421
you failed.

737
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,790
Woo-young predicted two people.

738
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,159
-But there was actually…
-Three?

739
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,560
…only one person.

740
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,461
Woo-jae?

741
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,962
It wasn't me.

742
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,731
-I think it's you.
-I answer all your calls.

743
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,599
It's Jin-kyung.

744
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,734
It was you, Jin-kyung?

745
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:57,702
It wasn't me.

746
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,704
Why do I keep doing it?

747
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,341
My hand just went up naturally.

748
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,976
She has telephone phobia.

749
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,512
Really? Whose call did you dodge?

750
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,114
I don't answer anybody's call.

751
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,282
You answer mine.

752
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,584
I only answer your calls.

753
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,685
Really?

754
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,619
Yeah.

755
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,255
WHAT IS HAPPENING, SOOK?

756
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,624
I LUV YOU

757
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,260
The only time you call me is

758
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,795
-when you need something.
-Yeah.

759
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,963
You call me, don't you?

760
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,832
She'd ask me to look into some pants.

761
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,800
-"Sae-ho, can I buy that watch?"
-Yeah.

762
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,670
I have only one opportunity
to speak to Sook on the phone.

763
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,637
When I have bad news.

764
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,707
In the last five years,
I've spoken to Sook 10 times.

765
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,609
Seven or eight of them
were to convey bad news.

766
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,312
-Okay. It's Sook's turn.
-Yes.

767
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,880
"You were really hurt

768
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,615
by a member of Screwballs."

769
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,550
Show us with your fingers.

770
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,519
WITHOUT HESITATIONS, SHE PREDICTS 0

771
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,855
Got it. Close your eyes too, Sook.

772
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,389
If it's about you, raise your hand.

773
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,628
Okay. Open your eyes.

774
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,029
Sook,

775
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,831
you got it right.

776
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,299
How many did she guess?

777
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,968
She guessed zero and we got zero.

778
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:03,969
This is nice.

779
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,970
That's us.

780
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,005
-Let us all eat.
-That's us.

781
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,740
Can we all eat as a congratulations?

782
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,875
Isn't it so beautiful?

783
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:10,942
Not a wrap but a bite.

784
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,911
-How about some toasted rice?
-One chopstick-full?

785
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,547
Then, since it's about "us",
you can have a spoonful instead.

786
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,415
-One bite?
-Everyone can have one bite.

787
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,617
WE'LL ALLOW EVERYONE TO HAVE ONE BITE

788
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,552
I'm going to have
a bite of the toasted rice.

789
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:28,026
THANKS TO HER,
THEY TASTE THE TOASTED RICE

790
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,804
In Woo-young's case,
even if I lent him 100,000 won,

791
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,172
he really wouldn't

792
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,807
have to pay me back.

793
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,242
-How much?
-100,000 won.

794
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,279
Why? I can't give him more than that.

795
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,980
HIS FRIENDSHIP IS INSANE

796
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,615
All right. Let's do the final round.

797
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,384
You're up, Woo-jae. Okay.

798
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,422
"Besides my own YouTube content,
like Real Study King, Kim Sook TV, etc.,

799
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,692
I love Screwballs the most
of the shows I have been on."

800
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,828
Show us your answer using your fingers,
Woo-jae.

801
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,363
All right.

802
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,099
If this is about you,
raise your hand at the count of three.

803
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,534
One, two, three.

804
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,139
Lower your hands.

805
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,107
-This is a definite success.
-Yes.

806
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,276
This has to be a success.

807
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,180
-Success.
-Okay!

808
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,748
SUCCESS
ALL FIVE RAISED THEIR HANDS

809
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:24,649
Did you all do it?

810
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,784
-But--
-All five.

811
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,119
-You know what was upsetting for me?
-Go on.

812
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,089
You said,
"Real Study King, Kim Sook TV, etcetera."

813
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,424
REAL STUDY KING, KIM SOOK TV, ETCETERA

814
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,460
I get it, but please refrain
from mentioning YouTube.

815
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,062
Don't you like You Quiz on the Block?

816
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,229
But

817
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,898
-besides that--
-More than Screwballs?

818
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,199
Besides all that,

819
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,568
to me, Screwballs is

820
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,805
-a show that caused me pain once.
-Okay.

821
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,974
That's why I love this show so much.

822
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,241
And Two Days and One Night?

823
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,644
We started this show before that.

824
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,914
You started
You Quiz on the Block before this.

825
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,185
You Quiz on the Block is a show
that is very educational for me.

826
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,921
It's a show where I have to
listen to other people's stories.

827
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,256
I can talk as much as I want on this show.

828
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,391
-I like that.
-I see.

829
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,292
With One Night--

830
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,527
Stop it, you jerk.

831
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,929
I ought to slap you.

832
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,431
The Kimchi versus Screwballs.
One, two, three.

833
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,600
JUST LAUGHING

834
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,702
-Which one is it?
-It's The Kimchi.

835
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,137
All right. Have a wrap

836
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,172
one last time. Good job.

837
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,741
Our last one was heartwarming.

838
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,476
I'm so happy.

839
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,578
-I'm really happy.
-I'm so happy.

840
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,479
THE NEXT HOLIDAY SCHEDULE

841
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,049
THE FARMHAND HOLIDAY CONTINUES
EVEN AFTER THEIR MEAL

842
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,553
A FUN RECREATION TIME IS
SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE HERE

843
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,655
Maybe I got it wrong,

844
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,391
but aren't we supposed to
rest on a holiday?

845
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,092
We just play games
and suspect each other.

846
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,561
-I'd rather do some farmhand work.
-Really?

847
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,163
-We couldn't even eat properly.
-Yeah.

848
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,298
You ate a lot of wraps earlier.

849
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,034
We did get to eat,

850
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,535
but it was under duress.

851
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,670
And you know what?

852
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,905
-I actually have indigestion.
-Really?

853
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,740
You're drunk and have a bellyache.

854
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,942
I have a bellyache about you.

855
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,277
I knew it.

856
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,278
Let's play the game.

857
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,180
I'm aching for Gangjin.

858
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,917
We'll send those messages out

859
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,119
to the officials of Gangjin
and to Woo-young's fans.

860
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,221
-I took some medicine for indigestion.
-You did?

861
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,189
I'll feel better soon.

862
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:16,027
This is the final moment to mark
the grand finale of Farmhand Holiday.

863
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,330
-You've gathered from various companies.
-Yes.

864
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:23,234
To boost your sense of unity
as fellow farmhands,

865
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,870
we will have
a farmhand membership training.

866
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,305
-Okay.
-Membership training?

867
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,443
You have developed farmhand-built muscles,

868
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,011
strength,

869
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,380
and team spirit. You will
get to show them off in this segment.

870
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,850
The farmhand membership training
consists of two games in total.

871
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,653
The first game is a team game
as you may have expected.

872
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,422
Two gifts from Gangjin
have been prepared.

873
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,790
And in the second game,

874
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,760
three gifts from Gangjin
have been prepared.

875
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:49,661
Two and three?

876
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,130
-Two and three?
-If you succeed in both games,

877
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,733
each one of you will get
all of those gifts.

878
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,501
-Let's do well, guys.
-Okay.

879
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,037
-It would be a perfect ending.
-It would be nice to get gifts.

880
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,339
Until now, the flavors
and characteristics of Gangjin,

881
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,808
whether it was the beer or food,
wasn't bad, was it?

882
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,043
-I'm so satisfied.
-The best.

883
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,578
Are those going to be our gifts?

884
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,146
We have prepared something else.

885
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,748
I was so happy. I mean it.

886
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,649
The first game is called

887
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,685
Farmhand Balloon Train.

888
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,619
What's that?

889
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,088
-Farmhand?
-Farmhand Balloon Train.

890
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,091
Two people will start
from the starting point.

891
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,025
-Okay.
-However,

892
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,996
there will be a balloon
between the first and second member.

893
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,898
You cannot touch the balloon.

894
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,701
-You must keep your arms out.
-Okay.

895
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,036
After the two make it
around the turning point,

896
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,304
three people will have to go.

897
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,640
Lastly, when all five members
carry the four balloons

898
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,709
back to the starting point,
you will succeed.

899
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,410
But what if you dropped the balloon?

900
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,678
It isn't back to square one.

901
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,714
-You just return to the starting point.
-Okay.

902
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,016
We'll give you a total of three attempts.

903
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,786
You have 70 seconds to complete it.

904
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,321
We need to align our heights.

905
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,357
Woo-jae and Jin-kyung match heights.

906
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,859
Wouldn't it work
if our heights were aligned?

907
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,261
-Let's go like this.
-The height

908
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,530
-has to be from tallest to shortest.
-Like this.

909
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,564
Tallest to shortest.

910
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,932
-You see?
-Hang on.

911
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,067
-I have to hold it up.
-We can't fail.

912
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,602
-And just push from the back.
-Push.

913
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,337
-Okay.
-You have to push, Jin-kyung.

914
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,605
-Okay.
-I can push.

915
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,640
-Got it.
-Got it.

916
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:12,110
GETTING READY

917
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,145
Can you hold on to my lip balm please?

918
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,914
MAKING A SUBTLE APPEAL

919
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,682
Do you want me to take an insert?

920
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,818
Sounds good.

921
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,554
Then, Woo-jae and Jin-kyung can…

922
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,090
The two model colleagues.
What a beautiful scene.

923
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,760
It isn't so often that you get to see
me and Jin-kyung walk together.

924
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,428
SMUG

925
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,596
We'll do a runway walk.

926
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,666
How fast are you going to walk?

927
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,800
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes.

928
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,468
Set your tempo at its fastest.

929
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,170
-Run?
-Yes, run.

930
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,305
I can follow that pace.

931
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,339
Ready,

932
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,041
set…

933
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,475
-Let's do it in one try.
-No hands.

934
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:45,844
…go!

935
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,513
Run, Jin-kyung. Go faster.

936
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,683
Run, Jin-kyung. Go faster.

937
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,184
Just run faster.

938
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,019
Faster. Run faster.

939
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,122
-It's okay.
-Turn around.

940
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,624
Touching the balloon is a foul.

941
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,226
-Run faster.
-It's a foul.

942
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,393
Faster, faster.

943
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,361
Okay. Good.

944
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,762
-Turn around.
-Slowly. Hang on.

945
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,897
You can't touch it.

946
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,031
Hold still.

947
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,733
-Go.
-You can't touch it.

948
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,634
Go.

949
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,036
-Go.
-Why are you so slow?

950
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,005
Go faster. Just push me.

951
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,808
FRILLED-NECK LIZARD?

952
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,644
-Hurry.
-We're doing good right now.

953
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,279
I think we'll make it.

954
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,280
Push. Run faster.

955
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,481
-We can make it.
-Push.

956
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,683
-It fell.
-Gosh, it fell.

957
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,019
-Wait.
-From the starting point.

958
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,522
I feel like I'll trip on his legs
so I can't run fast.

959
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,657
You did well.

960
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,993
-Let's do one like this and one like this.
-You did well.

961
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,262
Let me show them as an example.

962
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,296
Go.

963
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,697
-We can go like this.
-Push more.

964
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,798
That's it.

965
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,799
That's it.

966
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,201
That's it. You have to

967
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,669
-push from behind.
-You did well.

968
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,371
-Okay.
-Take quick steps.

969
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,538
Start with Woo-young.

970
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,973
I don't think height matters.

971
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,941
-Okay.
-It doesn't.

972
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,076
Jin-kyung should go last

973
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,244
-and--
-You should go first.

974
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,212
From the stomach.

975
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,546
-Okay.
-You should go first.

976
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,115
THE YOUNGER BROTHERS START THIS TIME

977
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,750
All right. Ready,

978
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:00,985
set…

979
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,120
LET'S SHOW THEM THE BROTHERLY POWER

980
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,354
…go.

981
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,990
-They're fast.
-This is good.

982
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,426
Yes, this is good.

983
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,028
-Push like this.
-Spread your legs.

984
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,063
-Spread your legs, Woo-jae.
-I can go slow.

985
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,998
Spread your legs
and I'll take quick steps.

986
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,166
-Okay.
-Ready, go.

987
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,670
-Oh, no. It fell out.
-Oh, no. Come back.

988
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:19,837
Ready, go.

989
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,206
IT ESCAPED

990
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,108
-It fell out.
-Come back. Come back.

991
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,143
It fell out.

992
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,045
-As fast as we can.
-Keep it on there.

993
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,413
Ready, go.

994
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,081
-That's it, Woo-jae.
-Faster. Go faster.

995
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,049
-Doing good.
-Faster.

996
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,950
LET'S SHOW THEM OUR TEAMWORK

997
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,051
Doing good, guys.

998
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,554
Good job. Keep it up.

999
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,356
Good job.

1000
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,324
From over there?

1001
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,092
-From here?
-No, from here.

1002
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,527
I hate that "Fail."

1003
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,696
No joke. I might throw up
all the bulgogi I ate.

1004
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,165
-The bulgogi might come out.
-Woo-jae.

1005
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,066
Ready, go.

1006
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,168
SINCE THE BULGOGI DIDN'T COME OUT
WE'LL START

1007
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,302
Good. Go slow.

1008
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,504
Don't twist your body too much, okay?

1009
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,539
-Don't twist it.
-Okay.

1010
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:55,540
Get in position.

1011
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,275
Keep going straight. Go straight.

1012
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,110
-I feel like throwing up.
-Turn around.

1013
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,378
-Don't stick too close.
-Okay.

1014
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,946
This is so exhausting.

1015
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,648
-Let's go.
-I want to stop.

1016
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,717
I JUST STARTED

1017
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:06,951
This is so exhausting.

1018
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,386
Let's go. Come on!

1019
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,321
Darn it. Let's go!

1020
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,623
-Let's go.
-This is too hard.

1021
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,125
Let's go. Come on.

1022
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,327
Darn it. Let's go!

1023
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,628
Why aren't you going?

1024
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,964
HOVERING AWKWARDLY

1025
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,333
-What's the point if it's just us two?
-Just keep going.

1026
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,668
You two give it a try for now.

1027
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,003
We're fast.

1028
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,638
-We'll go first.
-Okay. The four of us again.

1029
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,308
The four of us? I'm about to puke.

1030
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,110
COMPLETELY DRAINED

1031
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,044
Fail!

1032
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,646
My indigestion

1033
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,748
is gone now.

1034
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,484
The bulgogi that I ate
came all the way up and went down.

1035
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,087
Unlike Sae-ho, my indigestion
completely went away now.

1036
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,822
Of your three chances,

1037
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,958
you used up your first one.

1038
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,861
-This is so hard.
-The comedian colleagues will start.

1039
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,362
-Just keep pushing, Sook.
-Okay.

1040
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,397
How cute.

1041
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,198
THEY LOOK LIKE BROTHERS

1042
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,199
How cute.

1043
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,435
You have to go slow, Sae-ho.

1044
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,636
Sae-ho. Oh, wait.

1045
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,804
Sae-ho's over here.

1046
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,139
Sae-ho. Oh, wait.

1047
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,640
Sae-ho's over here.

1048
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,542
-Sae-ho's here.
-You have to lead well.

1049
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,710
Okay.

1050
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,111
Ready,

1051
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,713
-set…
-They look alike from behind.

1052
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,314
-…go.
-Go slowly, Sae-ho.

1053
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,150
You have to go slowly, Sae-ho.

1054
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,117
We're doing good.

1055
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,085
-Lean back.
-Very good.

1056
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,353
-We're doing great.
-Good.

1057
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,355
-We have become one.
-Very good.

1058
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,926
THIS IS ALMOST LIKE
A SHADOW CLONE TECHNIQUE

1059
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,795
-We have become one.
-You're like his shadow.

1060
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,463
-We've become one.
-Lean back, Sae-ho.

1061
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,631
She's like Sae-ho's shadow.

1062
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,132
-Good.
-It's Sae-ho's shadow.

1063
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,100
Lean on me now, Sook.

1064
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,001
Go. Lean on me.

1065
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,169
-Good.
-I'm leaning.

1066
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,303
-Lean on me.
-Okay. Good.

1067
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,838
Good. You're doing good.

1068
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,106
-Go slowly.
-Good.

1069
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,707
-It's okay.
-They look so cute.

1070
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,975
Slowly. Lean back.

1071
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:38,876
Lean back, you two.

1072
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,144
-Gosh.
-That's it!

1073
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,412
Lean back.

1074
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,513
-Good.
-Lean back.

1075
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,582
Lean back. You're okay.
You have an airbag.

1076
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,650
-You're good.
-Turn around.

1077
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,119
-I'll lean on you now.
-Lean straight back.

1078
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,120
Ready, go.

1079
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,788
Lean back. Go slow.

1080
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,590
-Good.
-Go slow. Good.

1081
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,958
-Good.
-Good.

1082
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,259
-We might make it.
-We might.

1083
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,928
-We can go faster.
-We'll make it.

1084
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,062
We can go a bit faster.

1085
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,097
Hang on.

1086
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,565
-Good.
-Lean on me.

1087
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,767
-Lean back.
-Lean back. Okay.

1088
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,268
-A little more.
-You have to do well.

1089
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,771
-Spread your legs wide, Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

1090
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,073
You're here, Jin-kyung?

1091
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,842
-Slowly. No.
-Oh, my.

1092
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,876
-We can do it.
-No.

1093
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,111
-Hold still.
-We can do it.

1094
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,046
-Hang on. Start over.
-Hold still.

1095
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,647
Go back, guys. Hurry up.

1096
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,549
-Hurry.
-How many seconds do we have?

1097
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,952
-We have time but we should hurry.
-Lean back.

1098
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:21,986
-Stick close.
-Lean back.

1099
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:22,920
-Ready, go.
-Ready, go.

1100
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,422
-Lean back.
-We can do it.

1101
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:25,957
Good.

1102
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,226
-Come closer, Jin-kyung.
-Go slowly.

1103
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,495
-Lean back further.
-Go slowly.

1104
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,596
THE FARMHAND TRAIN RUNS DANGEROUSLY

1105
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,264
-We're almost there.
-Jin-kyung,

1106
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,932
-you have to come closer.
-That's it.

1107
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,667
-Lean back more, Sae-ho.
-We got this.

1108
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,568
We can do it.

1109
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,470
-We did it.
-Okay!

1110
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,438
We made it!

1111
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,173
WE MADE IT!

1112
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,008
We made it.

1113
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,943
All right, everyone.

1114
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,446
DID WE MAKE IT?

1115
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,847
You finished the race.

1116
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,518
-Did we make it?
-The last digit of

1117
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,286
the total record.

1118
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,488
-Seven seconds.
-27 seconds?

1119
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,656
Probably 57 seconds.

1120
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,557
I think 67 seconds.

1121
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,526
-57 seconds.
-57?

1122
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,660
-Thank you so much.
-57.

1123
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,628
It was so easy.

1124
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,595
It was 87 seconds.

1125
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,098
-Fail.
-Why did it take that long?

1126
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,599
87 seconds?

1127
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,001
Give me a minute. I need a break.

1128
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,269
LET ME SEE WITH MY OWN EYES

1129
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,304
I went around too many times.

1130
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,575
THEY DID WELL
BUT SADLY, THEY FAILED!

1131
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,645
Listen, I'm not trying to call you out

1132
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,781
and I don't know who it is,
but don't burp. It reeks of bulgogi.

1133
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,349
I was so surprised.

1134
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,186
But weren't you all the way in the front?

1135
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,287
Wasn't it yourself?

1136
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,888
No, I smelled it when I got here.

1137
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,458
I THINK HE IS THE CULPRIT

1138
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,993
Should I go first, Sae-ho?

1139
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,728
-You? Shall we try?
-Yeah.

1140
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,629
-Shall we?
-Okay.

1141
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,664
Okay.

1142
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,799
-Isn't that nice?
-Wait, if Woo-jae is behind me,

1143
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,867
wouldn't he be too tall?

1144
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,535
-It doesn't matter.
-No, it won't matter.

1145
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,937
You have a broad back. It's okay.

1146
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,373
-Is that a compliment?
-Your lats

1147
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,175
are wider than mine anyway.

1148
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,644
-Hey, you changed positions again.
-Yes.

1149
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,413
Oh, we have to decide this.

1150
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,115
One person has to go like this
and the other like this.

1151
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,951
It has to go, one, two, one two.
Like that.

1152
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:00,885
Makes sense.

1153
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,120
I'll spread my legs then.

1154
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,689
Makes sense.

1155
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,793
I was so hyped up until just a moment ago,

1156
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,328
but it disappeared instantly.

1157
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,663
I'm not hyped anymore.

1158
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,132
In an instant.

1159
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,934
-Lalala soda pop
-Lalala soda pop

1160
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,436
THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT CHEMISTRY

1161
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,005
-Are you going to close your legs?
-Yeah.

1162
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,773
Then, you can close your legs too, Sook.

1163
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,941
-Run like this.
-Okay.

1164
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,676
Get ready.

1165
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,745
You have 70 seconds.

1166
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,580
-I'm the dude.
-Ready.

1167
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,317
Go. Go fast.

1168
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,752
-Go.
-Go faster.

1169
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,020
-Go faster.
-Going strong.

1170
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,255
Go. Turn around.

1171
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,557
Wait. Okay. Go.

1172
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,558
Go, go.

1173
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,393
Go, go, go.

1174
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,629
-Okay. Turn around.
-Go. Keep going.

1175
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,930
Okay. Go, go.

1176
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,398
-Go.
-Go slowly.

1177
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,100
-Go slowly.
-Slowly.

1178
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,068
-Go.
-It's better to go faster.

1179
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,637
-Turn around.
-Go.

1180
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:53,704
-Go, go.
-Go.

1181
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,673
-Go. Why aren't you going?
-Go.

1182
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,478
THE CAPTAIN THINKS TOO MUCH AND IS SLOW

1183
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,579
This is so hard.

1184
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,348
THE NEXT CUSTOMER GETS ON BOARD

1185
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,185
THEY'RE SLOW

1186
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,520
Go faster, Woo-young!

1187
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,521
We might get detached.

1188
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,224
-We won't. Just go.
-We won't get detached. Hurry up.

1189
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,258
OKAY…

1190
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,528
-Wait.
-All right.

1191
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,629
I might die.

1192
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,366
-Let's reorganize.
-Reorganize.

1193
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,634
Okay. Let's go.

1194
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,303
-Let's go!
-We got this, Screwballs!

1195
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,404
Screwballs!

1196
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,638
Move faster, Woo-young!

1197
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,973
-Woo-young!
-It might fall.

1198
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,074
It won't fall.

1199
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,375
-We're in control.
-Hurry up.

1200
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,977
-Turn around.
-Turn around.

1201
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,413
-Turn around.
-Go, go.

1202
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,380
-Go.
-Here we go.

1203
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:37,848
Last sprint.

1204
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,385
-Come on.
-I feel like I'm going to die.

1205
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,853
CAN THEY GET THE GIFTS FROM GANGJIN?

1206
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,256
-I'm going to die. Okay.
-We did it.

1207
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,290
We're here.

1208
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,726
-Oh, no. Oh, no.
-We made it.

1209
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:49,960
THEY COMPLETED THE RACE
WITHOUT ANY MISTAKES

1210
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,295
WHAT IS THE RESULT?

1211
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,563
No mistakes in this one.

1212
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,732
We lost. We didn't make it in 70 seconds.

1213
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,168
-60 seconds.
-I bet it's over two minutes.

1214
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,235
It's a little over 60.

1215
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,337
Let's be hopeful.

1216
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,538
I really pressed

1217
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,774
the stopwatch exactly on time

1218
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,077
from start to finish

1219
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,813
-without any margin at all.
-Okay.

1220
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,083
The time it took

1221
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,185
was 71 seconds.

1222
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,853
RESULT OF ROUND 3
71 SECONDS

1223
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,789
But I touched the balloon
behind the lines.

1224
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,924
That wasn't a foul?

1225
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,892
-It is a foul.
-It is?

1226
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,160
Behind the line.

1227
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,129
-Behind the line.
-Why is she saying that?

1228
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,098
-I was curious.
-I don't get it.

1229
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,899
I really don't get you.

1230
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,702
Is your life's motto
"Honesty" or something?

1231
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,205
Since when?

1232
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,674
Pardon me, but the path
you all took was…

1233
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,842
Since when?

1234
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,344
If you were going to be
criticized over this,

1235
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,346
you shouldn't even be on TV.

1236
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,016
Actually, you have exhausted your chances,

1237
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,486
but there are two Gangjin gifts at stake,

1238
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,354
so would you like to
try again with just one gift?

1239
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,390
That's enough. I can't do it anymore.

1240
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,024
I'm about to puke.

1241
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,093
-How about 75?
-What?

1242
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,994
That's 75 seconds.

1243
00:39:58,996 --> 00:39:59,964
-What?
-75.

1244
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,998
He wants 75 seconds.

1245
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,099
Yeah.

1246
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,901
But you just got 71 seconds.

1247
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,072
You see, we have lost
some energy while making these attempts.

1248
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,673
We can't be as fast as before.

1249
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,876
I may run a 100-meter dash in 11 seconds.

1250
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:14,245
We don't have time.
Just shake on it and let's do it.

1251
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,813
Why are you still talking about it?

1252
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,915
Since you came in at 71 seconds,

1253
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,084
the viewers would want you
to beat that record.

1254
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,685
Tell that person to come here.

1255
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,123
-They don't expect that much from us.
-I know.

1256
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,491
Let me hear their name.

1257
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:28,626
What is their name?

1258
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,695
73 seconds. Done.

1259
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,364
We can't give you more.

1260
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,331
What do you think?

1261
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,332
THINKING ABOUT IT

1262
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,767
I don't want the gift. Never mind!

1263
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,702
-73 seconds.
-Done.

1264
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,737
-Okay?
-Okay.

1265
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:40,871
-73 seconds.
-73 seconds.

1266
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,841
Just say 70 seconds and
hit the start button two seconds later.

1267
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,344
Whether we get 80 or 90 seconds,

1268
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,580
just stop the stopwatch at 69.8 seconds.

1269
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,782
We are all working hard here.

1270
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,117
STARTLED

1271
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,485
There are no gifts, are there?

1272
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,988
There are? I'm sorry.

1273
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,692
-We didn't make any mistakes earlier.
-Right.

1274
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,893
That was awesome.

1275
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,462
We can do it.

1276
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,629
I'm going second?

1277
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,799
Honestly, the two of you
were the best pair.

1278
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,367
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1279
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,669
-Let's go.
-They were the fastest.

1280
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,970
If you think about it…

1281
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,072
-Oh, let's think about it afterwards.
-Okay.

1282
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,008
-Ready…
-Okay.

1283
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,077
…set,

1284
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:22,880
go.

1285
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,316
THE TWINS TAKE OFF

1286
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,718
You see? We're way faster than Woo-young.

1287
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,454
THE TEAMWORK OF THE TWO SHORTIES

1288
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,690
-The two of them--
-We have to go like this.

1289
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,825
They look like
clowns from The King and the Clown.

1290
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,026
-Go.
-Ready, go.

1291
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,129
-Lean back.
-March, march, march.

1292
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,232
March. Okay. Move back.

1293
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,434
THE CLOWNS' DESPERATE TRAIN GAME

1294
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,504
WE WILL SUCCEED NO MATTER WHAT

1295
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,972
-Let's reorganize.
-Reorganize.

1296
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,607
-Reorganize.
-One, two.

1297
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,975
-Go.
-March, march.

1298
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,345
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER

1299
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,414
THEIR PACE IS FASTER THAN BEFORE!

1300
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,350
What? Where did you go?

1301
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,752
Straight line. Straight line.

1302
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,755
-Where did they go?
-That's enough.

1303
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,025
Listen. It was better
when I was in the front.

1304
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,460
-Okay.
-I'm done.

1305
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,161
-Right, Jin-kyung?
-One, two, three.

1306
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:12,796
Let's stop.

1307
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,199
Then, in the first game,

1308
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,834
-you failed.
-Fail.

1309
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,903
Didn't Sook and I do well?

1310
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,638
It was better when I was in the front.

1311
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,672
Gosh, darn it.

1312
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,173
How was it better?

1313
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,411
-There are still three gifts left.
-Three left.

1314
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,979
-Okay. We can do this.
-Let's win this.

1315
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,447
-Don't waste energy.
-Okay.

1316
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,049
Farmhand membership training.

1317
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,985
The second game is called
Farmhands Have Fun in the Water.

1318
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,587
-Fun in the water?
-Fun in the water?

1319
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:40,558
The five of you will
line up in a row at the starting point.

1320
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,593
You will carry a basin on your head.

1321
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,763
You have to pass it forward
all the way to the front.

1322
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,464
Definitely has to be tallest to shortest.

1323
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,799
Isn't it too easy?

1324
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,534
Even if the five of you stood in a row,

1325
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,236
the distance isn't that long.

1326
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,938
But your destination is over there.

1327
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,241
So after you pass on the basin,
you have to move to the front.

1328
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,510
-You have to keep doing that.
-Got it.

1329
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,178
There'll be a fish tank at the end.

1330
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,414
After pouring the water in, you'll return.

1331
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,950
When you deliver two basins of water

1332
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,153
and fill the fish tank up to the line,

1333
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,121
you succeed.

1334
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:15,326
-I will give you 50 seconds for this game.
-Okay.

1335
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,460
Can we spit?

1336
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,062
What?

1337
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,232
We have to get whatever we can get.

1338
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,434
Let's do this, Jin-kyung.

1339
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,468
ANYWAY, LET'S DO THIS

1340
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,703
One, two, three.

1341
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,870
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1342
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,839
Come over here, Woo-young.

1343
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,543
-Stand like this and…
-Yeah.

1344
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,978
…secretly move one step forward.

1345
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,946
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1346
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,815
-Okay.
-Just go like this.

1347
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:38,782
Okay. Nonchalantly.

1348
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,783
-We got this.
-One.

1349
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,185
-Lalala soda pop.
-One, two, three.

1350
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,486
-Hey!
-Hey!

1351
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,090
-I think you burped.
-No, I didn't.

1352
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,158
When we huddled,
you really reeked of bulgogi.

1353
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,426
Yeah.

1354
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,061
-Hey.
-I think you're on fire.

1355
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,298
HE MUST HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THE FOOD

1356
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,466
-Let's go.
-Ready.

1357
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,168
READY, SET

1358
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,171
GO!

1359
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,072
Hurry up.

1360
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:02,973
SECRETLY MOVING

1361
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,242
THE MASTER TRICKSTERS PROCEED AS PLANNED

1362
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,777
That's so cold.

1363
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:07,911
What's up with the sound?

1364
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,614
BUT THE BASIN SPLASHES ABOUT
LIKE A WATERFALL

1365
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,182
That's so cold.

1366
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,384
What's up with the sound?

1367
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,589
-We'll be done in no time.
-Very good. We got this.

1368
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,792
IT SEEMS TO BE GOING RATHER SMOOTHLY

1369
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:22,993
We did it. Let's go.

1370
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,696
Let's go. Hurry up.

1371
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,665
Hurry, hurry.

1372
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,366
-Come on.
-Guys, this isn't good enough.

1373
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,834
-Just hurry up.
-Yeah, hurry.

1374
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,369
-Hurry.
-Move up a little.

1375
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,904
This is much faster.

1376
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:34,905
WHATEVER, SPREAD OUT!

1377
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:38,942
-Up.
-Oh, no.

1378
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,445
I think we spilled a lot.

1379
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,213
SECRETLY MOVING AGAIN

1380
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,715
WHILE THEY ALL
DILIGENTLY STICK TO THE PLAN

1381
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,517
Hey!

1382
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,752
LAUGHING

1383
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,020
What the heck, man?

1384
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,355
I'm sorry, Jin-kyung.

1385
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,023
-Where did it go?
-My bad.

1386
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:54,958
This isn't working.

1387
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,461
HE SAID HE DID IT ON PURPOSE

1388
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,562
How can this work?

1389
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,898
AND SO, THE RESULT IS…

1390
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,333
OBVIOUSLY FAIL

1391
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,036
Sae-ho looks too sexy.

1392
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,471
I really want to go home.

1393
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,007
SEE-THROUGH BUT NOTHING TO LOOK AT

1394
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,176
I can't get wet on the bottom.

1395
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,845
The person behind you can no longer…

1396
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,014
THAT JERK, JOO WOO-JAE

1397
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,149
Isn't she the ghost of Gangjin
at this rate?

1398
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,886
You guys had the strategy
to spread out, right?

1399
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,656
The thing is, you took a couple steps
to deliver the basin.

1400
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,058
-That was our strategy.
-You're supposed to stand in place.

1401
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,626
Oh, you saw that?

1402
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,695
You caught us.

1403
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,230
You're very observant, In-seok.

1404
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,798
You spotted that fast.

1405
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,101
We told you that we knew, okay?

1406
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,336
Did we say that we didn't know? We knew.

1407
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,972
-You're too close.
-Have mercy, Woo-young.

1408
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,774
Am I okay? Doesn't this look gross?

1409
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,076
-How do you want it?
-It's okay.

1410
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:46,977
It's charming.

1411
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,446
If it becomes an issue,
we'll blur it out for you.

1412
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,514
That would be weirder.

1413
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,816
-That would be weirder.
-What?

1414
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,318
We'll do something about it.

1415
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,652
They'll wonder why it's blurred.

1416
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:57,755
Here we go.

1417
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,456
-Focus.
-Ready,

1418
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:01,759
set.

1419
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,327

1420
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,829

00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,076
THEY GAVE UP ON SUCCEEDING A LONG TIME AGO

1422
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:19,977
SLAP

1423
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,613
Why am I standing here?

1424
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,715
What's going on?

1425
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,151
Why am I standing here?

1426
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,253
-What's going on?
-What?

1427
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,187
Hurry up!

1428
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,488
KARMA BITES BACK

1429
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,856
Why was I standing there?

1430
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,691
I was looking over there!

1431
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,894
SHE'S TAKING A SHOWER TOO

1432
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,162
Where did all the water go?

1433
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,397
Hey, why isn't anyone in front of me?

1434
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,632
Gosh, Woo-jae!

1435
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,201
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS WET

1436
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,602
Darn it, Woo-jae.

1437
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,371
OH, WHATEVER

1438
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:48,806
What the heck?

1439
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,674
-I didn't do anything.
-This isn't right.

1440
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,776
THEY LOOK EVEN UGLIER

1441
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,813
-Shouldn't we at least play the game?
-Hey.

1442
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,081
Why?

1443
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,184
You should get Sae-ho wet.
Why did you target me?

1444
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,451
ANYWAY, THEY'RE JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME

1445
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,886
I didn't know you were behind me.

1446
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,621
-There's no one to give it to.
-Oh, no.

1447
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,690
I can see his butt.

1448
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,393
What do I gain from this?

1449
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,430
We'll blur it out for you. My goodness.

1450
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,699
This is so fun.

1451
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,867
This is so much fun.

1452
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,702
Let's come to Gangjin more often.

1453
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,804
We're making so many memories here.

1454
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,973
Yeah, it's really heartwarming.

1455
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,342
All right. How should I put this?

1456
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,377
In the end, none of you were offended,

1457
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,947
and you showed team spirit
by splashing water on each other.

1458
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,982
This is what membership training is--

1459
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,951
Please blur it out for him.

1460
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,153
I wore underwear. Come on.

1461
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,590
WE DID AS YOU REQUESTED

1462
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:42,059
Good job. Since you showed off
your skills as farmhands

1464
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,496

1465
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,098
What a surprise.

1466
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,234
We prepared one for each one of you.

1467
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,437
-It looks very heavy.
-Yes, can you pass it to them, Woo-young?

1468
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,073
-What is it? It's so heavy.
-This is a signature delicacy

1469
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,308
-of Gangjin.
-Let's see.

1471
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,946
-It's oat grains. Yes.
-It's oat grains.

1472
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,448
-Wow.
-Wow.

1476
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,456
From Gangjin. Okay.

1477
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,324
Pour some condensed milk on this.

1478
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,225
-Yes.
-Condensed milk?

1479
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,160
You can enjoy the sweet and bitter flavor.

1480
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,696
Yes, I really like this.

1481
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,865
-I like it.
-It's very special.

1482
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,467
