1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,870
I am so humiliated right now.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,042
I've never felt
this flustered on air before!

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,510
Are you really Woo-jae?

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,880
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ALWAYS CALM WOO-JAE?

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,083
AT SOME STUDIO IN PAJU

6
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,021
Gosh. Just wrapped up another show.

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,823
Sure. Go ahead and take photos.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,891
Hello.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,192
LOOKS LIKE MODEL WOO-JAE
IS VISITING SOMEWHERE

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,062
The next show is…
Yes, it is with Woo-seok.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:29,996
The next show…

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,232
Yes, you can take photos.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,301
WHO LOOKS HUNGRIER?

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,804
HOW THE MEME WAS BORN

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,838
Yes, thank you.

16
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,273
Thank you.

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,075
TODAY'S DRESS CODE IS MODEL

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,477
Did I eat? No, I didn't

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,779
for the last three days.

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,580
How have you been?

21
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,149
ONE MAN RUNS OVER HAPPILY

22
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,950
Yes, you may take photos. Of course.

23
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,086
- Go ahead.
- Take photos of what?

24
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,988
TAKE PHOTOS OF ME

25
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,059
- I'm taking selfies.
- Yes, thank you.

26
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,994
#I LIKE HOW I LOOK TODAY

27
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,063
Gee, the vibe is definitely different.

28
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,631
Today's vibe…

29
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,033
Even the air feels different than usual.

30
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,302
- Take pictures.
- Gosh, he is something else.

31
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,439
I tried to be as tall as him, but I can't.

32
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,907
Today's model… Yes, you can take them.

33
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,742
- It's okay. Go ahead.
- What's he doing?

34
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,843
THE NEXT MODEL ARRIVES

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,711
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

36
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,046
I'm a home shopping model.

37
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,016
SHOPPING MALL MODEL

38
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:28,388
THE PRO WHO CHANGES POSES EVERY SECOND

39
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,891
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE

40
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,461
She's like that Chinese model.

41
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,363
SHE CAN TAKE 10 CUTS PER SECOND

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,632
Click, click, click. Okay, next outfit.

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,468
- Hello.
- Sure. Take photos.

44
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,603
THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF A LITTLE MASTER

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,205
What's up with that guy?

46
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,006
Wait. But what is…

47
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,274
- What's this?
- What are you?

48
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,910
If you're a model,
you have to look exactly like one.

49
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,045
- For home shopping.
- I'm a model.

50
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,246
Home shopping model?

51
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,180
I have a famous meme.

52
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,682
- Yeah.
- An old one?

53
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,119
There's a meme with Woo-seok called,
"Who looks hungrier?"

54
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,086
It's the same outfit.

55
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,022
It's the same outfit from that day
and the same hairstyle.

56
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,525
RIGHT THEN

57
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,494
Real models are different.

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,395
- Who are you people?
- Come here.

59
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,967
SHE APPROACHES

60
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,002
Real models are different.

61
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,003
Who are you people?

62
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,305
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

63
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,107
Woo-jae is one as well,

64
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,109
- but she really is a model.
- She's different.

65
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,578
She definitely looks different from us.

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,450
SHE CAN ACTUALLY PULL THIS OFF

67
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,218
That is so fascinating.

68
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,221
I WANT TO DO IT TOO

69
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,225
THE MODEL DUO

70
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,894
This is it.

71
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,862
- They are truly models.
- Hello.

72
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,364
- I want to--
- Hello.

73
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,265
Is it you, Woo-seok?

74
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:46,900
Woo-seok.

75
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,902
I'm sorry, but she doesn't know the meme.

76
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,870
She doesn't seem to know what it is.

77
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,338
- So she is just--
- I love you too.

78
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,507
That's not how it's done.

79
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,742
That's not how it's done.

80
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,512
Well, what is your concept, Jin-kyung?

81
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,847
I'm a makeup model today.

82
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,048
A makeup model?

83
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,850
Can you jump high today?

84
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,751
Jump?

85
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,086
Those look like they could be springs.

86
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,890
What's that thing you play with?

87
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,025
Yeah, I know.

88
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,227
- The one that goes down stairs.
- Yeah, that one.

89
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,596
- It's a really beautiful dress.
- I'm just amazed

90
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,198
that you look good in that dress.

91
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,399
What kind of model is he?

92
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,135
There's a difference in timing
from when this airs,

93
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,170
but <i>Chuseok </i>is only a few days away.

94
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,572
And since I am

95
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,108
a K-Pop Idol, I thought I could
look like a young noble at a feast.

96
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,710
- I see.
- The young master vibe.

97
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,011
- Okay.
- Yes.

98
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,347
- You didn't put any thought to it at all.
- No, I didn't.

99
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,116
You know what I was reminded of again?

100
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,219
I realized that Woo-jae really is tall.

101
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,720
These were really hard to get.

102
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,388
I wanted to feel like a model.

103
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,123
They were so hard to get.

104
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,293
He wore sneakers
that have 12-cm wedge heels.

105
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,431
You know, when I got out of my car
with these shoes on today,

106
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,699
I got emotional.

107
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,068
He's short.

108
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,936
SAE-HO HAD A LOT OF SAD INCIDENTS
BECAUSE OF HIS SHORT HEIGHT

109
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,438
I can't see his feet.

110
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,505
Just say it from there.

111
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,908
NO MATTER HOW MUCH WOO-JAE LOWERED
HIMSELF HE WAS STILL TOO SMALL

112
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,479
IT'S SO FUNNY THAT
ONLY SAE-HO HAD A STEP STOOL

113
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,715
I was so happy on my way here.

114
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,049
What kind of model are you?

115
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,117
I don't need any of that.

116
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,120
- I just wanted to be tall like a model.
- I see.

117
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,456
Actually, the size only went up to 250,

118
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,157
so my toes are like this right now.

119
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,392
I thought so

120
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,628
because it looks like
it's going to burst open here.

121
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,528
They're like this.

122
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,964
My feet are like this but I don't care.

123
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,835
He looks happier than ever.

124
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,036
LIVING AS A 170-CM MAN

125
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,104
- Come down.
- What?

126
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,105
Yeah, come down.

127
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,506
I'll come down on one side.

128
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,141
Man, I shouldn't be coming down.

129
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,643
- Come down. Let's see.
- Wow!

130
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,511
One mishap and you'll sprain your ankle.

131
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,680
There's another lift inside the shoe.

132
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,382
He put a lift in the shoes too.

133
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,316
Yeah, I did.

134
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,617
- The lifts are high.
- Hang on.

135
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,720
You aren't even on your toes.
Your feet are hovering in the air.

136
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,489
- I can put my foot under it.
- Hey.

137
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,923
Lower this side.

138
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,892
There's a huge gap.

139
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,961
FEELING SORRY FOR HIM

140
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,529
LAUGHING GLEEFULLY

141
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,497
BUT HE'S HAPPY ABOUT IT

142
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,165
- Do you want to try it, Sook?
- Gosh.

143
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,400
You got really short.

144
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,701
If you put these on,

145
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,037
- you're really going to feel different.
- Really?

146
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,872
SHARES HIS CONFIDENCE
WITH A SHORT COMPANION

147
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,974
- We'll start shooting.
- We'll start shooting.

148
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,111
TALL SOOK

149
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,150
SHE DEFINITELY LOOKS DIFFERENT

150
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,484
- Gosh.
- Stand next to Jin-kyung.

151
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,620
- I'm taller than Sae-ho.
- Go over there.

152
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,921
She's taller than Sae-ho.

153
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,122
Stand next to Jin-kyung.

154
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,258
- I won't be as tall as her.
- But still…

155
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,927
THE UNFAMILIAR HEIGHT DIFFERENCE

156
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,362
Put your arm over my shoulder.

157
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,630
We're kind of similar now.

158
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,564
THE UPPER AIR MATE

159
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,066
It's so comfortable.

160
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,501
- This is awesome.
- What's up with these shoes?

161
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,703
Yeah, what's up with them?

162
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,404
- Let me try them.
- Yeah, try them.

163
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,872
- You should try them.
- Try them on.

164
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,341
But Woo-jae would be…

165
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,843
- I know.
- Wow!

166
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:51,017
HE IS NEARLY 2 METERS

167
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,886
WHEN YOU MAKE A TALL GUY TALLER,
HE BECOMES GIANT

168
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,887
What is this?

169
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,656
What? What's going on?

170
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,690
This is so nice.

171
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,192
- Sae-ho.
- Isn't he two meters?

172
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,027
I feel the fear of heights kicking in.

173
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,796
- That's how it is.
- I am feeling it right now.

174
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,732
- You're so tall!
- My knees are trembling.

175
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,668
You look like a basketball player.

176
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,536
The air must feel different.

177
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,705
- But…
- Seriously.

178
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,040
Can I have them back now?

179
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,443
When I come down from these,

180
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,178
it feels like getting off something.

181
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,079
You got so tall.

182
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,714
I've known Sae-ho for so long,

183
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,349
but I've never seen him
eye-to-eye like this.

184
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,553
So we have given "model"
as your dress code for today.

185
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,722
You all dressed up very nicely.

186
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,126
If you can become the model
of an advertisement of your choice,

187
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,227
what would it be?

188
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,528
Can you tell us?

189
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,562
For me,

190
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,398
I'm working as a beauty model.

191
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,467
I'm working as a men's beauty model.

192
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,771
And I'm sure you've seen me
on airport buses.

193
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,474
I'm also modeling for
an overseas SIM card service.

194
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,145
- You were on a lot of buses.
- Yeah, that's for the SIM card service.

195
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,346
I SIMply enjoyed it.

196
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:54,881
Did you?

197
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,215
- Is that why you said it?
- Yeah.

198
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,118
You know, don't take this the wrong way.

199
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,921
The question was,
"What would you like to model for?"

200
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,456
Why bring up what you're doing?

201
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,158
Why would you brag about yourself?

202
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,526
- We can brag too.
- You think you're so great?

203
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,395
- A model should show respect…
- Are you so great?

204
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,130
- …for the brand…
- I model too.

205
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,566
- …that they model for. Got that?
- We get that you're in-demand.

206
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,968
But the question was
about what you want to do.

207
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,871
I was hired for the job I wanted,
so I was showing respect.

208
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,673
- Showing respect?
- Are you not respectful?

209
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,774
I am respectful.

210
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,142
- Are you not respectful?
- I am.

211
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,944
- We have respect.
- You must mention them.

212
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,880
This is what a model
for a brand should do.

213
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,750
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this,
but I am actually modeling

214
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,752
- for a floss pick company.
- What's that?

215
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,853
- What's that?
- Floss.

216
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,588
- Really?
- You know,

217
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,090
he told me off for
mentioning the brands I'm modeling for,

218
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,059
- but he prepared his too.
- He prepared for it.

219
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,260
- Wow.
- You never know.

220
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,229
Do you carry floss in your back pocket?

221
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,931
I do. You never know.

222
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,566
I have to keep things clean on air.

223
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:51,103
I actually bought the 300 pack
and use it in my bathroom,

224
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,572
so advertisers, if you're watching,

225
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,973
could I be the next model?

226
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,910
I really did buy the 300 pack.

227
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,645
They give you so much.

228
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,247
- It--
- It seems to never run out.

229
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,148
It's so nice and--

230
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,585
- There's also a mint scent to it…
- Right.

231
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,055
…so if you use it when you haven't
brushed your teeth…

232
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,156
He's taking over.

233
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,392
- …you'll feel the mint in your teeth.
- He's taking it from you.

234
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,261
- If you use it--
- As for me,

235
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,897
I can use the floss to sing and dance.

236
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,265
I can even choreograph it.

237
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,501
- That's enough.
- I'll work two years for one year's pay.

238
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,603
I'll work for two years.

239
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,574
PLEASE CONSIDER ME TOO

240
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,209
What do you think about this dance?

241
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,844
We'll do a duet with this dance.

242
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,379
We'll use this exact dance.

243
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,547
HE LOST THE MAIN SPOT IN DENTAL FLOSS TOO

244
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,848
It's your signature move.

245
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,352
By the way, you may already know this.

246
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,087
We had some very good news.

247
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,022
The Screwballs' fan club, Tool Box,

248
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,558
celebrated the 200th day after the release
of Screwballs at Sinchon Station…

249
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,260
- I know. I'm so thankful.
- That's right.

250
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,462
<i>- They set up a digital billboard.</i>
<i>- Right, they did.</i>

251
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,130
FANS PUT UP A BILLBOARD
AT SINCHON STATION

252
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,732
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

253
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,834
- Sae-ho went there.
- I know.

254
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,168
- You made time.
- I happened to

255
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,871
have an appointment nearby.

256
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,908
<i>I thought it would be nice</i>
<i>to take a photo with it.</i>

257
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,309
<i>It felt so strange though.</i>

258
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,911
HOW COULD HE NOT GO SEE IT HIMSELF

259
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,381
WOO-JAE WENT BY AFTER FILMING TOO

260
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,282
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

261
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,182
Thank you.

262
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,851
NO OTHER WAY TO SHOW APPRECIATION

263
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,519
- Thank you so much. Oh, okay.
- Oh.

264
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,021
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

265
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,522
This is kind of hard for me.

266
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,157
Even I did it, Sae-ho.

267
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,225
SHUT UP AND BOW

268
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,093
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

269
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,328
Thank you.

270
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,666
All right. Thanks to the fans
who love Screwballs,

271
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,402
we were able to return with a new season.

272
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,970
THE NEW SEASON BEGINS

273
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,073
<i>Season one was </i>In Search of Loose Screws

274
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,375
<i>and Season two was</i>
In Search of Lost Steering Wheels<i>.</i>

275
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,377
<i>For season three,</i>
<i>we've come up with this title.</i>

276
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,179
<i>Season three of </i>Screwballs<i>,</i>

277
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
<i>Deconstruction Show.</i>

278
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,049
Deconstruction Show?

279
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:43,950
- Deconstruction?
- Yes.

280
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,053
Do you know the tuna Deconstruction show
that's very popular

281
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,055
- on YouTube?
- Tuna Deconstruction show?

282
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,591
<i>It has around 50 million views.</i>

283
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,260
So this is the concept for
season three of <i>Screwballs</i>.

284
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,697
<i>In each episode,</i>
<i>one member will become the star.</i>

285
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:02,401
<i>We'll dig into that person's history,</i>
<i>hidden charms, and all the little details.</i>

286
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,970
- All of you are--
- I feel pressured.

287
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,706
Who would you like to deconstruct first?

288
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,207
- Of the five of you.
- Deconstruct?

289
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,976
I think Woo-jae's time has come.

290
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,244
If we deconstruct him, I think we will

291
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,779
get to see him in full detail.

292
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,615
Do you want to deconstruct yourself?

293
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,884
- Woo-jae brags about himself a lot.
- Yeah.

294
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,787
- Let's dig into him.
- He's confident about his knowledge.

295
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,055
Let's see what's inside.

296
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,759
I'd like to see him crumble
at a very difficult problem.

297
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,027
This is what I think.

298
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,428
Why is showing off a flaw?

299
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,763
Acting dumb is a flaw too.

300
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,934
Shouldn't acting dumb be a flaw too?

301
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,002
Answer him.

302
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,870
Can I really hit him today?

303
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,405
I'll evade it.

304
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,174
I'm curious about him and him.

305
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,876
- Woo-young.
- Yes, me too.

306
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,344
When was your last kiss?

307
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,679
What? Where did that come from?

308
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,114
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

309
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,515
Just come clean and tell us.

310
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,583
Clean?

311
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,485
- Just tell us.
- What's there to be clean about?

312
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,753
Mine was yesterday.

313
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,788
- I wasn't curious.
- Just tell us the date.

314
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,158
The first star of Deconstruction Show

315
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,160
is related to the dress code.

316
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,462
- It's either Jin-kyung or me.
- Model.

317
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,298
This person has an unmatched figure
and a one-of-a-kind face.

318
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,901
The undisputed top model loved by Gen MZ.

319
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,935
Is it me?

320
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,103
Me?

321
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,071
Is it Sae-ho?

322
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,939
They were born with the knack for comedy.

323
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,142
The first star of Deconstruction Show is

324
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,244
- Jin-kyung.
- It's Jin-kyung.

325
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,679
Deconstruction Show.

326
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,480
Jin-kyung's Deconstruction Show.

327
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,882
HONG JIN-KYUNG HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED
AS THE FIRST STAR

328
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,350
But we already
deconstruct ourselves every week.

329
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,018
ACTUALLY, THIS IS…

330
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,388
A LIE

331
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,092
IN THE WAITING ROOM BEFORE FILMING

332
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,696
Are we starting the opening
with just the four of us?

333
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,464
Has it gone down to four?

334
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,099
DID A CERTAIN MEMBER LEAVE THE SHOW?

335
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,068
- The thing is,
- Woo-jae, you should have…

336
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,270
- I was worried this would happen.
- Right.

337
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,839
From today, we'll be shooting
a new season of Screwballs.

338
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,441
- Yes.
- I heard that.

339
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,477
- You're telling us this without Woo-jae?
- Are we really doing this without him?

340
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,546
Do we lose a member each season?

341
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,847
Sorry, Woo-jae.

342
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,216
In season three of <i>Screwballs</i>,
each episode will

343
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,985
- feature one member as the main star.
- As the main star.

344
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,988
- That person will be the main theme.
- Thank you.

345
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,057
Then, Woo-jae must be
the main star for today.

346
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,126
Yes, the first star is Woo-jae.

347
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,461
THE FIRST STAR: JOO WOO-JAE

348
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,262
He's nothing. Why is he the star?

349
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,131
SHE MEANS IT

350
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,332
Unbelievable.

351
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,935
Kicking off season three
with a grand plan,

352
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,604
We'll do
Woo-jae's Experiment Camera today.

353
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,072
- Experiment Camera?
- Yes.

354
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,941
You'll be revealing his true colors.

355
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,309
He's really inconsiderate.

356
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,577
Okay, we get it.

357
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,547
We had a hidden camera
on our previous show.

358
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,649
<i>He had to carry water for her.</i>
<i>It's like that.</i>

359
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,319
- You must be thorough.
- Yeah, if we're not thorough,

360
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,020
he won't get caught on camera

361
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,455
or it will backfire.

362
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,692
On top of that, Woo-jae picks up
on things pretty fast as you know.

363
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,593
Yes.

364
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,196
So the reason why we chose
"model" as today's dress code is

365
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,899
because we'll trick him
into thinking Jin-kyung is the first star.

366
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,033
SETTING UP JIN-KYUNG AS THE FAKE STAR

367
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,003
Let me explain the situations
for this experiment today.

368
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,338
Here's the first situation.

369
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,940
1. THE AUDIO TEAM KEEPS HAVING ISSUES

370
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,010
2. FREQUENT STOPS IN FILMING
CAUSE THE ON-SET ATMOSPHERE TO TURN COLD

371
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,480
So we'll say that we will
play a game with Jin-kyung as the topic.

372
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,115
The game will be Shouting in Silence.

373
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,851
<i>- We wear headphones, right?</i>
<i>- Yes, you'll do a speed quiz wearing them.</i>

374
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,119
<i>But the audio team will bring</i>

375
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,821
<i>only one set of headphones.</i>

376
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,689
<i>They say they did it by mistake?</i>

377
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,991
<i>Right, they didn't prepare it.</i>

378
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,959
At this point, I'll get upset.

379
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,094
And this is how it'll go.

380
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,263
Remember Soon-kyu?
He lost at arm wrestling with Woo-jae.

381
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,497
TODAY'S KEY FIGURE APPEARS

382
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,869
AUDIO DIRECTOR, KWON SOON-KYU
(TRAIT 1) LOST TO WOO-JAE AT ARM WRESTLING

383
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,038
I'm Kwon Soon-kyu of the recording team.

384
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,339
(TRAIT 2) INNOCENT, KIND, AND GENTLE

385
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,407
Soon-kyu

386
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,642
is totally an Egen guy.

387
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,111
I get what he's like.

388
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,245
3. CLOSEST WITH WOO-JAE

389
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,147
When the mic is off,

390
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,615
Soon-kyu will go to Woo-jae.

391
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,617
Remember I said we'll only have
one set of headphones?

392
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,019
But even that remaining one

393
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,587
will be almost out of batteries.

394
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,355
It can turn off half-way through.

395
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,225
If it turns off during the shoot,
he'll get in trouble.

396
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,359
With all the issues going on.

397
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,260
He'll ask Woo-jae a favor?

398
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,795
He'll ask Woo-jae if he can

399
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,498
continue on with the game
even if the headphones turn off.

400
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,334
Gosh, this seems like a fun scenario,

401
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:59,438
- but I think Woo-jae might pick up on it.
- I think so.

402
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,573
- We have to do well.
- Yeah.

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,542
Can't he just give him
another set of headphones?

404
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,443
Another set.

405
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,845
- He said there won't be any.
- There won't be any.

406
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,580
He said that there won't be any already.

407
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,115
There should be two.
One for each player.

408
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,484
- He already told us.
- So the one available won't have power.

409
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,886
Dear.

410
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,154
- Dear?
- What did you call me?

411
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,055
Dear.

412
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,491
OUR MASTER OF SHOW-OFF

413
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,861
LEVEL 100 IN READING THE ROOM

414
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,296
FULL-ON RATIONAL-TYPE PERSONALITY

415
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,899
FOOL JOO WOO-JAE!

416
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,401
ONE MONTH OF PLANNING

417
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,238
CASTING THE BEST ACTORS(?)

418
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,640
HOW WILL WOO-JAE REACT?

419
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,109
Then, Jin-kyung is today's star.

420
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,444
- Yeah.
- Okay.

421
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,946
Tell us how you feel
about being the first star.

422
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,449
Thank you so much.
Without any exaggeration,

423
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,717
without any secrets.

424
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,353
If you want, I'll even tell you
when my last kiss was.

425
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,688
I'll tell you everything today.

426
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,856
Why are you going that far?

427
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,025
- Right.
- Is that drool?

428
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,493
TIME TO TRICK THIS GUY

429
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,595
- It's snot.
- You were sleeping in the car earlier.

430
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,632
<i>Let me explain the situation</i>
<i>for this experiment.</i>

431
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,933
<i>Here's the first situation.</i>

432
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,101
<i>During the opening comments,</i>

433
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,770
<i>the audio team keeps encountering issues.</i>

434
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,208
THE CREW'S GROUP CHAT
LET'S START THE ISSUE WITH SAE-HO'S AUDIO

435
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,943
I have some good news.

436
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,678
- Producer In-seok.
- So I was--

437
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,180
Producer In-seok.

438
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,415
AUDIO DIRECTOR: PRODUCER IN-SEOK!

439
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,451
- Can we check Sae-ho's mic?
- My mic?

440
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,520
Maybe it's because of my necklace.

441
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,421
Sorry.

442
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,989
- Is it okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

443
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,558
It's my necklace. Should I remove it?

444
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,559
Is my necklace okay?

445
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,361
If you can remove it…

446
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,796
But he looks good with it.

447
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,499
- Yes, can I keep wearing it?
- Yes, for now.

448
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,067
Okay. Sorry.

449
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,803
- Nam-jae, if it sounds bad again…
- What?

450
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,006
- If there's another issue, message me.
- Okay.

451
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,041
Let's go.

452
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,277
AND SO, THE FIRST SCENE ENDS

453
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,281
LET ME CHECK MY NECKLACE TOO

454
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,284
- Today is Chuseok holiday isn't it?
- Yes.

455
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,586
- The long holiday just began.
- It did.

456
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,722
That's why the directors look upset.

457
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:58,757
They look depressed.

458
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,326
Do you remember

459
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,929
our concept for the last episode
in our past lives?

460
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,998
Wasn't it early Chuseok?

461
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,534
- Was it early New Year's Day?
- Early Chuseok.

462
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,869
It was because we couldn't
spend Chuseok together.

463
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,907
As the show was going off the air,
we couldn't be together during Chuseok.

464
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,077
<i>So we decided to move things up</i>
<i>and record a Chuseok special in advance.</i>

465
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,379
But somehow, we ended up
spending Chuseok together

466
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,247
- this time around.
- Yeah.

467
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,148
Wait.

468
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,451
Was that a year and nine months ago?

469
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:30,322
<i>Then, we have been together</i>
<i>for three or four years.</i>

470
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,024
<i>It has been four years.</i>

471
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,060
It isn't as long as I thought.

472
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,462
But it has been--

473
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,529
- I thought it was--
- A lot longer.

474
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,832
- It feels like 10 years.
- It feels much longer.

475
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,700
- It has only been four years.
- It feels weird.

476
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,769
<i>Sae-ho even got married during that time.</i>

477
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,071
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>- There were changes like that.</i>

478
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,842
All right. From now,
we will dive into Jin-kyung's life

479
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,344
with four Hong Jin-kyung related games.

480
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,579
Do I look like a fashionista?

481
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,148
- Looks good.
- Isn't that Sae-ho's pose?

482
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,716
- Yeah.
- He does that pose often.

483
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,218
This is the King of Fashion's pose.

484
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,819
Let me confess something.

485
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,521
<i>You did that wearing a suit</i>

486
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,390
<i>- in the God of Talk episode, didn't you?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

487
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,792
Did you see the subtitles we added?

488
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,893
I saw it.

489
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,028
- What was it?
- What was it?

490
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,630
<i>"He's pissing us off again."</i>

491
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,432
"He's pissing us off again." Yeah.

492
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,768
Why did that piss you off?

493
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,403
Just move on.

494
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,906
Even if you got mad,
just can keep it to yourselves.

495
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,174
Why did you put it in print?

496
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,376
- Should I make it worse?
- On the blind date episode…

497
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,412
- Come on. Don't do that.
- Darn it.

498
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,148
- Why are doing that?
- You look like Hwanhee.

499
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,049
Do I?

500
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,120
Don't do that to Hwanhee!

501
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,855
I apologize, Hwanhee.

502
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,756
This is wrong.

503
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,425
I like him so I can dance like him.

504
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,060
- Did I do something wrong?
- Don't.

505
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,361
Yes, it's wrong. You're a sinner.

506
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,929
Excuse me, but can you…

507
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,964
- Put it back on.
- Don't force me.

508
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:46,965
I'll take care of it.

509
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,303
I'm old enough to know
when I should put my clothes on.

510
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,506
IT IS TIME

511
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,276
TO THROW THE SECOND ROCK

512
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,646
<i>The audio team will say</i>
<i>that Sae-ho's mic has an issue again.</i>

513
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,314
<i>They'll check his mic again.</i>

514
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,116
I'LL BE COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS MIC SOON

515
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,485
REPLYING TO PRODUCER PARK IN-SEOK:
OKAY!

516
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,387
One moment.

517
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,489
- One moment.
- Is there a problem?

518
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
Go.

519
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,725
- I'm going in.
- Sae-ho.

520
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,427
- Sae-ho.
- Is it my mic again?

521
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,995
- Change his frequency.
- Gosh.

522
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,697
- Come on, Sae-ho.
- Change his frequency.

523
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,798
What's the matter?

524
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,667
Is it a battery issue, Nam-jae?

525
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,536
- The lines seem to be scrambled.
- What?

526
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,872
- What?
- Is it because of all your jewelry?

527
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,240
Is it because of my necklace?

528
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,842
Is it because of all your jewelry?

529
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,311
- Aren't you wearing one too, Woo-jae?
- Yes.

530
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,946
I don't think that's the issue then.

531
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,981
- Is it touching your skin?
- Mine is to the side.

532
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,883
- Nam-jae.
- Yes.

533
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,018
- Sorry.
- Try not to interrupt again.

534
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,120
- Okay.
- All right.

535
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,558
From now,
we will dive into Jin-kyung's life

536
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,894
with four Hong Jin-kyung related games.

537
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,828
Games about Jin-kyung.

538
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,364
Unlike the previous
individual or group games,

539
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,235
Jin-kyung will be matched
with another person in each game.

540
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,536
One of the four of us?

541
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,304
So it's a one-on-one game for all of them?

542
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,040
Let me explain the title
of the four Jin-kyung related games.

543
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:02,975
The first game is called

544
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,444
I Can't Hear Anything.

545
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,746
The second game is Everyday is New.

546
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,115
The third game is Aren't We All Pros?

547
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,551
- These are all Jin-kyung's lines.
- Exactly.

548
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,286
The fourth game is What Color Do You Like?

549
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,621
Those are the games we prepared.

550
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,890
- What Color Do You Like is an old one.
- What's that?

551
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,158
Oh, "What" color…

552
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,961
- Look, it's your show.
- It's your line.

553
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,397
You said you were going to
tell us everything.

554
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,632
- It's a game.
- Jin-kyung.

555
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,734
- You said you'll say everything.
- You guys.

556
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,602
If you win the game,

557
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,204
we will provide

558
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,007
<i>a Korean feast as a prize</i>
<i>since it's Jin-kyung's special.</i>

559
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,208
TODAY'S PRIZE IS A KOREAN FEAST

560
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,743
<i>- That sounds good.</i>
<i>- I'm hungry.</i>

561
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,146
BUT THEY MAY END UP EATING A WOO-JAE MEAL

562
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,849
We should eat bountifully
since it's Chuseok.

563
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,551
- Dried corvina.
- Bulgogi.

564
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,686
Woo-jae is in top shape today.

565
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,521
He must have slept well last night.

566
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,191
He's sleeping well these days
after taking melatonin.

567
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,525
He's got a lot of energy.

568
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,694
Wasn't he better when he had insomnia?

569
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,095
- Why is he so--
- Oh, my gosh!

570
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,831
HE'S GOING OVERBOARD AGAIN

571
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,733
- Good job.
- Why are you being like this?

572
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,869
- Are you only doing the morning shoot?
- Two kicks.

573
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,872
Hang on.

574
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,240
What's wrong now?

575
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,576
AT THAT MOMENT!

576
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,445
AN ISSUE WITH THE AUDIO OCCURS AGAIN!

577
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,680
(OF COURSE, IT'S FAKE)

578
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,948
Whose is it? Why?

579
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,049
Sook.

580
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,317
- Me?
- What's up with the mics today?

581
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,218
SOOK'S MIC IS THE ISSUE THIS TIME

582
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,619
- Check her mic.
- Me?

583
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,988
Woo-jae, who has been
moving around a lot, is fine.

584
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,022
Give us handheld mics.

585
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,692
- We'll hold it.
- Give me a headset.

586
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,162
- Did the battery run out?
- Let's go.

587
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,830
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

588
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,566
Checking. One, two, three.
Can you check if it works?

589
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,667
- Okay.
- It works.

590
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,603
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

591
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,338
- Check?
- We should check all of ours.

592
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,706
- Shouldn't we?
- Producer Park.

593
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,607
- Are we okay?
- Yes.

594
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,275
This place is so bright.

595
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,677
THE MOOD IS GETTING HEAVY
SO HE CHANGES THE SUBJECT

596
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,479
My bangs are suffocating me.

597
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:49,781
Shall we go?

598
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,216
- Sorry.
- Are you wearing a wig?

599
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,317
No, it's my hair.

600
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,485
ACTING SERIOUS

601
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,488
- There must be an issue with the audio.
- Let's do this.

602
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,224
From now on, if there's an issue
with the mic, just speak louder.

603
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,259
Okay.

604
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,960
- Got it?
- Take care of your own issue.

605
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,362
TIPTOEING THROUGH THE TENSION

606
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,063
HE SEEMS FULLY FOOLED SO FAR

607
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,466
- Speak in the other person's mic?
- Yeah.

608
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,101
The first game.

609
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,136
- I Can't Hear Anything.
- Okay.

610
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,739
- I Can't Hear Anything.
- Let me tell you what it is.

611
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,009
In our past lives,
your fellow alums came by

612
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,810
- and we played this game.
- Yes.

613
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:19,878
I remember.

614
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,613
It was called Shouting in Silence.

615
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,181
At that time, Jin-kyung made

616
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,717
an objection while wearing her headphones

617
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,885
before the game began.

618
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,086
She got all serious.

619
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,222
She said, "I can't hear anything at all."

620
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,523
THAT IS THE NAME OF THE GAME THOUGH

621
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,560
- Jin-kyung is so funny.
- We got "I Can't Hear Anything" from that.

622
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,098
You can play this game
with the person of your choice.

623
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,969
<i>I'm going to tell you to choose</i>
<i>who you want to play this game with.</i>

624
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,271
<i>Then, you have to choose Woo-jae.</i>

625
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,774
CHOOSE?

626
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,144
HER EYES DART AROUND

627
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,080
SHORT-TERM MEMORY ISSUE OCCURS

628
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,848
- Same as back then?
- Shouting in Silence.

629
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,916
WOO-JAE?

630
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,718
Then Jin-kyung explains what it is…

631
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,621
JOO WOO-JAE?
WRITER: YES

632
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,957
Then, if Jin-kyung explains what it is
and we use our wits to guess,

633
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,559
we win the foods, don't we?

634
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,660
- Exactly.
- Okay.

635
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,429
We need to read her mind quickly.

636
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,630
Pick someone who's good.

637
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:12,931
- Sae-ho--
- Then, I pick Woo-jae.

638
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,999
- What?
- Woo-jae.

639
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,367
Well, he is smart.

640
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,372
DID WOO-JAE NOTICE THE INTERACTION
BETWEEN JIN-KYUNG AND THE CREW?

641
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,074
- Me?
- Shall we do that?

642
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,010
- You can't read lips though.
- You're good at guessing.

643
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,845
Jin-kyung is the one who has to explain?

644
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,980
I think Sook will be good at it though.

645
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,783
Sook would be good at explaining it,

646
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,952
- but she can't guess well.
- I'm good at explaining it.

647
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah.

648
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:39,091
Then, can you briefly tell us
what the second game is?

649
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,094
You see, we have to
distribute the contestants well.

650
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,196
We can't reveal that.

651
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,565
So you have to pick well.

652
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,734
Just start us off, Woo-jae.

653
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,768
I'll do it.

654
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,803
- Yeah, we have to start off well.
- Yeah, do it.

655
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,572
- Do it. Where do we go?
- Now what?

656
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,207
- Anything to set up?
- You chose him?

657
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,708
Then, we'll go with Woo-jae.

658
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,143
I'LL SIGNAL THE NEXT SITUATION SOON

659
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,711
AFTER CALLING IN-SEOK
JONG-HO STANDS BY

660
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,612
Let's do that.

661
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,381
- In-seok.
- What's wrong?

662
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:03,982
Let's do that.

663
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,117
In-seok.

664
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,086
- I'm sorry, but…
- What's wrong?

665
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,921
THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR APPROACHES

666
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,990
WHAT IS GOING ON NOW

667
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,061
THE AUDIO TEAM ONLY BROUGHT
ONE SET OF HEADPHONES

668
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,598
NERVOUS

669
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,669
BRIEFLY STOP FILMING

670
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,641
THEY GO OVER TO HAVE
A SERIOUS CHAT WITH THE AUDIO DIRECTOR

671
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,810
- What's wrong?
- Stay next to me.

672
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:32,711
What's up?

673
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,481
Wanna get some soju next week?

674
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,184
Beef.

675
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,385
In Magok-dong.

676
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,788
THEY MAKE PLANS TO GET DRINKS
BUT ACT LIKE IT'S SERIOUS

677
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,256
THEY RETURN

678
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,757
The mood is very unsettling today.

679
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,495
Let me briefly explain something to you.

680
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,264
What is it?

681
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,666
There's something I have to apologize for.

682
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,134
- What is it?
- It's my fault.

683
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,071
We're supposed to play
Shouting in Silence, right?

684
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,809
But the person explaining
has to wear headphones

685
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,079
and the person guessing
has to wear one too.

686
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,182
But the audio team brought

687
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,083
only one set of headphones.

688
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,954
I have a really good noise-canceling one.

689
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,590
I have a really good noise-canceling one.

690
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,058
- You have headphones?
- No.

691
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,860
They're earphones
but it has noise canceling.

692
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,761
WOO-JAE'S EARPHONES UNEXPECTEDLY POP UP

693
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,129
Where is it?

694
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:25,997
In my bag.

695
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,667
We can use those
and just cover the ears, right?

696
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:32,170
- Wouldn't it look weird though?
- They have to listen to the same thing.

697
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,439
How would we explain that?

698
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,876
Don't we just need one
for the person guessing it?

699
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,077
No need for the other person.

700
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,946
- He's right.
- No, they both need it.

701
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,247
Why?

702
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,749
If they mouth the same thing,
but say something different,

703
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,285
the person who's explaining it
would think it's right.

704
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,954
SURE, YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART

705
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,655
That's why they should wear headphones.

706
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,424
- So what should we do?
- We don't have enough.

707
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,360
In-seok, don't worry about that too much
and let's just roll with it.

708
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,629
Guessing it is what matters.

709
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,298
- Jin-kyung doesn't understand anyway.
- She doesn't.

710
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,969
That was rude, Sook.

711
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,071
- Then--
- I'm going to take some more photos.

712
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,372
First of all, I apologize.

713
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,273
It's okay.

714
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,374
HOW SHOULD WE PUT THIS…

715
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,642
- Let's do it.
- Set it up.

716
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,178
- Let's just do it.
- Why don't we have only Woo-jae wear it?

717
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,379
Really?

718
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,914
REALLY?

719
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,216
In-seok, I'm sorry,

720
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,852
but you didn't care so much
about the details of our games anyway.

721
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:21,753
He's right.

722
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,455
SINCE WHEN DID YOU CARE ABOUT THE DETAILS?

723
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,257
He spoke the truth
so I can't even refute it.

724
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,291
Just take a photo of me.

725
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,194
Listen, you even dressed us up
in costumes like this.

726
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,429
Why do you keep taking photos?

727
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,298
- This is unbelievable.
- But you see…

728
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,900
- The lighting is good.
- Hey!

729
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,402
Can't you tell that
the mood isn't great right now?

730
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,571
- It's okay.
- I'm doing it to lighten the mood.

731
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:40,906
Stop it already.

732
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,508
- Look at the audio director's face.
- Yeah.

733
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,310
Then,

734
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,012
we'll change the setting.

735
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,314
- Okay.
- We'll change it but Nam-jae…

736
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,850
- Check all the mics while we're at it.
- Okay.

737
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,852
- Don't let it interrupt us again.
- Okay!

738
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,354
THEY MAKE IT SERIOUS AGAIN

739
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,658
WOO-JAE WILL BE ASKED
TO DO SOMETHING RIDICULOUS

740
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,359
But even that remaining one

741
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,895
will be almost out of batteries.

742
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,530
If it turns off during the shoot,

743
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,965
he'll get in trouble.

744
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,134
He'll ask Woo-jae
if he can continue on with the game.

745
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,169
WOO-JAE IS ASKED TO ACT LIKE HE CAN'T HEAR
HOW WILL WOO-JAE REACT?

746
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,006
THE ESSENTIAL STEP
TO ERASE ANY SUSPICION OF FILMING

747
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,644
COLLECTING HIS MIC
USING AUDIO CHECKS AS AN EXCUSE

748
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:25,183
WOO-JAE LEAVES BRIEFLY
CLUELESS OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN SOON

749
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,252
MEANWHILE

750
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,655
THERE'S ONE MAN
WHO IS MORE NERVOUS THAN ANYONE ELSE

751
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,792
AUDIO DIRECTOR KWON SOON-KYU

752
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:37,996
GOING OVER HIS LINES AGAIN

753
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,731
Since he works in audio,

754
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,567
when he is actually in the situation,
he may sound…

755
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,735
WORRIED ABOUT HIS ACTING

756
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,038
WORKING ON HIS ACTING
BEFORE THE CAMERA ROLLS

757
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:51,042
PERFORMING ENTHUSIASTICALLY

758
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,644
He'll totally see through it.

759
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,847
WILL WOO-JAE FALL FOR IT?

760
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,216
WOO-JAE

761
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,317
They took my mic.

762
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,518
Yes. But Woo-jae,

763
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,754
I'm really sorry,

764
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:07,125
but I only brought one set of headphones.

765
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,394
It was my mistake.

766
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,896
- It's okay.
- But I didn't charge

767
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,633
the one I brought.

768
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,635
I didn't charge it.

769
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,770
Well, I confirmed that it worked.

770
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,206
But during the game,

771
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:25,176
if it happens to turn off halfway through,

772
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,681
I was wondering if you could
act like you can hear the music.

773
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,918
I was wondering if you could
act like you can hear the music.

774
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,955
The mood in our team
is very tense right now.

775
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,456
THINGS ARE SUPER TENSE…

776
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,092
I feel like we'll get in big trouble
if we have another issue.

777
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,161
HIS ABSURD AND UNREASONABLE REQUEST

778
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:49,267
HOW WILL WOO-JAE REACT TO IT?

779
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,938
RESUMING THE SHOOT

780
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,142
- All right. Let me explain the rules.
- Okay.

781
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,510
The four games about Jin-kyung.

782
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,112
The first game is I Can't Hear Anything.

783
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,281
As you know, it's Shouting in Silence.

784
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,250
You have to explain, Jin-kyung.

785
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,585
Gestures can give clues,

786
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,622
so you should clasp your hands
behind your back.

787
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,358
The time limit is two minutes.

788
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,592
How many do we have to guess?

789
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,895
- Actually, we wrote ten.
- Okay.

790
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:17,796
That's too many.

791
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,863
- We can't do ten.
- Seven.

792
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,234
Since it's 120 seconds, let's say 6.
20 seconds per guess.

793
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,203
- How about seven?
- Come on. Six.

794
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,138
- Let's go with seven for now.
- Okay.

795
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,907
He's your best player after all.

796
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,476
- But she isn't our best.
- You just have to explain well, Jin-kyung.

797
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,479
- One side can--
- You can't say that right to her face.

798
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,415
I guess we're very close.

799
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,850
Of course we are, Jin-kyung.

800
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,219
- How can we not be close?
- We get along so well.

801
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,655
PUTS ON THE HEADPHONES
THAT ARE ABOUT TO RUN OUT OF BATTERIES

802
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,858
Can't Jin-kyung wear those glasses
while she explains?

803
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,892
- These?
- I want to see.

804
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,695
SHE LOOKS COOL

805
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,698
- I brought it because of my hair.
- You look so cool.

806
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,402
HEADPHONES WILL TURN OFF
AFTER 1 MINUTE AND 20 SECONDS

807
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,871
- All right. Here we go.
- Shouldn't someone do it?

808
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,072
Speak loudly.

809
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,341
- Ready.
- He can't hear us.

810
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,375
Set.

811
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,145
Go.

812
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,980
MUSIC ON

813
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,549
I CAN HEAR THE MUSIC
WHAT A RELIEF

814
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,419
CAPTAIN HOOK

815
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,788
- Well…
- You can't use your hands.

816
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,790
I can't use my hands? That's right.

817
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,791
He wears a hat.

818
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,128
He moves boats but…

819
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,629
CAPTAIN HOOK

820
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:29,734
(WHAT HE'S HEARING)
FROM WOO-JAE'S POINT OF VIEW

821
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,236
He wears a hat.

822
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,505
- He can't see in one eye.
- He sails a boat?

823
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,206
- Yeah. He rides a boat.
- Peter Pan.

824
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,941
- On a boat?
- Yeah, on a boat.

825
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:37,942
- Say Peter Pan.
- A captain.

826
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,577
- Yeah, that's right.
- A pirate?

827
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,212
- But he has a name.
- Captain Hook.

828
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,181
- That's it.
- That's correct.

829
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,018
The song you sang with the band 10CM.

830
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,086
Can she see it well?

831
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,187
- The song I sang?
- Yeah.

832
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,522
- You sang it.
- With whom?

833
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,689
With 10CM.

834
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,957
10CM? <i>To Reach You!</i>

835
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,592
CORRECT!

836
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,261
- He's doing a good job.
- We can make it.

837
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,429
AND NOW

838
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,999
SECONDS UNTIL HIS HEADPHONES TURN OFF

839
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,934
- BIGBANG.
- In a big room?

840
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:10,008
FROM WOO-JAE'S POINT OF VIEW

841
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,345
HEADPHONES TURN OFF

842
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,847
He's a member of BIGBANG.

843
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,682
POWER'S OFF!

844
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,852
HE'LL EITHER DO SOON-KYU A FAVOR

845
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,756
OR STOP THE GAME
AND SEEK A SOLUTION WITH THE CREW

846
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,826
THE BIGGEST DILEMMA
OF WOO-JAE'S CAREER ON TELEVISION

847
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,396
WHAT DO I DO?

848
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,699
- Big what? Big Bob?
- BIGBANG.

849
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,268
Big box?

850
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,203
Big box?

851
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,404
BIGBANG!

852
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,538
Oh, boy.

853
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,706
- Oh, BIGBANG!
- Yeah.

854
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,607
HE CHOSE TO ACT!

855
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,908
- G-DRAGON.
- Yeah.

856
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,909
Correct.

857
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,311
How much time do we have left?

858
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,612
This is hard.

859
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,713
This is a ghost.

860
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,981
It's a scary possessed doll.

861
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,150
- You did this before.
- It's a scary possessed doll.

862
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,885
- Scary.
- Doll.

863
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,220
- Doll.
- Door.

864
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,154
Doll.

865
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,892
If it happens to turn off halfway through,

866
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:05,530
I was wondering if you could
act like you can hear the music.

867
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,566
The mood in our team
is very tense right now.

868
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,001
Big what?

869
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,403
<i>I feel like we'll get in big trouble</i>
<i>if we have another issue.</i>

870
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,905
- Big Bob?
- BIGBANG!

871
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,574
I know it's a ridiculous request

872
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,509
but could you do me this one favor?

873
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,711
Don't worry about it.

874
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,446
COMFORTING HIM

875
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,047
Don't worry about it.

876
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,182
I'm sorry.

877
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,951
WOO-JAE ACCEPTED HIS UNREASONABLE REQUEST

878
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,556
- By the way…
- Yes?

879
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,926
…we will only be playing that game

880
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,096
one time, right?

881
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,464
Yes, just once.

882
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,033
It'll end with me?

883
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,201
Yes, I think so.

884
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,639
Then, I'll do my best on my end.

885
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:51,009
IF IT ENDS WITH ME,
IT MEANS THAT I CAN SOLVE IT ON MY END

886
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,277
The scary possessed doll.

887
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,978
- Scary.
- Doll.

888
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,179
- Doll.
- Door.

889
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,114
Doll.

890
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,082
BLINKING SLOWLY

891
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,084
- Door.
- Come on.

892
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,719
- The possessed doll!
- Come on.

893
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,454
<i>- Child's Play.</i>
<i>- Child's Play.</i>

894
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,756
I CANNOT GET CAUGHT ACTING

895
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,724
- From <i>Child's Play.</i>
<i>- Child's Play.</i>

896
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,692
Yeah.

897
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,394
What's his name? Give me his name.

898
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,563
THE CREW SILENTLY APPLAUDS HIM

899
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,800
THE AUDIO TEAM ARE ESPECIALLY THANKFUL

900
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,168
What's his name? Give me his name.

901
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,903
ACTING WITH HIS EYES

902
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,338
- Chucky!
- That's it.

903
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,272
He's smart.

904
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,474
- We're almost done.
- Your friend.

905
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,542
Your friend.

906
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,077
- My friend?
- Yeah.

907
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,478
- He has so many though.
- Yeah.

908
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,680
The handsome actor.

909
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,048
- Byeon Woo-seok
- Yeah.

910
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,849
No way. Nice.

911
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,851
- Am I right?
- Yeah, you're right.

912
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:34,919
- Doing good.
- Basketball player.

913
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,621
You always tease me about him.

914
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,190
You say that
this basketball player looks like me.

915
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,159
- What?
- Basketball player.

916
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,560
Basketball player.

917
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,028
Go slower.

918
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,197
Basketball player.

919
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,865
- Basketball.
- Player.

920
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,400
- Can he read lips?
- Basketball player.

921
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,735
- Basketball.
- Yeah.

922
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,970
- Player.
- Basketball?

923
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,504
- Seo Jang-hoon.
- No.

924
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,605
You said I look like him.

925
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:55,940
- Han Ki-bum.
- Yeah.

926
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,175
Wow.

927
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,276
- Correct.
- Park Chan-sook.

928
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,877
Someone you're close to.

929
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,579
- Your close friend.
- Park Chan-sook.

930
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,780
Your close friend.

931
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,781
CHIMCHAKMAN

932
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,751
- Rukawa Kaede.
- No, your close friend.

933
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,952
- We moved on.
- That one's over.

934
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,387
Time's up. That's it.

935
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,788
How many did they get? Come on.

936
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,792
Woo-jae, can you read lips or something?

937
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,761
- It's over.
- I thought he'd be so bad at it.

938
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,662
You're so good.

939
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,063
- He's good.
- How many did he get?

940
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,498
Five? Six?

941
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,000
You got six.

942
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,267
WITH SIX ANSWERS, THEY FAILED

943
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,536
- You're so good.
- You couldn't hear anything?

944
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,105
Her lips…

945
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,375
HE CAN'T LIE THOUGH

946
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,978
Can't you give them one more chance?

947
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,514
Can't you give them one more chance?

948
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,749
I HAVE TO DO THIS ONE MORE TIME?

949
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,617
- One more time.
- Hang on.

950
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,918
The game is pretty short.

951
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,754
Can I give it a shot?

952
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,690
- Go ahead, Woo-jae. Wait, not Woo-jae?
- No.

953
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,258
I thought about it.

954
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,527
I think I can do it easily
if it's at this level.

955
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,329
- But wait.
- Okay.

956
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,464
The words were… How should I put this?

957
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,867
- The explanations were too long.
- They were.

958
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,002
- Then, Woo-young should try.
- How many did we get?

959
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,904
You were aiming for seven but you got six.

960
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,806
- That's close enough.
- It was so close.

961
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,775
PLEASE END IT HERE

962
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,610
- What does that mean?
- Come, Woo-young.

963
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,246
Let us try one more time
since it's Chuseok.

964
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,580
- Let Woo-young try.
- Once more.

965
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,783
Forget that. All we need
is for In-seok to say that

966
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,785
we just need six correct answers.

967
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,520
It's so simple. Don't complicate it.

968
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,255
Can't I give it a try though?

969
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,826
JANG WOO-YOUNG, THAT PSYCHO

970
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,728
WOO-JAE IS BACKED INTO A CORNER

971
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,698
HOW WILL HE GET OUT OF THIS?

972
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,335
HE STANDS UP

973
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,238
What?

974
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:38,076
- There's no battery.
- Then, how about this?

975
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,046
HE WHISPERS SOMETHING IN SECRET
TO WOO-YOUNG

976
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,484
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

977
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,353
We calculated one guess
per 20 seconds, right?

978
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,621
So Woo-young can…

979
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,923
THERE'S NO POINT IN TELLING WOO-YOUNG

980
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,825
How about two guesses per 30 seconds?

981
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,294
THEN…

982
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,895
Two guesses per 30 seconds?

983
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,664
Yes, two guesses per 30 seconds.

984
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,801
WHAT IS WOO-JAE'S SECOND SOLUTION?

985
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,869
Okay, let's give it a try.

986
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,238
HE WALKS STRAIGHT TO THE AUDIO TEAM

987
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,208
- It cut off towards the end.
- Okay.

988
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,677
So if Woo-young does it now,

989
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,612
it won't work at all.

990
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,248
I think there might be some power left.

991
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,484
- It won't work at all.
- It won't work?

992
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,419
You may have to keep it plugged into this.

993
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,320
Charge it?

994
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,958
I'll give it a try and if it isn't funny,
we can just cut it out.

995
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,594
- You can just use Woo-jae's.
- Give him the headphones.

996
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,463
BUT THE HEADPHONES RETURNED IMMEDIATELY

997
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,865
Don't use any tricks.

998
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,567
WORRIED

999
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,403
Okay. Guess three answers in a minute.

1000
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,371
Ready.

1001
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,507
Set.

1002
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,444
- Go.
- You got this.

1003
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,614
EXPERIMENT CAMERA?

1004
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,816
All right. You do this

1005
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,518
- in secret.
- I can't hear anything!

1006
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,220
- In secret.
- I can't hear anything!

1007
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,555
You film this in secret.

1008
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,923
You aren't supposed to hear it.

1009
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,359
- You secretly film someone to trick them.
- How did you do it?

1010
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,294
You film someone to trick them.

1011
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,564
I don't think he'll get it.
I bet he'll think it's Hidden Camera.

1012
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,465
Person!

1013
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,201
Filming someone to trick them!

1014
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,235
Love?

1015
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,403
Surprise Camera.

1016
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,539
- Yeah, something like that.
- Something like that.

1017
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,674
Something like that.
It's not Surprise Camera.

1018
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,576
Experiment Camera.

1019
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,745
Experiment Camera.

1020
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,248
How did you guess that?

1021
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,416
- Hurry.
- Hey.

1022
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,684
HE HAS NO CLUE
IT'S A REAL EXPERIMENT CAMERA

1023
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,753
NEXT TOPIC: JOO WOO-JAE

1024
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,888
- Hey. Today…
- Hurry.

1025
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,090
WHAT?
JOO WOO-JAE

1026
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,560
Remember that we have a star?

1027
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,727
- Today's star?
- Stomp?

1028
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,297
Remember that we have a star?

1029
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,498
- Today's star?
- Stomp?

1030
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,266
The star of Experiment Camera.

1031
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,504
- Experiment Camera.
- Who's the star of Experiment Camera?

1032
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,572
The stomp?

1033
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,140
Today's Experiment Camera's star.

1034
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,241
- Joo Woo-jae!
- Okay!

1035
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,409
Experiment Camera.

1036
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,778
- Who's the star of Experiment Camera?
- What?

1037
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,147
- The stomp?
- Today's Experiment Camera's star.

1038
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,815
- Joo Woo-jae!
- Okay!

1039
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,017
- Joo Woo-jae.
- Another one.

1040
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,352
- Is that it?
- Joo Woo-jae!

1041
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,253
- Time's up?
- Yeah.

1042
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,988
- Time's up.
- Okay.

1043
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,123
Is it Woo-jae?

1044
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,026
THE EXPERIMENT CAMERA WAS A HUGE SUCCESS

1045
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,261
Is it Woo-jae?

1046
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,599
JOO WOO-JAE WAS COMPLETELY FOOLED

1047
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,833
Wait, is it Woo-jae?

1048
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,069
- It's Woo-jae.
- Is it?

1049
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,171
- Is it Woo-jae?
- Why are you in the corner?

1050
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,839
- Is it Woo-jae?
- Is this for real?

1051
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,674
- Is it really Woo-jae?
- You're so nice!

1052
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,243
You're so nice!

1053
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,944
Geez. My face is turning super red.

1054
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:27,945
Is it Woo-jae?

1055
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,647
Woo-jae.

1056
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,415
My goodness. What got into you?

1057
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,352
The first episode's star of<i> Screwballs:</i>
<i>Deconstruction Show</i> is Woo-jae!

1058
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,554
THE FIRST STAR, JOO WOO-JAE!

1059
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,223
What? What the heck?

1060
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,526
- Joo Woo-jae!
- Joo Woo-jae!

1061
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,694
What got into you?

1062
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,929
What is all this?

1063
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,130
- You're so nice.
- We did it!

1064
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,798
How do you feel right now?

1065
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,133
Woo-jae was fooled.

1066
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,401
Why are you so nice?

1067
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,836
HE IS DUMBFOUNDED

1068
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,604
How much of it was real?

1069
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,706
It was fake from the start.

1070
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,944
Your Experiment Camera
was in motion from the get-go.

1071
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,246
I am so humiliated right now.

1072
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,515
Woo-jae. Hey, Woo-jae.

1073
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,083
This feels amazing.

1074
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,986
You know, this is why
I am feeling emotional right now.

1075
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,255
I couldn't hear anything
from the headphones,

1076
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,125
so I acted like I could.

1077
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,259
We know. We know all of it.

1078
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,794
- You knew all about it?
- Yeah.

1079
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,397
- You acted well.
- You were so nice.

1080
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,765
You're an actor.

1081
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,967
- He's an actor all right.
- He sure is an actor.

1082
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,703
We knew he could hear us
but he acted like he couldn't.

1083
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,637
It was hilarious.

1084
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,607
Listen, Soon-kyu was about to cry!

1085
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,475
You're the best, Soon-kyu!

1086
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,210
CHUCKLE

1087
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,348
- What did you say?
- You know,

1088
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,050
I have never been in

1089
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,086
such an uncomfortable situation
in my career on television.

1090
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,987
So…

1091
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,323
- Soon-kyu did a good job of acting.
- He did.

1092
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,724
He was good too.

1093
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,093
He looked so upset since this morning.

1094
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,062
LAUGHING

1095
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,230
And he kept on saying,

1096
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,366
"The mood is very unsettling today."

1097
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,668
He kept on setting the mood like that,
so I didn't even…

1098
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,970
The mood is very unsettling today.

1099
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,839
It's kind of unsettling today, isn't it?

1100
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:02,973
KEPT BRAINWASHING HIM
THAT IT WAS UNSETTLING

1101
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,375
What time did you get here today?

1102
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,877
What time did I get here?
About nine o'clock?

1103
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,412
We got here at 7:50.

1104
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,482
- We were in a meeting for an hour.
- We had a meeting.

1105
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,117
All of us were so nervous

1106
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,953
that you would figure it out.

1107
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,090
Didn't you sense something strange
when you got here?

1108
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,658
- Did you feel--
- No, I didn't.

1109
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,626
No one asked for your help?

1110
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,363
ASK FOR HELP?

1111
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,400
THEY CALLED WOO-JAE FIRST
DURING THE OPENING

1112
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,902
THEY HAD A WARM-UP SESSION
BEFORE THE MAIN EXPERIMENT CAMERA BEGAN

1113
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,070
- Go now.
- Now?

1114
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,271
Go now.

1115
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,641
THE YOUNGEST WRITERS MAKE A MOVE

1116
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,711
SHE CAN'T GRAB SOMETHING
FROM THE TOP OF THE BOOKSHELF

1117
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,647
HOW WILL WOO-JAE REACT?

1118
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,852
THEIR ENTHUSIASTIC ACTING BEGINS

1119
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,621
STRUGGLING

1120
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,325
NO ONE CAN HELP THEM
DUE TO THE FAKE MEETING

1121
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,261
GLANCING OVER

1122
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,664
HE'S VERY BUSY

1123
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,538
You'll be revealing his true colors.

1124
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,706
He's really inconsiderate.

1125
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,307
Okay, we get it.

1126
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,642
LAUGHING

1127
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,713
GLANCING OVER

1128
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,050
WHY AREN'T THE OTHER MEMBERS COMING?

1129
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,822
DESPITE THEIR ENTHUSIASTIC ACTING,
WOO-JAE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THEM

1130
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,195
I'll get it for you.

1131
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,563
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1132
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,001
THE TALL HEARTTHROB
SAW THE STRUGGLE OF THE SHORTIES

1133
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,970
- This one?
- Thank you.

1134
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,472
- This one?
- Yeah.

1135
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,741
- That's it?
- Yes.

1136
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,677
TURNING AWAY

1137
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,180
You think you're so great?

1138
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,347
WHATEVER

1139
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,150
- He helped them.
- He did.

1140
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,452
Didn't you help them?

1141
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,520
- Grabbing those for them?
- Yeah.

1142
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,588
No wonder.

1143
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,825
- Hey, where's that youngest writer?
- We did it!

1144
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,226
We got you.

1145
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,427
You know, I had a feeling.

1146
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,529
- What?
- They had something to grab from here

1147
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,932
and these two small women…

1148
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,835
Usually after a few tries,
you'd ask for help, right?

1149
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,102
They were acting like this.

1150
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,104
THEY REPEATED THIS ENDLESSLY

1151
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,841
They kept doing that. It kept bugging me.

1152
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,676
That was fake too?

1153
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,677
It started with that.

1154
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,078
You survived it, Woo-jae.

1155
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,281
You know, Woo-jae is
so much nicer than I expected.

1156
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,183
You know,

1157
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,552
<i>why would there be</i>
<i>a water bottle all the way up there?</i>

1158
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,422
Now that you think about it…

1159
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,257
- Now that I think about it…
- It was strange.

1160
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,192
And you know what else was strange?

1161
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,361
I get why they needed to get the bottle.

1162
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,230
But why remove the globe?

1163
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,000
The mood was so tense

1164
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,003
that I took the necklace off
when Producer Park came in.

1165
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,872
<i>I took it off when he brought it up.</i>

1166
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,407
I thought he kept asking me cluelessly,

1167
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,742
"What's wrong with my necklace?"

1168
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,377
He kept saying crap like that.

1169
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,679
Right?

1170
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,981
The mood was so tense!

1171
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,250
That's why when you were
sitting on the sofa,

1172
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,820
I told you to take off your necklace
through my teeth.

1173
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,457
And then, I said the mood is
very tense right now.

1174
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,759
What? Why?

1175
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,160
- Because of the mic?
- Try to…

1176
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,161
Okay.

1177
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,430
Safety first.

1178
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,598
YOU NEVER KNOW

1179
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,066
THE MOOD IS VERY TENSE

1180
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,602
It's kind of unsettling today, isn't it?

1181
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,437
KEEPS SAYING IT'S UNSETTLING

1182
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,039
Did someone say something?

1183
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,308
No, I'll tell you later.

1184
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,110
Geez. I want to know.

1185
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,312
- You want to know?
- What is it?

1186
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,480
I'm not going to tell you.

1187
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,948
You're so annoying.

1188
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:31,982
HE REFRAINS FROM SPEAKING
BECAUSE OF THE MIC

1189
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,385
Is it because of this? Is it?

1190
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,420
He came to me earlier.

1191
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,688
I had no idea that

1192
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,924
- it was after Soon-kyu came to him.
- He came here.

1193
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,325
I didn't know. But he kept going…

1194
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,662
So the mic wouldn't hear it?

1195
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,430
So I realized it was going well.

1196
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,399
I felt so confident
about it from that point.

1197
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:49,767
We did it.

1198
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,001
We're almost there.

1199
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,070
He kept saying, "In-seok."

1200
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,573
He kept doing this by himself.

1201
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,875
What did Soon-kyu say to you?

1202
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,244
- Man.
- Do you want to know what I did?

1203
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,513
- I was…
- I want to see it.

1204
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,549
I had to get some touch-up on my makeup.

1205
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,953
If I was sitting here,
Soon-kyu came to me…

1206
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,156
and said "Woo-jae."

1207
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,494
I'm serious. He was already crying.

1208
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,196
He's denying it.

1209
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,431
HE'S MAKING IT UP

1210
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,100
"Could you do me a favor?"

1211
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,636
"The headphones are my mistake."

1212
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,439
"I only brought one,
but even that one ran out of power,

1213
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,274
so it may stop working."

1214
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,175
"Can you…"

1215
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,843
I'm not kidding.

1216
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,846
"Can you act like you can hear it
even if you can't?"

1217
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,082
The song…

1218
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,787
- Woo-jae, you're so nice.
- That's when I first started to panic.

1219
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,689
So when I asked him

1220
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,092
<i>if we will play this game only once,</i>
<i>he said yes.</i>

1221
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:52,296
- So I acted my way through it, right?
- Yeah.

1222
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,632
But that psycho kept
insisting on trying it!

1223
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:55,833
THAT PSYCHO!

1224
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,235
He kept saying
we should do it one more time.

1225
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,605
I don't know if the camera caught this,
but after the game,

1226
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:05,743
<i>I kept looking this way and that way</i>
<i>and stayed quiet.</i>

1227
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,378
- I just stayed like that.
- Yeah.

1228
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,646
I was wondering,

1229
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,948
why did you turn the music on for me?

1230
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,116
They turned it on for you?

1231
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:16,920
THEY PLAYED THE MUSIC BY ACCIDENT

1232
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,690
Why was I actually playing the game?

1233
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,258
I was doing it!

1234
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,961
I really couldn't hear anything!

1235
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,764
So do you know what I thought to myself?

1236
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,298
"Could it be me?"

1237
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,834
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
REVERSE EXPERIMENT CAMERA

1238
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,336
It was such a build-up.

1239
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,938
They would go this far?

1240
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,342
I woke up at 5:30 in the morning

1241
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,078
to come here,
but they've set me up like this?

1242
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,713
Oh, so you thought--

1243
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,114
- "Is it me?"
- I couldn't hear a thing!

1244
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,617
You thought they told you
that they're fooling me,

1245
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,951
but they're actually fooling you

1246
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,320
<i>- so that your name would appear there?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1247
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,691
I felt so confused for a split second.

1248
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:54,792
All by myself…

1249
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,594
But I saw Woo-jae's name there.

1250
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,929
And I felt it turn off.

1251
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,498
So I thought, "That's right.
It is Woo-jae." And I continued on.

1252
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,700
This is too funny.

1253
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:07,104
Then, were you going to keep this secret
between you and Soon-kyu forever?

1254
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,307
They asked us to remove our mics
so I wasn't wearing a mic.

1255
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,943
I wouldn't have said that if I had my mic.

1256
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,912
- Since we removed the mics,
- You even thought of that?

1257
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,347
I told Soon-kyu, "I got it."

1258
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,149
"I'll take care of it. Don't worry."

1259
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,217
You're awesome.

1260
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,118
After I said that,

1261
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,920
- you see--
- I told you he'd brag about it.

1262
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,222
I hadn't expected the music to

1263
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,092
stop that early on.

1264
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,960
Then, you turned it off.

1265
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,462
- No, we didn't.
- They turned it off.

1266
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,932
Maybe you didn't hear it
because it was too loud,

1267
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,601
but we even recorded and played
the sound you hear

1268
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,370
when the headphones' battery runs out.

1269
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,840
They're screwballs.

1270
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,942
How did you think of recording that?

1271
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,143
MY HEAD IS SPINNING

1272
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,645
Should we take a break?
He's having a hard time.

1273
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,280
He's in shock right now.

1274
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,949
He looks so spooked.

1275
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,984
All the writers are smitten with him.

1276
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,587
THEY'VE FALLEN FOR WOO-JAE ALREADY

1277
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,389
Then, since when was it?

1278
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,358
Was it when I came to work today?

1279
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,259
Before you even came.

1280
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,595
Of course. That's why
we asked you to come in late.

1281
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,463
Geez. This is Deconstruction Show?

1282
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,665
The crew did such a good job. Well done.

1283
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,734
They did it.

1284
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,170
This is the success of thorough planning.

1285
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,372
- Thorough planning.
- Planning?

1286
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,975
No, it is the success story
of your character, Woo-jae.

1287
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:18,909
I know.

1288
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,043
- Woo-jae, Woo-jae.
- Then,

1289
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,746
I have a question at this point.

1290
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:27,151
Jin-kyung, did you explain it
difficultly on purpose

1291
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,787
or did you just explain it that way?

1292
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,322
- I worked really hard to explain those.
- Really?

1293
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,558
- Seriously?
- Her explanation

1294
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,226
for Captain Hook was so complicated.

1295
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,095
I thought you used your brain for once.

1296
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,062
Me too.

1297
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,698
- G-DRAGON too.
- I thought she was trying to get it wrong.

1298
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,301
Look, can I tell you honestly?

1299
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,637
I forgot that we were
doing a prank at that moment.

1300
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,073
It's possible with Jin-kyung.

1301
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,676
SHE REALIZED IT WAS THE EXPERIMENT CAMERA
SO HER SHORT-TERM MEMORY WON IN THE END

1302
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,278
I wonder if I'll be viewed as the villain.

1303
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,383
All right. As we told you before,
you can view the Experiment Camera

1304
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:02,085
- as the opening for season three.
- Announcing the start.

1305
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,321
- It was done so well.
- So well.

1306
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,191
We will now properly begin
the Joo Woo-jae Deconstruction Show.

1307
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,459
But he's totally out of it right now.
Is it okay?

1308
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,128
He looks very deconstructed.

1309
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,363
He looks upset
about being fooled for the first time.

1310
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,834
So today's episode
isn't Jin-kyung's Deconstruction Show?

1311
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,335
- Exactly.
- You're the star today.

1312
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:21,038
I just can't grasp when it started.

1313
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,873
From now on, there's no Experiment Camera.

1314
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,010
- And it'll be a show about you, Woo-jae.
- My Deconstruction Show?

1315
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,313
Remember the four games
related to Jin-kyung?

1316
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,281
Games like Everyday is New,
Aren't We All Pros?

1317
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,450
What Color Do You Like? They don't exist.

1318
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,918
- Okay.
- They don't exist.

1319
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,488
DUMBFOUNDED

1320
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,425
Now, we will properly start
the Joo Woo-jae Deconstruction Show.

1321
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,061
When you think of Woo-jae on <i>Screwballs</i>

1322
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,431
or just Woo-jae,
what kind of image pops into your head?

1323
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,899
- Clever?
- Smart.

1324
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,500
- Clever and smart.
- Yes.

1325
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,237
- I can only answer this sincerely.
- Okay.

1326
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,472
I know the real Woo-jae much better than

1327
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,342
the Woo-jae from <i>Screwballs</i>.

1328
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,411
He's a friend who is like a hand warmer.

1329
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,947
He gets warm when you turn him on.

1330
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,116
- Usually--
- Hand warmers don't last long.

1331
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:07,651
- No.
- They break easily.

1332
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,454
- I know, right?
- He doesn't do much usually,

1333
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,055
but if I turn him on when I need help,

1334
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,358
he becomes so warm.
That's the kind of friend he is.

1335
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,359
That's pretty feeble.

1336
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,895
Excuse me, but check out
Jin-kyung's facial expression.

1337
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:18,929
What do you think?

1338
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:19,863
HE'S WARM? HOW?

1339
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,764
As for me,

1340
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,432
if he thinks Woo-jae is a hand warmer,

1341
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,700
I think he's an ice pack.

1342
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,070
He is somewhat cold,

1343
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:30,841
but it also keeps fish from going bad.

1344
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,277
- It prevents the fishy smell.
- What does she mean?

1345
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,311
Is that good though?

1346
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,213
- It's good, right?
- Yeah, it is.

1347
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,215
- He's cold but beneficial.
- Cold but beneficial.

1348
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,416
- I'm useful.
- Yes.

1349
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,884
- Yes, you're useful.
- For fish.

1350
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,920
I'll get it for you.

1351
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,555
HE IS DEFINITELY USEFUL FOR THIS

1352
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,592
All those countless days
you were outsmarted by Woo-jae.

1353
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,060
- Well.
- Is it payback time?

1354
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,561
- There were many, right?
- It's time.

1355
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:54,498
Woo-jae would
always take first place, didn't he?

1356
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,768
The time has finally come
to get even for all those

1357
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,937
- infuriating moments.
- We will?

1358
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:04,341
We planned this so that you can
join forces to beat Woo-jae today.

1359
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,710
All the games will be him
against the four of you.

1360
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,878
Nice.

1361
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,947
- Let's do it.
- I think we have a shot.

1362
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,615
- You know what?
- You're relentless.

1363
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,350
I don't think it's a disadvantage at all.

1364
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,520
- I mean it.
- Why don't we

1365
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,855
just send Woo-young and Jin-kyung
to his side?

1366
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,525
That would be more disadvantageous for me.

1367
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,727
- They went easy on us.
- What about the four of you?

1368
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,763
- The four of us joining forces
- Not so much.

1369
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,799
doesn't mean we'll get any smarter.

1370
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,667
It doesn't boost our confidence much.

1371
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,602
I think it's worth a shot.

1372
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,174
So we will begin
the one-against-four games.

1373
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,345
Here's the first game.
It's called Joo Woo-jae's Comment Quiz.

1374
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,214
- We'll be good at these.
- Comment?

1375
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,451
Reporters and fans alike who love Woo-jae

1376
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,987
<i>left lots of witty</i>
<i>and heartfelt article titles</i>

1377
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,456
- and comments.
- I'm not good at these.

1378
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,758
<i>So we blocked out some of</i>

1379
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,362
<i>the article titles</i>
<i>and videos shown on screen.</i>

1380
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:02,332
<i>You have to guess</i>
<i>what goes in those blank spaces.</i>

1381
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,700
I like blank spaces.

1382
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,069
Jang Woo-young's girlfriend is "blank."

1383
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,972
Since it's Joo Woo-jae's special,

1384
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,009
if he wins the one-against-four game,

1385
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,677
we will prepare the lunch menu

1386
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,114
- with a "Woo-jae" meal.
- No!

1387
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,315
No!

1388
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,550
Come on. I want some rice.

1389
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,119
Are we going to get gummies?

1390
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,987
- Something like <i>rasgulla</i>.
- Geez.

1391
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,889
Will we get Korean food if we win?

1392
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,658
- So if the four of you win, you get…
- Okay.

1393
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,559
…a huge Korean feast.

1394
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,128
- Okay, let's do this.
- Darn it.

1395
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,329
<i>- Let's win.</i>
<i>- We have to win.</i>

1396
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,031
<i>- We have to win.</i>
<i>- Stake our lives on it.</i>

1397
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,967
- I don't want to eat gummies.
- Why would you want to eat Korean food?

1398
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,770
There are some edible things
in a Woo-jae meal.

1399
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,104
<i>- Macarons…</i>
<i>- Nice.</i>

1400
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,472
<i>- …pancakes…</i>
<i>- Very nice.</i>

1401
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,174
<i>- …Taiwanese sandwiches…</i>
<i>- I love it.</i>

1402
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,275
<i>…and things like that.</i>

1403
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,576
A TABLE FULL OF SWEETS

1404
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,846
Woo-jae meal and the Korean meal
are at stake.

1405
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,081
We have to win this.

1406
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,083
- That's the game.
- This is your last chance

1407
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,786
because I am kind of out of it right now.

1408
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,155
- I haven't gotten out of this daze yet.
- Okay.

1409
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,489
Okay, let's do this.

1410
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,690
I'm drained.

1411
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,359
We have an advantage.

1412
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,094
Here's the first quiz.

1413
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:09,232
JOO WOO-JAE, WAKING UP "BLANK" IN ME
WHAT GOES IN THE BLANK?

1414
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,901
HMM…

1415
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:11,868
I got it!

1416
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,438
Can I answer it?

1417
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,806
Woo-jae.

1418
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,707
I'm sorry, but I'm going to guess it.

1419
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,009
- Already?
- You remember it?

1420
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,812
- May I guess it?
- Yes.

1421
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,447
Once again, I'm sorry.

1422
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,948
- Sorry.
- He's so annoying.

1423
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,084
May I really answer it?

1424
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,052
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1425
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,088
It's Black Dragon.

1426
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:33,590
- What?
- Black what?

1427
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:34,558
I'm sorry.

1428
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:35,592
- What?
- How are we

1429
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,394
- supposed to get that?
- How can we know that?

1430
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,629
- No one else would get it but me.
- Black Dragon.

1431
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,232
- We get it.
- Do you read all the articles about you?

1432
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,334
No. I used that expression a lot

1433
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,402
- at one point.
- Dragon?

1434
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,838
"Waking up the Black Dragon in me."
I said that a lot.

1435
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,240
Let's make that the practice round.
That was just practice.

1436
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,908
It was too hard. How can we guess that?

1437
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,743
- What the heck?
- It isn't practice.

1438
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,945
JUST MAKE IT A PRACTICE ROUND

1439
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:55,979
What are you doing?

1440
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,114
- Practice.
- Is this a prank?

1441
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,582
We don't know what that is.

1442
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,351
We know what a black goat is
but a black dragon?

1443
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,620
Today is just a day
where I have to concede everything.

1444
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,822
Moving on to the next quiz.

1445
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,157
Okay, I get it now.

1446
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,826
JOO WOO-JAE "BLANK"

1447
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,927
Look at his face.

1448
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,762
What's up with his face? When was that?

1449
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,664
Why are his bangs so straight?

1450
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,533
- He looks very sick.
- He does.

1451
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,636
THEY SAY
I LOOK VERY SICK

1452
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,271
Woo-jae. I got it.

1453
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,406
"Joo Woo-jae, I am sick."

1454
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,544
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1455
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,279
You want to eat a Woo-jae meal, don't you?

1456
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,213
That's incorrect.

1457
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,182
It could be something like this. I got it.

1458
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,185
"Joo Woo-jae, bang, bang, bang."

1459
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,686
IS HE JUST A SABOTEUR?

1460
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,587
Incorrect.

1461
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,856
Are his fingers supposed to be
some kind of hint?

1462
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,458
His hand area is a hint.

1463
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,161
My hand area?

1464
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,962
It must not be my fingers.

1465
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,164
- I got it.
- I got it.

1466
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,832
- It's my turn.
- Go on, Woo-jae.

1467
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,001
"Joo Woo-jae, read my palm."

1468
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,303
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

1469
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,905
"Joo Woo-jae, his wispy wrist."

1470
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,374
"Joo Woo-jae, his wispy wrist."

1471
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,476
He must be right.

1472
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:00,877
IS IT RIGHT?

1473
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,612
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

1474
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,648
- His wispy three fingers.
- Incorrect.

1475
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:08,118
I got it.
"Joo Woo-jae, his wispy fingers."

1476
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,085
That's incorrect.

1477
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,020
I got it.

1478
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,087
It's Woo-jae's turn.

1479
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,424
If it's one against four,
shouldn't we get four turns?

1480
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,692
We only get one chance.

1481
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,660
Give us four chances.

1482
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,861
He's right!

1483
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,263
- Yeah, he has more chances.
- Exactly.

1484
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,165
- That's right.
- We need to start over.

1485
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,934
- That's right.
- He's smart.

1486
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,702
They can discuss with each other.

1487
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,337
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.

1488
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,172
Just answer randomly. What do you think?

1489
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,640
- Random? Let's go randomly.
- Yeah.

1490
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,108
- Let's go randomly.
- Yeah.

1491
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,176
That's not in my favor.

1492
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,145
Come on, man!

1493
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,047
Nobody wants your macarons!

1494
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,316
I'm serious!

1495
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,084
All right. Go ahead.

1496
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,185
Woo-young.

1497
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,388
"Joo Woo-jae, his wispy palm."

1498
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,591
- Wispy palm?
- There's no "wispy."

1499
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,759
Oh, it must be his wrist.

1500
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,795
Sae-ho. I got it.

1501
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,663
"Joo Woo-jae,
his wrist is about to break."

1502
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:55,632
I like it.

1503
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,100
You can't break that.

1504
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,469
- It's in the right direction.
- Right?

1505
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:03,440
- Is it like UFC or something?
- Broken? Oh, about to break.

1506
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,541
Give us the first letter.

1507
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,742
You'll get it immediately.

1508
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,077
Let's give it a shot.

1509
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,311
- Let's try guessing it.
- Yeah.

1510
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:09,579
It starts with S.

1511
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,248
We can guess immediately with that?

1512
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,816
- S.
- S?

1513
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,484
Who? Who can guess that?

1514
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,819
- With S.
- Who?

1515
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,020
IT STARTS WITH S

1516
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,888
"Joo Woo-jae, surprisingly he's standing."

1517
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,925
Nice. I like it.

1518
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,461
Is it three words?

1519
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,463
- Yes.
- Three words.

1520
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,364
It's S?

1521
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,298
- S?
- S.

1522
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,400
- I'll reveal the answer.
- Wait.

1523
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:31,768
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

1524
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,770
No, no, no.

1525
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,072
- We don't have to eat.
- Next letter.

1526
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,108
- The next one?
- Hurry up!

1527
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,443
We're determined. We're going to guess it.

1528
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,511
It's S, W.

1529
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,680
S and W? Sae-ho! I got it.

1530
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,981
Give me a round of applause.

1531
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,750
Applause!

1532
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,251
- Applause.
- Okay!

1533
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,053
His slim wrist.

1534
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,954
Correct.

1535
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,856
We did it!

1536
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:53,957
Slim.

1537
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,826
JOO WOO-JAE, HIS SLIM WRIST

1538
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,195
WANTING TO CRY

1539
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,331
People don't use the word "slim"
for that, do they?

1540
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,600
They don't? I hear it all the time.

1541
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,802
My articles contained
the word "slim" a lot.

1542
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,038
- Slim.
- I haven't seen that before.

1543
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,472
It's been a long time.

1544
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,142
- The next one is a nice photo of Woo-jae.
- Okay.

1545
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,044
- A photo where he looks cool.
- Let's see.

1546
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,944
JOO WOO-JAE "BLANK, BEST"

1547
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,212
<i>He looks good.</i>

1548
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,814
<i>- He does look good in it.</i>
<i>- When is it?</i>

1549
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,015
<i>Looks like an awards show.</i>

1550
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,850
- Did we win an award for <i>Beat Coin</i>?
- Right?

1551
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,652
- Looks like The Entertainment Awards.
- It does.

1552
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,955
It's "Joo Woo-jae, blank, best."

1553
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,124
Woo-jae.

1554
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,159
"Joo Woo-jae,

1555
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:31,961
MC."

1556
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,730
- "MC, Best"
- MC?

1557
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,432
That's incorrect.

1558
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,000
- It's a taunt.
- It is.

1559
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,636
I don't think it has
anything to do with his gaze.

1560
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:40,637
Joo Woo-jae…

1561
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,873
Honestly, this is the first time
I am seeing this word in a title.

1562
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,209
It isn't used often?

1563
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,411
They changed some of the words.

1564
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,647
- They made a new word?
- Yes.

1565
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,649
- You want us to guess that?
- It's a new word?

1566
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,785
There are many words that come to mind
when you think of Woo-jae.

1567
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,587
- Tell us.
- Combine them?

1568
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,155
"Joo Woo-jae."

1569
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,757
SMIRKING

1570
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,025
"Bone, Best."

1571
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,493
Incorrect.

1572
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,095
"Joo Woo-jae, Comedian to the bone, Best."

1573
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,129
Call out your name.

1574
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,665
- Sae-ho. I got it.
- Okay.

1575
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,200
"Comedian to the bone, Best."

1576
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,634
- Comedian to the bone?
- Yes.

1577
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,936
Incorrect.

1578
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,537
- Woo-young.
- Yes.

1579
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,638
Proud of his bones.

1580
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,639
- Oh!
- No.

1581
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,007
That sounded good.

1582
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,309
Was that close?

1583
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,343
Yes, it was.

1584
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,146
"PROUD OF HIS BONES" IS CLOSE?

1585
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,714
Sae-ho! I got it.

1586
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,116
- Give me a hand.
- Applause!

1587
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,318
I GOT IT AGAIN!

1588
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,753
- I want to do it.
- No.

1589
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:30,820
I want to do it.

1590
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,390
I got a feeling just now.

1591
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,958
Bone visuals.

1592
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,493
Correct.

1593
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,195
Bone visuals. Like his visuals. Get it?

1594
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,196
SNORTS

1595
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,098
- Bone visuals. I see.
- We can eat Korean food!

1596
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,400
We can eat Korean food.

1597
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:46,503
- We're doing it.
- You know what? I got this feeling

1598
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,004
as if I was being possessed.

1599
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,939
"Bone visuals" just popped in.

1600
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,441
- Really?
- Wow.

1601
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,376
You know, that reporter is pretty witty.

1602
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,044
- They used "bone visuals."
- Bone visuals.

1603
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,813
- It's very clever.
- Very good.

1604
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,282
- Shall we move on to comments?
- Okay.

1605
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,518
- Let's move on to that.
- I'll guess all of them.

1606
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,787
- He'll do well with comments.
- Yeah.

1607
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,423
- I'm glad we got some already.
- These are comments for Screwballs.

1608
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,626
WOW, HE'S TALL, GOOD AT MATH,
RICH, AND HANDSOME BUT BLANK

1609
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,127
I remember seeing this.

1610
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,964
I got it! Woo-jae.

1611
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,034
"Wow, he's tall, good at math, rich,
and handsome, but I'm not intrigued."

1612
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,505
DID HE JUST GET THE ANSWER RIGHT?

1613
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,407
That's correct.

1614
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,743
- That was right?
- How did you know?

1615
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,078
- The context--
- Did you write it?

1616
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,347
Why would I write that about myself?

1617
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:36,286
Why would I put myself down like that?

1618
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,555
This was also a practice round
for comments, right?

1619
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,157
- Enough with this nonsense.
- He's right.

1620
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,592
Stop messing around.

1621
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:43,693
He's right.

1622
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,963
- So this is how it's done.
- The first one should be a practice round.

1623
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,997
Go.

1624
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,732
- Moving on.
- Okay.

1625
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:54,304
BLANK SPEAKS VERY WELL

1626
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,172
"Blank speaks very well."

1627
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,341
That one had 15,000 likes.

1628
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,644
- Woo-jae.
- Go ahead.

1629
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,513
The young kid speaks very well?

1630
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,648
- No, that's not it.
- Incorrect.

1631
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,952
I got it. The wax figure.

1632
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,720
- That's incorrect.
- I got it. The skeleton.

1633
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,489
- Incorrect.
- Oh, okay.

1634
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,790
- Did you get a feeling?
- Yeah.

1635
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,225
- You did?
- You got a feeling?

1636
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,494
"The hanger speaks very well."

1637
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,895
- He got it.
- He got it.

1638
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,763
THEY GOT IT AGAIN?

1639
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,867
CORRECT!

1640
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,568
- You got it!
- Wow!

1641
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,337
You really do get a feeling!

1642
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,404
- You see?
- All of a sudden?

1643
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,340
There must be a certain period.

1644
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,675
- I really did get a feeling.
- You do.

1645
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,043
- I just felt it.
- I know.

1646
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,111
THIS IS FUN

1647
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,113
THIS IS HILARIOUS

1648
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,115
Let me ask you this just in case.

1649
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,150
Is this Experiment Camera?

1650
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,519
Is this included?

1651
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,419
No, it isn't.

1652
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:44,621
From this morning…

1653
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,390
- It isn't?
- No, it isn't.

1654
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,158
- So funny.
- By the way,

1655
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,896
- you did get this eerie feeling, right?
- Yeah, I felt it.

1656
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,797
- It's clear.
- You'll definitely feel it.

1657
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,065
Okay.

1658
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,333
Moving onto the next one.

1659
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,136
IT FEELS LIKE BLANK
THE CHEMISTRY OF THESE TWO ARE INSANE

1660
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,704
"It feels like blank."

1661
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,008
It has to do
with their insane chemistry, right?

1662
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,142
Yes, it does.

1663
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,210
I got it!

1664
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,213
What's that group?
Singers made up of two guys.

1665
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,515
- It's two comedians.
- I got it.

1666
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,651
Their songs are always unsuccessful.

1667
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,120
Their music video
barely gets 100,000 views.

1668
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,388
- Who are they?
- ChoNam Zone.

1669
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,756
ChoNam Zone!

1670
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:21,157
It feels like ChoNam Zone.

1671
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:22,859
What?

1672
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,327
WHAT DID YOU SAY, YOU JERK?

1673
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,063
Let's say that's correct.

1674
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,831
Was he close?

1675
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,433
ChoNam Zone is in it.

1676
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,734
What? For real?

1677
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,803
I got it.

1678
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,471
"It feels like ChoNam Zone

1679
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,073
- but the handsome version.
- No, Sook.

1680
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,309
The chemistry of these two are insane."

1681
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,210
- I'll say this is correct.
- Really?

1682
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,412
Add it to the front.

1683
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,213
THE HANDSOME VERSION OF CHONAM ZONE

1684
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,816
CORRECT

1685
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,318
WE ARE SO HAPPY

1686
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,956
- Why are you upset? We got it right!
- Smile!

1687
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,592
- Then, ChoNam Zone was right.
- Smile, okay?

1688
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,994
- It's a good thing.
- You know,

1689
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,163
I am thankful about it in a way.

1690
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,498
It means more people
are aware of ChoNam Zone.

1691
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,033
- Yeah.
- That's why I was surprised.

1692
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,401
WHILE SAE-HO WAS EXPRESSING
HIS APPRECIATION FOR THEIR POPULARITY

1693
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,770
IN THE NEXT QUIZ

1694
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,872
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS CATCHING UP TO THEM

1695
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,909
THE ETC TEAM KEPT GETTING
POSSESSED BY THE ENTERTAINMENT GOD

1696
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,243
I got it. Ddochi.

1697
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,445
- Yeah!
- Yes.

1698
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,913
I got the feeling again.

1699
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,016
TOTAL FAILURE

1700
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,884
- This is hard.
- It's hard.

1701
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,987
The final score is seven to three.

1702
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,022
- Our--
- Let's eat some marinated crab.

1703
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,423
- Let's eat crab.
- Look.

1704
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,727
You should have protected
the player before you started.

1705
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,796
You had me play these games
feeling nearly dead from the start,

1706
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,999
so my brain wasn't working.

1707
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,533
Isn't that what
the Deconstruction Show is all about?

1708
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,668
- Let's go.
- You know,

1709
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,838
- I've never seen him like this.
- Yeah.

1710
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:42,739
He's drained.

1711
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,009
I bet the viewers
feel great about this too.

1712
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,344
ONE HOUR LATER

1713
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,812
Who is it?

1714
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,314
Someone's over here.

1715
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,419
