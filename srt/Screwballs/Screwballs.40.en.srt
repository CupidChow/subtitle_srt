00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,646
ADMIRED LEADER

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,218
TODAY'S DRESS CODE: LEADER

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,955
Hello.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,357
I'm the lead vocalist

9
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,726
of Comfy Relationship.

10
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,528
My name is Kim Sook.

11
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,202
SINGS ROCK AND OPERA WITH EASE

12
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,303
I just couldn't…

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,540
I just couldn't get
the courage to come out.

14
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,542
No matter what I prepare--

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,544
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

16
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,612
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,014
Pardon me,
but what kind of leader are you?

18
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,150
-I'm the leader of a band.
-I see.

19
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,751
-Who are you?
-Actually,

20
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,553
when I heard the word "leader,"

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,588
it reminded me of a dream
I had when I was young.

22
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,823
A leader in fashion.

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,825
I wanted to be a leader in fashion.

24
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,794
Is this what they look like?

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,429
I tried dressing up like one.

26
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,530
Is this what's hot now?

27
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,465
Yeah, I tried dressing up stylishly.

28
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,068
You can call me Ola.

29
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,569
-Oh, Cho Ola.
-Ola.

30
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,737
-Ola.
-Ola!

31
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,838
CHO OLA

32
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,673
-Hey, Ola.
-Ola.

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,108
-Nice to meet you, Ola.
-Yes.

34
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,342
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my.

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,510
-Nice to meet you, Ola.
-Yes.

36
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,812
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my.

37
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,947
-What the heck?
-Ryoiki Tenkai.

38
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,348
-What?
-Muryokusho.

39
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,784
-What? What's he saying?
-Gosh, this is confusing.

40
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,487
-The staff went crazy because of him.
-Who is he?

41
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,155
-They took pictures with him.
-Who is he?

42
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,057
Ryoiki Tenkai Muryokusho.

43
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,460
I think he's supposed to be
a famous anime character.

44
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,595
He crosses his fingers so delicately.

45
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,832
What is that?

46
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,300
When I do this, you die, Sook.

47
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,434
Are you a prisoner?

48
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,903
Tell us. Who are you?

49
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,541
Hi. I'm the leader
of the students of Jujutsu High.

50
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,709
My name is Gojo Satoru.

51
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,144
Are you Japanese?

52
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,512
They wanted photos with him.

53
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,180
-Is he that famous?
-I guess so.

54
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,548
Wait, did someone else die?

55
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,283
How many people is he going to kill?

56
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,553
ACTIVATING DOMAIN EXPANSION

57
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,355
(THE OLDER GUYS ARE CLUELESS)

58
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,623
WHAT IS HE DOING?

59
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,291
Nice to meet you.

60
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,192
Who is he?

61
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,127
Nice to meet you.

62
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,027
Who is he?

63
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,029
I will read your worries and concerns.

64
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,531
Aren't you a leader?

65
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,067
I'm not a leader. I'm a reader.

66
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,271
OH…

67
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,707
I sell books in Apgujeong.

68
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,277
So Woo-young decided to be
a "reader" instead of a "leader."

69
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,178
A twist. I see.

70
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,279
What's your concern?

71
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,148
I have to move.

72
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,415
-You have to move?
-Yes.

73
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,018
I can't decide where to move to.

74
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,086
Two, three.

75
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,220
Shouldn't I be doing that?

76
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,388
-I must do it.
-Okay.

77
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,624
WHEREVER YOU FLIP, THE ANSWER AWAITS

78
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,193
"Boldly discard outdated methods!"

79
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,295
-What?
-Move to a house.

80
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,230
-Abandon the house.
-I think--

81
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,066
-Lately, I've been wanting to go fishing.
-Okay.

82
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,234
Fishing? Okay.

83
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,303
May I stop working and go fishing?

84
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,105
Stop working and go fishing?

85
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,473
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

86
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,009
"Overcome the obstacles in front of you."

87
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,143
Keep working.

88
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,547
Keep working. Okay. What's your concern?

89
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,082
-Ryoiki Tenkai.
-Ryoiki Tenkai?

90
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,518
-Muryokusho.
-"Wrap it up already."

91
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,153
-Wrap it up?
-"Wrap it up already."

92
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,788
Okay. What is your concern?

93
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,191
Hey! It's a curse. Ryoiki Tenkai.

94
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,292
Muryokusho.

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,628
-Who said you could look cool?
-What's your concern?

96
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,830
Put on a funny outfit like his.

97
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,032
-I'm not dressed funny.
-Your concern?

98
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,466
Hang on. Excuse me, I'm not--

99
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,402
You should dress comically like him.

100
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,536
I thought he dressed up.

101
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,039
-He's a fashion leader.
-Look at him.

102
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,373
-What's your concern?
-Ryoiki Tenkai.

103
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,875
-What?
-Your concern.

104
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,843
I want to be funnier.

105
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,712
You want to be funnier? Two, three.

106
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,581
"In your dreams."

107
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,282
"In your dreams."

108
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,819
You're as funny as it gets.

109
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,155
Look at me. Didn't I prepare enough?

110
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,157
HONG JIN-KYUNG IS THE FUNNIEST ONE

111
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,925
JUST LOOKING AT JIN-KYUNG'S FACE
MAKES ME LAUGH

112
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,360
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE, JIN-KYUNG

113
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,896
"BUT I WANT TO BE FUNNIER"
HONG JIN-KYUNG

114
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,331
What are you supposed to be?

115
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,299
I'm Sun Wukong from Journey to the West.

116
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,803
She has such attention to detail.
Can you turn around?

117
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,837
Look at the tail.

118
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,272
-Wow.
-How cute.

119
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,240
THE TAIL DETAIL

120
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,909
Is Sun Wukong
the leader in Journey to the West?

121
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,410
Isn't it Tang Sanzang?

122
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,979
Yeah, it's Tang Sanzang.

123
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,680
I got it wrong.

124
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,882
But the main character is

125
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,150
-Sun Wukong.
-It's Sun Wukong.

126
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,052
Do you know who he is?

127
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,854
I bet she has no idea who he is.

128
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,656
-He keeps doing that.
-No way she knows.

129
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,825
He's supposed to be
a character from a famous anime.

130
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,693
When the staff heard
what he was going to be,

131
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,228
-they were so excited.
-Yeah?

132
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,764
I had a meet-and-greet
with the Gojo Satoru fans.

133
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,134
THE PASSIONATE MEET-AND-GREET
WITH THE GOJO SATORU FANS

134
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,937
The writers treated me in ways

135
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,506
they've never treated me before.

136
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,210
FINE, WE KIND OF LIKE YOU TOO, WOO-JAE

137
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,111
Ping!

138
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,014
We informed you
that today's dress code is "leader."

139
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,449
Who fits the role of leader best?

140
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,684
-Sook.
-Sook.

141
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,618
Gosh, not me.

142
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,720
-Because of her age.
-Yeah, her age.

143
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,422
Her maturity.

144
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,691
-Yeah, my age.
-Her seniority.

145
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,092
Who's the leader of ChoNam Zone?

146
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,029
Actually, the leader of ChoNam Zone
is Nam Chang-hee.

147
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,163
What do you do then?

148
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,765
I do the talking and share stories.

149
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,566
I'm also in charge of PR.

150
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,101
Doesn't he do most of the singing?

151
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,038
He's the main vocalist,
which makes me the sub vocalist.

152
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,540
I mainly do the talking.
But the actual leader of our group

153
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,410
is Jin-kyung.
She is the leader of our meetups.

154
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,546
-For the ChoNam Zone meetups?
-We have small meetups.

155
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,515
She invites friends
she can control easily.

156
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,350
-Our meetup is called Control.
-Yeah.

157
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,619
-Really?
-Yeah, those are the only ones I invite.

158
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,455
So Chang-hee and I are in that group,

159
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,390
and Woo-young almost joined us.

160
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,626
But she said,
"I can't control him. Get rid of him."

161
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,295
If I can't control them, they have to go.

162
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,663
You have clear criteria.

163
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,999
Then, let me ask you a question, Woo-jae.

164
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,337
Have you ever led a meetup
or had any past leadership experience?

165
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,740
Well, you see, I don't like having titles.

166
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,942
I like to follow along.

167
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,211
The only time I'm the leader
is when I walk my dog.

168
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,312
I usually take the lead.

169
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,281
-That's a sort of leader.
-True.

170
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,749
-You're its leader.
-That's it.

171
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,185
Have you ever been
a leader or class president, Woo-young?

172
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,821
Yes, I was continuously
the class president.

173
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,189
-Really?
-Yeah.

174
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,524
-I've been a class president too.
-Yeah.

175
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,226
Sae-ho was class president many times.

176
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,895
-Wasn't he the student body president?
-It's embarrassing,

177
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,065
but I was often the class president
in elementary school and middle school.

178
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,367
Not clown president?

179
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,471
So I ran for student body president in
my third year of middle school, but lost.

180
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,039
-You lost?
-Yeah, I did.

181
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,807
I was a candidate many times,

182
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,609
but I was never elected.

183
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,177
-Not even in class?
-I wasn't popular.

184
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,647
-I see.
-I was very quiet.

185
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,418
After school,
instead of focusing on schoolwork,

186
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,654
I used to meet up with a group
to read books in the library.

187
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,722
I'm serious.

188
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,291
Are we doing Talk Box today?

189
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,394
SHE'S SKILLED AT BEING SUBTLY FUNNY

190
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,461
That was hilarious.

191
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,063
What did you say? Library?

192
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,731
Listen. I attended a school

193
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,600
called Heungin Elementary School,

194
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,835
and I used to go to
the Yongsan and Namsan libraries.

195
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,304
I'd go there every day after school
without fail.

196
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,539
The two face each other.

197
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,108
I'd read books there all the time
instead of doing homework.

198
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,543
I'd stay there until the evening.

199
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,945
My parents wouldn't even tell me
to do my homework.

200
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,347
-Sounds like the truth.
-I just read books.

201
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,584
Then, Jin-kyung,
which author did you like back then?

202
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,520
Don't ask me things like that.

203
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,156
-Why not?
-It's not the time to talk about authors.

204
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,924
-She said she loved reading books.
-Hey.

205
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,958
It's not the right time.

206
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,260
-Jin-kyung.
-Well, you see…

207
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,228
Can you hit this with your magic stick?

208
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,129
Gosh, you see…

209
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,500
HAHA

210
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,701
Open it.

211
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,306
Oh. "Finish the other task first."

212
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,108
It means you should
do your homework first.

213
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,043
You should've focused on your schoolwork.

214
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,578
-I did.
-You just went to the library.

215
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,480
I did my homework afterwards,

216
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,048
but I enjoyed

217
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,418
entering book report contests
more than attending classes.

218
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,921
Can you share
anything you wrote back then?

219
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,191
When we went to your house
to shoot that special episode--

220
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,792
-Oh, yeah.
-You wrote really well.

221
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,027
-He's right.
-Come on.

222
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,829
-It's still talked about.
-It was sentimental.

223
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,964
You're right. It wasn't that mind-blowing.

224
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,301
Just let it go. Smile and let it go.

225
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,837
What? You said it wasn't great
and I agreed with you.

226
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,140
So for Season Three,
Screwballs: Deconstruction Show,

227
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,610
I'll announce the person
who's the best fit for the leader role.

228
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,112
They achieved great success
through exceptional execution.

229
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,748
They are the perfect leader
and a global entrepreneur.

230
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,886
The pride of Korea,
on par with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

231
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,288
-Entrepreneur Hong Jin-kyung.
-Me?

232
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,290
OUR LEADER, HONG JIN-KYUNG

233
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,659
-Of course, it's Jin-kyung.
-Gosh.

234
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,328
-She's on par with them.
-A true leader.

235
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,431
Bill Gates? What the heck are you doing?

236
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,700
-I bet you're the same height.
-Stop making fun of me.

237
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,035
-We aren't making fun of you.
-She bought coffee for everyone.

238
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,370
-Yeah.
-She did earlier.

239
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,471
GIVE IT UP FOR GOD JIN-KYUNG

240
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,707
-For real.
-Leaders are definitely different.

241
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,109
-Can't you buy us coffee?
-Yeah, okay.

242
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,211
No, the staff will pay for it.

243
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,813
I can chip in 10,000 won.

244
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,814
FIGHTING OVER WHO'D PAY

245
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,948
No, I'll pay.

246
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,383
-No.
-No.

247
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,151
-No.
-You always pay for us.

248
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,720
Hong Jin-kyung!

249
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,855
Hong Jin-kyung!

250
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,524
CEO HONG PAID FOR THE COFFEE
OF HER OWN FREE WILL

251
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,858
I want an iced vanilla latte.

252
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,628
Yes. The truth is, Jin-kyung has been

253
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,796
very successful as a model,
entertainer, entrepreneur,

254
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,699
-and even as a YouTuber.
-He's right.

255
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,835
-Everything she's done has been a success.
-But for today,

256
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,205
we are going to focus on Hong Jin-kyung,
the entrepreneur.

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,740
Yes.

258
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,875
In 2005, she founded
Hong Jin-kyung Co., Ltd.

259
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,278
She exported THE KIMCHI
and THE MANDOO worldwide.

260
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,746
-It's been 20 years?
-That's a long time.

261
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,148
The cumulative sales as of 2023

262
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,083
-exceeded 310 billion won.
-Wow.

263
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,719
-You're awesome.
-That's from my company's accounting team.

264
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,254
That's awesome.

265
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,189
When you actually try it,

266
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,257
-you'll see it's good.
-Yes.

267
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,093
-It's so good.
-I'm not saying this as a team member.

268
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,295
Her dumplings are so good.

269
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,629
-They're amazing.
-They are.

270
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,897
Jin-kyung. Wow.

271
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,766
Don't you think Bibigo is good too?

272
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,369
What the heck are you doing?

273
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,504
SPEAKS HIS MIND

274
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,772
-Look.
-That's so wrong.

275
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,807
Bibigo is good too.

276
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,875
It's good.

277
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,977
I'm sure it's good.
But that's still wrong.

278
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,080
-We weren't talking about Bibigo.
-Hit him, Jin-kyung.

279
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,448
He deserves it.

280
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,150
Is it the time to talk about Bibigo?

281
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,384
-Hit him hard.
-Sit.

282
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:46,819
-She didn't.
-Sorry.

283
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,055
-We don't hit anyone directly.
-That's a true leader.

284
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,824
-You see? Jin-kyung just embraced it.
-Of course.

285
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,527
Can I ask you about something?

286
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,295
You studied theater at Dongguk University.

287
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,998
-Your classmates chose acting.
-That's right.

288
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,766
And they focused on their major.

289
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,135
-But you told us that you were different.
-Yes.

290
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,204
I didn't want to do stage acting.

291
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,739
-Wasn't it your major?
-It was.

292
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,076
-I didn't find theater that interesting.
-I see.

293
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,111
-That's understandable.
-Many are interested in it,

294
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,046
-but personally, I wasn't.
-Right.

295
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,783
They said I could graduate
if I did four plays,

296
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,453
so I went to my professor and asked them

297
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,722
how I could graduate without acting.

298
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,957
I said I really couldn't do it,
so the professor said,

299
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,461
"Then, find a way to get the funds to do

300
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,762
the four plays."

301
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,163
-Wow.
-What?

302
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,633
"Then, you can graduate
without being in the plays."

303
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,534
How can a student get that kind of money?

304
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,802
-From a sponsor?
-You see,

305
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,105
they gave me a mission
I couldn't accomplish.

306
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,408
But over those four years,
I made them a lot of money.

307
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,144
You see, I didn't give them my own money.

308
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,914
I created my own plan
and put together presentations

309
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,417
to secure advertisements,
and I put them in the pamphlets.

310
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,487
I learned something
really important back then.

311
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,090
-You're amazing.
-So if someone asks me to raise money now,

312
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,025
I can do it.

313
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,161
If you came up with the money
to produce four plays,

314
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,796
it wouldn't be in the millions, right?

315
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,864
In the tens of millions?

316
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,633
-Tens of millions of won.
-That's a lot of money.

317
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,768
More than that would have…

318
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,937
But you could totally be in a play
with that kind of costume and makeup.

319
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,372
IT'S A WASTE OF TALENT

320
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,940
Listening to you makes us realize

321
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,343
that the great success
of THE KIMCHI and THE MANDOO

322
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,811
-is not a fluke.
-Exactly.

323
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:24,016
That's why we've created a variety
of games that reflect your career.

324
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,918
In Woo-jae's Deconstruction Show,

325
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,088
-the games were one against four.
-It was so fun.

326
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,590
But for all of you to play
against Jin-kyung…

327
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
CYNICAL LAUGH

328
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,627
It would be too unrealistic.

329
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,496
-I think so.
-You insult us subtly really well.

330
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,397
He's right.

331
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,466
I never knew Bach was the father of music.

332
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,867
That means you're below average.

333
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:42,802
BRAIN GAMES ARE A NO-GO

334
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,205
AND PHYSICAL GAMES

335
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,208
WON'T WORK EITHER

336
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,847
NO GAMES REQUIRING LUCK EITHER

337
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,483
If you were to play
against the four of us,

338
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,919
-what game do you think you could win?
-Yeah.

339
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,986
Tell us.

340
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,893
If we play the game
Woo-jae played last week, I can win.

341
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,794
Kung Kung Dda?

342
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,895
-Yeah.
-Really?

343
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,731
Give her any location.

344
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,032
I'll give you a location.

345
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,900
-School.
-Give it a try.

346
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,235
Start with the syllable Ga.

347
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,136
Ready, go.

348
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,939
-Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung
-Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung

349
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,876
-Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda
-Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

350
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,144
The Joo Jerk

351
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,579
We're done with that now.

352
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,481
-Sorry.
-There's no "The Joo Jerk."

353
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,782
-Right.
-Let's do it.

354
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,417
The Joo Jerk

355
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,119
Streetlight.

356
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,720
Pork ribs.

357
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,622
Video.

358
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,023
Music box.

359
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,126
Music box.

360
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,660
SUPER CONFIDENT JIN-KYUNG'S TURN

361
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,965
SOMETHING THAT'S IN A SCHOOL
AND STARTS WITH "GOL" IN KOREAN

362
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:46,866
Dumb guy.

363
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,300
There's always one.

364
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,002
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

365
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,403
There's always a dumb guy.

366
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,371
She's good.

367
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,639
That was good.

368
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,508
You got it.

369
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,144
There's always a dumb guy at school.

370
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,779
-She did it.
-She did it.

371
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,013
But

372
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,349
-this is going to be an individual game.
-Really?

373
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,617
Really?

374
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,620
There's a huge prize waiting
for the person who comes in first,

375
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,255
so do your best.

376
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,123
If you don't say what it is,
I won't get my hopes up.

377
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,826
We will begin
the journey to uncover everything

378
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,494
about Entrepreneur Hong Jin-kyung.

379
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,096
The script says, "Let's move to

380
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,532
the first location for
Jin-kyung's Deconstruction Show."

381
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,834
-But we'll continue shooting here.
-Okay.

382
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,337
Since it's in the script,
should we walk around and come back?

383
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,939
-Let's go.
-Okay.

384
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,240
-Let's go.
-Let's move.

385
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,511
WE SHOULD CHANGE LOCATIONS
FOR EACH SEGMENT

386
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,748
THEY TELEPORT AS IF BY MAGIC

387
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,682
Very nice.

388
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,185
-It feels different being in a new place.
-Much better.

389
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
-It gives you a sense of stability.
-All rested up?

390
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,756
-Everyone got here really fast.
-Now,

391
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,324
let me introduce the game.

392
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,761
Jin-kyung is a TV personality,
but she is also a CEO.

393
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,197
She founded
Hong Jin-kyung Co., Ltd. in 2005

394
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,998
and expanded overseas.

395
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,968
She contributed to
promoting kimchi worldwide.

396
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,406
So we will have a session
to present new business ideas.

397
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,309
It isn't limited to food items.
Each person has to present

398
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,744
an idea that they think
will be a huge success.

399
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,047
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes.

400
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,182
If there's a genuinely good idea,

401
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,818
-would you actually consider it?
-Of course.

402
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,953
-Really?
-Wow.

403
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,788
Mine will really be appealing.

404
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,523
It doesn't even require seed money.

405
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,291
-Wow.
-Is that possible?

406
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,027
-I think mine's the most realistic.
-Mine too.

407
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,730
-Mine too.
-I thought about mine a lot.

408
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,966
I even want to invest in it.

409
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,334
-Jin-kyung could…
-Yeah.

410
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,002
-…launch mine immediately.
-Nice.

411
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,905
-Shall we start from that end?
-From me?

412
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,306
-From Woo-jae?
-Sure.

413
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,908
-His can launch immediately.
-Okay.

414
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,777
-Then, I'll explain the judging criteria.
-Okay.

415
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,346
When everyone is finished,

416
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,781
the staff will vote on who they think

417
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,416
-presented a good idea.
-Okay.

418
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,419
And you will get to vote

419
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,954
for one business idea

420
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,223
-that is not your own.
-Okay.

421
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,626
But each one of your votes will count

422
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,361
-as five votes.
-Okay.

423
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,362
-Understood?
-Yes.

424
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,365
THE PRESENTATION FOR
NEW BUSINESS IDEAS BEGINS

425
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,700
Hello.

426
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:02,735
THE FIRST PRESENTER, JOO JERK

427
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,370
STARTING UNUSUALLY POLITELY

428
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,971
What a polite guy.

429
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,707
Dear judges.

430
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,609
The business idea I've prepared

431
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,748
is a business that is good

432
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,684
for all the judges here,

433
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,719
-including Ms. Hong Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

434
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,554
As I said before,

435
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,224
you don't need this.

436
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,525
You don't need any capital?

437
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,894
Ms. Hong Jin-kyung, you can just

438
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,097
turn your daily life directly

439
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,400
-into a business.
-Really?

440
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,802
-How can you not need capital?
-What could it be?

441
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,804
It's a great business idea.

442
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,106
-Sae-ho, Sook,
-Yes.

443
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,641
Woo-young, and myself.

444
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,878
For the four of us, this business may be

445
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,112
-a bit tough.
-Difficult?

446
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,647
-Only Ms. Hong can do it?
-Yes.

447
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,116
-Only Ms. Hong can do it.
-I'm curious.

448
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,385
-It's a business specialized for her.
-I'm curious.

449
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,187
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS IT?

450
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,889
It's called The Sukbak.

451
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,257
The Sukbak.

452
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,294
Ms. Hong has a series of businesses
that start with "The."

453
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,330
THE KIMCHI, THE MANDOO. But I think

454
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,266
it's time for her to break free
from the food industry.

455
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,036
She should expand to other areas.

456
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,272
As you can see,

457
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,407
-this is the current status…
-It's so detailed.

458
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,775
…of the lodging industry in Seoul.

459
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,311
There are a total of

460
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,213
3,724 lodging establishments.

461
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,015
The number has grown rapidly.

462
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:28,020
Why is the lodging industry
growing so much?

463
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,155
Why?

464
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,358
-What matters most in business?
-His fingers.

465
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,461
-Why?
-Geez.

466
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,729
Why is it growing?

467
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,332
The number of foreign tourists
visiting Korea

468
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,468
is at an all-time high.

469
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,536
An all-time high.

470
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,207
I will show you why it is
at an all-time high.

471
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,708
K-culture.

472
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,110
THE REASON BEHIND THE INCREASE IN TOURISTS

473
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,611
WHY IS THE LODGING INDUSTRY GROWING?

474
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,881
The pilgrimage to
the KPop Demon Hunters spots

475
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,350
-is popular with international fans.
-He's right.

476
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,252
-It's massively popular.
-It's all the rage.

477
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,223
N Seoul Tower,
Bukchon Hanok Village, and Naksan Park.

478
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,291
Where are all of these places?

479
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,861
They are all around Pyeongchang-dong.

480
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,095
ALL AROUND PYEONGCHANG-DONG

481
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,798
MY NEIGHBORHOOD?

482
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,434
When we visited your place, Ms. Hong,

483
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,869
we looked out the window

484
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,671
and thought, "So this is what
life is like for the top one percent."

485
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,542
What would it feel like to have coffee
in the morning with this view?

486
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,677
What would it be like
to eat dinner with this view?

487
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,213
She's the only one enjoying this.

488
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,916
But is she really enjoying all of this?

489
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,520
-What's that?
-All of a sudden?

490
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,388
She goes on frequent business trips.

491
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,258
Her home is empty
for 300 out of 365 days a year.

492
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,659
It's empty for that long?

493
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
I go almost every month.

494
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,564
Her home is empty 80 percent of the time.

495
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,999
SHE'S SO QUICK TO AGREE

496
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,934
My goodness. What a waste!

497
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,769
All that rent money gone to waste!

498
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,005
-Gosh. He worked hard on this.
-He did.

499
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,376
The tourist spots are so close.
Why not open her home for lodging?

500
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,478
The owner can make money,

501
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,514
and the guests can make
wonderful memories.

502
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,416
Not two birds with one stone.

503
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,051
I think you can kill five birds.

504
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,719
Five birds with one stone.

505
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:09,888
The Sukbak.

506
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,690
THIS IS THE SUKBAK

507
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,225
You should offer a special benefit.

508
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,561
It can't be the same
as other short-term rentals.

509
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,762
THE BENEFIT OF USING THE SUKBAK

510
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,530
Benefit number one, The Rich.

511
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,633
Do you want to experience
the life of a rich person?

512
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,636
Live in a mansion for one day.

513
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,172
Do you know how big it is?
It's 250 pyeong.

514
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,574
No, it isn't!

515
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,175
-Seriously?
-Is it not?

516
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,845
-Don't make things up.
-How big is it?

517
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,680
-It's just pretty big.
-It's pretty big.

518
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,049
-Maybe it's 240 pyeong.
-I'm just saying

519
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,784
-it will feel like a very big house.
-Yeah.

520
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,052
Life in a huge mansion.

521
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,387
-I see.
-Wouldn't you want to try it for a day?

522
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,622
I want to live there too.

523
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,457
You can experience the life of the rich.

524
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,093
The expensive couch, bed and toilet.

525
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,229
Surprisingly, the toilet lid lifts
when you approach it.

526
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,763
A TOILET THAT'S COMFIER THAN A SOFA

527
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,664
The sensor.

528
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,933
The expensive dining table.
As for this dining table,

529
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,602
Ms. Hong couldn't eat properly

530
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,505
when we sat to eat at that dining table.

531
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,707
-Why not?
-She was worried we would scratch it.

532
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,509
Come on.

533
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,410
Now, The Breakfast.

534
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,779
What's the most important thing
about an accommodation?

535
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,081
-Isn't it the food?
-Yes.

536
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,717
At Ms. Hong's The Sukbak,

537
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,886
you can try everything
that has "The" in it.

538
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,621
THE KIMCHI, THE MANDOO,

539
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,055
The Galbijjim, The Fish,

540
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,457
The Tangsuyuk, The Pizza.

541
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,425
You can enjoy a variety of things.

542
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,560
There's The Breakfast too.

543
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,895
I'm really excited about that.

544
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,429
Now, The Fashion.

545
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,299
Everyone, Hong Jin-kyung's closet
will become yours.

546
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,434
Can I wear whatever I want?

547
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,236
It's a service
that's included in The Sukbak.

548
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,472
-Says who?
-Just go into her closet.

549
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,073
This is Ms. Hong's photo zone.

550
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,709
If you follow her on social media,
you'll know what it is.

551
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,545
She takes many photos here.

552
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,481
You can wear the clothes
you get from her closet and…

553
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,352
YOU CAN BECOME A SUPERMODEL TOO!

554
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,054
-I can wear all those clothes?
-Of course.

555
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,990
You can take photos
and post them on your social media too.

556
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,559
The Party.

557
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,694
This is the best part of lodging.

558
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,563
Hang on. What's up with that photo?

559
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,565
What is going on here?

560
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,800
Why am I with Sae-ho
in front of some stranger's house?

561
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,101
Silence!

562
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,104
What is the advantage of staying
at Ms. Hong's Pyeongchang-dong home?

563
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,839
-It has a yard.
-It isn't an apartment.

564
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:08,740
A spacious yard.

565
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,244
You can party to your heart's content.

566
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,612
You can smoke indoors too.

567
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,680
Hey!

568
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,415
In the house?

569
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,116
-Says who?
-Hear him out.

570
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,918
He's saying that
because it isn't his house.

571
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,054
-He told them to go in my closet.
-Take that one out.

572
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,956
But it's part of
the services you're providing.

573
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,557
-That's nonsense.
-Also,

574
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,993
-you can get as drunk as you want.
-What?

575
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,161
You can draw too.

576
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,864
-Okay.
-The cleanup is included anyway.

577
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,700
How much is it then?

578
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,635
-The State Guest.
-Okay.

579
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,706
It's a ten-minute drive
from Pyeongchang-dong to the Blue House.

580
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,442
-You could invite a state guest.
-He's tacking everything on to it.

581
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,177
-They'll need to sleep.
-It's a bit much.

582
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,079
Okay. President Trump.

583
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,747
He could clearly…

584
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,983
Okay. President Trump.

585
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,417
He could clearly…

586
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,553
You've crossed the line, man.

587
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,054
He left a review.

588
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,658
"The Sukbak, which is
where I stayed in Korea, was the best."

589
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,493
-"At the next summit…
-Is this okay?

590
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,228
…I'd like to stay at The Sukbak.
Thank you."

591
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,399
-Even state guests can stay here…
-He left a review?

592
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,034
…and get some rest.

593
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,602
That's not a bad idea.

594
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,271
That's all from me.

595
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,274
-Well…
-You prepared a lot, Woo-jae.

596
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,242
How much are you planning to charge?

597
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,978
-Yeah, I wonder.
-You get to enjoy all those things,

598
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,546
so I think

599
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,649
it should reflect the value
of Ms. Hong's name

600
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,017
and the variety of services.

601
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,084
Maybe about

602
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,953
120,000 won per night?

603
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,621
120,000 WON?

604
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,657
This makes good business sense.

605
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,158
It's really good.

606
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,593
132,000 won, including fees.

607
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,296
I bet we'll be fully booked though.

608
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,231
-There's no doubt.
-It'll be sensational.

609
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,465
-I'll be fully booked.
-Yeah.

610
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,000
How much is it for 300 days?

611
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,402
It'll be over 30 million won.

612
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,337
It'll be about 40 million won.

613
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,206
You know, there are
many days where my house is vacant.

614
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,008
I have a live-in housekeeper

615
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,844
and she gets bored quite often.

616
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,347
-So are you thinking about it?
-So,

617
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,283
maybe I can give her a huge pay raise

618
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,119
-and have her make the guests' breakfasts.
-Okay.

619
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,454
-Then,
-She's really thinking about it.

620
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,223
I'll change the name
so that your housekeeper won't be bored.

621
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,159
From The Sukbak to The Guesthouse.

622
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,261
-Oh, guesthouse?
-To The Guesthouse.

623
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,230
-Everyone can get together and enjoy it.
-That sounds so nice.

624
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,099
We can charge 30,000 won per person.

625
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,134
YOU CAN STAY FOR 30,000 WON PER PERSON

626
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,269
That includes everything?

627
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,071
It'll be 33,000 won, including fees.

628
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,173
That way, many can come over and hang out.

629
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,274
The Guesthouse.

630
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,642
Very nice.

631
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,177
Gosh, Woo-jae.

632
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,712
Your presentation was awesome.

633
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,413
-Who's next?
-I'm up next.

634
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,584
Gosh. Woo-jae went way too global.

635
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,819
It was totally unexpected.

636
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,954
THE FIRST PRESENTATION GOT TONS OF PRAISE

637
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,723
-Do I press the space bar?
-Yes.

638
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,091
Can I just click the mouse?

639
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,759
-They do the same thing.
-Do they?

640
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,596
AWKWARD LAUGH

641
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,699
All right. This is called clicking.

642
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,001
This is how you click.

643
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,870
All right. The presenter.

644
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:52,938
All right.

645
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm sure you've felt very full
after eating

646
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,809
THE KIMCHI and THE MANDOO.

647
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,977
Can't eat more?

648
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,245
-No.
-Then,

649
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,414
-sing more.
-Okay. Sing more.

650
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,049
NICE RHYME

651
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,884
Ms. Hong Jin-kyung

652
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,520
sings 365 days a year.

653
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,756
SHE SINGS 365 DAYS
NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HER

654
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,824
That's why I prepared this.

655
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,227
The Sing More Coin Karaoke.

656
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,629
Yes, it's a coin karaoke.

657
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,231
But it isn't an ordinary one.

658
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,134
Please pay attention from here on out.

659
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,536
When you go to a karaoke,

660
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,572
-you see music videos on the screen.
-Yes, music videos.

661
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:32,878
All the music videos on the screen
will be of Jin-kyung.

662
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,415
Whether you sing a dance song

663
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,451
or a ballad, all the videos
will be of Jin-kyung.

664
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,852
She has to make all those videos?

665
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,789
-No.
-You can watch Jin-kyung the whole time.

666
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,657
Would people want to see that?

667
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,826
Of course. They'd love to see that.

668
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,429
I WANT TO SEE G-DRAGON
WHEN I SING HIS SONGS

669
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,564
When you're singing,

670
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,067
you add the echo effect
and melody effect, right?

671
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,636
All the choruses

672
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,338
will feature Jin-kyung's voice.

673
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,506
THE HONG JIN-KYUNG CHORUS

674
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,108
Would people like that?

675
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,242
Of course, they would.

676
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,212
I know why this karaoke
would be successful.

677
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,580
-Why?
-If you started it, that is.

678
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,816
When you sing at a karaoke,

679
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,885
-you can hear the neighboring room.
-Yes.

680
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,189
There are people who make you
more confident about your singing.

681
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:18,890
It makes you think,

682
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,193
-"I can sing better than that."
-Right.

683
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,061
Is that what you were going for?

684
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,229
You're pretty sharp.

685
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,998
"I can sing better than that."

686
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,467
GUARDIAN OF EVERYONE'S SELF-ESTEEM

687
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,836
All right. We don't use tambourines.

688
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,370
We use drums here.

689
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,372
Will someone play them?

690
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,107
-The drums will play.
-Who'll play them?

691
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,609
If Jin-kyung is available,

692
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,111
she can show up and play.

693
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,847
She has to learn how to play drums.

694
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,115
On top of making the music videos.

695
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,018
When you are in Korea
for 65 days of the year,

696
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,020
you can briefly swing by and do it.

697
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,355
PRACTICALLY A K-POP IDOL SCHEDULE

698
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,091
You need to consider this carefully,
Jin-kyung.

699
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,694
We weren't quite sold
on his K-pop angle earlier.

700
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,462
We can fill that void.

701
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,331
We'll lump it in
with the lodging business.

702
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,268
-The guests can go there in the evening?
-Yeah.

703
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,637
And the coin karaoke can be built--

704
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:06,938
Let's build it inside.

705
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,773
-We'll build it in your yard.
-Yeah.

706
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,009
WHY ARE YOU INTRIGUED BY THIS?

707
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,410
It's portable.

708
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,479
Sometimes, you go in
a coin karaoke and wonder,

709
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,082
"What kind of song would suit me?"

710
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,417
We provide advice for that.

711
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,418
Who, you ask?

712
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,120
This person right here.

713
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,421
THIS PERSON

714
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,957
JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT HIS SIDE HUSTLE

715
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,727
This person will recommend the song

716
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,196
that suits you best and together…

717
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,831
Gosh, this works.

718
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,433
-This works.
-It's a done deal.

719
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,569
We have one other person.

720
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,603
-Another person?
-Yes.

721
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,506
We worked really hard
to get this person on board.

722
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,909
Let me tell you about this person.

723
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,277
He isn't a human being.

724
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,979
He isn't a human being?

725
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,648
He's a genie.

726
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,715
THE GENIE APPEARS

727
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,850
-All right.
-It's me.

728
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,018
This person…

729
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,319
-Will he…
-Yes.

730
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,222
Will he dance with them?

731
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,024
He's in charge of the choreography.

732
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,992
His presentation is a total piece of crap.

733
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,894
HIS PRESENTATION IS A PIECE OF CRAP

734
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,962
We include dancing.

735
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,597
Ola would make it fun.

736
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,998
-Yes. Sure.
-What do you think?

737
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,133
What do you think?

738
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,536
If you lump it in
with the lodging business,

739
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,904
-it'll be fun.
-Lump it in?

740
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,639
You should be one team.

741
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,508
How much will be added to the total?

742
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,710
The coin karaoke is a bit expensive.

743
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,011
How much is it for an hour?

744
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,080
-It's charged per room.
-Yes.

745
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,149
It'll be ten million won per room.

746
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,216
Ten million won.

747
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,851
A TEN MILLION WON COIN KARAOKE

748
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,089
Then, if you include that with The Sukbak,
it'll be 10,132,000 won.

749
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,324
A 10,132,000 WON PACKAGE

750
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,458
It requires a system.

751
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,793
It makes sense.

752
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,462
-Mr. Cho Ola has to be there too.
-Yes.

753
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,597
About ten million won.

754
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,798
-10 million.
-10,130,000.

755
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,801
If that's too much work for you,

756
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,437
then we can use your talents…

757
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,705
A BUSINESS USING MY TALENTS?

758
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,008
…to start a business called
The Lend More.

759
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:50,976
THE LEND MORE

760
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,612
You could try out the loan industry.

761
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,579
You can lend more.

762
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,981
Even though they don't want more?

763
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,248
Yes, that's right.

764
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,350
So, "Oh, thank you."

765
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,051
OH, THANK YOU!

766
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,787
THE INNOVATIVE IDEA
STOOD OUT IN HIS PRESENTATION

767
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:03,888
SHE'S SATISFIED

768
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,590
-Next up is Sook.
-Yes.

769
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,992
I wonder what she prepared.

770
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,293
NEXT UP IS SOOK

771
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,464
-What is that? The Long?
-Hello, I'm Presenter Kim Sook.

772
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,734
FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT

773
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,438
After closely observing
Jin-kyung's business,

774
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,574
I've realized that it's delicious.

775
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,643
The kimchi is delicious,
and so are the dumplings.

776
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,745
But there's one thing that's lacking.

777
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,880
LACKING?

778
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,349
We live in the social media era.

779
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,785
People want photographic evidence.

780
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,820
You need to come up with something unique

781
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,656
that people want to take pictures of.

782
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,157
You have to make people

783
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,426
want to make reservations
at your restaurant

784
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,194
because they want to take photos.

785
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,429
Photos? Kimchi?

786
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,699
Kimchi tends to look the same,
a bit of red on some cabbage.

787
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,467
-So people don't take pictures of it.
-Right.

788
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,735
And dumplings?

789
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,570
They're round and cute,

790
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,173
-but dumplings are just dumplings.
-Yes.

791
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,943
So people don't really want to take photos

792
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,379
of the special dumpling they had,
and so now--

793
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,314
This is the visual
I find to be the most unique.

794
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,783
Can I take a photo with your phone?

795
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,618
I just realized that she's Korean.

796
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,919
-Yes.
-She speaks Korean.

797
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,054
You have to take photos.

798
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,689
-That's right.
-So

799
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,893
I thought it would be nice
if you made something very unique.

800
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,930
Something that can bring
the CEO and the food together.

801
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,865
-So lately…
-How?

802
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,634
Hong Jin-kyung's The Long.

803
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,302
Not the seaweed you wrap your rice in.

804
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,404
-Long?
-Yes, I mean the Korean word for "long."

805
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,239
-So I…
-But how?

806
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,441
So I prepared

807
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,076
The Gimbap.

808
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,377
It'll be two meters.

809
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,446
-A two-meter-long gimbap?
-Yes, two meters.

810
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,513
UNBELIEVABLE

811
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,848
The gimbap will be two meters.

812
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,516
-This is ridiculous.
-You can

813
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,651
-share it…
-It's amusing.

814
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,086
-…with your friends.
-Two-meters?

815
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,754
-This is interesting.
-Yeah.

816
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,689
A two-meter-long gimbap makes no sense.

817
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,857
It's interesting.

818
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,926
The CEO and the food
head in the same direction.

819
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,794
-How amusing.
-It's unrealistic.

820
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,463
The Hotdog. It's two meters.

821
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,897
How amusing.

822
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,432
Two meters. Nice and long.

823
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,068
If you have this two-meter-long gimbap…

824
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,105
Do you know how popular
gimbap is these days?

825
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,507
Even in foreign countries,
they just call it gimbap.

826
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,009
Then, it can be served
as breakfast at The Sukbak.

827
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,778
-The two-meter-long gimbap?
-Join us.

828
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,580
Let's work together.

829
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,681
Look at the camera.

830
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,516
-Let's collaborate.
-But still…

831
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,984
OCTOPUS-STYLE BUSINESS EXPANSION

832
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,920
The tornado potato?
It's two meters as well.

833
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,757
-Not bad.
-It starts from here and goes all the way.

834
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,059
If we install the tornado potato
at The Sukbak,

835
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,062
they can take that to come down
from the third floor.

836
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,230
RIDE THAT
FROM FLOOR 3 TO FLOOR 1

837
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,699
-That's not a bad idea.
-They can go up and down using that.

838
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,267
It can be used in a variety of ways.

839
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,103
-They can eat it while they slide down.
-Yeah.

840
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,571
It can be served as a dessert.

841
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,006
It sounds like a cartoon.

842
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,776
-Sotteok sotteok? Geez.
-A two-meter-long sotteok sotteok.

843
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:38,676
Sotteok sotteok.

844
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,578
They can just sit there

845
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,680
and eat the parts they want
from those two meters.

846
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,516
-You can use it in many ways.
-Where's that?

847
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,284
-It's Gangjin.
-Next…

848
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,253
BURSTS OUT IN LAUGHTER

849
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,757
For a second, I thought
I had never seen that before.

850
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,194
I was wondering when I did that too,
but it was in Gangjin.

851
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,962
I thought it was an AI image.

852
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,197
WE GET WHY IT FELT UNFAMILIAR

853
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,801
Since Jin-kyung is tall,
her food should be long too.

854
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,271
Then, take many photos so people
all over the world will want to come.

855
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,806
-Someone may do it.
-Korean food.

856
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,642
We can introduce K-food
to the world through this.

857
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,110
SOOK'S PRESENTATION ENDS

858
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,512
We can link this with The Sukbak too.

859
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,750
The three of us are able to collaborate.

860
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,984
Let's see if Sae-ho can…

861
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,019
WHAT WILL SAE-HO'S ITEM BE?

862
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,855
All right. First of all,

863
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,126
before I begin the presentation,
I'd like to make an apology.

864
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,527
-I am--
-No, thanks.

865
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,962
Since this is a variety show,

866
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,465
the three people who went before me
focused on bringing laughter.

867
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,935
They presented their business plan
in a variety show tone.

868
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,736
But mine will be more serious.

869
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,005
-Okay. I like that.
-It'll be something realistic.

870
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,675
-It's a realistically achievable plan.
-Good.

871
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,377
-You see…
-He's laying the groundwork.

872
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,445
I'm not laying groundwork.

873
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,515
I created content that really brings out

874
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,184
Ms. Hong Jin-kyung's strength.

875
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,888
Let me begin my presentation
for Hong Jin-kyung's The Kitchen.

876
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,524
-How lame.
-All right.

877
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,725
ACTING LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED

878
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,094
Anyway, you all know who this is, right?

879
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,995
Its Lee Hyo-ri.

880
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,097
She gained even more attention recently.

881
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,266
This is what she has been up to lately.

882
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,735
-Her yoga center.
-She opened a yoga center.

883
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,370
"LIFE-SIZE CUTOUT
WITH A HUGE SMILE WITH HER EYES"

884
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,873
Rave reviews have been pouring in.

885
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,908
So I would like to make a suggestion.

886
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,646
-What is it?
-I'd like you to start a cooking class.

887
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,414
Hong Jin-kyung's The Kitchen.

888
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,116
OH

889
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,153
Many people long for your cooking
and enjoy it.

890
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,055
This time, you can invite them yourselves.

891
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,323
This is a good idea.

892
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,592
You can do this on The Sukbak as well.

893
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:35,493
First of all--

894
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,829
We can totally do this at The Sukbak.

895
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,298
Even on Real Study King,

896
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,800
we have what's called
the Pyeongchang-dong recipe.

897
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,636
It's a show where we cook a dish

898
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,037
-to celebrities.
-Yes.

899
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,906
-So you did that--
-Do that on The Sukbak.

900
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,340
Do that on The Sukbak.

901
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,776
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA

902
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:52,977
You're doing that now?

903
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,313
Yes. So,

904
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,315
you can draw ten people every month

905
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,350
from your fans
and others who are interested

906
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,787
Also, you'll have to provide
all the ingredients.

907
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,189
There may be those who feel
it may be too costly to come,

908
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,558
so you can pay them
50,000 won for their transportation.

909
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,527
How am I benefiting from this?

910
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,561
How is this good for me?

911
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,829
-I'll show you.
-Fame?

912
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,632
What is the purpose of
doing all of these things?

913
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,869
You'll gain more popularity
on social media.

914
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,537
"I learned how to cook at Jin-kyung's.

915
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,806
She gave me the ingredients
and she was so cool."

916
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,909
So how do I benefit
from what they post on their social media?

917
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,211
-Take a look. Next.
-Fame.

918
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,113
-She'll get more famous.
-You can make profit

919
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,548
through your YouTube content.

920
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,883
-YouTube content.
-Wait.

921
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,352
That would only be worth
one episode on YouTube.

922
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,353
Hear me out.

923
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,255
You can't let it end with one episode.

924
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,324
You can sell things that

925
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,260
-have been touched with your finesse…
-Like books?

926
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,628
…such as plates and other products,

927
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,830
on social media
and to people who come in person.

928
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,766
On top of that, you can sell
"The Little Longer Jin-kyung toothpicks."

929
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,801
Like this.

930
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,235
THE LITTLE LONGER JIN-KYUNG TOOTHPICKS

931
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,704
-As merchandise.
-You should sell these

932
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,339
at the flea market in The Sukbak.

933
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,375
Look.

934
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,646
Jin-kyung is expanding globally.

935
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,914
For example,

936
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,649
"Hello, I'm Hong Kong."

937
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,950
Wait, not Hong Kong.

938
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,986
Not Hong Kong.

939
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,721
FLUSTERED

940
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,556
You said this wasn't going to be funny.

941
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,258
Why are you making us laugh?

942
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,094
-Well, this is…
-Hit backspace.

943
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
-Why are you making us laugh?
-Backspace.

944
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:21,632
"Hello, I'm Hong Jin-kyung.
Nice to meet you. I love you."

945
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,401
He started off
by saying it won't be funny,

946
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,769
but he's making us laugh.

947
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,703
-What's that?
-Okay.

948
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,439
So I thought it would be nice
if your fans from abroad came over

949
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,707
and made these things.

950
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,043
So they can make kimchi…

951
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,977
-Good idea.
-Yeah.

952
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,012
They can try that out.

953
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:37,215
That's why I suggested
Hong Jin-kyung's The Kitchen.

954
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,450
-That foreigner speaks Korean well.
-Thank you.

955
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,221
THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS CONTINUE
UNTIL THE END

956
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,590
-You know what though?
-Yes?

957
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,193
This seemed very convincing to me,

958
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,730
because if I were just a little less busy,
I'd want to do

959
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,765
all of those.

960
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,533
And to be honest, I think I could

961
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,368
even use my house.

962
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:01,539
You know,
I pounded the pavement strategically.

963
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,307
HE MAKES AN ADDITIONAL APPEAL

964
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,977
WHEN OTHER BUYERS COME,
YOU CAN PROVIDE PRODUCTS

965
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,479
SO YOU CAN HAVE A PRETTY STUDIO
THAT IS DESIGNED LIKE A KITCHEN

966
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,349
BORED

967
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,884
AND SO

968
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,086
One hour later…

969
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,889
THE CEO IS STILL IN DISCUSSION

970
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,898
THEY ARE FAST ASLEEP

971
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:27,832
If not the house…

972
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,668
In that place, we can put
things like THE KIMCHI…

973
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,303
-Wake up.
-Are you finished?

974
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,938
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

975
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,740
-I was a bit serious this time.
-You were.

976
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,876
So, you know, I would sometimes invite

977
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:42,013
our foreign buyers to my house

978
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,549
and serve them Korean food.
They really love that.

979
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,716
Let the people know.

980
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,953
Actually, those buyers should
pay 132,000 won too.

981
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,023
How dare they just come over

982
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,825
and just eat.
Wait, I don't have pockets.

983
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,593
SEARCHING FOR POCKETS

984
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,928
They ate and slept for free.

985
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,565
If I had more passion in me,

986
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,467
-it would definitely be possible.
-Of course.

987
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,002
-Nice.
-If I had the time and passion.

988
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,138
Then, lastly,
let's hear Ms. Hong Jin-kyung's

989
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,372
-new business idea.
-Okay.

990
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,575
The CEO's presentation
that's on another level.

991
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,676
EAGER TO FIND OUT

992
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,511
She'll be presenting an idea

993
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,513
-for her own company.
-Yes.

994
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:21,519
I gave traditional food a modern design.

995
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,288
There were already a variety of kimchi.

996
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,225
FROM KIMCHI TO MANDOO,
SHE EXPORTS THEM WORLDWIDE

997
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,928
The price would change
depending on how much you order.

998
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,065
The quality control for
Korea's home shopping is very strict.

999
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,235
You have to have one clear concept.

1000
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,736
You have to find what that is.

1001
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,172
If you have that,
you're already 50 percent there.

1002
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,240
WHAT'S HER NEW BUSINESS IDEA?

1003
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,376
This one will really be something good.

1004
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,745
What's this?

1005
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,181
GLANCING OVER

1006
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,450
THE SCREEN CAUGHT WOO-JAE'S ATTENTION

1007
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,417
What's this?

1008
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,086
What?

1009
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,787
-What is it?
-Okay.

1010
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,956
-Let me begin.
-I might have seen it wrong.

1011
00:35:59,023 --> 00:35:59,957
What could it be?

1012
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,993
The wallpaper is already…

1013
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,164
I think this item would be a huge success.

1014
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,132
"Hong Jin-kyung's The Puff Up."

1015
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,101
"Hong Jin-kyung's The Puff Up."

1016
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,903
I'll reload your confidence.

1017
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,437
Are you opening a pastry shop?

1018
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,173
Oh, a pastry shop?

1019
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,275
Unless it's some kind of driving school.

1020
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,210
Wow. You look cool.

1021
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,045
Yes, I'm a model.

1022
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,146
I'm a model

1023
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,384
and I am someone who likes fashion.

1024
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,453
I'm a model.

1025
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,423
She doesn't know how to use that.

1026
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,192
Excuse me, you're not supposed to

1027
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,626
-read from the monitor.
-Okay.

1028
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,795
-You have to present it to us.
-Really? Okay.

1029
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,797
-However.
-Yes, however,

1030
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,999
there's one unfortunate thing.

1031
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,968
-What is it?
-When I was created,

1032
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,271
God accidentally left something out.

1033
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,873
That was one of the quizzes.

1034
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,008
That is, none other than,

1035
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,744
yes, my breasts.

1036
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,414
My breasts.

1037
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,915
So the "puff up" is…

1038
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,917
I SEE

1039
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,220
…my breasts.

1040
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,188
THE THREE BROTHERS
DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK

1041
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,458
God did not give me any breasts.

1042
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,194
I think He momentarily forgot.

1043
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,364
-Relax and listen. It's her presentation.
-Okay.

1044
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,266
I don't know how to react.

1045
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,302
What is The Puff Up?

1046
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,973
It's shapewear that can give the breasts
volume they've never had before.

1047
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,175
Yes, it's shapewear.

1048
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,043
What is this?

1049
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,749
It's shapewear
that has a lot of "egenstory"

1050
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,386
which is known to
add volume to your breasts.

1051
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,488
-Does she mean estrogen?
-Yes.

1052
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,491
As you can see,
this is my current situation.

1053
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,494
FEELING DIZZY

1054
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,630
This is my current situation.

1055
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,799
My current situation is similar to this.

1056
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,334
Isn't that just your body?

1057
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,737
Yes, it is kind of

1058
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,206
-a sad situation.
-A sad situation?

1059
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,609
-If I add volume, I'll look like this.
-The Puff Up.

1060
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,710
They'll get filled up.

1061
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,413
-Come on.
-They'll get filled up.

1062
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,849
-Come on.
-They'll get filled up.

1063
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,083
THEY FILLED UP BUT IT'S FUNNY

1064
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,051
They fill up like so.

1065
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,886
-It doesn't suit you.
-Look.

1066
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,920
Gosh.

1067
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,522
Anyone would want to wear this.

1068
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,157
That is such nonsense.

1069
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,258
CONTINUES THROUGH THEIR HECKLING

1070
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,895
The breasts that god didn't give you.
The Puff Up can give it to you.

1071
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,997
-How can you do it?
-Is it a surgery?

1072
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,899
-Is this plastic surgery?
-Is it shapewear?

1073
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,901
Those pictures have no context.

1074
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,469
If you wear this,

1075
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,471
your whole soul will play a role

1076
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,873
in boosting your confidence.

1077
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,142
Isn't this just your personal dream?

1078
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,512
This is what I am like before The Puff Up.

1079
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,480
This is what I look like.

1080
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,182
But after I meet it, I'll be like this.

1081
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:39,917
Okay?

1082
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,919
Anyone would want to do this, right?

1083
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,421
What's going on?

1084
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,689
What is this?

1085
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,990
HATING IT

1086
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,225
-There's one for men too.
-What the heck?

1087
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,094
-For men…
-How far are you going, Jin-kyung?

1088
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,263
-Oh, my goodness.
-It was flimsy?

1089
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,764
Is this okay to air?

1090
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,300
-Before he met The Puff Up…
-Oh, my gosh.

1091
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,036
…and this is what he'll look like
after he tries it.

1092
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,538
You scared me.

1093
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,373
HIS CONFIDENCE IS BOOSTED

1094
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,344
HER BUSINESS SENSE LEFT WOO-JAE SPEECHLESS

1095
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,079
But you won't get taller.

1096
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,181
-You won't get taller.
-Something up top?

1097
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,317
Only the sensitive area can grow a little.

1098
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,186
-She scared me.
-That's what I wanted to say.

1099
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,856
Thank you for paying attention
to my presentation.

1100
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,025
HOW ABSURD

1101
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,293
That was the worst.

1102
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,096
HER PRESENTATION ENDS WITH JEERS

1103
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,197
What the heck?

1104
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,400
Only the four of us
were serious about this.

1105
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,503
-The CEO is too--
-Jin-kyung,

1106
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,338
I'm sorry, but how did you
make 310 billion?

1107
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,874
In all honestly, I was the only one
who did it earnestly.

1108
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,275
-Really?
-Yeah, only me.

1109
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:43,347
Yes, thank you for
the variety of presentations.

1110
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:47,551
Have you decided which one
is the best business idea?

1111
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,452
-Yes.
-Yes.

1112
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,187
Everything besides the CEO's was good.

1113
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,455
Yes, ours were the best.

1114
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,792
Look, 132,000 won is practically free
since they'll be enjoying all of that.

1115
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,629
You know, they can't really enjoy
with that 132,000 won.

1116
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,933
I have a question for Ms. Hong.
You proposed a breast-related business.

1117
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,802
Can you do two-meter breasts?

1118
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,138
Two-meter breasts?

1119
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,038
Two-meter breasts…

1120
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:08,939
PLEASE STOP!

1121
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,208
-The staff votes are almost done…
-Okay.

1122
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,811
-…so we won't reveal those yet.
-Okay.

1123
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,546
Each member can tell us what item

1124
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,381
they chose as the best business idea.

1125
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,049
Excluding your own?

1126
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,518
-Yes, excluding your own item.
-Okay.

1127
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,886
Let's start with Woo-jae.

1128
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,087
WOO-JAE VOTES FIRST

1129
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,321
We're really serious.

1130
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,891
WHY ARE THEY SO SERIOUS ABOUT THIS VOTE

1131
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,959
Oh, really?

1132
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,297
SOOK, SAE-HO, AND WOO-YOUNG

1133
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,132
FINISH VOTING TOO

1134
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,700
I see.

1135
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,935
Each vote is worth a lot.

1136
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,804
-It counts as five votes.
-Five votes.

1137
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,839
Look at that tail.

1138
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,307
It turned upwards.

1139
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,942
Think of its expandability.

1140
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,878
Excuse me,
but you can't choose your own item.

1141
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,714
-It's excluding your own.
-Really?

1142
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,349
Jin-kyung, The Sing More.

1143
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,318
-You can sing as much as you want.
-The Sukbak.

1144
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,454
-Just sing.
-Okay.

1145
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,255
-Sing whenever you want.
-Okay.

1146
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,124
THE MONKEY KING WITH HIPPOCAMPUS DAMAGE
FINISHED VOTING TOO

1147
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,028
BOLD AND INNOVATIVE ITEMS

1148
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,696
The music videos will be of Jin-kyung.

1149
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,698
The gimbap will be two meters.

1150
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,434
WHO WILL WIN THE COVETED 1ST PLACE?

1151
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,569
It'll boost it.

1152
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,206
Okay. The count is complete.

1153
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,107
The person who won
first place got five points.

1154
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,343
Second place got four points.
Third place got three.

1155
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,545
The scores are awarded differentially.

1156
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,581
Gosh. It's very close.

1157
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,583
Wow! This is how it ended up?

1158
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,519
You know what?
I think I got all the votes.

1159
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,620
-Must be really close.
-Okay.

1160
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,689
-Here is how the scores are distributed.
-Okay.

1161
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,424
Gosh, do I have a chance?

1162
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,059
-First place got 14 points.
-Okay.

1163
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,694
-What?
-Second place got 13 points.

1164
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,163
-Third place got 12 points.
-Wow.

1165
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,731
-Fourth place got 11 points.
-Okay.

1166
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,932
Fifth place got one point.

1167
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,968
That's how the scores are distributed.

1168
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,437
THEIR BRAINS STOP FUNCTIONING

1169
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,273
The Sing More was okay.
Why did you do that?

1170
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,742
Let me announce the third place first.

1171
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,744
-From third place.
-As long as I'm not last.

1172
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,845
Third place.

1173
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,715
-This person got a total of 12 votes.
-That's a lot.

1174
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,750
Jin-kyung's The Puff Up.

1175
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,352
-Wow.
-For real?

1176
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,419
Congratulations.

1177
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,654
Was it okay?

1178
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,723
-Twelve of you could relate to it?
-Hang on.

1179
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,626
-The Puff Up is third?
-You weren't the one with one vote?

1180
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,061
-The Puff Up is in third place.
-I thought she got one vote.

1181
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,797
-It means there are women…
-I thought she'd be last.

1182
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,500
-…who need that shapewear.
-Then,

1183
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,768
who's in second place?

1184
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,203
She got the overwhelming votes

1185
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,804
-from women.
-What?

1186
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,873
-Seriously?
-That was the result.

1187
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,042
-Second place.
-Then, am I the one with one vote?

1188
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,443
Could I be last place?

1189
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,279
-The Kitchen is?
-Is it The Sukbak?

1190
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,347
All right. I'll tell you
who's in second place.

1191
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,815
-What?
-The Sing More is…

1192
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,118
Congratulations. It's Hong Jin-kyung's

1193
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,519
The Sukbak.

1194
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,155
-Wow. Yes, it was a good idea.
-What the heck?

1195
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,157
The Sing More is really good.

1196
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,561
You can get snacks that you get
at internet cafes there.

1197
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,830
PERFORMING FAN SERVICE

1198
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,466
By the way, let me tell you this.

1199
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,736
-You didn't get any from the members.
-I knew it.

1200
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,371
None of the members voted for you.

1201
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,639
Right? I knew it.

1202
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,074
-Gosh.
-Yours were from the staff.

1203
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,275
But that's the real result.

1204
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,278
You know what? The staff must
really want to stay at her house.

1205
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,815
They want to stay at your house

1206
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,517
-for 132,000 won.
-Yeah.

1207
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,686
To be honest, I want to stay there too.

1208
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,387
It was pretty convincing.

1209
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,156
Then, I'm first place among the staff.

1210
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,891
-That's right.
-Gosh.

1211
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,559
-Which one do you want to know?
-Fourth.

1212
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,961
-Fourth.
-Fourth place?

1213
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,296
-Please, no.
-I want to know who's in fifth place.

1214
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,931
-Seriously.
-Please.

1215
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,967
-Fourth place is…
-The Sing More is…

1216
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,469
-Please be The Kitchen.
-It should be The Sing More.

1217
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,771
-Hong Jin-kyung's
-The Sing More.

1218
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,106
The Long.

1219
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,507
4TH PLACE THE LONG

1220
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,609
-I'm fourth place?
-Wait.

1221
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,445
Wait. Then, it's either him or me.
What the heck?

1222
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,414
-Wait.
-No way. I got one vote?

1223
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,550
-I voted for you, Sook.
-The Kitchen?

1224
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,286
-What about The Sing More?
-Isn't The Sing More a good idea?

1225
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,621
Then, between those two,

1226
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,756
one got one point
and the other got first place?

1227
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,393
One person got 14 votes
and the other person got one vote.

1228
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,830
-Let me announce the first place.
-Why am I up against him again?

1229
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,698
I know. This looks familiar.

1230
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,867
Didn't they compete with dancing?

1231
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,836
My pride was really hurt then.

1232
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:03,240
-What the heck?
-This one was a pretty classy game though.

1233
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,909
The presentation for a new business.

1234
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,646
-I thought mine was really good.
-Who's the final winner?

1235
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,747
Congratulations.

1236
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,282
Hong Jin-kyung's The Kitchen.

1237
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,552
CONGRATULATIONS
THE KITCHEN

1238
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:20,391
EXPRESSES HIS GRATITUDE
IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER

1239
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,859
He got one point?

1240
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,161
-He got one point?
-Who is the one person

1241
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,929
that voted for The Sing More?

1242
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,231
He got one point?

1243
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,966
I'll install a coin karaoke for you.

1244
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,068
-I'll install one for you.
-I really want to know

1245
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,903
who Ms. Hong voted for.

1246
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,305
-Ms. Hong? Oh, yeah. That's important.
-Yes.

1247
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,206
The Kitchen?

1248
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,409
-Ms. Hong voted…
-It must be The Kitchen.

1249
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,444
-…for The Kitchen.
-Thank you.

1250
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,047
It was the most realistic one.

1251
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,749
-Yes.
-It could be implemented immediately.

1252
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:49,520
I think there were others
who voted for The Kitchen, right?

1253
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,221
-That would be me.
-Thank you.

1254
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,424
-Woo-jae.
-I voted for The Long too.

1255
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,059
-Did you?
-I voted for The Long.

1256
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,393
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1257
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,861
I voted for The Long too.

1258
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,963
-Really? You did vote for The Long.
-Yes.

1259
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,832
-Let's hear him out.
-Okay.

1260
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,268
You know what? I'm okay.

1261
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,336
-I got the staff's overwhelming vote.
-First place.

1262
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,273
They just won by voting for each other.

1263
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,309
I got all the votes from the public.

1264
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,977
I voted for The Puff Up, Jin-kyung.

1265
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,215
Honestly, what intrigued me the most

1266
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,484
was The Sukbak.

1267
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,785
Didn't you want to try it?

1268
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,822
I wanted to use her house,
but it was disappointing that I couldn't.

1269
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,156
It's okay. Gosh.

1270
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,057
I feel so great.

1271
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,126
Can we hear what Ms. Hong has to say?

1272
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,563
Give us a general review
or why you voted him to be first place.

1273
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,432
-Also, remember who the people voted for.
-Okay.

1274
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,500
I know.

1275
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,304
If you can stay
for a little over 100,000 won,

1276
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,139
I'm sure you'd want to stay there.

1277
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,707
But from my standpoint,

1278
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,909
the price point was a bit too low.

1279
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,378
-Of course.
-I wasn't thinking about you though.

1280
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,448
What is the price you would like?

1281
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,583
-For one night?
-Yeah.

1282
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,118
Including breakfast and the clothes.

1283
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,654
-You can raise the price by a lot.
-Yeah.

1284
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,223
THINKING CAREFULLY

1285
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,825
Shouldn't I charge at least 300,000 won?

1286
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,527
-That's not bad.
-300,000 won isn't bad.

1287
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,596
-Not bad.
-300,000 won is a good price.

1288
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:10,033
Then, adding the surtax to 300,000 won
will make it 330,000 won.

1289
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,336
If you charge 330,000 won,
you'll earn 99 million won.

1290
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,370
THE CALCULATOR WORKS FAST

1291
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,708
-Then, Sae-ho is currently in first place.
-Yes.

1292
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,176
THE CURRENT 1ST PLACE SAE-HO

1293
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,112
SHOWING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ATTITUDE

1294
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,747
Now, let's move on to the next game

1295
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,983
that reflects Jin-kyung's
entrepreneurial mindset.

1296
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,284
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1297
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,686
-Let's go.
-Why am I hungry?

1298
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,322
DURING THEIR BREAK,
THE COFFEE THAT MS. HONG ORDERED ARRIVED

1299
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,524
Thank you, Jin-kyung.

1300
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,459
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1301
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,694
THANK YOU FOR THE COFFEE

1302
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,030
ONE HOUR LATER

1303
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,431
Show us the question.

1304
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,770
"Among the following, who do you think
was the most popular to the opposite sex?"

1305
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,838
-Most popular.
-One,

1306
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,140
Lighting Director Kwon Gi-jong.

1307
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,342
Two, Audio Director Lee Nam-jae.

1308
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,212
Three, Fixed-camera Director Song Man-ho.

1309
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,248
First of all, do you know who they are?

1310
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,551
-Look.
-Wait.

1311
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,985
-Come on.
-Wait.

1312
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,153
You have a death wish?

1313
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,822
-Jin-kyung, come over here.
-What?

1314
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,924
-Let go of me.
-Look.

1315
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,058
I quit!

1316
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,493
He's being weird.

1317
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,894
-He's annoying.
-Bring them here.

1318
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,830
He's going too far.

1319
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:13,764
Bring them here.

1320
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,199
You must know at least one.

1321
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,967
This is the easiest question.

1322
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,735
-You must know this.
-How do you not know?

1323
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,870
-She knows.
-She has to.

1324
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,005
-I cannot…
-Gosh, this is…

1325
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,740
Wow. Is she for real?
