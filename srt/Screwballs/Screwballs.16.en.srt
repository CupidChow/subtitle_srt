1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:04,838
FLOWERS AND ROMANCE
BLOOM IN SPRING

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:08,541
THE MELLOW SEASON
WILL MAKE YOUR HEART FLUTTER

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,912
"I'VE ADMIRED
BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS BY MYSELF"

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,983
"BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE COMPANY
NOW AS I APPRECIATE THEM"

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,352
HOPING TO FIND LOVE,

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,354
FIVE HOTTIES HAVE GATHERED HERE

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,555
Have you been well, Sae-ho?

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,391
-Hey, it's been ages.
-Thanks to--

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,525
Is your business doing well?

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,861
-Thanks to your investment.
-Your gift blew my mind.

11
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,463
Oh, it was nothing.
I know how much you love sports cars.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,298
Still, you didn't have to get me one.

13
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,068
It didn't seem like
you owned that specific edition.

14
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,404
You're right.
I didn't have that yellow one.

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,272
Thanks to your present,

16
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,074
I enjoyed a pleasant drive yesterday.

17
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,642
-I hope you liked it.
-I loved it.

18
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,844
-He's my business partner.
-It's a pleasure.

19
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,446
He doesn't have a tricycle, you see.

20
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,881
IT'S A PLEASURE, THANK YOU

21
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,682
So I got him… Oh, dear.

22
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,018
Well, he's put in some effort again.

23
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,686
ONE OTHER GUY HAS BEEN MAKING

24
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,956
OVER-THE-TOP POSES
TO CLAIM ATTENTION

25
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,825
-He's doing something again.
-Well, yeah.

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,462
-I dig the Super Bowl, you see.
-Whatever you say.

27
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,596
NEW GUY WITH STRANGE CHARMS

28
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,932
I played golf yesterday,
and the weather was amazing.

29
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,034
Yesterday, I dabbled in tennis.

30
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,636
Did you buy a tennis court?

31
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,037
I did, though it's a small one.

32
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,405
How's your four-trillion-won deal going?

33
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,407
That's become a pet project.

34
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,876
I now have my eye
on a six-trillion-won business.

35
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,812
MEN WITH QUESTIONABLE CHARMS

36
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,480
ATTENDING A BLIND DATE
IN SEARCH OF LOVE

37
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:24,851
Woo-young, a true big shot
will be joining us shortly.

38
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,121
-The lady you told me so much about?
-Yes, she's a major investor.

39
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,156
I hear her influence reaches overseas.

40
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,560
Absolutely. Her business is a success
in the global market.

41
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,462
Let me be clear, though.
She's not that lady.

42
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,430
-Hello, miss.
-Dang it.

43
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,065
-This way, please.
-My gosh.

44
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,133
Hello.

45
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,069
-Hello, miss.
-Dang it.

46
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,304
Hello.

47
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,374
A SHY LADY WITH
A CUTE LITTLE HAIRPIN

48
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,009
-This way, please.
-My gosh.

49
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,945
You look like a pretty wrestler.

50
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,346
Please come this way.

51
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,115
-Here, ma'am.
-Oh, okay.

52
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,516
-You must be the organizer.
-I'm Sook--

53
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,984
-This way.
-Sorry? Where?

54
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,719
-Please come with me.
-Where to?

55
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,955
-Wait.
-I'm here to meet new guys.

56
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,289
As I was saying,

57
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,557
let's have some fun today.

58
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,625
REJECTED

59
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,027
-I think she might be a salesperson.
-Oh, no.

60
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm here to attend a blind date.

61
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,465
I'd hate to be rude to a stranger,

62
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,467
but you have the fists of a fighter.

63
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,237
Oh, no. I've been told
that I have large hands, though.

64
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,372
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

65
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,007
-Did you say a blind date?
-Yes.

66
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,575
CUTE LADY
WITH EXTRAORDINARY FISTS

67
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,277
-My gosh!
-Ma'am!

68
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,945
Welcome, Ms. Hong.

69
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,881
I hear her influence reaches overseas.

70
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,284
Absolutely. Her business is a success
in the global market.

71
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,052
If she's nice as well…

72
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,823
Allow me to introduce
a global sensation to you.

73
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,491
Here's Ms. Hong.

74
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,659
CRACKING UP

75
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,727
Hello.

76
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,762
Can I get a balloon poodle?

77
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,797
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'D BE GREAT
AT BALLOON MODELING

78
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,066
I'm Sherry Hong, a hairstylist
and entrepreneur based in Hong Kong.

79
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,401
-My gosh.
-It's such an honor.

80
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,304
I first started out in a tiny salon,
but I now have branches in Shanghai…

81
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,906
-Not this?
-And also…

82
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,642
THAT'S STRANGE
YOU LOOK LIKE A CLOWN

83
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,544
That's her side job.

84
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,814
I also have salons
in Shenzhen, Lan Kwai Fong,

85
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,850
-Malaysia…
-I see.

86
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,452
-…Kuala Lumpur, and Vietnam.
-Isn't Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia?

87
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,054
We're leading the Southeast Asian Market…

88
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,723
THIS SOUTHEAST ASIAN
BEAUTY MARKET MOGUL

89
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,625
BUILT HER EMPIRE
FROM THE GROUND UP

90
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,794
I believe my chain
is the biggest in the area.

91
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,362
Why isn't your own hair styled?

92
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,430
FLUSH OF ANGER

93
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,531
I must say,

94
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,400
you're quite rude.

95
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,769
-Don't be like that.
-Are you trying to hit on me?

96
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,738
HER FLIRTING GAME
IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL!

97
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,774
-He might take offense.
-Was that your goal?

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,144
BLANDEST ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS ANGLE

99
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
We did a blind date episode
on our predecessor show.

100
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,781
-Do you remember?
-Sure.

101
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,450
-That was exactly two years ago.
-Has it been so long?

102
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,486
-The weather's perfect around this time.
-That's true.

103
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,121
-Many do have blind dates.
-Right.

104
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,991
I was still in my dating era back then.

105
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,894
My wife was my girlfriend then,

106
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,063
and she enjoyed that episode very much.

107
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,633
-So you were seeing her then.
-Are all of us having blind dates?

108
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,302
That's actually related to the question
I wanted to ask.

109
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,770
If you think about it,

110
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,573
-Jin-kyung and Sae-ho are married.
-That's true.

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,309
Sook has a thing going with a certain
gentleman.

112
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,811
-No, no.
-How so?

113
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,913
-He's her boyfriend.
-Is that right?

114
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,681
-A contractual one, that is.
-Stop it.

115
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,718
-I only live just for you
-That's a good impression.

116
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,019
It's a really good one.

117
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,454
TURNS INTO SOOK'S DATE

118
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,922
Hey, you do look like him too.

119
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,590
He does look like Bon-seung.

120
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,759
This is the actual dance
Bon-seung performed on stage.

121
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,394
He's right.

122
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,962
Dude, you've got good hip thrusts.

123
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,030
GEN X-ERS KNOW IT

124
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,466
I didn't travel all the way
from Hong Kong to see that mess.

125
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,900
MS. SHERRY HONG IS UPSET

126
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,968
Such nimble thrusts.

127
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,803
Are you fine with having blind dates?

128
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,472
I don't see why we'd have a problem.

129
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,775
Back then, only Jin-kyung and I
didn't get to meet anyone.

130
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,343
Look at Woo-young's sharp ensemble.

131
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,578
He looks great.

132
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,215
He's come determined
to start something with someone.

133
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,384
Yeah, as for the rest of us,

134
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,053
the characters we dressed up as
have comical elements.

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,623
-But not you, Woo-young.
-He's dressed to steal a girl's heart.

136
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,059
He's got a watch and a bracelet
he rarely wears too.

137
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,828
I dress up like this
whenever I hit a convenience store.

138
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,330
Cut that crap.

139
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,631
It's comfy and relaxed.

140
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,701
At any rate, the guys should learn
a tip or two from the ladies.

141
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,304
-We took the blind date concept literally.
-Same here.

142
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,673
I only thought of dressing smartly.

143
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,474
THEIR LOOKS
PUT THE GUYS TO SHAME

144
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,209
This much is a given for blind dates, no?

145
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,344
SNORTS

146
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,279
Can you put up your fists for me?

147
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,347
HERE I GO!

148
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,682
Goodness.

149
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,749
COME AT ME, BLIND DATE!

150
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,452
-At the end of the day, we're on a show.
-Right.

151
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,288
We ask for your families'
and Sook's date's understanding.

152
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,290
-Come on.
-We're in an alternate universe here,

153
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,026
so I'm hoping they'll be generous
with the concept.

154
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,128
So we'll be on blind dates
as fictional characters?

155
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,663
-Exactly.
-Got it.

156
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,633
-I'll think of it as a skit.
-As you should, of course.

157
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,069
I'm down with whatever
as long as it's not each other.

158
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,737
We had Jin visit us last time.

159
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,708
Could it be that we'll be having guests
on a similar level as Jin?

160
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,911
-Oh, really?
-Woo-young must've hit home.

161
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,081
I'm sure you'll all be wondering
who your dates are going to be.

162
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,784
Please take a turn to introduce us
one person you'd like as your date.

163
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,421
I hope my date and I
have compatible personalities.

164
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,990
-Who could manage that feat, though?
-Understood. And you, Sook?

165
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,393
I'm good as long as my date
isn't Yoon Jung-soo.

166
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,562
-A love triangle.
-I barely managed to shake him off.

167
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,796
What they have is rare.

168
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,998
-What about you, Woo-young?
-Let me think.

169
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,334
I'd like to meet a calm and composed woman

170
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,169
with a beautiful smile.

171
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,571
She's right next to you.

172
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,476
-Where?
-There, she has a beautiful smile.

173
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,379
SHERRY HONG,
LADY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE

174
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,714
OH, HER

175
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,849
Can I get a perm sometime?

176
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,517
Come see me whenever.

177
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,186
People scared of clowns
won't be able to watch this episode.

178
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,823
-I mean that. It's a real condition.
-I know what you mean.

179
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,458
Who would you like to meet, Jin-kyung?

180
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,659
-Well--
-Seon-jae.

181
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,229
-Who is that?
-The male lead from Lovely Runner?

182
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,331
And not Woo-seok? All right.

183
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,932
Woo-seok is far too good for me.

184
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,668
-Seon-jae would be enough.
-Are you sure you don't mean sensei?

185
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,904
-How about you, Sae-ho?
-I recently fell in love

186
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,507
with the character of Ae-sun.

187
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,510
If we could have a blind date
with fictional characters as well,

188
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,645
I would like my date to be her
so I could pamper her.

189
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,414
If I were Sae-ho, I would say,

190
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,916
"While I'm already married to her,

191
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,585
-I'd like to have a date with my wife."
-Me too.

192
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,155
-They're in their honeymoon phase.
-I expected to hear that too.

193
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,656
Why should he care about Ae-sun?

194
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,825
I can't imagine why he would mention her.

195
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,060
-His wife would feel so upset.
-We can't even edit it out.

196
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,662
AVOIDS THE CAMERA

197
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,897
If you ask me,

198
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,365
I would like my date to be--

199
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,900
-You mentioned Ae-sun.
-We heard already.

200
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,537
-That footage would make the final cut.
-Of course.

201
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,105
I want to visit the restaurant

202
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,773
-where I first met my wife.
-Give it up.

203
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,010
I'll directly announce your dates
for today's blind date.

204
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,878
Your dates for today are…

205
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,246
The crew outdid themselves.

206
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,584
-…your fellow cast mates.
-Dang it.

207
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,154
-You ran out of ideas, didn't you?
-We're one person short.

208
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,392
-You put in no effort at all.
-I'm taking this off.

209
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,295
-Why should I bother with this?
-Please let me finish.

210
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,764
DANG IT

211
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,966
I'm already mad as hell.

212
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,601
BY OURSELVES? BUT WE DRESSED UP!

213
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,902
Oh, I found something.

214
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,871
I'm taking this to my wife.

215
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,307
TOO LATE, DUDE

216
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,775
Do we really have no guests?

217
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,011
Let me explain the scenario.

218
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,481
One of Netflix's flagship dating shows

219
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,949
-is Single's Inferno.
-Single's Inferno.

220
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,016
I'm sure you'll remember.

221
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,385
Wait, but our vibe is closer
to that of I am SOLO.

222
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,821
No, wait. Are you sure
it isn't Inferno, period?

223
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,389
As you know,

224
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,191
couples on the show
spend time in "Paradise"

225
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,594
while singles must remain in "Inferno."

226
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,630
It's a bold and spicy dating show.

227
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,301
AND NOW

228
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,669
A BOLD AND SPICY DAY AWAITS

229
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,738
We promise you a bold and spicy day

230
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,641
with your fellow cast mates as your dates.

231
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,909
Isn't that nice?

232
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,310
What do you think you're doing?

233
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,578
YOU THINK SO?

234
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,380
-"Bold and spicy"?
-Exactly.

235
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,848
Gosh, I thought you were going to hit me.

236
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,283
Are we going for "bold and furious"?

237
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,553
-I thought we'd have a spicy rumble.
-I put up a guard on reflex.

238
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,021
So no one's joining us?

239
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,556
-Must we pretend to like it?
-Is it just us?

240
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,891
What if we say we hate it?

241
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,394
That is exactly why
we came up with a new concept

242
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,697
with a new twist to Single's Inferno,
one of Netflix's successful dating shows.

243
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,767
Today's theme is "Couple's Inferno."

244
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,902
SNEER

245
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,403
Do couples end up in Inferno?

246
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,373
Unlike in Single's Inferno,
singles will go to Paradise…

247
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,242
SINGLES
CAN RELAX IN THE LUXURIOUS PARADISE

248
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,380
…while couples will end up in Inferno.

249
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,681
COUPLES
MUST ENDURE A ROMANTIC DATE

250
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,351
You can earn points from games.

251
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:17,223
The person who is placed at the bottom
must remain in Inferno for a date.

252
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,725
Their partner to endure it with

253
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,596
will be decided by the votes
from the Love Kibitzers, the crew.

254
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,066
Those designated to have a date
must complete a mission

255
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,869
to escape from the Inferno.

256
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,203
FORCING YOUR CAST MEMBERS
TO HAVE A DATE?

257
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,605
THAT'S A NOVEL PENALTY

258
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,975
The bold and spicy dating show

259
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,910
"Couple's Inferno" begins now.

260
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,279
-Hello.
-Hi!

261
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,682
I can supply you with kimchi
for the rest of your life.

262
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,718
To ferment us to death?

263
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,157
Hey, my net worth is two trillion won.

264
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,659
Be mine if you want to use it.

265
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,329
That's baloney.

266
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,432
Hi, I was born to shower
my sweetheart with love.

267
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,200
And you, my sweetheart,
were born to be loved.

268
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,602
That's my opening line. Thanks.

269
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,706
Hi.

270
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,475
My purse is filled with bills.

271
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,543
(CREW MEMBER'S PURSE)

272
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,777
Who wants to hang with me?

273
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,979
So you're a pickpocket.

274
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,115
With me as your partner,

275
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,483
your life will be…

276
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,251
full of laughter…

277
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,319
Full of laugh lines.

278
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,021
You'll get plenty of laugh lines as well.

279
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,159
This episode is bound to bomb.

280
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,029
WHO WILL END UP ENDURING A DATE
IN INFERNO AS A COUPLE?

281
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,697
Welcome to Couple's Inferno,

282
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,699
the hottest hell on earth.

283
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,736
-Let's go!
-I'll avoid that no matter what.

284
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,304
I'm most at ease when I'm single.

285
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,806
I'll work harder
than in any of the episodes so far.

286
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,341
-Same here.
-I'm going to go to Paradise.

287
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,609
There's a benefit there, right?

288
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,078
The Paradise itself
will offer you a pleasant time.

289
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,748
You can rest there.

290
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,815
-Really?
-Of course.

291
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,283
-Okay.
-As we should.

292
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,685
SINGLES CAN REST IN PARADISE

293
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,121
DELICIOUS FOOD IS PREPARED

294
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,891
I'll now announce the first game
that will decide your fate.

295
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,860
-It's the Lipstick Game.
-Lipstick?

296
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,662
What's that about?

297
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,096
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

298
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,666
Do you perhaps remember
Dex's first scene in Single's Inferno?

299
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,035
-Of course.
-Everyone would remember that one.

300
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,004
Can you recall the name of the game
he played back then?

301
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,273
CRAWL ON THE GROUND ON ALL FOURS

302
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,777
TO REACH YOUR GOAL USING
EVERY LAST OUNCE OF YOUR POWER

303
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,782
ANYHOW, IT REQUIRES STRENGTH

304
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,017
Our first game of the day

305
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,888
is Three-way Triangle Tug-of-War.

306
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,723
-Just a moment.
-If that's the case…

307
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,324
Will Sook and Jin-kyung be competing too?

308
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,326
Do all five of us have to play it?

309
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,961
You went too far with that one.

310
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,263
I think it's for the three guys.

311
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,200
The men and the women
will play the game separately.

312
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,003
Even then, I just don't think I'd cut it.

313
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,705
I mean, I'm clearly at a disadvantage.

314
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,906
Can Sun-gyu join us?

315
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,075
SUN-GYU WOULDN'T HAVE REALIZED…

316
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,910
The one who lost
at arm wrestling against me.

317
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,746
…THAT HIS DEFEAT
WOULD BE PLAYED AGAIN AND AGAIN

318
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,481
You were phenomenal back then.

319
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,982
Anyhow, I'll play against the girls.

320
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,617
Go ahead. Join us.

321
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,888
-I should get to do that.
-Let's talk about the rules in detail.

322
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,291
Three players will compete
in each game of tug-of-war.

323
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,127
Obviously, you'll have to move forward
in the direction you're facing.

324
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,663
At its end, a cast member
of the opposite sex will be there.

325
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,766
You'll be given one minute
to apply lipstick to that person's lips.

326
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,969
The person to do so best wins the game.

327
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,271
-So we have to put it on them?
-That is correct.

328
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,474
We'd get our share of the lipstick, then.

329
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,610
-For the women's game, yes.
-They'll put it on us.

330
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,612
I'm already wearing
a whole lot of lipstick.

331
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,681
-I have to add more?
-You'll have to remove it.

332
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,917
Putting the lipstick on your partner first
doesn't guarantee your victory.

333
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,522
Whoever applies it the best
will be declared the winner.

334
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,125
Wait, we have three guys here,
so one wouldn't have a partner.

335
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,294
WE NEED ANOTHER WOMAN…

336
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,395
You're right.

337
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,498
We're one woman short, aren't we?

338
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,966
Do we have a guest?

339
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,335
-So there is a guest after all.
-Here we go.

340
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,604
We have a guest joining us
to even out the numbers.

341
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,938
A FEMALE GAME CHANGER

342
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,709
-What are the upcoming Netflix shows?
-So my efforts aren't being wasted.

343
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,544
Could she be an actress?

344
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
Could it be Suzy?

345
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,784
Please join us.

346
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,287
ANTICIPATION RUNS HIGH

347
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,389
-No, ma'am.
-As if.

348
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,791
-Oh, dear.
-Out of my way.

349
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,958
Like I said, get out of my way.

350
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,695
-Ma'am!
-Stop following me around!

351
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,832
CRACKING UP

352
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,133
It's been a while.

353
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,935
-I said I don't want it!
-It's been ages.

354
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,370
-Ms. Kim.
-That's enough.

355
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,238
"Ms. Kim"?

356
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,940
I warned you. Stop following me.

357
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,442
Respectfully, the chairman
ordered us to keep you safe.

358
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,679
Listen, I'm not interested
in arranged marriages.

359
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,947
No, Mr… I mean, Ms. Kim.

360
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,015
"Mr. Kim"?

361
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,817
OOPS

362
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,385
SMOTHERS A LAUGH

363
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,053
-He called her a mister.
-Just a second.

364
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,524
Give this message to my dad.

365
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,626
Tell him I won't stay
as his girl in the bubbles.

366
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,794
-No!
-Get lost!

367
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,830
-Ms. Kim!
-I said, leave!

368
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,932
It must've taken ages
to let her hair grow so long.

369
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,567
What now?

370
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,202
Would you look at that?

371
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,538
SAVAGE

372
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,106
SHAKEN

373
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,343
HEIRESS GEARING UP FOR A FIGHT

374
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,611
-She's no joke.
-Bring it on!

375
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,681
I'LL BE THE MASTER OF MY LIFE

376
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,816
THESE GOONS CAN'T CONTROL ME

377
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,421
-She punched him for real!
-She tagged him clean.

378
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,190
WE'RE TERRIFIED

379
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,027
MR. CHAIRMAN, WHO OR WHAT
DID YOU RAISE IN YOUR BUBBLES?

380
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,234
GOODNESS…

381
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,668
He took a punch to the gut.

382
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,203
I'll find the right guy for me.

383
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,539
ENDING FAIRY

384
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,607
FEELING THE GROUND

385
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,308
The ground's not soft at all.

386
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,577
HER BODYGUARDS ARE CRUSHED

387
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,679
-I think he's bleeding.
-Are you sure they're fine?

388
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,314
WORKERS' COMP REQUIRED…

389
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,849
-He got hit hard.
-Return to your posts.

390
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,018
-Return to what?
-To their posts.

391
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,386
-Adjust your clothes.
-Ma'am.

392
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,454
Grab your sunglasses.

393
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,422
It's been too long, Hye-seon.

394
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,224
NEWCOMER WITH BRUTE STRENGTH

395
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,959
We made our comeback, Hye-seon.

396
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,795
-"I'll be back."
-You've made it back. Welcome.

397
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,798
If you ask me,
those guys still have trouble breathing.

398
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,166
Thank you, Hye-seon's friends.

399
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,735
THANK YOU,
PARK GYU-MIN AND AN HYEONG-SU

400
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,471
Did you smack him harder
for almost calling you Mr. Kim?

401
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,240
A PUNCH WITH FEELINGS

402
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,809
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU CALL AN HEIRESS A MISTER

403
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,346
Welcome to Couple's Inferno,
the hottest hell on earth.

404
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,482
This is your new castmate, Hye-seon.

405
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,552
GRACEFUL

406
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,388
-Aren't you cold?
-I am cold.

407
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,456
Being a member of a distinguished family,

408
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,593
her father, the chairman, opposed
her decision to join us on the show.

409
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,695
He tried to stop her
by sending extra bodyguards,

410
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,830
but she bested them
and joined us nonetheless.

411
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,400
The bodyguards are to remain here
per the chairman's request,

412
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,335
and we ask for your understanding.

413
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,004
It's been a while, Hye-seon.
Could you please introduce yourself?

414
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,806
It's a pleasure.

415
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,878
My gosh, Hye-seon.

416
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,147
I felt it, to be honest.

417
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,317
MY HEART STIRRING UP LIKE CRAZY

418
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,484
Right here.

419
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,354
I'll work harder
than in any of the episodes so far.

420
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,422
BUT SHE'S IRRESISTIBLE

421
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,357
GET LOST

422
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,559
-She's no joke.
-You might get hurt. Stay away.

423
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,195
How about this jacket?

424
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,563
SAE-HO APPROACHES HER THIS TIME

425
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,401
SAE-HO MUST BE TO HER LIKING

426
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,236
-This heiress is so feisty.
-Hurry.

427
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,341
Sae-ho?

428
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,347
When I meet a new guy,

429
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,449
I take in their physique first.

430
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,818
I see if they're well-built

431
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,454
and look dependable enough.

432
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,855
Considering how things are,

433
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,524
it seemed like…

434
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,027
her family was rather affluent.

435
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,795
Some may call me superficial,

436
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,565
but the fact did appeal to me.

437
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,300
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

438
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,370
My name is Kim Hye-seon.
I was born in 1997, the year of the pig.

439
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,738
My hobbies are…

440
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,539
-In 1997?
-…pulling tires by the teeth

441
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,009
and slicing up radish with nunchucks.

442
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,113
-Weren't you around in the 1988 Olympics?
-Shut it.

443
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,714
IT'S A FAUX PAS
TO ASK A LADY'S AGE

444
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,282
Gosh, she's not holding back.

445
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,353
From what I hear,
her father owns a large corporation.

446
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,623
She has such long and thick hair

447
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,025
as well as physical strength.

448
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,095
It seemed like she was showing off
all her diverse assets.

449
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,197
That got on my nerves.

450
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,334
Earlier, we saw Sae-ho

451
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,438
give Hye-seon his jacket
so she wouldn't be cold out there.

452
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,608
You can only acquire good manners
through practice,

453
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,343
and I took note of his fine manners.

454
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,279
ORIGINALLY
YOU HAVE TO AVOID BECOMING A COUPLE

455
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,983
Things sure got heated
now our cast members are evenly matched.

456
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,452
All right. Let's begin the Lipstick Game.

457
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,989
All contestants will be given points
according to their ranks.

458
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,257
First place gets 100 points.

459
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,658
Second place, 30 points.

460
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,693
-The points vary, I see.
-Third place, zero points.

461
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,529
-Geez. I must aim high.
-Those are the rules.

462
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,531
The three-way game
will determine first place.

463
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,168
Those who didn't place first will play
another match to determine their ranks.

464
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,436
A second-place match?

465
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,204
A LIGHT WARM-UP

466
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,873
-Wait. So the three of us are competing?
-That's right.

467
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,608
She's going to be unstoppable.

468
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,277
QUAKING

469
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,179
-Lucky us, then.
-Thank goodness.

470
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,048
-If we had to compete against her--
-Shouldn't she play against these guys?

471
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,750
She's playing with Jin-kyung and me?

472
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,818
Wait, Hye-seon.

473
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,420
Your hamstrings are incredible.

474
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,189
My legs are…

475
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,356
Well, yeah.

476
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,525
They're just…

477
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,028
I've put on some muscle.
That's how they normally are.

478
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,598
Please hand the guys a lipstick each.

479
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,834
Please look this way, guys.

480
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,803
-Okay.
-This is a blind date episode,

481
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,973
so we'll now give you a choice
to select the woman

482
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,508
you want to put lipstick on.

483
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,843
I want Sook.

484
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:36,482
At moments, Sook acts all shy.

485
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,784
Those moments do make your heart flutter.

486
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,586
HEH-HEH

487
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,221
What about you, Woo-jae?

488
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,655
-How about you?
-Well…

489
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,361
A HELLISH CHOICE
BETWEEN TWO OPTIONS

490
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,263
I'll go with Hye-seon.

491
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,598
-Hye-seon?
-Yeah.

492
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,665
SMIRK

493
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,733
He's got high standards.

494
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,170
Winning me over will be
the biggest challenge in the world.

495
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,005
I'll go with Jin-kyung.

496
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,073
Let me tell you why.

497
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,842
Her torso is longer than others,

498
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,011
-so if she leans in even just a bit--
-Wait.

499
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,780
But you won't even get that far
because you're too weak.

500
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,282
YOU'VE GOT A POINT

501
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,717
Once we're paired up,

502
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,986
does that make us a team?

503
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,889
Your partner will be the same
for the women's game.

504
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,590
-Okay. Let's do this!
-That's how we'll play it.

505
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,826
A COUPLE'S GAME
TO AVOID BECOMING A COUPLE

506
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,395
THE MEN'S FIRST GAME
TO DETERMINE THE WINNER

507
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,731
This won't be easy, Jin-kyung.

508
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,999
GUARDING THE LADY

509
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,034
MENACING MORAL SUPPORT

510
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,736
I should lower my center of gravity.

511
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,638
I feel confident about my strength.

512
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,673
I'm wide alert.

513
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,342
I'm long-limbed compared to other guys.

514
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,078
I thought it could give me an edge.

515
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,080
Ready.

516
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,082
HOPING TO RECREATE DEX'S SUCCESS

517
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,384
Set…

518
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,485
GO!

519
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,287
CACKLES

520
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,957
AS EXPECTED
MR. SCARECROW GETS DRAGGED AWAY

521
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,759
BLISSFULLY HAPPY

522
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,728
DESPERATELY HANGING IN THERE

523
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,264
THIS GUY IS STRUGGLING TOO

524
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,699
What is he doing? Goodness.

525
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,069
-Gosh, Sae-ho.
-Wow, I'm impressed, Sae-ho.

526
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,272
ACE PLAYER AMONG THE WEAKLINGS

527
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,640
HURRY OVER TO ME

528
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,876
WOO-BROTHERS
ARE BEING DRAGGED AWAY

529
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,278
WAIT FOR ME, HYE-SEON

530
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,780
It's slippery.

531
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,548
It's because it's slippery.

532
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,983
-Just a bit further.
-It's slippery.

533
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,118
WHILE SAE-HO STRUGGLES,

534
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,520
WOO-YOUNG MAKES HEADWAY

535
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,821
Just a bit further, Woo-young.

536
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,256
READYING THE LIPSTICK

537
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,257
Come on, Woo-young.

538
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,725
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE!

539
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,160
You're slipping away, Woo-young.

540
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,494
LOSES A SHOE

541
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,898
AS THEY STUMBLE
WOO-JAE STARTS TO PUSH AHEAD

542
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,200
THIS IS MY SHOT

543
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,236
-What's going on?
-It's the slippery grass.

544
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,539
HOW IS WOO-JAE WINNING?

545
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,607
What on earth, Woo-jae?

546
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,041
I'M ALMOST THERE

547
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,543
Seriously, Woo-jae!

548
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,877
AGAIN, I'M SO CLOSE

549
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,347
Who was that just now?

550
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,449
I ONLY TOOK A FEW STEPS BACK

551
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,084
TO BUILD UP MOMENTUM

552
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,418
FALLS BACKWARD

553
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,753
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

554
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,054
CRACKS UP

555
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,390
Gosh, look at Sae-ho!

556
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,959
IN THE MIDST OF THE WHOLE FIASCO

557
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,527
SAE-HO SEIZES HIS CHANCE

558
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,063
FINALLY GETS CLOSE ENOUGH
TO HIS PARTNER

559
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,632
APPLIES THE LIPSTICK

560
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,766
Get Sae-ho away from her.

561
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,201
Work together, you two.

562
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,369
SABOTEUR APPROACHING

563
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,336
Dang it.

564
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,305
MAKEUP SESSION DOESN'T STOP
DESPITE THE DIRTY TRICK

565
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,373
Hold on.

566
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,474
Mine broke.

567
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,541
RIP LIPSTICK

568
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,810
You should've had it twisted down.

569
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,615
Hurry, Woo-jae.

570
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,617
NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY PULL

571
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,185
Woo-young!

572
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,253
THESE TWO ARE UNAFFECTED

573
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,321
Woo-jae!

574
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,922
Drag him over together.

575
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,125
-Okay.
-What on earth?

576
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,893
You didn't even get close to me.

577
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,795
Why are you so weak?

578
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,397
I was almost there.

579
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,931
HEH

580
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,501
There's no suspense at all.

581
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,336
Send me to the Couple's Inferno.

582
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,171
No, I think I should end up there.

583
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,773
All right. Nicely done!

584
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,609
In the men's game,

585
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,445
-Sae-ho claimed first place.
-Let's go!

586
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,613
It wasn't so bad.

587
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,814
Not bad at all.

588
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,316
-It was great.
-Okay.

589
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,483
How should I put this?

590
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,951
Seeing him

591
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,087
approach me so daringly

592
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,989
made me feel like giving him a hug

593
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,724
or protecting him from any harm.

594
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,659
I've never applied lipstick
on anyone before.

595
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,695
I've only done that to Hye-seon.

596
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:14,366
I hope we can share a pleasant time
as considerate adults.

597
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,401
MEN'S SECOND-PLACE GAME

598
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,569
Ready.

599
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,037
-Let's do this!
-Good luck!

600
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,105
You've got this.

601
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,641
IF THEY LOSE AGAIN,

602
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,744
THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF ENDING UP
IN INFERNO INCREASES

603
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,312
Set…

604
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,249
GROAN AND TEARS

605
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,586
MR. SCARECROW FLAILING YET AGAIN

606
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,455
I KNEW IT

607
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,689
He's really not my type.

608
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,959
HE'S LIKE A NEWBORN CALF

609
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,794
IN THE MEANTIME…

610
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,833
DROPS THE LIPSTICK
PICKS IT UP

611
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,637
UNFORTUNATE VICTIM
FOR THE GREATER GOOD

612
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,072
I'M SORRY, SOOK

613
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,174
MUFFLED

614
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,509
Seriously, punk.

615
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,145
Do you have a death wish,
you crazy son of a b****?

616
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,714
-How dare you?
-Woo-young!

617
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,549
ENJOYING HER BREAD,
HAVING THE WORST DAY OF HIS LIFE

618
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,817
He's the worst.

619
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,252
HIS IMAGE TANKS
AS HE DOES HIS BEST

620
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,720
Lie flat on the ground, Woo-jae.

621
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,389
-Hey, Jang Woo-young.
-Hang in there.

622
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,691
Stay right there. You can do it.

623
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,792
It's over.

624
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,895
Still, Woo-young went way too far!

625
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,597
REMINDS YOU OF PRINCESS MONONOKE

626
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,166
We should be talking about Woo-jae,
not Woo-young.

627
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,567
He's a feeble wimp.

628
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,635
What are you chewing?

629
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,437
Bread.

630
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,241
How could you be eating something
while your partner is suffering here?

631
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,543
I don't want to partner up
with Woo-young anymore.

632
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,944
I'm so sorry.

633
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,346
CACKLES

634
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,815
You didn't have to go this far.

635
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,350
MY BAD, I WAS IN A RUSH

636
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,086
Woo-young takes second place
in the men's game. Congratulations.

637
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,988
Why are you so weak, Woo-jae?

638
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,055
Woo-jae.

639
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,390
You're not hurt or anything, are you?

640
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,259
Seriously, where's Sun-gyu?

641
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,728
WHAT A WIMP

642
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,197
THIS IS HIS LIFE'S ACHIEVEMENT

643
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,333
-Now, let's begin the women's game.
-Okay!

644
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,035
I'm terrified.

645
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,070
-I'm scared too.
-Good luck, Sook!

646
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,138
Wait, Director Park.

647
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,542
We're partnered up for the games,

648
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,976
but we're scored separately, right?

649
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,311
-That's right.
-Sure.

650
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,379
Okay, then.

651
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,648
STILL A ROTTEN JERK

652
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,850
You have to lean in
for a better shot at this.

653
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,485
He said we were scored separately.

654
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,321
You're really mean, you know that?

655
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:17,989
WHO CARES? NOT ME

656
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,126
Think of it as rock climbing.
Try using this edge of your feet.

657
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,094
-Okay, I got it.
-Great. Try it that way.

658
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,162
-Just like that.
-Ready.

659
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,797
You've got this, Sook!

660
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,199
-Let's do this, Sae-ho!
-Good luck!

661
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,667
-Wait for me, babe.
-Sure thing!

662
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,702
DO YOUR BEST OR WHATEVER…

663
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,370
HE REALLY MUST HAVE ISSUES

664
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,438
-You can do this!
-Do it!

665
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,340
WHILE HYE-SEON IS LIKELY
TO WIN BY A LANDSLIDE…

666
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,775
THE GAME BEGINS!

667
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,445
AS EXPECTED…

668
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,981
SHERRY HONG IS FLUNG AWAY
LIKE A PAPER DOLL

669
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,249
You don't stand a chance.

670
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,751
-Oh, man!
-What on earth?

671
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,258
UNEXPECTED
STRONG START FROM SOOK

672
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,193
PLASTERS IT ALL OVER HIS LIPS

673
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,928
What's going on?

674
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,697
What happened to Sook?

675
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,933
HYE-SEON SLIPPED
EARLY ON IN THE GAME

676
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,969
Damn it. It's so slippery.

677
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,838
SEIZING HER CHANCE

678
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,740
SOOK REACHED HER PARTNER
IN A FLASH

679
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,110
LOCKED ON COORDINATES

680
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,279
Jong-kook saw Sook lifting weights

681
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,615
-and gave her his approval.
-Hang in there.

682
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,517
GRIPPING FIRMLY

683
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,619
I'm almost done.

684
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,988
SHE EVEN HAS THE EXTRA SUPPORT
FROM HER PARTNER

685
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,590
For your information,
you don't get any points, Woo-young.

686
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,992
Is that right?

687
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,059
Is that right?

688
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,095
TIME TO RETURN
TO HER ORIGINAL POST

689
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,162
Here she comes.

690
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,597
LET'S GO

691
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,533
BRINGING DEX'S ENERGY

692
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,667
Hang in there, Sook.

693
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,936
She's something else.

694
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,304
Hang in there. No!

695
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,372
I'm Kim Hye-seon!

696
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,108
GETTING DRAGGED ACROSS THE LAWN

697
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,378
SHE IS COMING TO ME

698
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,445
Here she is.

699
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,348
SHE'S TRAINED HER WHOLE LIFE

700
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,919
FINALLY REACHES SAE-HO

701
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,354
LET ME DOLL YOU UP

702
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,823
WON'T GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT

703
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,392
FALTERS

704
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,827
ARGH!!!

705
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,930
PULLS HIS HAIR

706
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,966
HURRIEDLY ENDS THE GAME

707
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,003
MY PRECIOUS HAIR…

708
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,638
It was so slippery.

709
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,774
Man, you were amazing, Sook.

710
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,841
I'm exhausted.

711
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,109
DARK HORSE OF THE GAME, SOOK

712
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,545
I'M GOING TO CRY HERE

713
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,180
-Now--
-I'm amazed.

714
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,548
I thought Hye-seon would win easily.

715
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,050
-What's up with her?
-Could anyone go

716
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,618
-and check on her?
-She's napping.

717
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,686
What happened?

718
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,220
-Jin-kyung.
-The day is too long.

719
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,389
This day is dragging on forever.

720
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,125
We still have to see
who applied the lipstick better.

721
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,293
I still applied it first.

722
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,495
But what matters is
who applied it better, right?

723
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,997
We'll review the results.

724
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,503
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE LIPSTICK
ON THEIR LIPS

725
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,306
NOT FAR OUT OF LINE FROM HIS LIPS
BUT THERE ARE BLANK SPOTS

726
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,509
LIPSTICK COVERS HIS LIPS
AND ALMOST REACHES HIS NOSTRILS

727
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,446
-The game goes to Sook!
-There we go!

728
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,116
SOOK SECURES A WIN
AGAINST ALL ODDS

729
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,818
No, I'm not exactly working out.

730
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,020
My muscles grow on their own regardless.

731
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,955
To tell you the truth, these…

732
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,156
aren't my boobs.

733
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,224
(THEY'RE PECS)

734
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:07,926
You're amazing, Sook.

735
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,327
-How incredible.
-Isn't it so slippery?

736
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,596
-I couldn't do much either.
-I'm exhausted.

737
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,998
How did you manage to hang in there?

738
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,265
Look at her shoes!

739
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,533
She's wearing killer cleats.

740
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,469
SECRET TO HER VICTORY
SPIKED SHOES

741
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,570
Could these have helped?

742
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,206
MEANWHILE, SHERRY HONG…

743
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,778
SHE'S DEVASTATED AT THE THOUGHT
OF GOING AGAINST HYE-SEON NEXT

744
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,980
We'd have to play
the second-place match, right?

745
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,081
But is it necessary?

746
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,216
Here's a suggestion.

747
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,283
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

748
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,320
Are you open to Woo-jae
competing in your place?

749
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,388
I'm down with that.

750
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,991
-It's time to restore your pride.
-You can do this, Woo-jae.

751
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,594
Think about it, Sae-ho.
I'd have trouble even if I won,

752
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,562
and it'd be much worse if I lost.

753
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,332
I don't want to feel small.
I'm a guy with pride too!

754
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,367
Come on, you can beat her.

755
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,702
You can do it.

756
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,971
-Jin-kyung isn't feeling well. Help her.
-Come on, dude.

757
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,372
Woo-jae.

758
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,440
Come here.

759
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,409
She wants you to face her. Get out there.

760
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,611
-Yeah, go ahead.
-I have to face more humiliation?

761
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,012
NO MAN BACKS DOWN FROM A FIGHT

762
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,014
-Go on.
-Take her down in one go.

763
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,449
-Honestly…
-Show us what you've got.

764
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,217
-Woo-jae. Wait.
-How am I supposed to do that?

765
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,453
The game now will decide
who gets second place, right?

766
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,988
If you win, we'll award the points to you.

767
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,056
Really?

768
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,292
-Jin-kyung already gave up anyway.
-That's true.

769
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,294
-You can give him the points.
-We'll award them to you.

770
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,230
You're a guy too. I'm sure you can win.

771
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,666
I'm sure all of our crew remembers

772
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,902
-the Field Day episode.
-Don't try to spin it already.

773
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,303
The guys threw the game away--

774
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,971
DON'T BUILD UP AN EXCUSE

775
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,840
The match will decide who gets 30 points.

776
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,041
Give it all you've got.

777
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,910
GULP

778
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,645
It seemed I met a worthy foe at long last.

779
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,346
How dare he?

780
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,749
WOMEN'S SECOND-PLACE MATCH

781
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,850
Ready.

782
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,019
THIS WILL DECIDE THE RANKS
AMONG THE WOMEN

783
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,320
Crouch down.

784
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,924
IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY

785
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,525
I PLAN ON MAKING HISTORY TODAY

786
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,660
Set.

787
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,196
GO!

788
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,431
WHO WILL TRIUMPH?

789
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,968
Lie flat on the ground.

790
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,738
-Geez!
-Lie on the ground.

791
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:00,805
Lie flat on the ground.

792
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,040
IT ONLY TOOK 1 SECOND

793
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,408
-Lie on the ground.
-Look at you, wimp.

794
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,943
STARTS APPLYING LIPSTICK
WITH EASE

795
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,045
EVEN I CAN HOLD OUT LONGE
THAN YOU

796
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,081
-You can do this. Take one step at a time.
-You've got this.

797
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,149
One step at a time.

798
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,250
It's so slippery!

799
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,185
-You're the problem.
-Spread out your feet.

800
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,221
Men rarely lose to women
in a game of strength.

801
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,759
THIS COUPLE IS SHARING
A SWEET MOMENT TOGETHER

802
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,327
FEELING SHY

803
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,728
Try moving diagonally.

804
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,396
-Looks like they're all set.
-Bend your arms.

805
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,298
DOES HIS BEST UNTIL THE END

806
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,067
HOW BOTHERSOME

807
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,138
GET OVER HERE, YOU

808
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,640
ROLLING

809
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,610
TAKE THAT
FOR DISTURBING MY LOVE LIFE

810
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,677
Be careful.

811
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,180
CRACKING UP

812
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,649
This makeup artist offers great service.

813
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,817
What on earth is this?

814
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,386
UTTER HUMILIATION

815
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,454
THIS IS HELLISH

816
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,522
Great service.

817
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,424
Hey, Woo-jae.

818
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,560
She spun you like a pinwheel.

819
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,428
Are you okay, Woo-jae?

820
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,297
Goodness. Are you okay, Hye-seon?

821
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,800
Damn it. Get lost.

822
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,169
Come on. It won't do for me to hurt you.

823
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,071
I'll announce the final results
of the women's game.

824
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,507
Hold on. Could you leave out "women's"?

825
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,111
LET HIM KEEP
HIS LAST PIECE OF DIGNITY

826
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,548
Second place went to Hye-seon,
and third place to Woo-jae. Congrats.

827
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,485
Goodness, Woo-jae. I hope you don't cry.

828
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,120
-Don't cry, Woo-jae.
-Hey, Woo-jae.

829
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,756
-Your considerate nature shone.
-It sure did.

830
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,492
I wonder why he looks so pitiful.

831
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,894
He may look good on the outside,

832
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,564
but he's a failure as a man.

833
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,432
I wonder if he could defend himself.

834
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,034
I won't ask him to protect anyone else.

835
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,469
I merely wish he was strong enough
to keep himself safe.

836
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,905
After the game, he approached me

837
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,041
and asked if I saw
how he went easy on Hye-seon.

838
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,510
Could he be more pathetic?

839
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,146
It felt as if I was competing by myself.

840
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,049
It was as if there was no one there,

841
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,219
leaving me to approach Sae-ho
without any trouble.

842
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,956
It was my way of showing
my deep devotion to variety shows--

843
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,159
SOMETIMES YOU CAN LOSE
TO A WOMAN IN A BATTLE OF STRENGTH

844
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,527
ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON

845
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,396
ONE HOUR LATER

846
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,433
As we continue with the challenge
of holding back laughter,

847
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,301
could I ask a small question?

848
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,736
-May I do that?
-Sure.

849
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,939
-We'll have to avoid laughing from now on.
-Of course.

850
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,942
Which middle school did you attend?

851
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,043
IS THIS OFTEN ASKED ON DATES?

852
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,546
Kimsang Middle School.

853
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,615
Oh, Kimsang Middle School. That place…

854
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,416
Isn't it an all-boys school?

855
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,318
-1 POINT

856
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,054
Isn't it an all-boys school?

857
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,056
TEARS

858
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:36,060
FOCUS,
LET'S THINK ABOUT SAD THINGS

859
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,328
FLINCH

860
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,064
-Oh, you can't do that.
-Isn't that inappropriate?

861
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,035
FAILS TO HOLD BACK LAUGHTER
AS HER PAST IS EXPOSED SO EASILY

862
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,436
THEY'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET

863
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,239
I'm a graduate
of Lan Kwai Fong Girls' Middle School.

864
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,241
LAN KWAI FONG?

865
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,777
TWITCH

866
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,680
Oh, if it's not too much to ask,

867
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,917
could you please sing us
a verse of your school song?

868
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,686
