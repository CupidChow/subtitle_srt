1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,136
Please love us. We'll do our best.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,037
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,372
THE FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY, 2025

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,974
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

5
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,376
FEBRUARY

00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,111
MARCH

00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,679
APRIL

8
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,247
MAY

9
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,815
JUNE

10
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,384
JULY

11
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,952
AUGUST

12
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,520
SEPTEMBER

13
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,355
OCTOBER

14
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,890
NOVEMBER

15
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,993
1 YEAR OF WORKING HARD NONSTOP

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,661
Is this the last shoot for the season?

17
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,796
-Yeah.
-Right?

18
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,264
I'll make it funny.

19
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,432
REAFFIRMING THEIR RESOLVE
FOR THE SHOOT TODAY

20
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,134
THEY SHOWED UP IN OUTFITS
THAT GIVE NO CLUE TO THE THEME

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,368
Shall we appear one by one?

22
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,237
Appear one by one?

23
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,438
Shall we open together?

24
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,974
FOR SOME REASON, ONE PERSON IS MISSING

25
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,242
What's up with Woo-young?

26
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,843
Tell us what's going on with him.

27
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,844
WOO-YOUNG IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

28
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,179
What's going on with him?

29
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,581
-He has been vomiting a lot.
-I see.

30
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,384
So he has to drop by a clinic.

31
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,752
He should go to a hospital.

32
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,354
There aren't any hospitals here.

33
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,489
Before we do our opening,

34
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,725
-we should explain this to the viewers.
-Yes, we should.

35
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,493
-Let's explain it to them.
-Yes.

36
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,694
First of all,

37
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,630
I think viewers would be curious about

38
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,598
why we look serious
when we're dressed like this.

39
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,766
Hang on.

40
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,301
-Yes?
-What are you supposed to be?

41
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,904
-I feel bad for my sister.
-Slowly…

42
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,938
Let me…

43
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,807
explain it slowly.

44
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,775
I can't express myself

45
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,211
-to the extent that I want because--
-What's wrong?

46
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,345
What's wrong?

47
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,214
-What's up with him?
-What the heck?

48
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,849
Why does he look like this?

49
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,217
Welcome, Do-yeon.

50
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,187
You guys look sicker than Woo-young.

51
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,555
Hello.

52
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,092
Before we make a proper appearance,
how are we going to open?

53
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,793
-Look. Let's take a seat.
-Let's sit.

54
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,463
-We encountered an unexpected incident.
-Yes.

55
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,866
But we have to make it fun
since it's our last episode of the season.

56
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,334
What's up with you?

57
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,469
Well, I am…

58
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,238
-Should we introduce ourselves…
-I'm a human yut.

59
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,673
…or explain the situation?

60
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,475
-I'm a human yut.
-Let's explain.

61
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,976
-But that's not important.
-Right.

62
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,213
We don't see Woo-young
in the studio right now, do we?

63
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,281
I heard that he is very sick.

64
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,719
He got sick on his way back
from finishing his tour overseas, right?

65
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,087
Extreme fatigue?

66
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,524
-Woo-young loves this place though.
-I know.

67
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,126
THIS PLACE THAT WOO-YOUNG LOVES

68
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,428
THE BATHHOUSE

69
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,098
COZY

70
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,935
Woo-young used to
get haircuts and styled here.

71
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,104
-That's right.
-He liked the jjimjilbang too.

72
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,975
What about this? Why don't we
keep an eye on the situation,

73
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,277
but do our own opening for now?

74
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,045
Appear one by one, then?

75
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,214
Yeah, why not?
That wouldn't be such a big deal.

76
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,616
Like we're just starting? Okay.

77
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,553
Wait, are we going to appear one by one
after we just shot this whole scene?

78
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,024
-That would be better, right?
-Would that even make sense?

79
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,328
-We should do the usual.
-Let me explain what's going on, viewers.

80
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:47,667
Woo-young isn't feeling well today,
so he can't join us currently, so--

81
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,870
-Sae-ho. Please step out and come back.
-Oh, step out?

82
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,172
-Get out.
-We explained it already.

83
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,406
-Did we?
-Yes.

84
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,542
Jin-kyung, you should enter first.

85
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,510
-Starting with Sook?
-Jin-kyung first.

86
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,079
FORGET ALL THAT JUST HAPPENED

87
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,284
THE SENSATIONAL HUMAN YUT APPEARS FIRST

88
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,252
Since it's the New Year…

89
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,356
It's the New Year,
so I dressed up like this.

90
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,059
If you had to decide, which one are you?
Do, gae, geol, yut or mo?

91
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:13,993
Geol.

92
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,762
A life with nothing higher than yut.

93
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,765
You'll continuously get geol in your life.

94
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,333
What's the concept for your outfit?

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,068
I'll explain it to you in time.

96
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,469
You should go in now.

97
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,504
-Should I?
-Yes.

98
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,672
-Go.
-What are you?

99
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,641
You're dressed so nicely but…

100
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,642
WIPING NOSE

101
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,877
Here he goes.

102
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,111
WIPING IT OFF

103
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,379
Hello.

104
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,480
Here he goes.

105
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,450
-May I sit next to you?
-I'm embarrassed.

106
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,585
I'm so embarrassed.

107
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,486
I'm so embarrassed.

108
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,722
-I'm so embarrassed for him.
-He's good.

109
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,427
Look at him.

110
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,328
He's good.

111
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,630
HE'S ABSOLUTELY IMMERSED
INTO YANG SE-CHAN'S CHARACTER

112
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,831
I'm so embarrassed for him.

113
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,866
His acting got better.

114
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,603
-His acting got really good.
-His face turned red.

115
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,438
His face turned totally red.

116
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,006
-Why is he trying so hard?
-Oh, no.

117
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,507
-Sorry, Se-chan.
-He's working hard.

118
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,475
His face is red.

119
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,843
Since it's New Year,

120
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,412
I dressed like "Say Hey."

121
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,415
EVEN THE FORMER JJUGGUMI IS
AMAZED AT THIS VARIATION

122
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,350
So, hey!

123
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,653
HE PUT AN EFFORT INTO HIS ATTIRE TODAY

124
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,955
You must not have had any good ideas.

125
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,824
Due to copyright issues,
I'll sing a little.

126
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,559
EVEN IF I CHEATED ON YOU…

127
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,729
YOUR EYES, NOSE…

128
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,097
NO WAY…

129
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,298
Oh, no.

130
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,733
Your skin is cracked even more.

131
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,101
EMBARRASSED

132
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,068
Since it's winter.

133
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,404
Please note it's like this
as it is dry in the winter.

134
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,473
What comes to your mind in the new year?

135
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,509
A new sun is rising!

136
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,011
Darling, my heart…

137
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,379
I can only sing this much
due to copyright.

138
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,947
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

139
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,816
That's all I can sing.

140
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,552
SHOWING OFF HIS TALENT

141
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,620
Come over here.

142
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,521
I love you…

143
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,656
I'll stop right there.

144
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,024
Darling, you're…

145
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,924
What the heck?

146
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,793
-Hey! Hey!
-Is she from that restaurant?

147
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,894
A SHAMAN APPEARS AT THAT MOMENT

148
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,329
Hello.

149
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,465
Listen, I am from up there.

150
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,101
I see the future.

151
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,069
Oh?

152
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,771
I don't think he can return!

153
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,673
SHE'S GOOD

154
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,209
I don't think Woo-young can return.

155
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,313
LAUGHING

156
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,616
-You went too far.
-Nice to meet you.

157
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,352
If you're curious about anything,
just ask me.

158
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,489
THESE WORDS WILL SOON BECOME LEGENDARY

159
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,859
Okay. Today's dress code is New Year.

160
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,262
The year 2026 is finally upon us.

161
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,031
Would you like to give
a New Year's greeting to the viewers?

162
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,266
Go ahead, Sook.

163
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:40,807
I am truly thankful to be able to give you
a New Year's greeting in 2026.

164
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,377
I'm also thankful
that our members can be with you

165
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,546
without any changes.

166
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,350
And thank you
for your continuous love and support.

167
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,519
We hope that you have nothing
but good health and good things

168
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,254
coming your way this year.

169
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,255
Our Beat--

170
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,828
With our beautiful Hong Jin-kyung…

171
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,530
-With all of us.
-Yes, with all of us.

172
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,435
We hope that Screwballs
can be with you for a very long time.

173
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,337
Happy…

174
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,574
New Year.

175
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,409
Happy New Year.

176
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,811
TO OUR VIEWERS, HAPPY NEW YEAR

177
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,581
-Happy New Year.
-This is perfect for bowing.

178
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,915
That must be comfortable.

179
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,251
That must be so comfortable.

180
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,320
These were made for kneeling.

181
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,222
It feels comfortable.

182
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,557
These would be perfect
for visiting the elderly.

183
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,394
Please take turns telling us
your New Year's resolution.

184
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,462
-Would you like to go first, Sae-ho?
-Okay.

185
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,998
I don't have anything special
for my New Year's resolution.

186
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,167
I'd like to be
a bit funnier than last year.

187
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,770
-Funnier?
-Yes, I'd like to be funnier.

188
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,605
This may seem long-winded,

189
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,607
but I'd like people to know
that I am funny--

190
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,075
You're talking too long.

191
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,810
-I want to do that.
-Already too long.

192
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,211
That's all.

193
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,980
-All right.
-And you, Woo-jae?

194
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,016
The name of the three members of VIVIZ?

195
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,419
What's a VIVIZ?

196
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,620
What's a VIVIZ?

197
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,021
WHAT IS VIVIZ?

198
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,957
IS SHE FOR REAL?

199
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,492
What's a VIVIZ?

200
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,493
Remember the quiz show?

201
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,231
May I ask you for the names
of the three members of VIVIZ?

202
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,735
Jin-kyung, can you name
the three members of VIVIZ?

203
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,037
CONFUSED

204
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,239
-She didn't expect this.
-This is hilarious.

205
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,140
-This is unexpected.
-So funny.

206
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,942
-Wait.
-Are you trying to be funny?

207
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,011
-What's VIVIZ?
-Are you being funny?

208
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,413
There is a range of what we expect, right?

209
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,948
Am I right?

210
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,950
It's the girl group.

211
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,420
-Isn't there a range of what we expect?
-What is VIVIZ?

212
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,055
What do I do when she goes beyond that?

213
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,457
You had to remember three names.

214
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,058
GET TO WORK HIPPOCAMPUS

215
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,193
Eunha something?

216
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,994
-Wow!
-Yeah, Eunha.

217
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,563
OH?

218
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,431
-Eunha and?
-Eunha.

219
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:46,999
And let's see…

220
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,969
What happens
when you see the beautiful sky?

221
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,971
The Korean word for majestic? "Sinbee?"

222
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,773
-Yes, SinB.
-SinB!

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,974
Wow!

224
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:55,942
And last one?

225
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,276
-This?
-Thumb. "Umji" in Korean.

226
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,479
-Yes, Umji!
-Umji!

227
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,581
SIGH

228
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,050
THEY EXHAUSTED THEMSELVES EXPLAINING IT

229
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,586
I got shocked by
something totally unexpected.

230
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,389
PLEASE BE UNDERSTANDING, FANS OF VIVIZ

231
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,458
I don't make resolutions.

232
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,360
Because I don't make any…

233
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,661
I just hope that

234
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,897
tomorrow will be as good as today,

235
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,266
-and the same for the next day.
-What do you want to do?

236
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,301
Is there something
you want to do this year?

237
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,171
-No plans?
-I would love it if things flow as it is.

238
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,639
What about you, Jin-kyung?

239
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,242
May I share a personal story of mine?

240
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,943
I recently met Young K.

241
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,278
Did he see our show?

242
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,313
I saw him a few days ago and yesterday.

243
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,415
He saw everything from the opening

244
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,151
when we talked about him
on the day care center special.

245
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,487
Also, you know,

246
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,656
this is what we talked about yesterday.

247
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,992
Our show aired yesterday, right?

248
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,794
We talked about how
he was brought up on that too.

249
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,631
Dear Young K's parents,

250
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,832
are you doing well?

251
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,502
-You dressed well today.
-Please accept my deep bow.

252
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,871
You dressed well today.

253
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,607
Thank you for giving birth to Young K.

254
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,310
I hope our viewers
would be understanding of her.

255
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,512
She really is a nice person.

256
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,814
I've known her for a long time.

257
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,116
She can't help it.

258
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,552
-She forgets things easily.
-Yes.

259
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,986
-She can't help it.
-Forgive her.

260
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,989
I would like to say this today.

261
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,059
Until the day I lie in a coffin,

262
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,195
I will keep the name Young K
engraved in my heart.

263
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,430
-That's your resolution?
-Yes.

264
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,033
-What about you, Sook?
-As for me,

265
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,367
it is the same.

266
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,769
Staying healthy.

267
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,138
-Staying healthy.
-My resolutions

268
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,807
have become simpler as I got older.

269
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,412
I'd like to be healthier
and travel with my friends.

270
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,715
Your resolution is very simple, Sook.

271
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,483
You're the healthiest among us.

272
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,354
-No, I'm not.
-You are already stronger than all of us.

273
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,257
-Come on.
-You already travel the most out of us.

274
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,125
I want to travel even more though.

275
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,329
Okay. Even though Woo-young isn't here,

276
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,597
let's try to guess

277
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,434
who among the members
will be the most successful this year.

278
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,368
-This year?
-This year?

279
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,669
Point to that person.

280
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,305
If you want to choose Woo-young…

281
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,274
You don't have to tell us that.

282
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,809
Oh. Okay.

283
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,345
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

284
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,815
Would anyone like to know what to do?

285
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,085
I think a person should move up gradually.

286
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,021
-Yes.
-He just got this show

287
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,157
after being a guest on a radio show.

288
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,227
-Exactly.
-If he moves up too much in 2026,

289
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
it isn't good.

290
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,863
-Yes.
-He should have two next year.

291
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,398
That's about it.

292
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
All right.

293
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,301
Please point to someone.

294
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,869
Who will be most successful this year?

295
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,437
One, two, three.

296
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,807
POINTS TO WOO-JAE,
POINTS TO SOOK, POINTS TO JIN-KYUNG

297
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,442
Who did you choose, Jin-kyung?

298
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,343
I chose Sae-ho.

299
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,978
We all got one vote.

300
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,380
-Wow!
-Everyone got a vote.

301
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,081
-This is insane.
-How did this happen?

302
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,516
-Was this planned?
-In this case,

303
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,351
only Woo-young didn't get a vote.

304
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,487
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

305
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,554
That's how it ended up.

306
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,690
-He's the only one.
-Moving on.

307
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,591
Okay.

308
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
You should never be absent.

309
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,161
This is so amazing though.

310
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,396
How did we all get one vote?

311
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,097
I know. Who did you vote for, Sae-ho?

312
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,465
I chose Woo-jae.

313
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,534
When I look at
how Woo-jae is doing these days,

314
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,603
he seems to be getting sturdier.

315
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,305
He's getting sturdier.

316
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:17,243
-In a good way?
-Something scares me about Woo-jae though.

317
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,244
His momentum.

318
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,714
You see, he often meets up
with production crews.

319
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,484
Then, he always ends up on the cast list.

320
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,522
He's the top pick
on almost all the variety shows.

321
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,590
No, that's not why. I'm just someone

322
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,159
who is an easy cast.

323
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,326
My role is easy.

324
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,928
What's up with her all of a sudden?

325
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,163
Because…

326
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,533
Because she is coming at me like this,
I can't keep up with her.

327
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,370
This is a different kind of attack.

328
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,639
What am I supposed to do
when she comes at me like this?

329
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,374
I can't seem to fight back.

330
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,176
GIGGLING

331
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,877
I pick Jin-kyung.

332
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,847
She isn't more popular
because she doesn't want to be.

333
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,551
I felt that as I observed her
for the past 10 years.

334
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,019
I really want to be popular.

335
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,589
No.

336
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,224
This is an act too.

337
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,193
She doesn't know anything about me.

338
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,995
-Jin-kyung is good at acting too.
-She is.

339
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,631
-That's right.
-But because of her schedule abroad,

340
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,101
she can't do any more
even if they wanted to cast her.

341
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,569
She has no availability.

342
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,437
If they ask me, I do it all.

343
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,473
OH REALLY?

344
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,242
YOU'RE WELCOME TO CALL ME ANYTIME

345
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,044
In 2026,

346
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,479
I think she will soar.

347
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,248
She seems very trustworthy
because of her outfit.

348
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,283
LOOKING TRUSTWORTHY

349
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,552
You're going to have a great year.

350
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,188
Sook.

351
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,656
-Do you not want it again?
-No.

352
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,991
I really want to turn out well.

353
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,926
SHE BASHFULLY CONFESSES

354
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,696
CONTACT ME ANYTIME

355
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,998
Okay. I hope all of you
will be successful.

356
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,001
Then, let me announce today's star.

357
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,103
We've been doing
Screwballs' Deconstruction Show.

358
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,473
We have prepared
a group Deconstruction Show today.

359
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,878
We would like to film
a Deconstruction Show of all five of you.

360
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,779
While we were thinking about

361
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,783
how we could shoot an even in-depth
Deconstruction Show for the viewers,

362
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,850
we chose the bathhouse.

363
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,652
-Oh?
-So…

364
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,287
Are we all going to be naked?

365
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,656
IS THAT RIGHT?

366
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,324
-It's a physical deconstruction.
-Yes.

367
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,294
I know we call our show
an asexual variety show,

368
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,962
but Sook and Jin-kyung,

369
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,299
how do you feel about
going to the bathhouse with these guys?

370
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,202
We're okay, but I don't
want them to get the wrong idea.

371
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,605
DON'T DO THAT, GUYS

372
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,740
Us?

373
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,875
-Us?
-I'm worried about that.

374
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,510
It's possible.

375
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,447
Can you guys promise them?

376
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,949
Get your minds out of the gutter.

377
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,385
Listen, there's nothing to promise.

378
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,286
Look,

379
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,454
I don't know how much
I'll make in the future,

380
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,790
but I'll bet all the money
I'll ever make in my life.

381
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,194
Hey, don't be so sure of yourself.

382
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,762
A promise is…

383
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,697
-A promise is too weak.
-Don't be so sure.

384
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,599
I'll bet all the money I'll make from now.

385
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,534
-Woo-jae.
-This includes real estate…

386
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,503
-You never know.
-No.

387
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,704
I'll bet everything I have.

388
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,339
"What am I feeling?"

389
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,074
You may think that and weep.

390
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,442
You too, Sae-ho.

391
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,810
Is there anything to say?

392
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,811
NOT EVEN WORTH A RESPONSE

393
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,379
What in the world?

394
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,115
Okay. Well, please be careful.

395
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,318
From now, you'll go into the bath

396
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,320
and reveal your true selves thoroughly.

397
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,387
For real?

398
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,422
Then, did we

399
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,724
dress up just for this?

400
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,926
-Yes.
-Geez.

401
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,728
I SEE

402
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,697
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

403
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,432
We went too far.

404
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,399
LOOK AT HER

405
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,402
We dressed up like this
to portray the New Year, right?

406
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,604
That's right.

407
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,472
THEY DEFINITELY PORTRAYED IT

408
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,642
Though it's called
Group Deconstruction Show,

409
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,444
you'll be competing individually.

410
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,714
The person who comes in first
by getting the most accumulated points

411
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,415
will be given an amazing prize.

412
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,618
-Geez.
-You call it an amazing prize,

413
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,153
but sometimes it turns out to be
more of an ironic prize.

414
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,289
No, it isn't sometimes.

415
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,657
It has always been like that.

416
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,158
They were ironic prizes.

417
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,728
Okay, let me explain
today's prize just a little bit.

418
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,665
It is a unique prize that
you have never gotten before.

419
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,900
OH?

420
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,503
-Is it valuable?
-If you convert it into money,

421
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,705
-it would be quite pricey.
-You can convert it?

422
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,340
-Really? Okay. Let's do this.
-Yes.

423
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,742
-That's what we prepared.
-Okay.

424
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,845
Firstly, since we can't be
completely naked in there,

425
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,513
we prepared outfits for you.

426
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,116
Why don't you just enjoy
the bathhouse for about 10 minutes?

427
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,318
-May I wash my hair too? Really?
-Of course.

428
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,719
Of course.

429
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,187
Can I remove my makeup too?

430
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,423
Viewers may not want to see
my real self though.

431
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,658
You're wearing makeup?

432
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,558
What?

433
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,930
-What, Sook? What do you mean?
-Are you or not?

434
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,065
-What did you do?
-What?

435
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,400
WHAT WAS APPLIED?

436
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,301
You look the same.

437
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,802
I'm wearing makeup.

438
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,337
Did you wash your hair too?

439
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,505
No, I had this styled.

440
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,773
-What the heck?
-Indeed.

441
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,874
SURPRISINGLY, HE'S FULLY GLAMMED UP

442
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,075
It's Deconstruction Show,

443
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,477
-so show us your bare face.
-Yes. Sounds good.

444
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,879
Let me give you your outfits.

445
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,846
-Okay.
-Let's cut here.

446
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,015
-Can you clap, Sae-ho?
-One, two, three.

447
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,319
BRIEFLY TAKING THE TIME TO CHANGE OUTFITS

448
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,587
I've never been to the men's bath.

449
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,256
I've never been to the men's bath.

450
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,592
FROM THE HOT TUB THAT WILL
WARM YOU UP FROM THIS COLD WINTER

451
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,262
TO A COLD POOL THAT WILL
HELP YOU FIGHT COLD WITH COLD!

452
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,098
THERE ARE EVEN SAUNAS
THAT WILL MELT AWAY ALL THE FATIGUE

453
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,468
THE MEMBERS WASH UP
BEFORE THEY ENTER THE BATH

454
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,771
SHOWING CELEBRITIES WASH UP
FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON

455
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,939
It's warm.

456
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,543
I should have taken off my underwear.

457
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,311
You never know.

458
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,612
-Really?
-You never know.

459
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,847
That would be good for me.

460
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,282
I want it to be revealed.

461
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,783
FINE THEN

462
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,985
What a shame.

463
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,887
AFTER SAYING SOMETHING CRAZY,
HE ENTERS THE TUB

464
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:30,889
THIS IS THE BEST

465
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,358
It's nice and warm.

466
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,659
Wow.

467
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,228
It's nice and warm.

468
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:37,930
It's so nice.

469
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,897
WE ARE IN PARADISE

470
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,567
SAE-HO FINISHES WASHING UP
AND ENTERS THE TUB

471
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,935
Remove your makeup, Sae-ho.

472
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,737
What? I just removed all of it.

473
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,538
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

474
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,875
You can tell that he removed his makeup.

475
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,111
I couldn't tell when he had makeup on,

476
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,380
-but I can tell when it's removed.
-That's the worst.

477
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,148
You can only tell when it's removed?

478
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,049
HAPPY

479
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:57,950
I'm serious.

480
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,885
You're going in the cold pool?

481
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,920
The cold pool is nice.

482
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,222
HE IS READY TO ENJOY THE COLD POOL NOW

483
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,957
Hey, it's pretty deep.

484
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,992
I couldn't touch the ground.

485
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,361
I think it'll only reach my shin.

486
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,996
-Come over here.
-To the cold pool?

487
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,100
The depth is totally different for Sae-ho.

488
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,136
Didn't it go up to Sae-ho's chest?

489
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,404
LAUGHING

490
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,671
It's so nice and cool.

491
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,340
DEFINITELY SEEING
THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE WITH SAE-HO

492
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,275
You're the real deal only if you sit.

493
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,276
I can't.

494
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:25,778
It's too cold.

495
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,248
I can catch a cold
from staying there for just 30 seconds.

496
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,582
GIGGLING

497
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,683
It's so hot!

498
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,985
What is wrong with him?

499
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,019
He is so weak.

500
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,388
THE BATHHOUSE IS DEFINITELY THE PLACE
FOR CLOSE FRIENDS TO COME

501
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,123
What is wrong with him?

502
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,260
You know,
I suffer from cold hands and feet.

503
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,962
I'm fully enjoying this heat.

504
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:44,997
AND THE SAUNA

505
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,032
I'm sweating beads.

506
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,234
I'm kind of getting drowsy.

507
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,639
We prepared things
that you can only do in this place.

508
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,607
I'm sure you played this game before.

509
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,109
Have you heard of the Bunny Bunny game?

510
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,545
-Yeah, of course.
-Bunny, bunny.

511
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,446
What is that?

512
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,747
Carrot, carrot.

513
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,049
Let's say you're all standing in a circle.

514
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,252
One person says "Bunny, bunny"

515
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,922
and sends the "Bunny, bunny"
to someone else.

516
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:15,094
Then, the recipient would send
the "Bunny, bunny" to someone else.

517
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,329
While they send it,
the people on either side of me

518
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,864
must say "Carrot, carrot."

519
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,065
I get it.

520
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,267
But what made you think
they could do this game?

521
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,837
It's not easy with four people.

522
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,439
HER FACE ISN'T CLEAR AS TO
WHETHER SHE UNDERSTOOD THE RULES OR NOT

523
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,907
To help you understand,

524
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,109
we'll demonstrate it.

525
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,643
-No, we understood.
-We understood.

526
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,445
-Don't underestimate us.
-Come on.

527
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,613
We aren't like that.

528
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,081
-Let's give it a try.
-Let's stand.

529
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,950
How dare you underestimate us.

530
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,885
-We understood everything.
-Okay.

531
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,487
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

532
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,055
-Carrot, carrot.
-Bunny, bunny.

533
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,790
-Carrot, carrot.
-Bunny, bunny.

534
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,158
-Carrot, carrot.
-Carrot, carrot.

535
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,694
I TOLD YOU SHE CAN'T DO IT

536
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,596
-Didn't she say she understood?
-This won't work.

537
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,197
Why are we doing this?

538
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,266
During this precious time…

539
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,167
Listen.

540
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,536
Understanding up here
and understanding down here

541
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,271
are different.

542
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,405
She can't do it.

543
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,774
Why are we doing this
during this precious time

544
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,143
at the start of the New Year?

545
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,079
Actually, we weren't going to play
just the regular Bunny Game.

546
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
We were going to do
an upgraded Dancing Bunny Game.

547
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,449
What is that?

548
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,550
You dance to the beat.

549
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,784
Like this?

550
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,987
Bunny, bunny.

551
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,021
I get it.

552
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:16,922
Bunny, bunny…

553
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,491
IT'S REMARKABLE HOW THEY GET IT SO FAST

554
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,393
-Like this? I see.
-Carrot, carrot. Like this?

555
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,295
Shall we give it a try?

556
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,196
So it's like that.

557
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,266
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

558
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,800
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

559
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,637
FOUR PEOPLE HAVE ENTERED THE BUNNY CLUB

560
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,910
ONLY TRUE PARTY ANIMALS CAN ENTER
THE NEWLY OPENED BUNNY CLUB

561
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,513
IN A TRANCE

562
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,982
SHE DOESN'T GET THE REGULAR BUNNY
BUT SHE GETS THE DANCING BUNNY

563
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,817
-Is this how you do it?
-That's right.

564
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,553
Let's go like this then.

565
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,354
-We can do this.
-Let's give it a try.

566
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,125
A NEW GAME IS ABOUT TO HIT 2026
LIKE A STORM

567
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,763
YOU NEED EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME
RHYTHM, BEAT, GROOVE, SWAG

568
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,732
You start, Sook.

569
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,702
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

570
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,270
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot. Carrot.

571
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,738
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

572
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,240
-Carrot, carrot.
-Carrot, carrot.

573
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,808
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

574
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,276
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

575
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,145
-Carrot, carrot.
-You're out.

576
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,780
I'M SO SORRY, MY MAN!

577
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,381
Carrot, carrot.

578
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,084
THIS IS FUN
JUST ENJOY IT!

579
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,254
JUST COVER UP YOUR MISTAKE WITH FUN!

580
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,455
Is this how you do it?

581
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,557
Is this how it's done?

582
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,792
Basically,

583
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,093
I like that it's exciting.

584
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,629
When I say "Bunny, bunny,"
you have to accept it.

585
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,197
Don't turn your back.

586
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,733
I'm sorry. I got too excited. I got it.

587
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,168
-Let's go.
-I'll start.

588
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,636
Ready, go.

589
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,539
FOUR PEOPLE HAVE ENTERED THE BUNNY CLUB

590
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,374
SOOK BUNNY

591
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,675
WOO-JAE BUNNY

592
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,079
JIN-KYUNG BUNNY

593
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,614
You can't do it to yourself.

594
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,115
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

595
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,550
You can't do it to yourself.

596
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,118
You're not supposed to do it to yourself.

597
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,419
Carrot, carrot.

598
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,522
HE DOESN'T CARE IF SHE GOT IT WRONG
HE CAN'T GET OUT OF THE BUNNY CLUB

599
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,590
It would be more fun

600
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,726
-if I explained the rules one more time.
-No!

601
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,627
It's okay.

602
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,728
-We know it.
-We know.

603
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,730
Whoever gets it wrong
has to leave the tub?

604
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,164
No, you lose a point.

605
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,967
-We lose a point?
-Whoever loses the least points wins.

606
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,002
-Got it.
-Okay.

607
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,038
The rabbit that descended
from the sky said…

608
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,242
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

609
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,543
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

610
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,945
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

611
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,346
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

612
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,714
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

613
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,116
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

614
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,519
CAUTION: TOO MUCH FUN
CAN CAUSE ONE TO GO OFF BEAT

615
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:34,192
BUT MINOR MISTAKES
CAN'T STOP THE BUNNY CLUB

616
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,161
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

617
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,829
HE'S BUSY PLAYING THE GAME AND DANCING

618
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,531
Carrot, carrot.

619
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:40,932
This won't work.

620
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,167
I DON'T THINK THIS GAME WILL WORK

621
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,769
USING HIS HEAD AND BODY IS KILLING HIM

622
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,237
-What is all this?
-We already got it wrong.

623
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,673
Let's not go fast this time.
Let's do a slow dance.

624
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,275
-Let's go like this. Bunny, bunny.
-Yeah.

625
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,743
Let's go slow.

626
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
Here we go.

627
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,812
The rabbit that

628
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,448
-descended from the sky said…
-From the sky said…

629
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,118
MAKING BEATBOX SOUNDS

630
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,887
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

631
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,588
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

632
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,324
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

633
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,059
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

634
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,727
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

635
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,295
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

636
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,997
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

637
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,632
-Carrot, carrot.
-Carrot, carrot.

638
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,533
Carrot.

639
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,803
HER BRAIN AND ENERGY
ARE REACHING THEIR LIMIT

640
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,137
SHE ENDS UP DOING THE CARROT DANCE

641
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,972
-Bunny, bunny.
-She got it wrong.

642
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,042
Only the people on either side
say "Carrot, carrot."

643
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,811
Let's go to the cold plunge pool.

644
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,412
-Let's go.
-Let's do it in cold water.

645
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,647
OPENING THE BUNNY CLUB
AT A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE

646
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,548
It's too hot.

647
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,051
OPENING THE BUNNY CLUB ONE LAST TIME

648
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,254
MAKING BEATBOX SOUNDS

649
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,756
Bunny, bunny.

650
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,926
THE MISTAKES ARE BEING COUNTED
REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF FUN

651
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,461
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

652
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,029
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

653
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,630
-Bunny, bunny.
-Carrot, carrot.

654
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,531
Bunny, bunny.

655
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,734
BOOP BOOP

656
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,603
THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN
DO THEIR BEST TO ENJOY THE CLUB

657
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,239
SINCE THEY DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE BUNNY CLUB WILL OPEN AGAIN

658
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,043
MAXIMIZING THEIR QUICK THINKING AND FUN

659
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,611
Carrot. Bunny, bunny.

660
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,912
-Carrot, carrot.
-Wait.

661
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,147
EVEN THE ACE GETS CONFUSED

662
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,548
You said, "Carrot."

663
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,517
Man, that was so hectic.

664
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,152
-Come over here.
-Okay.

665
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,254
Let me explain the game you'll play now.

666
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,324
This game is called Sense the Bucket.

667
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:13,925
Sense the Bucket?

668
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,827
Let me explain how to play
Sense the Bucket.

669
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,597
Three of you will sit in the front
and one will stand behind you.

670
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:23,034
They will swing the bucket over the heads
of the three people sitting in the front.

671
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,971
The person sitting in the middle
will call out when to stop

672
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,306
and say how many buckets.

673
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:32,377
Then, the water will get poured
on the person that the bucket landed on.

674
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,914
The more buckets you get poured on you,
the more points you will lose.

675
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,449
-I see.
-Okay.

676
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,984
No limit to how many buckets we can say?

677
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,819
What if I said, "200 buckets"?

678
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:44,022
We only rented this place for today
so that may be difficult.

679
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,425
-How about five?
-Let's set the limit to five.

680
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,260
Okay, we'll start with Sook.

681
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,163
-After he stops when you say so…
-Okay.

682
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,131
-…you can tell him how many buckets.
-Okay.

683
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,199
You say start.

684
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,734
Ready.

685
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:57,903
Go.

686
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,271
START

687
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,207
CHO BUCKET MOVES QUIETLY

688
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,876
AND THE CONTROLLER
WAITS FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT

689
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,018
Three buckets.

690
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,052
THREE BUCKETS FOR JIN-KYUNG

691
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,288
WHO COULD IT BE?

692
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:24,162
IT WAS ME

693
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,666
Here we go again.

694
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,969
SOAKING WET

695
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,004
How many times do I go?

696
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,340
-Three rounds?
-Three rounds. Okay.

697
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,274
-Let's go.
-Ready…

698
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,276
Then, I keep calling out when to stop.

699
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,211
-Go.
-Ready, go.

700
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,113
START
CHO BUCKET'S ROUND 2

701
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,652
STOP

702
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,387
Four buckets.

703
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:53,091
FOUR BUCKETS FOR SOOK

704
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,563
OH, NO

705
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:00,866
SOOK ACQUIRES 3 BUCKETS

706
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:02,801
SOOK ACQUIRES 4 BUCKETS

707
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,505
You look like a Reggae artist.

708
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:08,807
HEH

709
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,208
Okay. Here I go.

710
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,043
Ready, go.

711
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,280
START
CHO BUCKET'S ROUND 3

712
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,016
CAUTIOUS

713
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,286
Five buckets.

714
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,357
FIVE FULL BUCKETS FOR THE LAST ROUND

715
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,792
SOOK GETS CHOSEN TWICE IN A ROW

716
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,797
SHE CLUELESSLY ACCUMULATES 5 BUCKETS

717
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,067
Geez. How am I so lucky? I'm so lucky.

718
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,937
SHE BROUGHT
THE 9 BUCKET DISASTER UPON HERSELF

719
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,273
NEXT UP IS JOO WOO-JAE

720
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,240
Can I do this?

721
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,441
As I do this,

722
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,777
I'm definitely going to stop
when she calls it out…

723
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,547
UGH… HYAH!

724
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,683
That's allowed.

725
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,584
-It's okay?
-Yes.

726
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,952
Okay. Got it.

727
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,520
He's going to do something bad.

728
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,188
You have to tell him
when to stop, Jin-kyung.

729
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,356
80% CHANCE HE'S AIMING FOR JIN-KYUNG

730
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,025
JOO BUCKET'S ROUND 1

731
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,159
Ready, go.

732
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,463
Three buckets.

733
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,265
NARROWLY AVOIDED THE BUCKET

734
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,233
Three buckets.

735
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,136
I swear I'll be fair.

736
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,704
ALREADY CHOSEN FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW

737
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,605
SOOK ACQUIRES 1 BUCKET

738
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,474
IT'S ME AGAIN

739
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,178
Geez. I am so unlucky.

740
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,418
Come to think of it,
I didn't check my own fortune.

741
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,053
GURGLE

742
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,254
Here I go again.

743
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,222
JOO BUCKET'S ROUND 2

744
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,224
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS

745
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,659
I can't see anything anymore.

746
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:40,799
FLEXING HIS FOREARM MUSCLES
AFTER A LONG TIME

747
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,335
30 SECONDS HAVE PASSED SINCE HE STARTED

748
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,536
Why aren't you saying "Stop"?

749
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:46,938
Oh, is it me?

750
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:55,246
AN ANSWER THEY COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED

751
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:59,017
HER GAME COMPREHENSION
HASN'T CHANGED IN THE NEW YEAR

752
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,485
You don't disappoint.

753
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,220
I was just waiting.

754
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,222
-Sorry.
-You know what?

755
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,423
You're the best!

756
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,058
PETTY TRICKS CAN'T BEAT UNADULTERATED EVIL

757
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,461
I was wondering why she wasn't saying it,
but she said, "Is it me?"

758
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,663
You were just soaking your feet,
weren't you?

759
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,066
-I'll start.
-Okay. Ready, go.

760
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,268
SCHEMER MODE IS BACK ON

761
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,872
Four buckets.

762
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,107
SAE-HO GETS FOUR BUCKETS

763
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,476
Jin-kyung, do you have
eyes on the back of your head?

764
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,211
That was awesome.

765
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,545
SAE-HO ACQUIRES 1 BUCKET

766
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:30,749
SAE-HO ACQUIRES 2 BUCKETS

767
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,152
Oops.

768
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,388
WATER BOMBS ARE FUN TOO

769
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,722
SAE-HO ACQUIRES 4 BUCKETS

770
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,725
TRICKLING

771
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:45,697
OUTPUT - RELAY - INPUT

772
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,233
-Jin-kyung, call out the last stop.
-Okay.

773
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,834
You'll go one more time. Ready,

774
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,302
go.

775
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,540
CONFIDENTLY CALLS OUT "STOP"
AS SOON AS HE BEGINS

776
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,741
Five buckets.

777
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,711
CAN JIN-KYUNG STAY DRY
UNTIL THE END OF HIS TURN?

778
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,146
Didn't you say it too quickly?

779
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,049
JIN-KYUNG IS CHOSEN

780
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,119
SHE LOST HER SENSE TOWARDS THE END

781
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:12,424
I'LL POUR DOUBLE THE AMOUNT
SINCE YOU'RE SPECIAL

782
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,428
THE JIN-KYUNG HUNTER FINALLY
ACCOMPLISHED HIS GOAL

783
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,229
You're pouring it like that?

784
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,673
THE BUCKET IS A BIT BIG

785
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,408
That was five buckets.

786
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:31,843
Done.

787
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,745
Whose turn is it now?

788
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,113
Here I go.

789
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,382
Ready, set,

790
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,017
go.

791
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,425
-Three buckets.
-You should've gone for five.

792
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,627
WHO WON SOOK'S FIRST BUCKET?

793
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,932
SAE-HO WON

794
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,805
SMASHING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
WITH THE WATER BUCKET

795
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,042
FAILED TO CONTROL HER STRENGTH

796
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,144
WHY DO BAD THINGS
ALWAYS HAPPEN TO SAE-HO?

797
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,245
Did you get hit?

798
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,215
I just want to point out to the viewers
that this is rubber.

799
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,550
You can't tell from the screen,
but it's rubber.

800
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,919
Why is the water so blunt?

801
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,921
-It's rubber.
-Is it?

802
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,124
-Feel it. It's rubber.
-Yes, it's rubber.

803
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,692
-It's rubber.
-One more?

804
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,693
-One more bucket.
-No.

805
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,829
-I made a mistake so forget that one.
-Okay.

806
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,231
ONE LESS BUCKET
SINCE I HIT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD

807
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,465
-Let's go.
-Okay.

808
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,033
Ready, go.

809
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,804
Five buckets!

810
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,838
LANDED RIGHT ON WOO-JAE

811
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,240
IS IT ME?

812
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,975
HE SENSES HIS FATE

813
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:37,876
WOO-JAE ACQUIRES 1 BUCKET

814
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:39,878
WOO-JAE ACQUIRES 2 BUCKETS

815
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,547
You know what?
You can sense it when it lands on you.

816
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,448
Really?

817
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,383
WOO-JAE ACQUIRES 4 BUCKETS

818
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,027
That's so cold!

819
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,463
SOMEBODY HELP

820
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,735
HE DIDN'T SENSE THE COLD WATER THOUGH

821
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,769
That's so cold.

822
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,772
-That was so cold.
-Hurry. Go in the tub.

823
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,673
Go in the tub.

824
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,674
There's one round left.

825
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,242
-You looked too hot.
-She has one left.

826
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,178
When I say "Stop" this time,

827
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,346
it'll be three buckets of cold water.

828
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,115
-Okay?
-Three buckets of cold water.

829
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,983
-I'm scared.
-Three buckets of cold water.

830
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,752
-I'm scared about the cold water.
-Okay.

831
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,153
This is exciting.

832
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,289
ONE OF THESE WILL GET THREE COLD SPLASHES

833
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,660
SOOK'S BUCKET ROUND 3 BEGINS

834
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,297
TURNING FEAR INTO EXCITEMENT

835
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,233
Three buckets of cold water!

836
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,571
SHE FIRST GETS THE TWO BUCKETS,
ONE IN EACH HAND

837
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:45,577
WHO WON SOOK'S BUCKET OF COLD WATER?

838
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,478
It isn't me.

839
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:52,016
WOO-JAE IS CHOSEN TWICE IN A ROW

840
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,719
EYES GLEAMING WITH MISCHIEF

841
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,823
SHUDDERING

842
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,862
Act cool.

843
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,598
Look at his mouth.
He can't possibly look cool.

844
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,533
It's so cold.

845
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,501
-Last up is Jin-kyung. Go to the back.
-Okay.

846
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,836
I'll only use cold water.

847
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,271
What did you just say?

848
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,940
-No. No!
-That's not how you play the game.

849
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,742
-No, this is the upgraded version.
-No.

850
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,177
-You can't do that.
-What is she going to do?

851
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,979
-She'll use cold water.
-It's an upgrade.

852
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,214
Ready, set,

853
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,749
go.

854
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,319
START

855
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:33,858
THE CONTROLLER SEEKS THE RIGHT TIMING

856
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,631
SAE-HO IS CHOSEN

857
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,798
GROANING

858
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,268
Pour it all at once. Do it faster.

859
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,103
THE SLOW POUR MAKES IT TWICE AS COLD

860
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,371
Wait.

861
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,773
I didn't even tell you
how many buckets yet.

862
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,608
OH, RIGHT

863
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:54,679
I'm the one in the middle,
so I should tell you how many buckets.

864
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,747
YOU BROKE THE SPEED LIMIT, MA'AM

865
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,982
I couldn't wait to pour water on him.

866
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,450
-How many buckets?
-Five.

867
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,253
Stop lying. You said three buckets.

868
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,421
Pour it quickly.

869
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,455
SOBBING

870
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,857
Pour it faster!

871
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,393
Pour it faster!
Why are you pouring it so slowly?

872
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,530
HAVING A TOUGH TIME?

873
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,632
POURING WARM WATER ON SAE-HO
WHO GOT TORMENTED WITH COLD WATER?

874
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,001
Hey, man! That's cold water too.

875
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,070
I told you that this was cold water.

876
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,973
SHUDDERING

877
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,143
FACE WASH SERVICE

878
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,644
-How many buckets was that?
-Fifth bucket.

879
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,880
THE LAST BUCKET

880
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,481
SHIVERING

881
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,517
It's the second round now.

882
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,718
Ready,

883
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,553
-set…
-Get closer.

884
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,488
…go.

885
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:41,592
HONG'S BUCKET STARTS OPERATING

886
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,931
GRINNING

887
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,566
STICKING HIS NECK OUT

888
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,201
He's looking at the window.

889
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,504
What is he looking at?

890
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,008
HE LOOKS CAREFULLY AT SOMETHING

891
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,278
Did you look at the lens?

892
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,179
GOT IT!

893
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,481
-Five buckets?
-Yeah.

894
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,949
-How many buckets?
-No. Wait.

895
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,785
No. Wait.

896
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,655
SOOK IS CHOSEN

897
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,190
Five buckets.

898
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,157
ORDERING A TOTAL OF FIVE BUCKETS

899
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,026
SOOK ACQUIRES 2 BUCKETS

900
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,894
SOOK ACQUIRES 3 BUCKETS

901
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:18,997
SOOK ACQUIRES 4 BUCKETS

902
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,631
Last one.

903
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:23,935
It's so nice and cool.

904
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,603
The last round.

905
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,771
It's the last round.

906
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,806
Give me a moment.

907
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,508
-Come on out already.
-Wait.

908
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,409
Come out.

909
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,643
Give me a second.

910
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,113
Let's start. Come closer.

911
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,014
Ready,

912
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,482
set, go.

913
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,254
CAN THE QUICK-WITTED WOO-JAE
EVADE THE BUCKET AGAIN?

914
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,822
HIS EYES FOCUS SOMEWHERE AGAIN

915
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,595
SOOK GETS THE BUCKET AGAIN

916
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,729
How many buckets?

917
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,297
-How many buckets?
-Five.

918
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,168
Doggone it!

919
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,504
Hey, Woo-jae! Did you cheat or something?

920
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,007
Gosh, this game is too easy.

921
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,643
To win a game,
you have to figure out how it works.

922
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,280
HOW DOES IT WORK?

923
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,049
This is how it feels.

924
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,784
When I look at where their eyes are going,

925
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,519
it's like watching a table tennis match.

926
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,953
DARTING BACK AND FORTH

927
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,054
You can see it.

928
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:22,226
ALL THE STAFF'S EYES
FOLLOW THE BUCKET AS IT MOVES

929
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,694
BACK AND FORTH

930
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,397
GOT YOU

931
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,733
HE DOES HAVE THE BEST SENSE
FOR THIS KIND OF GAME

932
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,867
It's very subtle though.

933
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:33,004
It was subtle, but it was
like watching a badminton match.

934
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,139
I could see it.

935
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,408
That's all for Sense the Bucket.

936
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,310
AFTER THE NEW YEAR'S BATHHOUSE GAMES

937
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,211
Nice.

938
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,547
Sook didn't get the Dancing Bunny Game
wrong at all?

939
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,448
No.

940
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:45,783
That's amazing.

941
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,019
QUEEN SOOK WALKS AWAY WITH
ENJOYING THE GAME AND HAVING FUN

942
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,421
You know, it was kind of confusing

943
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,391
because someone kept getting it wrong.

944
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,092
You have to ride the beat
and play to the end.

945
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,294
That person came in last.

946
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,361
-Really?
-Yes.

947
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,699
Here are the accumulated points from
Dancing Bunny and Sense the Bucket.

948
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,301
-I'll announce them all at once.
-Yes.

949
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,769
Let's start from the bottom.

950
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,405
Since it's a game
where the first place takes the prize,

951
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,307
-there's no punishment for last place.
-Okay.

952
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,708
The bathhouse games.

953
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,844
It was our first game for the New Year.

954
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,746
Last place had negative 22 points.
It's Sook.

955
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,648
MINUS 22 POINTS KIM SOOK

956
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,884
-I did bad in this.
-You got a lot of buckets.

957
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,586
Because she got lots of buckets?

958
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,354
You came in first in Bunny Bunny,

959
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,723
but you got negative 22 points in this.

960
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,493
-Okay.
-Since two people came in second

961
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,727
and there's first place,

962
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,529
I'll directly announce the first place.

963
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:36,200
The two that are not announced
are automatically tied for second place.

964
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:40,338
The first place with the combined points
from Dancing Bunny and Sense the Bucket…

965
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,640
It seems there is no exception
when it comes to games in the new year.

966
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,741
It's Woo-jae.

967
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,911
Why? Why is he…

968
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,446
He got a lot of buckets though.

969
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,983
Woo-jae had negative 13 points.

970
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,118
BOOM BOOM

971
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,487
He's so annoying, isn't he?

972
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,388
WATCHING, WOO-YOUNG?

973
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,056
Where's the cold water?

974
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,658
We should dunk him in cold water.

975
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,692
ANNOYING DANCE MOVES
HE LEARNED AT JYP

976
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,629
Woo-jae won in the New Year too.
Congratulations.

977
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,097
-Job well done.
-Okay.

978
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,632
And so,

979
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:11,002
a jaw-dropping, high-end prize
is prepared for Woo-jae.

980
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,837
He always wins the prizes.

981
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:13,804
Never on a variety show?

982
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,239
Never seen on a variety show.

983
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,141
You won the top-of-the-line

984
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,476
treatment for VIPs.

985
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,811
A body scrub voucher.

986
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,914
-Wow!
-Awesome.

987
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,814
HMM…

988
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,550
You said you wanted a body scrub.

989
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,984
I'll just scrub my own body.

990
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:31,055
From now, the other three members

991
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,624
will become body scrubbers

992
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,459
and lay the winner Woo-jae

993
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,794
on the body scrubbing bed

994
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,463
to provide the high-end body scrubbing

995
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,266
from the top of the head
all the way down to the toes.

996
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,467
Congrats.

997
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,702
Congrats, Woo-jae.

998
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,103
CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU MUST BE SO HAPPY!

999
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,339
Typically, you only get one body scrubber.

1000
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,640
-Every nook and cranny.
-That's not it.

1001
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,242
I'll even give you a foot massage.

1002
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,277
I don't need any of that.

1003
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,380
Welcome.

1004
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,684
JUST GIVE IT A TRY

1005
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,854
THE SLAPPING THERAPY TO RELEASE TENSION
BEFORE THE BODY SCRUBBING

1006
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,189
Geez.

1007
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,358
You don't know the basics, do you?

1008
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,259
THE SECOND BODY SCRUBBER APPEARS

1009
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,560
FOOT MASSAGE
HOT COMPRESS

1010
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,395
Let's warm this area up.

1011
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:12,797
Isn't this nice?

1012
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,198
SCREWBALLS BATHHOUSE VIP SCRUBBING SERVICE

1013
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,099
That's nice.

1014
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,734
1 YEAR'S WORTH OF FATIGUE
IS TOTALLY VAPORIZED

1015
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,837
MASSAGING

1016
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,239
You're right.

1017
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,441
This is VIP treatment.

1018
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,044
SO FAR, HE'S VERY SATISFIED
WITH THE BODY SCRUBBING TREATMENT

1019
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:28,713
NOW THE REAL SCRUB STARTS

1020
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,648
By the way,

1021
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:34,852
is it really okay for a celebrity's
dead skin cells to air on TV?

1022
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,654
You know, I also…

1023
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,389
have a you know…

1024
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,626
This is kind of fun.

1025
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,660
My dead skin cells…

1026
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,961
STAY STILL SINCE THIS IS FUN

1027
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:44,929
Look.

1028
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,731
This is really a deconstruction show.

1029
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,834
WOO-JAE'S IN-DEPTH DECONSTRUCTION SHOW

1030
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,435
I see dead skin cells.

1031
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,104
Dead skin cells are forming.

1032
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,172
Keep your head off the bed, sir.

1033
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,975
-I already told you that it would.
-I see that.

1034
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,910
-Oh, no.
-This is humiliating!

1035
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:00,978
Sir.

1036
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,381
-I already told you that you'd see them.
-Lie down.

1037
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,283
It is time for you to feel humiliated.

1038
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,752
TIME FOR HIM TO ENDURE
BECAUSE HE IS IN 1ST PLACE

1039
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,388
THE VIP GUEST REGAINS HIS COMPOSURE

1040
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,690
Sir, do you want a threading session?

1041
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,427
-Your legs are too hairy.
-One more time.

1042
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:21,632
THE 3 BODY SCRUBBERS PROVIDE
FULL-BODY CARE FOR JUST ONE PERSON

1043
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,935
-Let me work on your thighs.
-Oh, no.

1044
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,671
He has a lot of dead skin cells.

1045
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,408
FROM DEEP-CLEANING TO A REFRESHING MASSAGE
THE EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE FOR THE 1ST PLACE

1046
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,276
-Doesn't it feel good?
-It does.

1047
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,345
I do feel like I'm being pampered.

1048
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,414
All right. Another bucket of water.

1049
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,115
-Gosh, this is nice.
-Yes.

1050
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,051
Finally, I can

1051
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,353
fully enjoy it.

1052
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,421
We're almost done now.

1053
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,356
Let me begin.

1054
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:49,260
THE FINAL VIP TREATMENT
SCALP MASSAGE

1055
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,831
THIS PLACE DOES GOOD MASSAGES

1056
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,932
Open your eyes.

1057
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,469
DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE PARADISE?

1058
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,537
Sir.

1059
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,504
Sir?

1060
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,639
Look at my eyes when you talk.

1061
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,007
Does it feel good?

1062
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,109
What's wrong?

1063
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,610
-I'm being gentle.
-Who is that?

1064
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,947
You can't press
with your fingernails, Jin-kyung!

1065
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,716
Open your eyes, sir.

1066
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,285
SCREWBALLS CLEANED UP NICELY
FOR THE NEW YEAR OF 2026

1067
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,920
Woo-jae had so many dead skin cells.

1068
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,189
I need to wash this all off.

1069
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,958
ONE HOUR LATER

1070
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,427
First of all, your shoulders are size L.

1071
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,595
Because of your shoulders…

1072
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,030
MEASUREMENTS BASED ON INDICATORS

1073
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,300
There's a chance
it may not close down here.

1074
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,403
Also, your waist is a bit big.

1075
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,605
-Like this.
-But you measured…

1076
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,973
But you measured from underneath.

1077
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,675
It's large up here

1078
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:38,909
and it gets smaller here.

1079
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,244
Wait, my breasts get smaller?

1080
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,612
What the heck?

1081
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,913
From my shoulder…

1082
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,082
-Why does it get smaller?
-Your chest is a size M.

1083
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,016
But why?

1084
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,185
Her shoulders are a size L
but her chest is a size M.

1085
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,122
What the heck?
Why would my chest get smaller?

1086
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,023
Your stomach is size XL.

1087
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,291
My stomach is size XL?

1088
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,560
MY STOMACH IS SIZE XL?

1089
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,028
I quit!

1090
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,163
I quit this segment.

1091
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,831
Just a little bit more.

1092
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,199
How can my stomach be a size XL?

1093
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,567
-Is she almost done?
-Look.

1094
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,636
We just met for the first time
but she's so rude.

1095
