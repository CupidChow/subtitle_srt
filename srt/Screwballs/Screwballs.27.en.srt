1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs…

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,072
SAE-HO HAS INVITED HIS COSTARS TO HIS HOME

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,441
THE PROBLEM WAS…

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,177
THEY WALKED IN WITH A CLOUD
HANGING OVER THEM

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,080
BUT DON'T BE HARSH ON THEM,
THEY BROUGHT GIFTS FOR SAE-HO

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,616
LOOK AT THIS STUNNING PAIR OF JEANS

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,086
WAIT, WHAT?

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,755
PFFT

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,089
HOW HUMILIATING

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,391
-Woo-jae.
-Yeah?

11
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,759
Please leave.

12
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,193
LOL

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,728
I brought this to keep you warm.

14
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,063
In the middle of summer?

15
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,334
-Isn't it too big on him?
-It is.

16
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,302
JIN-KYUNG WORE IT
LIKE A MODEL ON THE CATWALK

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,271
Woo-jae brought a gift for Jin-kyung.

18
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,306
-It looks so good on him.
-How do I look?

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,209
AT LEAST I'M KEEPING THESE PRETTY GLASSES

20
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,944
-I kept them--
-I'm worried about the arms.

21
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,881
Please leave.

22
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,251
THE FIRST GAME TO DECIDE
WHO PAYS FOR THE TEAM DINNER

23
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,520
It's called "Who Bopped My Head?"

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,025
Seriously, Woo-young!

25
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,126
YOU THINK I DID IT?

26
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,831
THEY ALREADY HAD A TRUST ISSUE
TO BEGIN WITH…

27
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,732
SCRAMBLING

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,333
HEH

29
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,169
It was Sae-ho, right?

30
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,104
You failed.

31
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,739
TIME TO DECEIVE YOUR COSTARS

32
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,641
Jin-kyung.

33
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,842
You failed!

34
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,910
Three, two, one.

35
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,078
I'll do it. It was me.

36
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,547
THE GAME ONLY ENDED UP SCARRING EVERYONE…

37
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,549
CURRENT STANDINGS
SOOK: 5 POINTS, WOO-JAE: 4 POINTS

38
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,818
JIN-KYUNG: 3 POINTS,
SAE-HO: 2 POINTS, WOO-YOUNG: 1 POINT

39
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,186
It's gotten hot.

40
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,687
Yeah, I'm sweating.

41
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,190
All right. We've been debating
which game to play next.

42
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,959
Well, there's one where you spout water.

43
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,928
-We're spouting water?
-In here?

44
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:38,698
Obviously, we'll need Sae-ho's approval
before proceeding with it.

45
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,500
Well, I guess that depends…

46
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,102
Just how much water
do we hold in our mouths?

47
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,169
One sip.

48
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,237
-Just one sip?
-Yes.

49
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,239
We'll hardly get the whole floor wet.

50
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,142
Do you remember the game
we played in Hong Kong on Beat Coin?

51
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,844
It's pretty much the same.

52
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,445
We should be fine once the rug's removed.

53
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,713
-Let's move this.
-Let's do that.

54
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,215
-We can always wipe the floor.
-Yeah.

55
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,683
-Okay.
-I'll roll this.

56
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,485
Just fold it.

57
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,820
THE WATER GAME IS BEING PREPARED
WITH THE HOMEOWNER'S APPROVAL

58
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,622
Yes, please give them the bracket.

59
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,257
Huh? What's that?

60
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,626
We're having a tournament for this game.

61
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,795
-One of us gets the bye.
-That's right.

62
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,864
WATER BOMB GAME FOR TEAM DINNER BILL
TOURNAMENT BRACKET

63
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,199
Whoever gets the bye will have it so easy.

64
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,569
That person has the best shot at winning.

65
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,705
Will you decide by Rock-Paper-Scissors?

66
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,873
Okay, here's my suggestion.

67
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,574
Give us a math quiz for 12th graders.

68
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,009
-Be serious.
-What could we do?

69
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,077
HE'S DEMANDING HE GETS THE BYE

70
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,145
Do you have anything?

71
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,880
Why don't we use that?

72
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,047
-This?
-The Young-hee figurine.

73
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,115
Young-hee?

74
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,718
How do we decide anything with that?

75
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,819
Let's sit around it.

76
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,887
AS FOR THE YOUNG-HEE GAME…

77
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,922
THE TOY'S HEAD SWIVELS?

78
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,190
-See?
-Hey, I'm it.

79
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,725
-It looks at you.
-I see.

80
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,626
If Young-hee looks at you…

81
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,960
Whoever the figurine looks at

82
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,495
-gets the bye.
-That's it.

83
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,796
Let's finish this in one go.

84
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,398
-Okay.
-This is for who gets the bye.

85
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,800
Here we go.

86
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,538
-Three, two, one.
-One!

87
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,506
WHO GETS THE BYE?

88
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,008
-It's me. I'm sure of it.
-It's Woo-young.

89
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,376
You can't deny it.

90
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,678
It's me.

91
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,346
-It's Woo-young.
-You can't deny it.

92
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,382
TOO BAD WOO-YOUNG GOT IT AND NOT ME…

93
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,483
READS THE ROOM

94
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,451
-It's not fun. Let's try something else.
-Yeah.

95
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,587
-It's not fun. Let's try something else.
-Yeah.

96
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,955
What's going on?

97
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,190
-It was lame.
-Not fun at all.

98
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,724
But I won fair and square!

99
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,693
-How dull was that?
-I'll take Young-hee back.

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,528
I didn't think it'd be so anticlimactic.

101
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,696
I'm putting it in the box.

102
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,764
-What a letdown.
-But I…

103
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,999
-Jin-kyung.
-That's not the issue.

104
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,234
-I won.
-Let's try something else.

105
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,368
We'll play some other game.

106
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,436
-Sit back down.
-Let's all sit.

107
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,872
Don't raise your voice
when the cameras are rolling.

108
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,940
She has a point.

109
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,242
Do you think we're being civil
for no reason?

110
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,610
-Wait.
-Rock-Paper-Scissors?

111
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,479
THIS BAND WILL ROB YOUR PERK
WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE

112
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,748
Rock-Paper-Scissors is bound
to make more people laugh.

113
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,684
Young-hee works better as a drinking game.

114
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,386
You snooze, you lose the bye.
Rock, paper, scissors.

115
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,454
Rock, paper, scissors.

116
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,855
JIN-KYUNG: ROCK, OTHERS: PAPER

117
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,023
JIN-KYUNG IS ELIMINATED

118
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,959
-Move out.
-Jin-kyung is eliminated.

119
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,394
You snooze, you lose the bye.
Rock, paper, scissors.

120
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,029
WOO-YOUNG AND SAE-HO: ROCK
WOO-JAE AND SOOK: SCISSORS

121
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,232
-Dang it.
-Man, I blew it.

122
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,000
-No going back if I win this time.
-Got it.

123
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,802
Look, folks.

124
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,570
Come on.

125
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,073
"The complex belongs to its residents."

126
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,541
What's your choice?

127
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,609
Me? Paper.

128
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,544
-It's all good if I go for rock, right?
-Sure.

129
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,812
All right. Rock, paper, scissors.

130
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,614
SAID HE WOULD GO PAPER
SAID HE WOULD GO ROCK

131
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,482
NO ONE KEPT THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN

132
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,550
We went the opposite.

133
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,719
We went the exact opposite.

134
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,187
MUTUAL TRUST COMES CLOSE TO 0%

135
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,388
Hey, you.

136
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,690
-What were you thinking?
-We gave you a shot.

137
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,158
-Yeah.
-He took such a simple approach.

138
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,893
When he said he'd go for paper,

139
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,096
I wanted him to think
that I'd go for rock.

140
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,865
In that case… What was it again?
Did you pick the paper sign?

141
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,933
What did you say earlier?

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,601
REMIND ME, WILL YOU?

143
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,938
-What did you say you'd choose?
-Gosh.

144
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,007
"Anyway, I'm going for rock."
How simple is that?

145
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,275
That's why I chose paper.

146
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,045
Even without the game,
we meant to give Sae-ho the bye

147
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,948
-because he opened up his home for us.
-Really? Thank you.

148
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,850
BUT THAT SOURED MY MOOD

149
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,652
Why didn't you say so earlier?

150
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,719
GRUMBLING

151
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,354
Allow me to present the rules.

152
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,689
The next game is called

153
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,391
Water Bomb.

154
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,026
-"Water Bomb"?
-Yes, that's it.

155
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,927
Water bomb, bomb

156
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,963
All rounds are played one-to-one.

157
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,031
With two players.

158
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,999
You will face your opponent

159
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,501
and stand across from them.

160
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,870
AN EXTREME EXTROVERT, AN EXTREME INTROVERT

161
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,307
You'll take a sip of water,
hold it, and close your eyes.

162
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,743
Once the game starts,
you can open your eyes at your choosing.

163
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,944
You can close your eyes again.

164
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,114
YOU MUST SUPPRESS THE URGE TO LAUGH
AND KEEP THE WATER IN TO WIN

165
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,349
That's all there is to it.

166
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,417
What?

167
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,686
The underlying principle of the game

168
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,654
is that if both players
open their eyes at once,

169
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,856
at least one of them
is bound to burst into laughter.

170
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,491
-Really?
-In most cases, yes.

171
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,859
For example… Let's try it.

172
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,927
Close your eyes.

173
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,830
WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS?

174
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,832
HEY, WAIT

175
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,900
So that's how it works.

176
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,301
-It does make you laugh.
-Yes, it does.

177
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,271
In the real game,
you'll stand much closer to one another.

178
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,873
If you think you won't burst out laughing

179
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,342
even after the eye contact,

180
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,078
you're free to make faces
to make your opponent laugh.

181
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,881
Even if we make it to the final round,
we'll be soaked through.

182
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,784
-Well, a bit.
-You'd been spat at by three people.

183
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,820
Wait, let's make this pledge
before we begin.

184
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,657
-Promise you won't throw the game away.
-Right, no giving up on purpose.

185
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,158
Let's not stoop so low.

186
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,361
-We shouldn't.
-Let's keep it fair, okay?

187
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,596
To discourage you from giving up the game,

188
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,766
we won't be giving any points to those
in second, third, and fourth places.

189
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,368
Only the winner will get ten points.

190
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,702
THE WINNER GETS IT ALL

191
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,572
Whoever throws the game away
should pay five million won as a penalty.

192
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,074
-I'm not joking.
-If anyone gives up…

193
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,143
AN EXTREME PENALTY IS REQUIRED
TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK

194
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,212
Any ideas on how to set up the bracket?

195
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,280
Excluding Sae-ho, I mean.

196
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,216
Why don't we pair up the two oldest
and the two youngest?

197
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,283
I like the idea.

198
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,586
We can then have a clash
between a youngster and an old hand

199
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,954
-in the semifinal round.
-All right.

200
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,756
WRITING IN THE BRACKETS

201
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,658
Take a look at his penmanship.
That's how good students write.

202
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,694
You can tell
he used to take notes diligently.

203
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,496
He does have the look of a model student.

204
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,131
Look how neat his writing is.

205
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,499
I'm only saying this

206
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,503
because his letters are so evenly sized.
How wonderful is that?

207
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,872
Here's your tournament bracket.

208
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:46,973
Dang, I'm getting nervous.

209
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,941
It's gonna be a big match.

210
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,209
SOOK, JIN-KYUNG,
WOO-JAE, WOO-YOUNG, SAE-HO

211
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,312
I'll add a rule using my privilege
as the owner of this place.

212
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,716
Let's have the contestants
place their chins on this stool.

213
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,820
That way, both players can stay
in the same spot throughout the game.

214
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,822
-Can you join me?
-That will make things much harder.

215
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,824
How do we spew out the water, then?

216
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,893
It will go right
onto your opponent's face.

217
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,862
-This is going to be entertaining.
-Great.

218
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,531
-The angle…
-I'll allow it.

219
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,166
COMFORT, DISTANCE, HILARITY

220
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,867
-All right.
-The whole setup…

221
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,270
-No drills this time.
-Don't worry about getting water on it.

222
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,339
I kept wondering when I'd use this stool.
Its time has come at last.

223
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,675
EVEN ITS MAKER WOULDN'T HAVE FORESEEN THIS

224
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,210
Let's use this as a screen.

225
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,645
THE FIRST GAME IS ABOUT TO BEGIN

226
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,146
Can you sit closer
to the stool, Jin-kyung?

227
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,915
Sit closer and place your chin on it.

228
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,184
You should take a sip first, Jin-kyung.

229
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,351
The water, Jin-kyung.

230
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,453
OH, RIGHT

231
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,522
BOTH CONTESTANTS
NOW HAVE THEIR "WATER GUNS" LOADED

232
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,791
All right. Please close your eyes.

233
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,393
Place your chin on the stool.

234
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,829
Once the game starts,

235
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,364
you must open your eyes
at least once every five seconds.

236
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,567
Three.

237
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,935
Two.

238
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,002
One.

239
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,905
SOOK REVEALED

240
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,141
JIN-KYUNG REVEALED

241
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,115
SHE'S LAUGHING RIGHT AWAY?

242
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:08,721
DESPITE HER BEST EFFORTS TO REIN IT IN,
HER WATER GUN WENT OFF

243
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,291
JIN-KYUNG LOSES

244
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,760
I don't want to play this game!

245
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,062
SOOK WINS

246
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,764
THIS IS HOW IT GOES

247
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,533
I don't want to play this game!

248
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,971
The water came spewing out
of her mouth and her nostrils.

249
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,839
BOTH WINNER AND LOSER
ARE UNSURE HOW TO FEEL

250
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,974
-That was hilarious.
-What was that?

251
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,041
Here's your towel.

252
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,343
-What on earth?
-Seriously.

253
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,678
What sort of game is this?

254
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,947
I bet this will surprise you, Sook.

255
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
-You're the winner.
-Yeah.

256
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,885
-By a landslide.
-You won.

257
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,520
-Wait--
-I won?

258
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,089
It's difficult not to laugh.

259
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,458
The sound

260
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,294
and the spray of the water
were spectacular.

261
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,530
I'll write down Sook's name here.

262
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,764
SOOK ADVANCES TO THE SEMIFINAL

263
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,466
It's Woo-jae versus Woo-young next.

264
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,568
Get over here, Woo-jae.
Show me what you've got.

265
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,137
Move in closer to Woo-young if you can.

266
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,205
Good. Just a bit further.

267
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,007
-More.
-I think Woo-young should move closer.

268
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,074
A bit more.

269
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,210
All right, as you were.
No practices are allowed.

270
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,646
All right. Move in closer, Woo-jae.

271
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,713
Okay, we're all set.

272
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,682
Close your eyes.

273
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,684
Open your eyes at will.

274
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,987
All right. You have to open them
at least once every five seconds.

275
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,557
Three, two, one.

276
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,458
Go!

277
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,061
THEY LOOK PRESENTABLE FROM THE SIDE

278
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,565
BUT NOT FROM THE FRONT

279
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,435
IT'S A NECK-AND-NECK COMPETITION

280
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,803
Both are holding on well.

281
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,606
TURNS OUT THEY'RE MORE KEEN
ON WINNING THAN THEY LET ON…

282
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,043
STILL, WOO-YOUNG IS AN IDOL
AND WOO-JAE IS A MODEL…

283
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,244
Gosh, they're good.

284
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,880
THIS COMEDIAN MUST FEEL THREATENED

285
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,448
Hold on. Timeout.

286
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,516
Okay, timeout.

287
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,117
I'm giving Woo-jae a warning.

288
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,787
Under the pretext of making silly faces,

289
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,388
-you avoided looking at Woo-young.
-Right.

290
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,890
Okay.

291
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,558
You must look ahead at all times.

292
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,261
Don't use that gross water.
Just swallow it and take another sip.

293
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,230
-That was a good point.
-You bet it was.

294
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,601
Three, two, one.

295
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,768
Go.

296
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,103
Go.

297
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,372
UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS ROUND,
THIS ROUND STARTS OFF RESERVED

298
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,440
Go.

299
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,977
Hey, Woo-young almost laughed.

300
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,313
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WOO-YOUNG'S LIFE

301
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,916
WOO-JAE'S HEATED GAZE IS FIXED ON HIM

302
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,720
-Hey.
-Wait.

303
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,256
WE DON'T GET WHY HE ALMOST LAUGHED,
BUT HE MANAGED TO REIN IT IN

304
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,025
Woo-young, you have to look at Woo-jae.

305
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:26,926
SHE'S HOLDING BACK TOO

306
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,395
THE GAME IS LOCKED IN A STALEMATE

307
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,964
GARGLING?!

308
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,532
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

309
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,334
CHEEKS PUFFING IN AND OUT

310
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,503
Jeez, that's disgusting.

311
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,905
EYE FOR AN EYE
GARGLE FOR GARGLE

312
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,641
I don't want to play against them.

313
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,444
I'm not even sure who'd win at this point.

314
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,013
HOW ABOUT A KISS INSTEAD?

315
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,280
That's it. Just kiss.

316
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,815
SO, HOW ABOUT IT?

317
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,288
WOO-JAE GOT SPLASHED ON FIRST

318
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,690
AND RETURNED THE FAVOR

319
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,460
Why did you spit out the water?

320
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,063
YOU THINK THAT MATTERS?

321
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,831
That was disgusting!

322
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,533
So gross!

323
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,735
DISGUSTED BY EACH OTHER

324
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,803
Just how…

325
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,471
This was the grossest moment of 2025.

326
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,973
I'm ashamed of myself.

327
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,975
Who won anyway?

328
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,176
Woo-young did.

329
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,411
No, I won.

330
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,079
-Woo-jae won.
-Oh, that's right.

331
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,914
Although it feels like Woo-young won.

332
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,982
WOO-JAE WINS

333
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,750
He wanted to keep it going.

334
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,052
Two players, please step forward.

335
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,687
-Can I forfeit?
-No way.

336
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,155
Let me bow out.

337
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,790
IT WON'T FEEL GOOD TO WIN ANYWAY

338
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,626
(GIVES UP AND LOADS UP HER WATER GUN)

339
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,295
I MUST REMAIN CALM, MY OPPONENT IS SOOK

340
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,030
BOTH OVERCAME AN ORDEAL TO GET HERE

341
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,098
Three,

342
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,001
YESTERDAY'S COLLEAGUE

343
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,236
IS TODAY'S ENEMY TO SPIT WATER ON

344
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,371
Go.

345
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,141
GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAIN

346
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,043
THAT'S NOT SO BAD

347
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,479
SHE DIDN'T LOSE COMPOSURE OVER THAT FACE?

348
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,981
YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD OUT AGAINST THIS?

349
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,419
STAY CALM

350
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,422
BUT HE'S A MODEL

351
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,858
AND I'M THE COMEDIAN

352
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,027
(SOMETHING'S OFF)

353
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,697
WHO WILL WIN
AND FACE SAE-HO IN THE FINAL ROUND?

354
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,104
WOO-JAE WINS

355
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:23,542
EVEN WITH HER EYES CLOSED,
HER AIM STAYED TRUE

356
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,114
IT'S THE SECOND TIME
HE HAS TO BE THE CONFUSED WINNER

357
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,682
I'm sorry.

358
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,184
I'm so sorry.

359
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,320
POOR WOO-JAE…

360
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,322
I'm sorry, Woo-jae.

361
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,991
I DO FEEL BAD, WOO-JAE…

362
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,761
I'll let you use the bathroom.

363
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,364
Winning just leaves
a sour taste in your mouth.

364
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,967
-Hang on.
-It's so strange, if you think about it.

365
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,537
-Just a second.
-When you lose, you're liberated.

366
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,141
Suppose I lose in the final round
after enduring all this.

367
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,343
WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE ME WITH?

368
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,477
A ton of regret.

369
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,645
Make sure to win, Woo-jae.

370
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,847
I lose ten points after getting spat on

371
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,616
while he wins ten points
without any suffering?

372
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,851
Yes, and that's how good fortune works.

373
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,320
THAT'S THE TRUTH ABOUT LIFE, ISN'T IT?

374
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,489
That's how luck works.

375
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,091
You have to win, Woo-jae.

376
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,260
Now that I've gotten this far, I must win.

377
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,463
You went through so much to get here.

378
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,198
I still have droplets

379
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,968
of Sook's and Woo-young's spit on my face.

380
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,436
You have to win, okay?

381
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,506
-You endured so much.
-This is a fight to the death.

382
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,008
Woo-jae has to win this time.

383
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,043
You've got to win, Woo-jae.

384
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,111
FINAL BOSS, CHO SAE-HO

385
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,381
WHO WILL BE CROWNED THE CHAMPION?

386
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,982
ENGROSSED

387
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,720
THIS FINAL BOSS
MUST'VE PREPARED SOMETHING EPIC

388
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,056
CACKLING

389
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,425
HE'S GOT HIS SPECIAL ITEMS EQUIPPED

390
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,127
You have to hang in there, okay?

391
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,063
ONLY WOO-JAE COULDN'T SEE HIM
BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN

392
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,665
You have to hang in there, okay?

393
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,334
Your opponent is a comedian.

394
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,804
I won, didn't I?

395
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,972
This should count as my victory.

396
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,274
-The game hasn't begun yet.
-Still, I won.

397
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,210
HE'S MAKING A BIG FUSS
WITH HIS PREPARATIONS

398
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,644
This should count as my victory.

399
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,879
The game hasn't begun yet.

400
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,349
A WORTHY BIT FROM THE FINAL BOSS

401
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,252
THE SPECTATORS ARE DEEPLY MOVED
EVEN BEFORE THE GAME

402
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,954
SHE'S ABOUT TO CRY

403
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,689
Your opponent is a comedian.

404
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,023
REMEMBER THAT, OKAY?

405
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,692
You're going up against a comedian.

406
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,162
(RELOADED HIS WATER GUN)
(FULLY READY)

407
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,364
-We'll begin once Woo-jae takes his sip.
-Sae-ho's ready.

408
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,832
I'll begin the count right away.

409
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,767
WHEEZING

410
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,570
POOR WOO-JAE…

411
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,339
Three, two…

412
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,907
Start.

413
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,008
TWITCHING

414
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,578
OOPS, HE'S SEEN SAE-HO

415
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,881
GET READY TO WITNESS

416
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,883
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FINAL BOSS

417
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:45,851
GUSH

418
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,722
A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE
FITTING FOR THE ALUM OF TAZZANG

419
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,790
OVERFLOWING?

420
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,125
FACED WITH A CRISIS TOO EARLY ON

421
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,327
TEARS

422
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,630
HOLD ON ANY LONGER
AND THIS WILL BACKFIRE ON HIM

423
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,465
BUT HOW CAN ANYONE MANAGE THAT?

424
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,502
WAIT, I'M DONE FOR

425
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,070
TAKE MY WATER BOMB

426
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,372
For goodness' sake…

427
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:11,176
SAE-HO'S PLAN TURNED OUT TO BE
A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ONE

428
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,581
Seriously, dude!

429
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,183
FINAL BOSS IS A TOP-TIER TEASE

430
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,188
THE MEMORABLE MATCH WAS ROUNDED UP QUICKLY

431
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,658
Quick, take them out.

432
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,859
(FREE AT LAST)

433
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,994
YUCK

434
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,665
DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME

435
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,735
He didn't spit out the water.
He let it splash out.

436
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,538
HE REACHED NEW HEIGHTS

437
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,639
What a shame.

438
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,508
That's what a comedian can do.

439
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,909
Did I win?

440
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,145
Woo-jae sure is tenacious.

441
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,379
He went too far, didn't he?

442
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,781
-How was it?
-Hats off to you, Sae-ho.

443
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,084
I hadn't thought of it, but you have to
have your mouth closed to hold water in.

444
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,887
With your mouth closed, you can keep
water in without swallowing it.

445
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,256
-But with your mouth open…
-The water keeps splashing over.

446
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,857
You need to have your mouth closed, Sook.

447
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,025
So you learned something new.

448
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,293
ANYHOW, HE'S LEARNED A LOT

449
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,361
So hilarious.

450
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,596
Woo-jae, you…

451
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,398
Why do you look so glum when you just won?

452
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,733
VICTORY WITHOUT GLORY

453
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,368
This is my lowest moment of 2025.

454
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,005
WOO-JAE, THE WINNER
OF THE FIRST WATER BOMB GAME

455
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,874
-Still, you won.
-Good job.

456
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,476
Congrats, seriously.

457
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,978
-He's miles ahead of us.
-Totally.

458
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,079
Had Sae-ho…

459
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,481
been my opponent in the first round,

460
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,849
I would've given up right away.

461
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,618
But I had everyone's spit
all over my face.

462
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,987
I couldn't just accept defeat.

463
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,123
The winner of this game is Woo-jae.

464
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,891
WOO-JAE IS THE WINNER
OF THE WATER BOMB GAME

465
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,330
WATER BOMB GAME ENDS IN SUCCESS,
BRINGING EVERYONE CLOSER

466
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,065
All right. Here's the third game.

467
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,302
-This game doesn't require any props.
-What can this be?

468
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,704
Your presence alone is enough.
It's that simple.

469
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,573
It is the Tearing Challenge.

470
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,409
-That's it.
-I cried earlier from watching Sae-ho.

471
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,545
Can you put those chopsticks back in?

472
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,214
-It'll tear me up right away.
-Woo-jae.

473
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,482
Don't get started just yet.

474
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,117
-Not just yet.
-It's a sure bet.

475
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,184
-Ready.
-Close your eyes.

476
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,086
Hold on. Ask everyone to close their eyes.

477
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,154
Please close your eyes.

478
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,556
-The teardrop has to roll down your face.
-How far does it have to go?

479
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,592
-Past my cheekbone?
-Yes, past your cheekbone.

480
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,327
Whoever cries first wins, yes?

481
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,762
That's right. Ready.

482
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,930
GO!

483
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,869
ENGAGING ALL THE SADNESS IN THEIR BODY

484
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,005
MY ZIT IS BREAKING MY HEART

485
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,808
THIS IS TOO MUCH
FOR A REASON-DRIVEN GUY LIKE ME

486
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,477
HOW ARE MY STOCKS DOING AGAIN?

487
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,280
MEANWHILE, THIS NEWLYWED
IS SIMPLY OVER THE MOON

488
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,784
WAIT, HE'S READY FOR AN ASSESSMENT?

489
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,659
You passed.

490
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,794
-Who passed?
-I did.

491
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,995
ME, HEH-HEH

492
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,230
WAIT, I CAN'T HOLD IT BACK

493
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,732
What did you think about?

494
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,034
Getting kicked out of my home.

495
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,805
AFTER STRIKING OUT AS CABBAGE…

496
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,574
I'VE COME SUCH A LONG WAY
TO CALL THIS UNIT MY HOME

497
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,345
PLEASE LET ME KEEP MY HOME, I BEG OF YOU

498
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,415
How did he manage to tear up so quickly?

499
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,451
Is Sae-ho the winner, then?

500
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,386
The game will continue
until all ranks are decided.

501
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,754
-We have to go on?
-Yes.

502
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,525
IS SHE CRYING
OR TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH?

503
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,360
This might help you tear up.

504
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,428
Look.

505
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,131
Remember this?

506
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,199
AVOIDS IT

507
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,633
THAT WAS EPIC

508
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,303
THE LEGENDARY MEME REMASTERED

509
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,106
The tears came
when I kept my eyes open for long.

510
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,977
Dang it. My eyes hurt!

511
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,078
You have to endure it.

512
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,146
"Sook."

513
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,747
"Jin-kyung."

514
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,049
"Sook."

515
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,617
"Jin-kyung."

516
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,519
"Sae-ho."

517
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,587
"Woo-young."

518
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,590
HE'S FINALLY BRINGING OUT
THAT ACE FROM HIS SLEEVE

519
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,691
"We made…

520
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,459
a hell of a show together."

521
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,228
The tears just won't come.

522
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,597
Your tear ducts are dry as a bone.

523
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,133
IN THAT CASE…

524
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,904
NEW STRATEGY: INDUCE TEARS FROM PAIN

525
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,873
(FEELING BAD FOR HIS COSTAR)

526
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:01,940
Dang it!

527
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,409
Do you have to go that far?

528
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,811
HE'S USUALLY SMART…

529
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,747
LET'S GET ASSESSED ANYWAY

530
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,416
A STATE-OF-THE-ART
TEAR DETECTION SYSTEM

531
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,484
You failed.

532
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,453
But my eyes definitely watered up.

533
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,090
NEXT STRATEGY: SABOTAGE

534
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,291
Are you for real?

535
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm getting this eye welled up.

536
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,629
WAILING

537
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,731
TEARS

538
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,767
WHAT IS THIS, A FUNERAL?

539
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,641
(JUMPS TO HER FEET)

540
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,111
ONE FUNERAL GUEST
WANTS HER TEAR TESTED FIRST

541
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,481
THE TEARDROP HAS TO REACH HER CHEEKBONE

542
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,283
Just a bit further.

543
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,818
NO WAY

544
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,154
CAN'T YOU TAKE A SECOND LOOK?

545
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,856
HE'S SAYING NO, JIN-KYUNG

546
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,192
(JUMPS TO HIS FEET)

547
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,993
FUNERAL GUESTS GATHER

548
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,528
(I WANT MY TEAR CHECKED TOO)

549
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,265
WHILE THEY WAIL LOUD…

550
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,770
THEIR SORROWS ARE ALL BUT FAKE

551
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,272
My neighbors will think
I'm holding a funeral.

552
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,216
WHAT'S WRONG, WOO-YOUNG?

553
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,385
SO SICK OF THE TANTRUM

554
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,087
-You've got to be kidding me.
-That hurts.

555
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,922
(SCREWBALLS' TROUBLEMAKER)

556
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:24,990
Come on.

557
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,525
What the heck is wrong with him?

558
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,928
His agency should have a word with him.

559
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,831
BUT WHO WOULD GIVE
THE DIRECTOR-LEVEL ARTIST AN EARFUL?

560
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,833
-I can't stand him.
-What's wrong with you?

561
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,302
All my tears dried up because of you!

562
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,370
(WAHHH)

563
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,074
-What is the matter with him?
-Doesn't Woo-young deserve second place?

564
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,178
DID I TEAR UP?

565
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,679
You didn't get a single drop.

566
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,015
SOB, SOB

567
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,817
I never knew crying was so hard.

568
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,019
I'm getting dewy-eyed, but no tears.

569
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,320
Things never end up

570
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:56,955
the way you want it to.

571
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,424
Tears only come to you
once you've given up on crying.

572
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,593
WELL, WE'RE SET ON CRYING

573
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,661
Jin-kyung.

574
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,564
DID SHE REALLY DO IT?

575
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,932
Check my cheekbone.

576
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,400
-It's on my cheekbone.
-Just a bit further.

577
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,735
-Wait.
-My cheekbone.

578
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,670
All right, Jin-kyung.

579
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,938
-You passed.
-You got second place.

580
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,072
-All right.
-Wow.

581
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,508
I WANT TO PASS TOO…

582
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,777
Woo-jae hasn't teared up, has he?
Why is he making that face?

583
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,845
Seriously, why?

584
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,881
Focus your gaze on the light
and keep your eyes open.

585
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,750
LIKE THIS!

586
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,352
LIKE THIS?

587
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,422
THE 3RD PLACE IS MINE!

588
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,757
Keep at it until your eyes hurt.

589
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,325
You must endure that pain.

590
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,128
THEY'RE HAVING NO LUCK
WITH THE TEARING CHALLENGE

591
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,362
How many points can we earn here?

592
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,632
You placed second, so you won four points.

593
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,801
But I've already secured 14 points.

594
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,970
Hey, I'll still get first place
even if I place fifth here.

595
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,638
I'm giving up.

596
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,507
I'm in the lead anyway.

597
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,042
I'm afraid we're hopeless.

598
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,712
You could say I cried a lot
in the previous game.

599
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,347
THE MAN WITH THE MOST MOIST SKIN

600
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,049
That was the last game.

601
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,483
I can't manage it.

602
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,385
Why can't I make myself cry?

603
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,188
All right, then. The three of you
failed to complete the challenge.

604
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,256
0 POINTS FOR THE QUITTERS

605
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,591
-It's surprisingly difficult.
-How did you tear up?

606
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,226
NO IDEA

607
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,562
You don't cry, do you, Sook?

608
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,130
I shudder at the thought.

609
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,432
When was the last time you cried?

610
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,566
Back at the amusement park.

611
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,635
When you played my father's voicemail.

612
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,736
Sook.

613
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,506
Good job on hanging in there
for the last 30 years.

614
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,874
HER FATHER'S VOICE TRIGGERED HER TEARS

615
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,510
What puzzled me
when watching the episode later

616
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,679
was seeing Jin-kyung
cry harder than I did.

617
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,715
That stunned us too.

618
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,184
You were even crying as you walked home.

619
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,220
MADE US THINK SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER…

620
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,488
GAME OVER

621
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,990
Since I placed first in this game,
I'll skip the present

622
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,292
and let the runner-up choose the prize.

623
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,393
I want Young-hee.

624
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,461
What about the sneakers?

625
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,563
-Can I take them both?
-Sure.

626
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,630
Here you go.

627
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,698
Aren't shoes more practical?

628
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,766
Thanks.

629
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,036
-So, I'll now announce the final results.
-Okay.

630
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,271
As you would all know,
Woo-jae placed first.

631
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,339
He won 14 points.

632
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,407
I'll take one slot.

633
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,608
Next, in second place…

634
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,676
We have a tie.

635
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,012
Jin-kyung and Sae-ho are tied
as they both won seven points each.

636
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,348
-What happens to the slots, then?
-Rock-Paper-Scissors?

637
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,684
You snooze, you lose

638
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,785
JIN-KYUNG WINS!

639
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:07,886
-She gets two slots.
-Just two.

640
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,988
Fourth place goes to Sook
who won five points.

641
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,123
Four slots, then?

642
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,290
-Tell me where.
-The blue ones.

643
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,358
I'll take them all.

644
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,493
Woo-young gets five slots.

645
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,161
Please fill the five slots with his name.

646
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,998
-This roulette hurt me pretty badly.
-Oh, that's true.

647
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,066
Give it a good spin!

648
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,300
DURING THE BESTIES TRIP IN BUSAN…

649
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,070
The person who's chosen here
will have to sleep outdoors.

650
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,471
JANG, HONG

651
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,073
It's shaped like an arrow.

652
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,310
HE WAS ONCE CHOSEN TO SLEEP OUTDOORS ALONE

653
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,646
TEARS

654
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,082
-Please remove this roulette.
-Five slots?

655
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,184
Woo-young got five slots.

656
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,620
We'll decide who'll pay
with the first spin.

657
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,988
If that person is chosen again,

658
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,424
-they'll cover the entire 50%.
-That's right.

659
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,859
I assume you'll remember
how we all got confused.

660
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,928
But the choice is made by the arrow point.

661
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,263
-Remember that.
-Here we go.

662
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,798
This is the first spin, right?

663
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,666
-It is the first spin.
-Off we go with the first one.

664
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,734
Three, two, one.

665
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,802
Let's go!

666
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:57,936
HERE WE GO

667
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,409
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW HOW LIFE WILL TURN OUT

668
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,811
No!

669
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,280
-No!
-The stopper actually moves.

670
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,916
-No!
-The stopper actually moves.

671
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,618
WHOSE NAME WILL BE CHOSEN
FROM THE FIRST SPIN?

672
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,086
-It's Sae-ho.
-It's going to pass by.

673
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,822
-Sae-ho's chosen first.
-Sae-ho.

674
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:17,889
What on earth?

675
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,191
Your name, Sae-ho.

676
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,059
-It's you.
-What's the matter?

677
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,093
YOUR NAME HAS BEEN CHOSEN

678
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,161
-Is this for real?
-Yeah.

679
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,229
Cho Sae-ho.

680
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,130
IT'S YOU

681
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,998
SO RELIEVED

682
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,601
NEXT SPIN WILL CHOOSE THE PERSON
WHO WILL SHARE THE BURDEN WITH SAE-HO

683
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,036
If my name is chosen again…

684
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,437
Yeah, you pay for the entire half.

685
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,805
-You pay for the 50%.
-Okay.

686
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,873
-That's not likely.
-No way.

687
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,642
SURELY, SAE-HO WON'T BE CHOSEN AGAIN

688
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,511
COME ON, IT CAN'T STOP AT MY NAME

689
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,916
WHO DID THE ROULETTE CHOOSE?

690
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,051
Even in fifth place…

691
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,086
-I knew this roulette wouldn't--
-It's Woo-young!

692
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,990
BELOVED BY THE ROULETTE

693
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,625
I COULD JUST…

694
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,393
Come on. Let's do a celebratory turn.

695
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,062
Why would I do that?

696
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,630
DAMN IT

697
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,399
At any rate, that roulette
is bent on being a pain in my neck.

698
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,467
Are we done? Get out now.

699
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,703
WE'RE ALL DONE HERE, NOW SCOOT

700
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,404
That concludes today's games to decide

701
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,306
who'll pay for the team dinner.

702
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,976
Sae-ho and Woo-young
will share the burden.

703
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,043
Thanks for chipping in!

704
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,311
THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL

705
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,614
-I'll enjoy the dinner.
-Woo-young is finally treating us.

706
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,848
I'll pay for the entire 50%.

707
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,849
You will?

708
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,917
Okay, then.

709
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:19,918
-Good.
-That's sorted, then.

710
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,553
-What?
-I actually prefer that.

711
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,554
It's nice and neat that way.

712
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,922
I'm short on funds lately.

713
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,457
I bought too many designer items.

714
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,592
I'm sorry about that.

715
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,062
DON'T BE PATHETIC

716
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,132
OFF TO THE RESTAURANT

717
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,901
Three, two, one.

718
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:36,968
SPONSOR #1 ARRIVED FIRST

719
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,970
I can't believe how fast time flew.

720
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,506
Today is the seventh shoot already, right?

721
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,574
That's right.

722
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,808
(WOO-JAE)

723
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,710
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, good to see you.

724
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,413
-Hey, you're wearing an AMOUPRE T-shirt.
-Yup.

725
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:51,883
NEXT COMES SPONSOR #2

726
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,986
Here comes Mr. Jang Woo-young,
set to cover 25% of the bill.

727
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,454
I'll pay for your part too.

728
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,123
-What are you even saying?
-I won't, then.

729
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,460
HAHAHA

730
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,763
Wait, guys.

731
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,431
-The ladies haven't arrived yet.
-Right.

732
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,933
-How do we…
-Let's eat.

733
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,568
Come on!

734
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,303
I'll give them an earful
when they get here.

735
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,306
-Age doesn't mean much these days.
-Exactly.

736
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,840
Anyway, the food looks amazing.

737
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,644
MOUTHWATERING DISHES AWAIT THEM

738
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,247
Shall we get a drink first?
How about a highball or some beer?

739
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,715
I have a photo shoot
for my album cover tomorrow.

740
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,783
When's that?

741
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,117
-I'll have a somaek.
-Really?

742
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,287
Way to go. For an "album cover,"
do you wrap up the albums?

743
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,289
Sure, it'll be all about the labor
and not me.

744
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,958
He's good.

745
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,026
SOOK ARRIVES

746
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,996
-Come on, Jin-kyung.
-What do we have here?

747
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,064
There she is.

748
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,233
JIN-KYUNG WALKS IN

749
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,103
Hey, Jin-kyung. Come this way.

750
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,739
HE'S AS POLITE AS HE CAN BE

751
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,474
Didn't you say you'd give her an earful?

752
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,742
-Says who?
-What did he say?

753
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,277
Woo-jae said

754
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,913
he was determined
to give you a word about tardiness,

755
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,114
even if you're his senior.

756
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,215
-Says who?
-Go ahead.

757
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,150
-No.
-Go on. Let's hear it.

758
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,285
SPEAK FREELY

759
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,387
-Did you want to have a word with her?
-No.

760
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,290
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU TWO GOT ALONG

761
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,891
Please enjoy the food.

762
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,159
-Thanks.
-We'll enjoy it.

763
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,028
Thanks for the food, Woo-young.

764
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,830
-It's my pleasure. Please enjoy.
-Thanks, Sae-ho.

765
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,897
Enjoy.

766
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,299
You know I don't eat a lot.

767
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,800
Sure. Enjoy.

768
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,836
-This place offers great bar food.
-Try this.

769
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,373
Sook, try this broth.

770
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,341
-My gosh, thank you.
-Is that cuttlefish?

771
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,442
These are baby squids.

772
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,510
TENDER BABY SQUID

773
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,645
Is this what I think it is?

774
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,079
-Sliced raw beef?
-You got it.

775
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,547
Sliced raw beef, here I go

776

A HAPPY TEAM DINNER THANKS TO THE SPONSORS

777
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,788
THIS SPONSOR TAKES A BIG BITE

778
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,324
The squid tastes amazing.

779
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,793
Look at the board.

780
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,262
It lists our show's journey,
not the dishes on offer.

781
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,598
Today was our seventh shoot, apparently.

782
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,033
…8. SURVIVE AS CHARACTERS FROM FAIRY TALES

783
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,969
From the six shoots,

784
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,972
we produced and released 25 episodes.

785
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,540
A round of applause, please.

786
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,608
Thanks for the good work.

787
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,578
I actually wanted to say something.

788
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,646
Go ahead.

789
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,215
Let's talk about the sixth theme,
my 30th anniversary.

790
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,583
-Sure.
-Thank you for everything.

791
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,586
I found the occasion rather embarrassing,

792
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,690
so I didn't even consider
throwing a party.

793
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,793
But you dug through the archives
and even got my father's voicemail,

794
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,695
who rarely speaks up.

795
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,496
You crafted a narrative…

796
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,764
When I asked my family…

797
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm talking here.

798
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,703
Did you have to take
a bunch of raw beef slices?

799
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,504
Jin-kyung just picked up five slices.

800
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:30,542
CRAZY ABOUT RAW BEEF
FOOD OVER SOOK

801
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,745
Following Jin-kyung's example,
we'll take a few bites.

802
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,013
WE MIGHT AS WELL EAT TOO

803
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,816
Anyway, when I talked to my older sisters,

804
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,386
they told me they had a meeting to discuss
whether it was right to get involved.

805
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,255
Turns out they had been very busy
behind my back.

806
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,691
At first, I was too embarrassed to…

807
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,194
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS?

808
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,395
Anyway, that's how I felt.

809

(WATCH IT, WOO-YOUNG)

810
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,965
Sook is talking here.

811
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,667
Why are you giving me that wrap?

812
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,968
I don't even eat garlic.

813
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,603
Why would you make that wrap?

814
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,938

00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,873

817
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,412
I've come to realize
I'd cherish the memory of that day.

818
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,750
You can't be serious.

819
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:12,784
You can't be serious.

820
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:13,685
BIG BITE

821
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,354
-Get your acts together, you two!
-But my chair…

822
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,256
Its leg got stuck in the gap on the floor.
I'm sorry.

823
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,959
I couldn't help but notice
how you ate two pieces before getting up.

825
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,828

Jeez, he's dozing.

You're getting a call
from the moving service agent.

829
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,801
Oh, the moving service agent.

830
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,703
Why a moving service?

831
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,271
I asked them for a quote.

832
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,573
Sook moves stuff from place to place
all year round.

833
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,678
She has these storage units
all over the place.

834
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,914
Anyway, I wanted to share my gratitude.

835
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:47,418
I want to thank the cast and crew
once again.

IT WAS OUR HONOR TO CELEBRATE WITH YOU
-FROM THE ENTIRE CREW-

The junior comedians from Gag Concert

838
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,392
posted the photos from that day
on their social media accounts

839
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,961
and wrote that it was their honor
to celebrate Sook's 30th anniversary.

840
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,263
How sweet, right?

841
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,330
Of course.

Netflix offered us a home.

844
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,741
I want to say
how grateful I am to Netflix…

845
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,509
Wasn't Netflix's decision

846
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,945
heavily influenced by Jin-kyung?

847
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:14,979
-How so?
-What did she do?

848
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:15,914
A lobbying campaign.

849
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,816
What on earth are you talking about?

850
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,051
Are you insane?

851
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:21,786
You didn't?

852
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,455
What lobbying campaign
are you talking about?

853
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,957
I can't even guess what you were saying.

854
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,125
Maybe I got the wrong idea.

855
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,794
You could land me in serious trouble!

856
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,596
Did you really pay them two billion won?

857
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,932
I have no idea.
That's what I thought she did.

858
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,301
What's your favorite theme, Sook?

859
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,902
I loved "Besties Trip to Busan."

860
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,771
-The trip to Busan?
-I had the most fun then.

861
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,174
I only watched the Busan episodes
just yesterday.

862
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,709
You did?

863
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,311
Gosh, they were so hilarious.

864
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,279
I laughed so hard.

865
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,981
The bits were ridiculous.

PHONE CALL BETWEEN SOOK AND THE SHOWRUNNER

867
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,686
Woo-jae and I were
in the other part of the city

868
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,422
while the remaining three
went on to the zip-line course.

869
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,158
-For that mission, yes.
-I laughed so hard watching it.

870
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,960
My gosh.

871
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,261
What about you, Jin-kyung?

872
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,664
The crew members
have a question for Jin-kyung.

873
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,733
Did you even watch the episodes?

874
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,602
SO, DID YOU?

875
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,872
I'm sure she didn't

876
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,940
because she asked
if Young K was a celebrity.

877
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,675
That was just…

878
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,777
Seriously, you.

879
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,080
-I'm sure she didn't watch them.
-I just found my peace.

880
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,515
You could say my reputation
barely took off the respirator.

881
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,917
YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WEEK

882
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,253
HELP YOUR COSTAR OUT

883
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,587
Do you remember "Along with the Gods"?

884
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,723
Chuck a raw beef slice
and discuss the one it sticks to.

885
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,892
Of course I remember. Jin from BTS came

886
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,828
-and played the foot basin game together.
-Yeah, that's the one.

887
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,929
Why wouldn't I watch our show?

888
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,899
I'm getting tongue-tied
because this accusation is ridiculous.

889
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,200
I watched all of it.

890
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,235
In that case…

891
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,703
(SHUT IT)

892
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,572
You know what? You can drink this.

893
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,941
Drink this and stop your childish game.

894
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,976
You're a grown man.

895
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,244
PFFT

896
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,580
He thinks he's so bright.

897
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,715
Well, you can't deny it.

898
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,919
It's a private gathering
with only a few cameras here.

899
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,621
So let's have a secret vote
with your eyes closed.

900
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,758
Raise your hand if you believe
that Screwballs' success so far

901
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,160
relied mostly on your performance.

902
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,496
-If you take a peep…
-You really shouldn't.

903
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,730
If you do, you're off the show.

904
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,798
Okay.

905
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,001
-It's no fun at all if you take a peep.
-Agreed.

906
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,136
Close your eyes, everyone.

907
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,804
Close your eyes too.
Check the footage later.

908
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,705
US TOO?

909
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,607
How many times can I raise my hand?

910
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,208
-Just once.
-I see.

911
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,077
Please raise your hand

912
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,280
if you think
we owe the success of Screwballs

913
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,882
to you.

914
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,983
TWITCHING

915
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,019
SNORTS

916
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,959
Okay, understood.

917
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,627
Keep your eyes closed.

918
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,197
Raise your hand if you think
we owe the show's success to the viewers.

919
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,566
SCREWBALLS OWES ITS SUCCESS TO THE VIEWERS

920
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,904
EVERYONE RAISES THEIR HAND
WITHOUT HESITATION

921
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,238
We get only one vote, right?

922
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,440
Just one, right?

923
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,507
TEARS

924
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,842
VOTE COMPLETED

925
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,311
Would you rather learn the results now
or watch the episode yourselves?

926
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,546
-I'll watch the show.
-Yeah?

927
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,613
Tell us the results now.

928
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,015
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN

929
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,584
-We should hash things out here today.
-Good idea.

930
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,121
Those who agreed
that we owe our success to our viewers

931
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,423
are everyone except Sae-ho.

932
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,891
EVERYONE EXCEPT SAE-HO

933
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,060
I can explain.

934
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,862
I have one more announcement.

935
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,231
The only person who believes
he drove the show's success

936
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,499
was Sae-ho.

937
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,001
ONLY ONE

938
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,202
The only reason

939
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,172
I didn't get to raise my hand
when asked if we owe it to the viewers…

940
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,474
WE AREN'T INTERESTED

941
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,010
I only voted for the statement
that I drove the show's success

942
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,446
because I attend every shoot
determined to propel the show.

943
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,781
WELL NOTED

944
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,516
Can we do the votes again?

945
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,452
-The vote…
-I never knew it tasted this good.

946
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,688
I hope the viewers will be understanding.

947
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,790
I'm a comedian, after all.

948
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,291
I don't really believe--

949
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,293
-Are you still going on about that?
-Yes, I still am.

950
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,462
I love it the most

951
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,132
when we're all sitting down on a couch.

952
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,235
I'm convinced we can make good jokes
when we're together.

953
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,437
The most memorable shoot for me
was the first one.

954
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,305
I felt a strange mix of emotions.

955
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,673
I love going over old memories.

956
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,876
-I know, right?
-It hasn't been all that long.

957
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,010
Yeah, but still.

958
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,045
THAT BRINGS US TO…

959
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,380
Next episode on Screwballs…

960
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,616
WIN THE HEARTS OF THE FUTURE VIEWERS

961
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,850
We're meeting the future viewers?

962
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,819
HERE COME THE LITTLE FUTURE VIEWERS

963
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,754
It's lovely to meet you.

964
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,790
-Good job.
-To be a long-running series,

965
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,025
we'll have to open the hearts
of the future viewers.

966
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,195
But by the time the children
grow old enough to watch our shows,

967
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,564
a few of our cast members
may have passed away.

968
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,266
Do you have to go that far?

969
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,200
TEARS

970
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,836
THE FUTURE VIEWERS
ARE CLEARLY DISSATISFIED

971
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,405
ALL THE TRICKS UP THEIR SLEEVES

972
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,441
AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH

973
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,376
No one's looking.

974
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,646
It's much harder to win a child's heart
than to win a woman's heart.

975
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,580
Let's rest here a bit.

976
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,217
THEIR BEHAVIOR GROW EVEN SILLIER

977
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,785
CACKLING

978
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,788
-I love this.
-I can't believe you hogged this place.

979
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,323
That was mean. Let us join you.

980
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,725
-What on earth?
-What's he doing?

981
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,861
5 MINUTES
UNTIL THE BEST TEACHER VOTE

982
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,263
Who seems to be the kindest? Really?

983
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,965
Who's the most handsome one?

984
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,999
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!

985
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,701
THE CAST MEMBERS WILL RAT EACH OTHER OUT

986
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,637
AND THROW SHADE AT EACH OTHER MERCILESSLY

987
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,240
THE CONTEST TO WIN OVER CHILDREN
REMAINS CHILDISH UNTIL THE END

988
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,075
-Seong-jun.
-I'll treat you to a meal.

989
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,145
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO WIN
THE HEARTS OF THE FUTURE VIEWERS?
