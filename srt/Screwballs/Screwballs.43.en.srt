1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,903
The legendary K-pop idol of 18 years,
2PM's main dancer.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,805
Off the stage, he's a true screwball.

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,941
The star of today's
Deconstruction Show is Woo-young.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,843
WOO-YOUNG'S DECONSTRUCTION SHOW

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,712
With Woo-young as the leader,
you'll try to be the actual 2PM.

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,382
There will be an end-of-month evaluation.

7
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,316
You're insane.

8
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,185
There will be a punishment for the person
who scores the lowest.

9
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,387
They have to go out to the street.

10
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,455
In front of at least five people,

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,691
you have to do a solo performance
without any music.

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:25,925
It's "I'll Be Back"!

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,827
THEIR DANCE SKILLS CAN'T EVEN BE EVALUATED

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,762
SNORT

15
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,864
-And sweep up.
-You got it.

16
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,499
ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO

17
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,234
One, two.

18
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,603
BUT THEY DO THEIR BEST TO LEARN THE DANCE

19
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,372
THE TIME FOR EVALUATION HAS COME

20
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,708
CLEAN TRANSITIONS

21
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,476
PRECISE STEPS

22
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,145
PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED TEAMWORK

23
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,013
PERFECTLY REPLICATING 2PM

24
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,283
THE MEMBERS TRULY DID THEIR BEST

25
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,018
WHAT IS THE RESULT?

26
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,488
I think you have gotten even worse
than back then.

27
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,923
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

28
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,225
Jin-kyung's average score is five points.

29
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,360
ALONG WITH CRITICISM
JIN-KYUNG COMES IN LAST

30
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,062
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT US

31
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,830
SHE IS SET TO DANCE ON THE STREET
WITHOUT ANY MUSIC

32
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,198
The menu is awesome today.

33
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,734
It's cold outside, so wear these gloves.

34
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,670
He says the cafeteria food is good.

35
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,905
I'm sick and tired of them.

36
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,010
THE OUTSTANDING DANCERS
MOVE TO THE CAFETERIA

37
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,280
While she goes through
the punishment outside,

38
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,214
you can eat.

39
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,682
-Really? We can eat?
-Can we eat?

40
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,484
-Oh, I see.
-How can we do that?

41
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,188
I'd feel bad.
How could we eat without Jin-kyung?

42
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,989
-Gosh, this is good.
-It's really good.

43
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,225
SOMEONE'S TRAY IS GETTING COLD

44
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,960
-Is it okay?
-It's really good.

45
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:34,994
-Yeah.
-Gosh.

46
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,601
THIS IS EARTH IN ANOTHER MULTIVERSE

47
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,372
5PM EXISTS IN THIS WORLD INSTEAD OF 2PM

48
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,108
5PM'S UNIQUELY OUTSTANDING DANCER

49
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,945
THE MAIN DANCER TAEK-GYEON

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,648
THE ONE THAT MESMERIZED
THE K-POP WORLD WITH HER DANCE

51
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,752
HAS GONE OUT TO THE STREET
TO MEET THE PUBLIC

52
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,824
SHE WENT SHIRTLESS(?)
NOT REALIZING THIS WOULD HAPPEN

53
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,160
Hello.

54
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,362
QUICKLY PASSES BY

55
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,463
LOOKING AROUND

56
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,866
This area is very busy and bright.

57
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,702
It's so bright out here.

58
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,837
JYP IS LOCATED RIGHT IN DOWNTOWN SEOUL

59
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,641
A lot of people are
staring at you over there.

60
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,777
WORD HAS ALREADY GONE OUT
THAT THIS WILL BE FUNNY

61
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,080
The weather is too nice.

62
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,315
I wish it was a bit gloomy.

63
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,618
-It is a really nice day.
-The sun is shining so bright.

64
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,454
The sun is high in the sky.

65
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,223
You get a good day like this
maybe 10 days out of the year.

66
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,458
How can it be so sunny?

67
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,761
That's why you're dressed for the weather.

68
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,296
With your top off.

69
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,697
DRESSED FOR THE WATERBOMB FESTIVAL

70
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,199
You'll play the music, right?

71
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,168
-You dance without music.
-Without music?

72
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,403
Then, do I do this?

73
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,441
We'll prepare chairs for the audience.

74
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,210
That's it.

75
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,344
You remember all of it.

76
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,780
-It's without music.
-Yes, without music.

77
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,681
SHE PRACTICES HARD FOR NOW

78
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,357
LEAVING ALL THE BURNING GAZES BEHIND

79
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,461
SEARCHING FOR AN AUDIENCE

80
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,362
GETTING READY JUST LIKE THAT?

81
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,530
Wait.

82
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,065
-Ask for their consent.
-Okay.

83
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,434
-Would you like to briefly see me dance?
-Yes.

84
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,170
-May I film you?
-There are people inside too.

85
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,472
IT'S LUNCH TIME
SO THERE ARE TONS OF WORKERS FROM NEARBY

86
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,777
AND SO, WITHOUT ANY RHYME OR REASON
SHE PREPARES FOR "I'LL BE BACK"

87
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,445
Unbelievable.

88
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,581
NOW THAT SHE HAS TO DANCE,
SHE IS SO EMBARRASSED

89
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,184
This is mortifying.
Why does it have to be so sunny today?

90
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,285
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO SUNNY TODAY?

91
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,888
FINALLY, THE MAIN DANCER FOR 5PM

92
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,958
RISES UP FROM HER CROUCHED POSITION!

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,428
FLUTTERING

94
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,297
DUM DUDUM

95
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,234
THE AUDIENCE FROM THE VIP SEATS
REACT IN A SUBTLE WAY

96
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,469
PASSING BY QUICKLY

97
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,837
LOOKING AWAY

98
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,173
THE R SEATS DON'T COMPLAIN
BECAUSE IT'S FREE

99
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,374
SPEECHLESS

100
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,345
THERE ARE SO MANY WEIRD PEOPLE OUT THERE

101
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,214
I WAS RAISED PROPERLY
SHOULD I BE WATCHING THIS?

102
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,582
WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SIGHT!

103
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,454
NEGATIVELY KILLING THE PERFORMANCE

104
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,124
THE VIP GUEST IS
SLOWLY GETTING TIRED OF IT

105
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,760
THE PERFORMANCE IS ALMOST OVER

106
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,861
SPINNING

107
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,665
BUT HER ENDING WAS PERFECT

108
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,001
It's over.

109
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,702
GIVE HER A BIG HAND FIRST

110
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,838
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

111
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,040
How was my dance?

112
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,075
-You dance well.
-Really?

113
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,610
YOU COULD HARDLY WATCH THOUGH

114
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,978
Your children are kind.

115
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,947
They're so kind.

116
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,048
-Here.
-Thank you.

117
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,784
-Thank you for watching.
-Thank you.

118
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,052
You weren't shocked, were you?

119
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,953
SHE DOESN'T DENY IT

120
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,388
Okay. Study hard.

121
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,590
Let's go.

122
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,491
SHE STILL NEEDS MORE VIEWERS

123
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,426
Sir, please join them.

124
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,328
I'm going to dance.

125
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,497
-She'll be performing.
-I'm performing.

126
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,766
SHE SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITS
SOMEONE ON THEIR WAY TO A CAFE

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,336
I think you have gotten even worse
than back then.

128
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,904
YOU HAVE GOTTEN EVEN WORSE THAN THEN

129
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,509
EVERYBODY SCOFFED
AT THE TRAGIC DANCER TAEK-GYEON

130
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,547
I WILL PROVE MY TALENT HERE TODAY

131
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,488
OH…

132
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,590
SHE DANCES WELL

133
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:29,162
HER DANCE MOVES BRING PEOPLE TO A HALT

134
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,299
SHE USES THE STAGE TO THE FULLEST

135
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,906
HIS MOUTH DRIES

136
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,942
THE TIME THAT SEEMED LIKE
IT WOULD NEVER END COMES TO PASS

137
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,678
ENDING POSE

138
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,083
THUNDERING APPLAUSE

139
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,918
You dance well.

140
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,985
-Was it okay?
-Yes.

141
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,354
Oh, really?

142
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,289
-You dance so well without music.
-Yes.

143
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,790
You were different
from when you were in Unnies.

144
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,058
Really?

145
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,561
THE EVALUATION HAS BEEN OVERTURNED

146
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,897
-I'll watch the show.
-Thank you for watching me dance.

147
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,466
JIN-KYUNG CLEARED HER MISSION

148
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,968
-Thank you.
-It's so good.

149
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,269
THE MEMBERS ARE BUSY EATING

150
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,072
-Jin-kyung.
-You even locked the door to eat?

151
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,207
-Yes, sorry.
-No.

152
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,175
-Good job, Jin-kyung.
-Thanks.

153
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,276
The food looks great.

154
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,412
-It's so good.
-Is it?

155
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,381
Jin-kyung, I waited for you to eat.

156
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,082
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST FINISH CHEWING
BEFORE YOU LIE

157
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,718
This is the famous
home cooked meal at JYP.

158
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,453
YOU PRACTICALLY INHALED IT

159
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,989
This place is the pride and joy of JYP.

160
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,392
It's their cafeteria
that serves organic meals

161
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,094
-called JYPBOB.
-Yes.

162
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,230
THE FANCY BUFFET LINEUP

163
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,164
Here's all that I ate.

164
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,766
I ate nothing to eat JYPBOB.

165
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,534
I can really eat two bowls of this.

166
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,303
A DELICIOUS AND HEALTHY

167
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,473
HOME-COOKED STYLE MEAL
FOR THE STAFF AND TRAINEES

168
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,077
There isn't even a little bit of MSG.

169
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,545
There's no MSG.

170
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,047
-How can it taste this good without MSG?
-Yeah.

171
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,917
-They want to know if it's free.
-Is it free

172
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,152
to eat at this cafeteria?

173
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,187
-How much is this?
-Basically,

174
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,856
if you apply for it, it's free.

175
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,191
If you apply for it in advance?

176
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,126
-This is?
-If you apply, it's free.

177
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,895
But if you haven't applied for it,

178
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,798
lunch is 8,000 won
and dinner is 6,000 won.

179
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,801
Everyone must apply for it then.

180
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,969
Most people try to.

181
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,938
Even if you were in a rush,

182
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,773
you can eat this meal at lunch

183
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,341
-for 8,000 won, right?
-Yeah.

184
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,644
This place is so nice.

185
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,646
-Isn't it so nice?
-It's so good.

186
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,482
TAKING A HUGE BITE

187
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,783
This is insane.

188
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,685
The stew is so good.

189
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,020
When I ate the stew,

190
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,188
I got a big whiff of

191
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,490
the aroma from the mushrooms.

192
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,758
It was so good.

193
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,859
-It's so good.
-Look.

194
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,694
The suyuk is so good too.

195
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,897
The geotjeori is so good too, Sook.

196
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,798
Let me see.

197
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,167
ENJOYING A PEACEFUL LUNCH

198
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,135
All right.

199
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,937
-Yes?
-Keep eating.

200
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,738
-Just relax and listen.
-I got a bad feeling

201
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,774
so I couldn't eat comfortably.

202
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,576
-I think something's up.
-No, not at all.

203
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,246
Well, since today is
Woo-young's Deconstruction Show,

204
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,217
we want to see
some other sides of Woo-young.

205
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
As the youngest, Woo-young has been

206
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:11,023
doted on so much by the other members,

207
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,092
but at times, he has to endure

208
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,127
the sacrifice and frustration too.

209
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,262
HE HAS TO ENDURE
THE SACRIFICE AND FRUSTRATION TOO

210
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,498
WANTING TO CRY

211
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,999
I endure so much.

212
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,335
Who endures what? Do you mean us?

213
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,870
The youngest endured sacrifice?

214
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,672
I can finally speak up now.

215
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:31,110
So what if Woo-young was the oldest?

216
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:36,115
-Flip the Age.
-We'll play Flip the Age starting now.

217
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,250
Hey, can I eat that?

218
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,384
Hey, can I eat that?

219
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,220
What are you doing? You have yours.

220
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,989
How dare you?

221
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,658
While we're in the cafeteria,
your ages will be in reverse order.

222
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,593
Think of it as your ages being flipped.

223
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,895
Then, Sook is the youngest?

224
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,196
THE 50-YEAR-OLD YOUNGEST MEMBER

225
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,397
-Yes.
-Really?

226
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,232
So Woo-jae is older than me

227
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,400
and this guy is the oldest.

228
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,002
"This guy" is oldest?

229
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,136
THIS GUY?

230
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,871
I mean, Woo-young is the oldest.

231
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,106
And I'm second oldest.

232
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,140
HE SHRINKS BACK WITH ONE LOOK

233
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,109
Yes, Woo-young. Please speak.
Hey, Jin-kyung.

234
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,243
Yeah?

235
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,344
Did she just say "yeah?"

236
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,214
-That's what I say to older friends.
-Really?

237
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,285
Sook, can you get us some water?

238
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,020
Sook, can you get us some water?

239
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,722
SHE HASN'T BEEN ORDERED BY ANYONE
IN A LONG TIME

240
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,890
SCOFFS

241
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,026
-Bring more geotjeori on your way back.
-Yeah.

242
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,962
-I'll be the only one suffering.
-Well, no.

243
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,500
Woo-young, they keep ordering me around.

244
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,802
Guys, come on.

245
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,772
Sook is such a nice girl, you know.

246
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,674
TOUCHED

247
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,242
-Then--
-Why are you still here?

248
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,810
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

249
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,545
You know, Jin-kyung is close to the door.

250
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,880
Why don't you go and get it?

251
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,348
The two of you can go together.

252
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,950
Hey, Jin-kyung.

253
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,652
-I want doenjang soup.
-Me too.

254
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,487
Jin-kyung can get some more doenjang soup.

255
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,189
-Sook, let's go together.
-Yeah?

256
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,358
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

257
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,393
-Woo-jae's soup and--
-And my stew.

258
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,095
How long are we doing this?

259
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:56,996
Ten minutes.

260
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,130
Ten minutes? Okay.

261
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,634
-Guys.
-Ten minutes? What happens after that?

262
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,235
What happens…

263
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,004
Get some Coke Zero from the first floor.

264
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,105
Woo-jae.

265
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,140
-Give me money then.
-Yeah, you have to.

266
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,308
I'll pay you afterwards.

267
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,543
Give me two million won.

268
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,012
Why these brats…

269
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,314
-Girls, get going.
-Doenjang soup and geotjeori?

270
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,415
You're letting dust in.

271
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,850
THEY LEAVE AS IF THEY'RE KICKED OUT

272
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,652
-Geez.
-Unbelievable.

273
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,555
Why are they eating so much? Those jerks.

274
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,723
How could they?

275
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,493
They always order us around
when we are eating.

276
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,295
They're so annoying.

277
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,630
They're so infuriating.

278
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,264
This is bad only for us.

279
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,202
Shouldn't they get their own food?

280
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,703
Why did they tell us to get it?

281
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,871
You'll wolf down some too.

282
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,406
YOU'LL WOLF DOWN SOME TOO

283
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,741
LAUGHING AWKWARDLY

284
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,875
Did you say "wolf down?"

285
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,976
I'm sorry.

286
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,212
How dare you speak to
someone older like that?

287
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,849
You haven't been taught
proper social etiquette.

288
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:50,950
I'm sorry.

289
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,152
I forgot you're older than me.

290
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,454
WHILE SOOK IS BEING VICIOUSLY SCOLDED

291
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,890
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-Hey, Sae-ho.

292
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:58,858
-Yes.
-Woo-jae.

293
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,459
-Yes, can I help you?
-Yes, Woo-young.

294
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,328
-Look, Sae-ho.
-Yes.

295
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,097
Why are you such a messy eater?

296
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,298
I'm sorry.

297
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,234
-The thing is--
-You messy jerk.

298
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,003
-You're such a messy jerk.
-The thing is…

299
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,472
-Why are you so messy?
-It was so good that I ate in haste.

300
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,608
-Do you have no manners?
-I'm sorry.

301
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,443
-I'm so sorry.
-Hey, Woo-jae.

302
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,678
Sweep your hair to the side.

303
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,880
Let me see your eyes when I speak to you.

304
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,716
THE JERK IS UNAFFECTED
BY THE FLIP THE AGE GAME

305
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,684
Our dear Woo-jae.

306
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,486
Our dear Woo-jae.

307
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,056
Give me a hug. Please.

308
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,092
Just this once. Can I kiss you?

309
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,728
I really like Woo-jae, you know.

310
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,530
-Just hold me.
-Why are you so dirty?

311
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,999
-I used to like Woo-jae so much.
-Hey, Woo-jae.

312
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,401
Woo-jae, we are brothers.

313
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,335
HE'S PISSING ME OFF AGAIN

314
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,004
Why do you hate it so much?

315
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,273
I really like Woo-jae.

316
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,543
-Sae-ho may lack in certain aspects…
-You know,

317
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,211
-…but you should embrace him.
-I really

318
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,846
like both of you.

319
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,715
-Go away.
-Come on.

320
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,117
-Try hugging him. His skin feels weird.
-Hug me.

321
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,251
Let's hug.

322
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,253
I like you both so much.

323
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,288
SOULESS EYES

324
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,422
I really like you.

325
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,592
Did Sae-ho always smell bad like this?

326
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,861
Listen, Woo-young.

327
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,596
You keep saying

328
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,566
that I'm messy and that I smell bad.

329
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,867
I'm married now.

330
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,837
I got married last year.

331
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:23,275
MEANWHILE, THE YOUNGEST TWO THAT WENT OUT

332
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,177
They love kimchi.

333
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,546
REPLENISH THE FOODS WHILE COMPLAINING

334
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,482
Here they come.

335
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,418
Thanks, Jin-kyung.

336
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,352
THE FOOD DELIVERERS RETURN

337
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,388
BUT SOOK IS MISSING?

338
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,523
Where's Sook?

339
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,160
-Don't sit down.
-Sook is still getting food.

340
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,495
What if she gets lost?

341
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,996
She's only five years old.

342
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,831
WHAT IF SHE GETS LOST?
SHE'S ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD

343
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,367
How can you leave
the five-year-old behind?

344
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,104
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT
IN FLIP THE AGE GAME

345
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,106
-Hey, Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

346
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,242
When you grow up…

347
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,409
He makes me nervous.

348
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,512
Any romantic notions about marriage?

349
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,347
ANY ROMANTIC NOTIONS ABOUT MARRIAGE?

350
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,415
-Since we're still young.
-Since we're all young…

351
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,084
I'm going to kill him today.

352
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,752
THEY END THE GAME TO PROTECT THE MEMBERS

353
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,123
So this time, we prepared
a simple game that contains

354
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,026
what Woo-young wanted to tell you.

355
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,327
It's called Hey, You Buster.

356
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,829
-Do you know the game?
-No.

357
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,430
I think I've played it before.

358
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,331
Let me explain.

359
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,766
It goes counterclockwise.

360
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,134
-Okay.
-Okay.

361
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,136
Jin-kyung, you will look at someone,

362
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,772
-point at them, and say, "Hey!"
-Okay.

363
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,842
The person next to Jin-kyung
will say, "You!"

364
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,044
You!

365
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,247
-Then, Sae-ho will say, "Buster!"
-Okay.

366
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,683
The person he pointed at

367
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,051
will start off the "Hey" again.

368
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,252
It starts all over.

369
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,289
Then, whoever you choose
for "Hey" and "You" means nothing.

370
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,957
-Only "Buster" matters.
-Only "Buster."

371
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,592
The point of this game is…

372
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,895
I said that "Hey" and "You"
don't mean anything, right?

373
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,498
-Yeah.
-But if someone is chosen…

374
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,799
MEANINGLESS CHOICES

375
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,700
You're startled.

376
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,035
There's a rhythm to it.

377
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,238
It goes,
"Hey, You Buster. Hey, You Buster."

378
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,040
Let's do a trial run.

379
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,208
-Hey.
-You.

380
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,442
-Buster.
-No.

381
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,846
-I'm the one who should say "Buster."
-Yes.

382
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,681
Jin-kyung showed us
exactly what not to do.

383
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,216
She showed us the bad example.

384
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,152
The only choice that matters is Buster.

385
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,119
Yeah.

386
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,187
DID SHE REALLY UNDERSTAND IT?

387
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,623
-The person who loses has to clean this.
-Yeah.

388
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,091
-Yes. Cleaning it all up.
-Okay.

389
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,293
-Sounds fun.
-Should we start with Jin-kyung?

390
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,729
Two, two, three, four.

391
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,498
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

392
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,900
-Hey.
-You.

393
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,868
Buster!

394
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,169
Buster!

395
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,804
-Hey. What's up with her?
-What?

396
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,472
-She did this.
-You got it wrong.

397
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,674
SHE PLAYED AT THE LEVEL WE EXPECTED

398
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,376
We're going to eat comfortably today.

399
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,446
After Sook's turn,
it goes back to your turn, Jin-kyung.

400
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,014
Got it? Please?

401
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,082
-Here we go.
-Okay.

402
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,083
-From me?
-Okay.

403
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,084
Ready, go.

404
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,986
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

405
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,220
Hey!

406
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,121
STARTLED

407
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,155
You!

408
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,523
NOW, IT'S MY TURN

409
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,192
-Buster!
-What the heck?

410
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,226
You!

411
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,327
Buster!

412
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,363
Buster!

413
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,031
LAUGHING

414
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,032
What the heck?

415
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,534
She's so transparent.

416
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,570
My gosh. She is too transparent.

417
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,938
-Wasn't it my turn?
-Yes.

418
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,841
SOOK SHOULD HAVE SAID "BUSTER"

419
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,843
BUT THIS PERSON DECIDED TO BARGE IN

420
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,011
-Start over.
-From whom?

421
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,312
-From you? Ready, go.
-From you.

422
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,581
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

423
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,987
We're starting from you.

424
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,522
What are you--

425
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,857
-Hey!
-You!

426
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,758
Buster!

427
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,792
Buster!

428
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,995
SOOK'S TURN AS SHE WAS
POINTED OUT AS "BUSTER"

429
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,096
Buster!

430
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,833
AND AT THE SAME TIME

431
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,270
HER PUPILS MOVE RAPIDLY

432
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,171
Hey!

433
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,572
You!

434
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,874
You!

435
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,808
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO HER?

436
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,777
Buster!

437
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,245
-Hey!
-You!

438
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,413
Shouldn't I say "You"?

439
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,515
Since I said "Buster",

440
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,317
should I be the one that says "You"?

441
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,685
-What?
-Isn't that right?

442
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,186
-No.
-I said "Buster."

443
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,754
-The one beside you.
-You said, "Hey."

444
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,222
-But I--
-You said, "Hey."

445
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,624
"Buster" came to me.

446
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,792
Buster.

447
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,393
Buster!

448
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,795
-Hey!
-You!

449
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,729
Shouldn't I say "You"?

450
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,997
HE SAID "HEY" BUT TRIED TO STEAL "YOU" TOO

451
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,131
Buster.

452
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,499
Hey!

453
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,400
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

454
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,403
BURST OUT LAUGHING

455
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,304
LAUGHING

456
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,206
I'm sorry, but you looked stupid just now.

457
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,508
-It's very confusing.
-It is.

458
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,810
It's very confusing.

459
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,144
-Hey!
-You see--

460
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,412
I said, "Buster"!

461
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,948
But he said, no, I said "Buster."

462
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,750
-Hey! Wait, it is your turn.
-Yeah.

463
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,852
-So what did I say?
-You said all of it.

464
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,354
You did "Hey" and "You."

465
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,322
HE WANTED TO SAY BOTH OF THEM

466
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,224
He tried to attack,
but he fell for it himself.

467
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,026
-It's very confusing.
-Okay. Let's try again.

468
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,427
This isn't easy.

469
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,695
Ready, go.

470
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,797
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

471
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,032
-Hey!
-You!

472
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,470
It's your turn.

473
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,338
-No, it isn't.
-Why not?

474
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,374
This is so frustrating!

475
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,708
-You!
-But…

476
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,909
It starts from here.

477
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,511
RECEIVING MIRROR THERAPY THROUGH SOOK

478
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,380
-Who did you point to?
-It starts from here.

479
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,647
Who did you choose?

480
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,182
-You.
-It doesn't matter.

481
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,450
-Oh, yeah.
-It doesn't matter.

482
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,752
EMBARRASSED

483
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,853
That's right.

484
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,554
Did you spike this or something?

485
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,223
HOW COULD THEY BE SO BAD?

486
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,858
-Let's try again.
-Okay.

487
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,761
-Whose turn? Jin-kyung's?
-One, two. One, two, three, four.

488
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,196
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

489
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,364
-Hey.
-You!

490
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,365
Buster!

491
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,701
HE POINTED OUT JIN-KYUNG FOR "BUSTER"!

492
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,470
JIN-KYUNG MUST SAY "HEY" NOW

493
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,738
Hey.

494
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,373
You!

495
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:22,875
Buster!

496
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,776
Hey!

497
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,310
Hey!

498
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,780
THE CRISIS RETURNS

499
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,747
You.

500
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,150
-You.
-Buster!

501
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,384
-Hey!
-You!

502
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,352
Buster!

503
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,587
IN THE MEANTIME, SHE FLINCHES

504
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,723
-Buster!
-Hey!

505
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,624
You.

506
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,858
-Buster!
-Your finger.

507
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,293
WE'LL LET IT SLIDE THIS ONE TIME

508
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,628
-Your finger.
-Hey!

509
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,463
-You!
-Buster!

510
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,697
Buster!

511
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,665
Hey.

512
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,967
WHAT?

513
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,069
BECAUSE OF SOOK'S "BUSTER"

514
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:50,969
Hey!

515
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,237
IT STARTS AGAIN FROM JIN-KYUNG

516
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,505
-What's up?
-It's Woo-young.

517
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,107
WOO-YOUNG WHO ZONED OUT LOSES 1 POINT

518
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,575
-We played for a long time.
-Yeah.

519
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,643
You played for a while.

520
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,545
-There were some risky moments.
-I get it now.

521
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,679
I get it now.

522
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,580
From Woo-young.

523
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,982
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

524
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,250
-Hey.
-You.

525
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,752
-Buster.
-Hey.

526
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,653
You.

527
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,088
-Buster.
-Hey.

528
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,355
-You.
-You.

529
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,523
-You.
-You.

530
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,658
-She's wrong.
-What?

531
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,526
-It was my turn.
-That's right.

532
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,527
He said "Buster."

533
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,462
I said, "Hey."

534
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,263
-He said, "Hey."
-He said, "Buster."

535
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,231
Can we check?

536
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,700
-No, it wasn't.
-He definitely said, "Hey."

537
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,968
And it was my turn.

538
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,436
It was my turn to say, "You."

539
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,472
And Jin-kyung said "You" during my turn.

540
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,773
That's why she got it wrong.

541
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,108
You think you're so great?

542
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,243
For your reference,

543
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,845
Woo-jae hasn't gotten it wrong yet.

544
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,713
-Wow.
-Yeah, he's smart.

545
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,881
I'm not smart.

546
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,584
Let's try to do something about that.
Let's do it.

547
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,819
-I don't think he'll fall for it.
-I'm not smart.

548
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,855
No, I won't say anything further.

549
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,692
I'm not smart.
These guys are just too dim.

550
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,626
YOU ALREADY SAID IT ALL

551
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,495
He hasn't gotten it wrong yet.

552
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,597
-Let's attack Woo-jae.
-He's a genius.

553
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,432
-Let's attack Woo-jae.
-Yeah, attack Woo-jae.

554
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,602
But this game is
the simplest game we've played this year.

555
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,037
-Ready, go.
-This is the hardest one.

556
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,806
-You start.
-Why him?

557
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,374
-You can't get me.
-Start from her.

558
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,275
Ready, go.

559
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,310
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

560
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,345
Hey.

561
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,312
Hey.

562
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,714
Hey.

563
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,182
ATTACKS WOO-JAE AS PLANNED

564
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,083
Hey.

565
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,551
OF COURSE, HE ISN'T FAZED AT ALL

566
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,986
-Hey.
-You!

567
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,120
-Buster!
-Hey.

568
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,155
You.

569
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,890
-Buster.
-You should say it, Jin-kyung.

570
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:18,824
Why?

571
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,392
Because it's the Buster's turn!

572
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,362
-It's your turn to say "Buster."
-I did it because you didn't.

573
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,364
-You got it wrong too.
-It's because of her.

574
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,366
-Woo-young got it wrong too.
-Geez.

575
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,434
Can the four of them
try doing it without me?

576
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,203
-Can they?
-Shall we?

577
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,539
-I don't think I'll ever get it wrong.
-Go over there.

578
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,508
Can we try an extra round?
But this one doesn't count.

579
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,211
-I really don't think I'll get it wrong.
-Okay.

580
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,680
-All right. Let's do well, guys.
-I'm getting sleepy.

581
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,081
AND SO, A GAME AMONG THEMSELVES BEGINS

582
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,618
-One, two. One, two, three, four.
-Three, four.

583
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,053
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

584
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,821
-Who's going to go first?
-Hey!

585
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,056
You.

586
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,524
You.

587
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,725
Buster.

588
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,527
Buster.

589
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,428
You.

590
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,729
Buster.

591
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,164
Hey!

592
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,132
You!

593
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,734
FLINCHING

594
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,703
LAUGHING

595
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,905
-I'm right, aren't I?
-No.

596
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,807
PURE INNOCENCE

597
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,042
Jin-kyung is so funny.

598
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,076
Jin-kyung was…

599
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,477
EMBARRASSED

600
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,714
Do you know what Jin-kyung did
when it was her turn?

601
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,416
She went like this and started choosing.

602
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,885
-She went like this.
-Her face was…

603
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,588
We were going around
and doing Hey, You Buster but she…

604
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:27,192
AN INTENSE BATTLE OF WITS WITH HERSELF

605
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,895
-Who got it wrong the most?
-This is fun.

606
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,797
This is the current result.

607
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,232
Sook got it wrong four times.

608
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,300
-That's a lot.
-It isn't.

609
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,935
Sae-ho got it wrong three times.

610
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,770
Woo-young got it wrong three times.

611
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,539
Jin-kyung got it wrong 10 times.

612
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,075
-What?
-Gosh, this is…

613
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,043
THE UNMATCHED TALENT!

614
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,813
It's because you couldn't focus, right?

615
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,681
All you have to do is focus.

616
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,251
SO THEY DECIDED TO

617
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,086
TAKE OUT THEIR SECRET WEAPON

618
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,089
TO INCREASE THEIR FOCUS

619
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,693
WITH EVERY DROP OF FOCUS POURED INTO IT

620
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,161
AND WITH 5PM'S PRIDE ON THE LINE

621
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:07,599
AN ALL-OUT MATCH IS ABOUT TO UNFOLD

622
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,501
One, two, three, four.

623
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,769
Hey, you buster

624
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,670
From you.

625
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,939
Hey, you buster
Hey, you buster

626
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:14,973
-Hey.
-You!

627
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,108
Buster!

628
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,075
Buster!

629
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,510
-Hey!
-You!

630
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,878
Buster!

631
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,146
Hey!

632
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,781
SOOK ATTACKS SAE-HO THIS TIME

633
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,682
Hey!

634
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,550
You!

635
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,286
OOPS

636
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,554
Bye, Sae-ho.

637
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,023
-The two of you.
-Why?

638
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,057
Why me?

639
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,425
-He didn't know.
-The two of us

640
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,093
should play a one-on-one 369 game.

641
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,628
-The loser has to clean up.
-Okay.

642
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,597
Shall we just make them
play the Tomato game?

643
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,832
-The Tomato game?
-Let's do the Tomato game.

644
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,801
-What is that?
-To, Ma, To.

645
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,303
We just exchange the syllables like this.

646
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,971
I guarantee that they'll do To, To, Ma.

647
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,307
Ready, go.

648
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,341
-To.
-Ma.

649
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,676
-To.
-Ma.

650
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,777
TO MA TO MA?

651
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,878
-To.
-Ma.

652
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,046
-To.
-Ma.

653
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:54,946
To.

654
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,050
-Come on, man.
-Come on.

655
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,618
Let's try again.

656
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,320
I don't want to do it again!

657
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,722
There's no do-over in this.

658
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,023
Come on, man.

659
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,825
-That was a clean loss.
-Come on.

660
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,061
-No do-overs.
-To, Ma, To, Ma was a clean loss.

661
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,065
-He basically ended the scene.
-Come on.

662
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,633
WHAT A CLEAN ENDING

663
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,802
To, Ma, To, Ma, and then, the scene ended.

664
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,903
Let's go down now.

665
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,004
-Clap the slate.
-Do it.

666
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,572
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

667
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,873
-To, To.
-Ma, Ma.

668
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,774
CLEAN ENDING

669
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,509
AFTER THEIR MEAL
THEY GATHER AT THE STUDIO AGAIN

670
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,510
All right.

671
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,447
Let's continue with
Woo-young's Deconstruction Show.

672
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,351
There is a word that has been
representing you lately, Woo-young.

673
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,954
-What he's doing whenever we call him.
-Mixing?

674
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,489
-Mixing.
-Mixing.

675
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,593
Can you briefly explain what
this mixing incident is about, Woo-jae?

676
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,828
The mixing incident?

677
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,130
Let me explain the mixing incident.

678
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,668
First of all, whenever we contact him,
he says mysteriously,

679
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,070
"I'm mixing." Like a word that's trending.

680
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,807
We heard it so many times
that the word "mixing" stood out to us.

681
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,942
-Yes.
-That's too funny.

682
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,245
We don't know whether he really was mixing

683
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,380
-or not.
-Who knows?

684
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,982
-No matter how many times…
-Whenever I called him,

685
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,650
-he said he's working on a song.
-Yeah.

686
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,552
That's why we prepared this game.

687
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,655
-You made a game?
-It's a game inspired by your mixing life.

688
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,058
It's called Mixing Baby.

689
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,025
Mixing Baby?

690
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,628
-Oh, mixing baby
-Yes.

691
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,765
-From now--
-I think I know what it'll be about.

692
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,769
We're going to show you photos
of virtual children created by AI.

693
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:28,607
These children's faces are a mix
of two celebrities' faces.

694
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,242
-I see.
-Oh.

695
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,977
That's why it's called Mixing Baby?

696
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:35,814
You have to guess
which two people's faces have been mixed.

697
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,616
-Then--
-It's wrong if you only guess one.

698
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,817
You have to guess both.

699
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,921
Then, these are two people
who are of the opposite sex, right?

700
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,090
-Yes, they're all opposite sexes.
-Okay.

701
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,259
This is an individual round.

702
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,561
We'll rank you by the number
of correct answers you get.

703
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,963
From five points to one,
the points will be given

704
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,332
-according to your rank.
-These are hard to guess.

705
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,101
When the game is over,
the first place will

706
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,871
-get an amazing, limited-edition prize.
-Limited?

707
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,106
You may look forward to it.

708
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,042
-Okay.
-Why am I not excited about it at all?

709
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,745
THE LIMITED-EDITION PRIZE
IS REALLY WAITING FOR THEM

710
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,548
There may be someone
who doesn't understand,

711
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,616
so let me give you a practice question.

712
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,851
Show us the baby picture.

713
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,219
Mixing Baby.

714
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,587
How adorable.

715
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,490
-Whose faces have been combined?
-I can totally see the faces.

716
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,192
-Whose faces are in it?
-Isn't it PSY?

717
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,626
I got it. Lee Su-ji.

718
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,161
Lee Su-ji…

719
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,597
LEE SU-JI AND?

720
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,632
-And PSY.
-Okay. Lee Su-ji and PSY.

721
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,701
-That's right.
-Yeah, it's clearly PSY.

722
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,770
-Really?
-That's right. I can tell.

723
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,772
Why was this a practice round?

724
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,007
-Why?
-Gosh.

725
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,242
This is hard.

726
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,845
That's how these questions
will be presented.

727
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:43,482
You can call out "I got it!"
whenever you are ready to guess.

728
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,417
It's only correct if you guess

729
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,252
-both mom and dad correctly.
-This is hard.

730
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,021
One of the parents
is a Screwballs' member.

731
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,423
-Really? Okay.
-I see.

732
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,691
Shall we begin?

733
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,592
-Yes.
-Yes.

734
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,160
WHO ARE THE MOM AND DAD?
SON, DAUGHTER

735
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,127
Woo-jae?

736
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,395
Who are the mom and dad?

737
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,097
The daughter is so cute.

738
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,966
-I think…
-Who looks like that?

739
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,335
-I think I'm the dad.
-Yes, I see Woo-jae.

740
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,336
It's Woo-jae?

741
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,938
-Woo-young.
-Go ahead.

742
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,440
Woo-jae and Song Eun-i.

743
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,341
Wrong.

744
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,109
-I got it.
-Go ahead, Sook.

745
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,978
Woo-jae and Jung Yi-rang.

746
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,846
-Wrong.
-Is Woo-jae in it?

747
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,281
The left one is so me.

748
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,718
Wait, is it Jin-kyung?

749
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,286
The mom is one of you guys.

750
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,221
-What?
-I see. It's Jin-kyung.

751
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,423
-It's Jin-kyung.
-But those aren't my eyes.

752
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,459
-I got it.
-I got it. Jin-kyung and Cha Eun-woo.

753
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,627
-Wrong.
-I got it.

754
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,462
Jin-kyung and G-Dragon.

755
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,030
-Wrong.
-They're both comedians.

756
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:32,964
Comedians?

757
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,600
I got it. Nam Chang-hee and Jin-kyung.

758
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,969
-I got it.
-Sorry. I said they're both comedians.

759
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,438
What? Aren't they both comedians?

760
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,406
Isn't Jin-kyung…

761
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,308
WEREN'T YOU A COMEDIAN?

762
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,976
-What?
-Okay. Woo-jae, go ahead.

763
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,211
Sook and Nam Chang-hee.

764
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,112
Wrong.

765
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,314
That's me?

766
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,849
THEY'RE STRUGGLING FROM THE FIRST QUESTION

767
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,150
Sook is correct, right?

768
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,718
-Yes, Sook is correct.
-What?

769
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,921
I got it. Yoon Jung-soo and Sook?

770
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,821
Wrong.

771
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,190
-Gu Bon-seung and Sook.
-Wrong.

772
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,626
-Who is it?
-Gosh, this is so hard.

773
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,462
-Let's reveal the answer now. Show us.
-That's me?

774
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,566
Go back.

775
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,603
ANSWER: KIM YOUNG-CHUL, KIM SOOK

776
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,673
-You can see his sister's face.
-I see it.

777
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,841
-You can see his sister's face.
-In the right one.

778
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,977
The son's face should have been longer.

779
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,512
She's right.

780
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,980
-The right one is like him.
-Yeah.

781
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,149
-How interesting.
-This is really hard.

782
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,116
-It's fun.
-Next one.

783
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,585
Moving onto the next one.

784
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,588
QUESTION NUMBER 2

785
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,156
I got it.

786
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,558
-Jin-kyung and Park Myung-soo.
-Wrong.

787
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,727
-Is it me?
-No, it's me.

788
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,195
I can see me.

789
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,697
-Woo-young?
-Yeah, it's me.

790
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,798
-Is it Woo-young?
-No.

791
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,666
-I don't think it's Woo-young.
-Is it Sae-ho?

792
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,935
I got it. Jin-kyung…

793
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,172
and Park Myung-soo.

794
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,306
You already said that.

795
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,975
I just said that?

796
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,276
IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN 30 SECONDS

797
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,712
-You said Jin-kyung and Park Myung-soo.
-Yes?

798
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,046
That's wrong.

799
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,581
I THINK WE'RE ALMOST THERE

800
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,917
I got it. Sook and Park Myung-soo.

801
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,385
That's correct.

802
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,554
SON, DAUGHTER

803
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,856
Those are Myung-soo's wrinkles.

804
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,057
POWERFUL FROWN LINES

805
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,660
-But I don't see Sook.
-Where is Sook in those photos?

806
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,796
I used to be pretty like that daughter
when I was young.

807
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,231
What happened to you?

808
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,367
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED

809
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,668
Moving on.

810
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,571
THESE CHILDREN LOOK TOUGH

811
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,039
-How cute.
-How cute.

812
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,507
Kids like these are the cutest.

813
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,676
-Look at how cute the daughter is.
-Yeah.

814
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,777
I got it.

815
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,345
Jin-kyung and Kang Ho-dong.

816
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,080
No.

817
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,250
HE LOOKS PRETTY STRONG

818
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,819
-I got it. Jin-kyung and Ma Dong-seok.
-That's correct.

819
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,754
That's correct.

820
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,888
It was Ma Dong-seok.

821
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,657
I can see Dong-seok.

822
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,759
-It wasn't Sae-ho?
-There are some hints.

823
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,428
-Yeah. There is.
-There are hints if you look carefully.

824
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,829
Let's move on to the next one.

825
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,567
-Choo Sung-hoon.
-It's Choo Sung-hoon.

826
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,003
-I got it. Jin-kyung and Choo Sung-hoon.
-Correct.

827
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,639
I'LL DEFINITELY LOSE
TO THE OFFSPRING OF CHOO SUNG-HOON

828
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,974
You're good at this.

829
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,244
Who's this?

830
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,513
Hang on.

831
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,014
THESE CHILDREN LOOK STYLISH

832
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,182
I got it.

833
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,717
Sook and Car, the Garden.

834
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,985
Yeah, kind of.

835
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,219
WELL-KNOWN HAIRY GUY WITH A FULL BEARD

836
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,722
-Wrong.
-I got it. Jin-kyung and Car, the Garden.

837
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,157
-Wrong.
-What?

838
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,291
IS IT NOT CAR, THE GARDEN?

839
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,294
I got it. Ko Chang-seok and Sook.

840
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,429
Correct.

841
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,532
SON, DAUGHTER

842
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,702
Yeah, that is Ko Chang-seok. You're right.

843
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,804
You can see it. It gives you hints.

844
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,172
-So funny.
-Here's the next one.

845
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,407
I wish I could get at least one.

846
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,745
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE A FREE SPIRIT

847
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,879
Is it me?

848
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,114
THE BLEACHED HAIR AND THE BEARD
ARE THE HINTS

849
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,649
-I got it.
-It's Sae-ho.

850
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,418
-Who is it?
-No, it could be Sae-ho.

851
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,153
-Yoo Byung-jae and…
-What?

852
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,054
Jin-kyung.

853
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,556
SON, DAUGHTER

854
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,125
REASONABLE APPROACH!

855
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,061
-Wrong.
-Yoo Byung-jae and Sook.

856
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:50,995
Correct.

857
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,197
I was going to say Sook.

858
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,899
-You got it from me, right?
-I did.

859
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,068
-Yoo Byung-jae and me?
-I can see it.

860
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,403
You can see it.

861
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,038
Here's the next one.

862
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,440
Who is that?

863
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,942
What the heck? Why is the daughter…

864
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,477
-It's Sae-ho.
-The eyes…

865
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,913
I can see the person's face
from the daughter. Who is it?

866
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:10,882
WHO IS THAT?

867
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:11,816
Who is that?

868
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,253
Our producers guessed it immediately
because of the daughter.

869
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,387
The daughter?

870
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:17,956
The daughter.

871
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,824
SON, DAUGHTER

872
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,793
-Who is it?
-I got it. Sae-ho and Cho Hye-lyun.

873
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,694
That's incorrect.

874
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,129
Woo-young and Cho Hye-lyun.

875
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:25,764
Wrong.

876
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,031
IS IT NOT HYE-LYUN?

877
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,568
-They guessed it because of the daughter?
-Is it Jin-kyung?

878
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,071
I can see the face from the daughter.

879
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,639
Is it Hye-seon?

880
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,208
-I see Sae-ho too.
-I got it.

881
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,409
Sae-ho and Kim Hye-seon.

882
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:39,878
Wrong.

883
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,112
Woo-young and Kim Hye-seon.

884
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,781
-Wrong.
-I got it.

885
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,816
Woo-jae and Kim Hye-seon.

886
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,985
That's right.

887
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,387
HE GOT HIS ANSWER STOLEN AGAIN

888
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,023
SHE GOT ALL OF MOM'S MANLY ENERGY

889
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,192
Hey, you can't even
recognize your own daughter?

890
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,928
-I wasn't even close.
-Can't you recognize your own daughter?

891
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,496
Here's the next one.

892
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,832
NEXT QUESTION

893
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,067
Wait. I can see the face.

894
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,803
Oh, is that…

895
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,571
I got it. Sae-ho and Shin Gi-ru.

896
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,073
-Wrong.
-I got it. Woo-young and Shin Gi-ru.

897
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,341
That's correct.

898
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,510
SHE STOLE ANOTHER ONE

899
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,180
You can totally see Gi-ru's face, right?

900
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,181
LOOK CAREFULLY
THERE ARE TONS OF HINTS

901
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,185
NEXT QUESTION

902
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,719
WHO IS THAT?

903
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,055
-I've seen those lips before.
-Yeah, you're right.

904
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,090
I'VE SEEN THOSE LIPS BEFORE

905
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,127
-I've seen those lips before.
-Whose lips are those?

906
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,762
-They look very familiar, right?
-Yes.

907
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,931
Whose lips are those?

908
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,600
I got it. Jin-kyung and P.O?

909
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,403
-I can see P.O.
-Right? Can you see him too?

910
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,071
Wrong.

911
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,706
It's a model and comedian couple.

912
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,874
It must be Jin-kyung.

913
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,576
LET ME SEE

914
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,544
-Chang-hee and Jin-kyung.
-Me and Yang Se-chan.

915
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,546
-Chang-hee and Jin-kyung.
-Me and Yang Se-chan.

916
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,615
-Who did you say, Jin-kyung?
-Yang Se-chan.

917
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,016
-And?
-Hong Jin-kyung.

918
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,885
-That's correct.
-That's Se-chan's lips.

919
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,086
-It's Se-chan's mouth.
-I see.

920
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,590
-I thought those lips looked familiar.
-I knew I've seen those lips.

921
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,293
As a way of taking a break,
shall we try to guess our members--

922
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,561
-Among ourselves?
-Okay.

923
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,730
-I didn't guess any.
-Here it is.

924
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,966
SON, DAUGHTER

925
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,801
-I got it.
-Woo-jae.

926
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,302
-Sae-ho and Sook.
-No.

927
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,637
-Wrong.
-I got it.

928
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,672
Woo-jae and Jin-kyung.

929
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:15,840
-Wrong.
-I got it.

930
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,609
-Sae-ho and Jin-kyung.
-Correct.

931
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,509
CORRECT

932
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,712
-You see, that's your hat.
-You're right.

933
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,447
It's the one from your profile photo.

934
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,182
JIN-KYUNG IS WEARING SAE-HO'S HAT

935
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,351
-So that's how you guess them.
-You're right.

936
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,152
Your son and daughter are cute.

937
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,388
Interesting.

938
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,490
Let's make it a little more difficult.

939
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,592
-You guys aren't in these at all.
-Okay.

940
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,594
-This may be a bit hard.
-This requires skill.

941
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,296
-It'll be fun from now.
-Yeah.

942
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,299
NEXT QUESTION

943
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,301
THEY LOOK VERY MISCHIEVOUS

944
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,402
I got it.

945
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,104
Kang Jae-jun and Lee Eun-hyung.

946
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,639
Wrong.

947
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,840
I see Eun-hyung though.

948
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,709
Whose eyes are those?

949
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,810
Is the right one Nucksal?

950
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,612
-Was one of them correct?
-Looks like Nucksal.

951
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,347
Didn't I guess one of them right?

952
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,248
-No comment.
-No.

953
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,850
I got it. Nucksal and Lee Eun-hyung.

954
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,985
-Correct.
-Okay.

955
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,554
You could clearly see Nucksal.

956
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,223
-And the eyes were Eun-hyung's.
-Yeah.

957
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,191
Gosh, I don't think I can guess these.

958
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,293
Here's the last one.

959
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,260
-Okay.
-Okay.

960
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,263
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE CLOSE TO SOOK

961
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,832
Well, I think I know one of them.

962
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,868
-Song Eun-i.
-Yeah, it's Song Eun-i.

963
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,003
It's definitely Eun-i,
but who's the pretty one?

964
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,738
I got it. Song Eun-i and Kim Je-dong.

965
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,807
-Wrong.
-I got it.

966
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,809
Jung Hae-in and Song Eun-i.

967
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,611
-Wrong.
-I got it. Song Eun-i and Yu Jae-seok.

968
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,112
Song Eun-i and Kim Young-chul.

969
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,447
You're almost there.

970
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,115
I got it. Song Eun-i and Ji Sang-ryeol.

971
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,684
SON, DAUGHTER

972
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,519
-Correct.
-Wow!

973
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,087
Wow. I see it though.

974
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,822
I see Sang-ryeol's face.

975
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,891
-Yeah.
-How did you guess that?

976
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,292
Can't you see it?

977
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,462
Sook is doing an excellent job.

978
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,396
-I know.
-It's so hard.

979
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,699
-I have an eye for this.
-Yes, you do.

980
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,367
These are the results.

981
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,902
-Sook.
-Yes?

982
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,237
You guessed five correctly.

983
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,039
-Yes!
-You guessed a lot.

984
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,708
Woo-jae guessed three correctly.

985
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,776
Sae-ho guessed three correctly.

986
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,144
Hey, you tied.

987
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,479
Jin-kyung guessed one correctly.

988
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,216
-Woo-young didn't guess any correctly.
-You didn't get any?

989
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,784
But you like mixing so much.

990
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,153
I won't ever do mixing again.

991
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,689
-Don't lie to us.
-You've been mixing for seven years.

992
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,057
My goodness.

993
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,928
WORK HARDER ON MIXING

994
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,331
This will be the last game for
Woo-young's Deconstruction Show.

995
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,034
You're an 18-year veteran K-pop idol,
Woo-young.

996
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,170
-You worked longer than Woo-jae.
-I'm the youngest here.

997
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,872
-Based on the year you debuted.
-Yes.

998
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,075
Our star Woo-young
was sensational around the world.

999
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,745
Do you have a secret
to your long-running success?

1000
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,147
Well…

1001
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,184
Can you please speak faster?

1002
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,020
-Write it down for us later.
-Okay.

1003
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,521
-Get it in text form.
-Okay.

1004
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,756
-That would be better.
-Yes.

1005
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,457
-I'd feel more at ease with that.
-Yeah.

1006
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,260
The thing is that
many stars end up in trouble

1007
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,929
-when their private lives…
-They were exposed.

1008
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,565
-…are photographed.
-Yes, that's right.

1009
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,435
How have you never been caught

1010
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,804
for the past 18 years as a celebrity?

1011
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,572
I blocked them well.

1012
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,074
I BLOCKED THEM WELL

1013
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,144
-Sometimes they don't get blocked so well.
-That is true.

1014
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,148
Well, this is a very personal story,

1015
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,583
but I spent all the money I saved on that.

1016
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,519
To block all of that.

1017
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,454
-Is that why?
-Yes.

1018
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,657
A star like Woo-young,
who is loved by the public,

1019
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,459
can be cast aside in an instant

1020
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,528
-if they're caught up in some controversy.
-Yes.

1021
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,063
The reason why Woo-young was
able to be a long-running idol is

1022
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,233
-because he did "this" well.
-This?

1023
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,902
-What is it?
-This game is…

1024
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,172
-The title seems very grandiose.
-What are you trying to connect it to?

1025
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,276
This game is called Avoid the Paparazzi.

1026
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,811
That's what you ended up with?

1027
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,712
You will each take turns

1028
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,514
-being a paparazzi.
-Okay.

1029
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,283
The person who becomes the paparazzi

1030
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,651
will wear a blindfold

1031
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,885
and rely on their five senses

1032
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:51,022
to take photos of the other members.

1033
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,459
When the game starts,
you may move around freely within the box.

1034
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,627
Then, the paparazzi will say, "Stop!"

1035
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,930
At that moment, the others have to stop

1036
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,932
and look towards the paparazzi.

1037
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,568
The paparazzi will move three steps.

1038
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,603
After moving three steps,

1039
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,505
they will take the paparazzi cut.

1040
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,739
TAKING THE PAPARAZZI CUT

1041
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,841
EACH PAPARAZZI GETS 3 SHOTS!

1042
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,611
If we can recognize the face
of the person that is in the picture,

1043
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,947
that person will get one point

1044
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,483
-deducted.
-I see. Okay.

1045
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,851
PAPARAZZI ORDER

1046
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,219
1 JIN-KYUNG 2 SAE-HO
3 WOO-JAE 4 SOOK 5 WOO-YOUNG

1047
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,488
HONGPARAZZI IS STARTING OFF

1048
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,225
MOVING SILENTLY

1049
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,527
GETTING READY TO
TOY WITH HER FROM UNDER HER NOSE

1050
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:33,231
Jin-kyung, you may call out
"Start" and "Stop" three times each.

1051
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,500
GIGGLE

1052
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,135
Ready, go.

1053
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,336
HONGPARAZZI STARTS TAKING PHOTOS

1054
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,341
WHAT'S ON HER CELL PHONE'S SCREEN

1055
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,144
Excuse me, but can you
do the "Start" first?

1056
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,179
HE ALMOST HAD TO RETIRE

1057
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,614
You can't say "Stop"

1058
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,482
-when you haven't started.
-Yeah, start first.

1059
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,318
She has to say "Start" first but…

1060
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,888
STARTING FOR REAL

1061
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,892
UH OH!

1062
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,195
SHE SAID STOP AS SOON AS
HE TAPPED HER FROM BEHIND

1063
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,731
SHE CAN MOVE 3 STEPS NOW

1064
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,299
NERVOUS, NERVOUS

1065
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,400
You can take three steps.

1066
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,872
APPROACHING THE VETERAN IDOL

1067
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,742
HE'S A TOP STAR AFTER ALL

1068
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,380
BUT SHE CAN'T GET THE DIRECTION RIGHT

1069
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,584
WAS SHE ABLE TO CAPTURE HIS PRIVATE LIFE?

1070
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,924
THE STARS ENJOY THEIR PRIVATE LIVES AGAIN

1071
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,263
HE EXPOSES HIS LOCATION
WHILE TRYING TO MOCK HER

1072
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,232
WHY DID YOU COME THIS WAY?

1073
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,873
SHE MOVES TOWARDS SAE-HO!

1074
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,176
TAKING A SUPER CLOSEUP SHOT

1075
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,753
SHE WALKS STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE SOUND

1076
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,891
SHE'LL RUN INTO THEM AT THIS RATE!

1077
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,630
WILL WOO-JAE'S PRIVATE LIFE
GET EXPOSED TOO?

1078
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,531
It's over.

1079
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,301
-Why did you hide behind me?
-No, I didn't.

1080
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,036
-All right.
-Please!

1081
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,037
-Please!
-The first one.

1082
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,239
-The first one.
-Not my face.

1083
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,139
It was Woo-young.

1084
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,674
She got it exactly.

1085
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,743
BEAST-LIKE IDOL WANDERS ABOUT
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE

1086
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,845
Do you know what's scary, Jin-kyung?

1087
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,914
-She turned around all of a sudden.
-She lifted it.

1088
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,649
She lifted it like this all of a sudden.

1089
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,917
It was so freaky.

1090
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,785
She was pointing at his butt first.

1091
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:35,920
PROUD TO GET A SCOOP

1092
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,056
SHE WAS RIGHT UNDER THEIR NOSE
IN THE SECOND ONE

1093
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,293
WAS SHE ABLE TO TAKE A DECENT PHOTO?

1094
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,527
Next.

1095
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,896
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1096
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,601
-I got him right in the face.
-Shouldn't we protect him?

1097
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:51,502
REVEALING EVEN HIS PORES

1098
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,537
-This is too funny.
-So funny.

1099
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,773
CHO SAE-HO LOSES 1 POINT

1100
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,974
-Next.
-Next.

1101
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,242
Woo-jae.

1102
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:03,414
WHILE HE WAS TOYING WITH HER,
WOO-JAE RAN INTO HONGPARAZZI

1103
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,615
-Next.
-Next.

1104
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,583
Woo-jae.

1105
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,084
-Come on.
-No.

1106
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,387
-What's this?
-She must have gotten you

1107
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,821
instead of Woo-jae earlier.

1108
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,057
-I think this is my hair.
-Your hair.

1109
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,792
You're right.

1110
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,161
You see, Sae-ho tried to
hide behind him, so I scolded him.

1111
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,062
He got caught.

1112
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,130
Geez.

1113
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,231
-Serves you right.
-Okay.

1114
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,168
HE TRIED TO HIDE BEHIND WOO-JAE
WHOM SHE RAN INTO

1115
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,004
CAUGHT WHILE TRYING TO BE SNEAKY

1116
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,507
-Serves you right.
-Sae-ho got caught twice.

1117
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,941
-Congrats.
-Sae-ho's turn.

1118
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,243
-You did a great job.
-Sae-ho.

1119
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,277
What a shame.

1120
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,646
IT'S CHOPARAZZI'S TIME TO COLLECT PHOTOS

1121
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,923
HIS FIVE SENSES OPERATE ON FULL CAPACITY

1122
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,059
WHERE SHOULD I GO

1123
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,496
HE TAKES A STEP TOWARDS SOOK

1124
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,732
HELP

1125
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,902
LOOKING AROUND

1126
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,410
LAUGHING

1127
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,145
CHOPARAZZI'S CLOSEUP SHOT

1128
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,080
Did I get someone?

1129
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,653
THE STARS ENJOY THEIR PRIVATE LIVES AGAIN

1130
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,023
SHE LOWERS HERSELF TO HIDE THIS TIME

1131
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,062
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS BEHIND ME

1132
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,835
IS IT ME AGAIN?

1133
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,472
CHOPARAZZI GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER

1134
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,743
SHE FALLS BACKWARDS
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SCREAM

1135
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,978
I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING FROM HERE

1136
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,017
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH

1137
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,620
SHE ENDS UP BURSTING OUT LAUGHING

1138
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,389
What? Is it Sook?

1139
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,292
SHE TAKES IT OUT ON INNOCENT WOO-YOUNG

1140
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,932
THEY TRY TO HIDE BEHIND EACH OTHER

1141
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,770
MEANWHILE, THE TWO MODELS
FOLLOW CHOPARAZZI CLOSELY

1142
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,708
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE

1143
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,682
ARE THE TWO MODELS HIS TARGET THIS TIME?

1144
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,488
AGAIN?

1145
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,792
DID HE PUT A GPS ON HER?

1146
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,662
What the heck? Is it you again? What?

1147
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,098
-What the heck is going on?
-Hang on.

1148
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,599
What's up with him?

1149
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,368
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

1150
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,837
-He is so annoying.
-Gosh.

1151
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,540
-Let's check the photos.
-This makes no sense.

1152
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,674
Here's the first photo.

1153
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,377
It's Sook.

1154
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,147
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL,
LOOKING INTO KIM SOOK'S LIFE

1155
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,717
Why did he take that photo from so close?

1156
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,754
He must have lost his mind.

1157
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,756
-Why did you only take photos of me?
-I know.

1158
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,158
The picture is gradually coming together.

1159
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,093
I got three points deducted all at once.

1160
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,462
KIM SOOK ALONE GOT 3 POINTS DEDUCTED

1161
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,598
IT'S JOOPARAZZI'S TURN TO TAKE PHOTOS

1162
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,534
STAR SOOK DEVELOPED SOCIAL ANXIETY NOW

1163
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,042
I heard something here and here.

1164
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,411
AT RISK!

1165
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,217
NOT EVEN ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BREATH

1166
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,488
You can't use your hands.

1167
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,922
-Okay.
-No using hands.

1168
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,824
But it's okay if you bump into them.

1169
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,427
LETTING IT SLIDE JUST ONCE

1170
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,398
HIS INVESTIGATION STARTS UP AGAIN

1171
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,341
THEY EXPOSE THEIR LOCATION WHILE TUSSLING

1172
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,480
HE ATTEMPTS TO TAKE PHOTOS
WHERE SAE-HO AND JIN-KYUNG ARE

1173
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,852
SWINGING HIS HEAD AROUND

1174
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,654
ACTING LIKE HE'S BUMPING INTO THEM

1175
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,090
THE MASTER OF USING TRICKS

1176
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,491
I heard something.

1177
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,563
TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH SAE-HO TWICE IN A ROW

1178
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,769
JOOPARAZZI LOOKS VERY RELAXED

1179
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,704
GO AWAY

1180
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,410
YOU HAVE TO FACE THE PAPARAZZI

1181
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,383
GOING TO PHOTOGRAPH YOU 3 TIMES IN A ROW

1182
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:38,255
USES THE ACCIDENTAL BUMP TACTIC

1183
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,190
I bumped into him by accident.
It's an accident.

1184
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,026
He's shameless.

1185
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,027
Is it Jin-kyung?

1186
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,662
WHY DO YOU KEEP COMING AFTER ME?

1187
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,564
That's it. I got three.

1188
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,498
That's it.

1189
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,266
-Isn't it so annoying, Sae-ho?
-Hey.

1190
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,334
You kept following me.

1191
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,136
-You were like that too.
-Really?

1192
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,171
-You kept following Sae-ho.
-Really?

1193
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,707
He may not have gotten any photos.
He was too close.

1194
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,808
He may not have taken any.

1195
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,410
-Sae-ho was--
-Here's the first one.

1196
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,713
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1197
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,281
CHO SAE-HO'S BEST ANGLE HOWEVER…

1198
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,749
I really did a great job with that.

1199
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,818
It looks like he took that photo for you.

1200
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,719
The second one.

1201
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:09,954
Post this on your Insta.

1202
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,124
SADLY, HE DIDN'T GET HIS FACE
SO IT DOESN'T COUNT

1203
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,159
This is clearly Sae-ho.

1204
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,660
You can see half of his body.

1205
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,028
-The third one.
-So close.

1206
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,130
I was able to avoid it.

1207
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,865
You kept trying to attack me.

1208
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,634
That was so close.

1209
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,503
Ready.

1210
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,738
4TH ROUND SOOKPARAZZI

1211
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:28,939
Set.

1212
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,908
TIME FOR REVENGE, SAE-HO

1213
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,710
Go.

1214
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,381
MAKING A WRONG GUESS

1215
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,782
USING DISRUPTING TACTIC

1216
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,287
WOO-JAE WHO IS RIGHT BEHIND HER

1217
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,523
AND SAE-HO WHO IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

1218
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,492
SOOK'S CELL PHONE SCREEN

1219
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,861
SHE CAN MOVE 3 STEPS NOW

1220
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,830
SLIDING

1221
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,532
MOVING TO THE WRONG PLACE

1222
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,035
PHEW WE'RE SAFE

1223
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,674
Can I take the photo now?

1224
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,542
You may take the photo.

1225
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,348
I took it.

1226
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,916
DID SHE GET THE K-POP STAR?

1227
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,388
THE STARS MOVE AROUND AGAIN

1228
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,562
THE THREE SUPERSTARS ARE STANDING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF SOOKPARAZZI

1229
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,735
THE K-POP STAR IS AT RISK
OF BEING CAUGHT AGAIN!

1230
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,840
FORTUNATELY, SHE DIDN'T NOTICE HIM

1231
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,247
IS SHE CAPTURING
JIN-KYUNG'S PRIVATE LIFE NOW?

1232
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,148
I took it.

1233
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,155
RUN

1234
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,897
THE TWO STARS ARE CAUGHT ON HER SCREEN

1235
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,566
I think someone's here.

1236
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,368
IS IT FINALLY TIME FOR REVENGE?

1237
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,039
THE K-POP STAR FACES
AN UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBER OF CRISES

1238
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,209
HE GOT NERVOUS AS WELL

1239
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,411
I took it.

1240
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:15,946
I got three photos.

1241
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,882
-Let's take a look at the photos.
-Did I get any?

1242
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,385
-Hey.
-Who's that?

1243
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,286
-Woo-young.
-Who?

1244
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,854
-It's Woo-young.
-Woo-young.

1245
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,556
Anyone can tell that it's Woo-young.

1246
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,157
I got you, Woo-young.

1247
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,026
Deduct a point from Camera Director too.

1248
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,561
We're in it together.

1249
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,895
Yeah, Woo-young.

1250
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,230
-Where did I take it from?
-Next.

1251
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,799
THE SECOND EXCLUSIVE

1252
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,001
-Jin-kyung.
-That is such a clear shot of her.

1253
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,503
It really is a clear shot.

1254
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:40,904
Next.

1255
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,339
-Wow!
-What a relief!

1256
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,907
-This one.
-I got them.

1257
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,342
Yeah, this one.

1258
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,577
Who's that up there?

1259
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,045
Hey, that's my arm.

1260
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,279
But his face isn't showing.

1261
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,116
-Yeah, I knew someone was in front of me.
-You can't see his face.

1262
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,585
SHE WAS SO CLOSE BUT DIDN'T GET HIS FACE

1263
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,420
I think someone's here.

1264
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,089
PHEW

1265
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,091
I got everybody.

1266
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,760
We all got a point deducted.

1267
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,763
YOUNGPARAZZI IS READY

1268
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,664
I can't use my hands, right?

1269
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,269
USING TRICKS

1270
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,371
Go forward.

1271
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,373
-Can I start?
-Go forward?

1272
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,212
IF I GET YOU, YOU'RE RUINED

1273
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,351
TRIES TO GET SAE-HO

1274
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,389
FLINCHING

1275
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,727
ENCOUNTERS YOUNGPARAZZI UP CLOSE

1276
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,765
HE GETS CLOSER WITH EACH STEP

1277
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,872
Did Sae-ho always smell bad like this?

1278
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,040
I SMELL SOMETHING BAD HERE

1279
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,610
UNPLEASANT SMELL, UNPLEASANT SIGHT

1280
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,245
DISGUSTING

1281
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,484
HERE YOU ARE

1282
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,389
HE'S USING TRICKS IN A NEW WAY

1283
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,159
STAR CHO SUCCEEDS IN ESCAPING

1284
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,937
HIS TARGET IS STAR JOO THIS TIME

1285
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,040
You can't use your hands.

1286
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,741
HE'S USING HIS NOSE INSTEAD OF HIS HANDS

1287
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,479
NERVOUS

1288
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,650
WEIGHING HIS OPTIONS
BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS

1289
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,086
AVOIDING HIM

1290
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,324
LIKE A BEAST,
HIS FIVE SENSES ARE WELL-DEVELOPED

1291
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:45,295
QUICKLY ESCAPING

1292
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,499
ARE THEY BEHIND ME?

1293
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,742
THE TWO MODELS ARE CAUGHT ON HIS RADAR

1294
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,813
DETECTS THEM WITH ANIMAL-LIKE SENSES

1295
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,149
TURNS ON HIS OLFACTORY SENSOR

1296
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,486
ATTEMPTING TO TAKE A SUPER CLOSE SHOT

1297
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,555
YOUNGPARAZZI ENDS HIS INVESTIGATION

1298
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,423
Man, you really used your senses.

1299
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,092
You knew it was me, didn't you?

1300
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,860
Let's see the first photo.

1301
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,262
REVEALING YOUNGPARAZZI'S EXCLUSIVE

1302
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,963
He's in many photos.

1303
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:21,632
He's in many photos.

1304
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,200
Sorry, Sae-ho.

1305
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,936
-I'm sorry, Sae-ho.
-You got me.

1306
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,905
You went to the dermatologist today.

1307
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:28,939
The second photo.

1308
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:29,873
THE SECOND EXCLUSIVE

1309
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,541
-It's Woo-jae.
-It's Woo-jae.

1310
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,477
This one doesn't count.

1311
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,479
-It's clearly Woo-jae.
-If only I turned my body…

1312
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,781
Yeah, you should have turned your body.

1313
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:38,916
Third photo.

1314
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:39,950
LAST EXCLUSIVE

1315
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,986
-Hey! It's Jin-kyung and Sook!
-Hey!

1316
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,221
Two birds, one stone.

1317
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,188
WHY AM I THERE?

1318
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,991
-Jin-kyung, Sook, and Sae-ho.
-Hey.

1319
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,360
-How did you take that?
-How did you do that?

1320
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,129
-How did you get me?
-Awesome.

1321
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,297
That's awesome.

1322
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,831
Here are the scores.

1323
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,033
-Sook.
-Yes.

1324
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,401
-I was in a lot of photos.
-Yeah.

1325
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,869
-Four times.
-Four shots.

1326
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,504
-You were in four shots.
-That's a lot.

1327
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,540
-You took three shots of me, Sae-ho.
-If I only turned…

1328
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,008
SORRY

1329
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,344
And Jin-kyung,
you had two photos taken of you.

1330
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,446
-Not bad.
-You had two photos taken.

1331
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,815
-You avoided it well.
-Sae-ho, there are five shots of you.

1332
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,417
-Congratulations.
-Gosh.

1333
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,786
-Congrats. You're the best shot of today.
-I'm in a lot.

1334
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,387
WELL, AIN'T HE A SUPERSTAR

1335
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,024
Woo-young was in two shots.

1336
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,592
-You avoided it well.
-Yeah.

1337
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,861
-Woo-jae, you were in one shot.
-Yes!

1338
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,763
Wow. What the heck?

1339
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,765
Let me announce the final ranking.

1340
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,000
As I said before,

1341
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,070
there is a limited-edition prize at stake.

1342
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,771
I think I'm in last place.

1343
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,007
-You're tied for last place.
-Jin-kyung and me?

1344
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,275
It's Sae-ho and Woo-young.

1345
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,543
SAE-HO AND WOO-YOUNG ARE BOTH LAST PLACE

1346
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,044
It's because I had many shots taken.

1347
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,113
TIED FOR LAST PLACE TOGETHER

1348
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,047
That's an honor too.

1349
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,515
Third place.

1350
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,284
-Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

1351
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,553
I'm satisfied with it.

1352
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,656
Now, it's between Sook and Woo-jae.

1353
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,125
I hope the person next to me
is in first place.

1354
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,893
I hope I can be in first place.

1355
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,662
Sook got a lot right earlier.

1356
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,732
-Congratulations. Today's winner is…
-But I was in many shots.

1357
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:02,632
-…Woo-jae.
-I wonder.

1358
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,201
1ST PLACE JOO WOO-JAE.

1359
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,970
What's the limited-edition prize?
What is it?

1360
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,472
-Gosh, Woo-jae.
-I'm curious.

1361
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,240
He always comes in first.

1362
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,775
I'm curious what the prize is.

1363
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:16,013
And so, Woo-jae showed off his talent
as an idol and came in first.

1364
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,949
Today's prize is
from the eternal idol of Screwballs.

1365
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,751
-Woo-young?
-Woo-young's soul itself.

1366
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,387
The masterpiece that was born
after endless mixing.

1367
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,623
IT CAN'T BE

1368
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,525
-Limited edition.
-An autographed CD.

1369
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,294
You get Woo-young's solo album.

1370
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,262
Do I get an autograph?

1371
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,797
You get one right now.

1372
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,666
-I have this at home.
-This is a really limited one.

1373
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,769
-I have one at home too.
-This is a really limited one.

1374
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:39,870
Is it "Simple Dance"?

1375
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,772
This is a new one called "Think Too Much."

1376
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,206
His name is Woo-jae.

1377
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,908
Spelled like the Korean word for annoying.

1378
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:45,842
He's annoying?

1379
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,544
-No, just Woo-jae.
-Okay. Woo-jae.

1380
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,413
WOO-JAE, LOVE YOU
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WOO-YOUNG

1381
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,581
"Woo-jae, love you. What are you doing?"

1382
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,784
CAN'T GIVE UP ON TRYING TO BE FUNNY

1383
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,286
Thank you for letting me
give this to Woo-jae.

1384
00:50:56,353 --> 00:51:01,058
-Congrats.
-I should be giving this to everyone here.

1385
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,559
-But it's a limited edition.
-Yes.

1386
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,593
REFUSES WITH KIND WORDS

1387
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,762
There are a lot of photos in this.

1388
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:06,863
How do you feel?

1389
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,632
-How do I feel?
-You must be so happy.

1390
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,734
-Of course. It's a limited edition.
-So happy.

1391
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,835
Aren't you so happy?

1392
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,769
HE CAN'T EXPRESS HOW HAPPY HE IS

1393
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,037
Try to look happy, man.

1394
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,672
-Smile.
-Yeah, smile.

1395
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,574
I've been dancing and playing games

1396
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,975
for about five hours,

1397
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,711
but I got such a nice gift.

1398
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,581
Try to look up and smile, Woo-jae.

1399
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,917
I really like the song "Think Too Much."

1400
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,252
-I'll listen to it even more.
-Congrats.

1401
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,289
-Congrats.
-We are happy that you are

1402
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,424
happy about it as we expected.

1403
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,325
Congratulations.

1404
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,527
CONGRATS

1405
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,197
Woo-young, can you tell us
how you felt about this episode?

1406
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,566
When I became the star,

1407
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,567
I felt like

1408
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,336
I became someone really amazing.

1409
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,839
-You don't know what to do with yourself.
-That's right.

1410
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,041
I would like to be able to
show my gratitude

1411
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,709
when the time is right

1412
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,711
and my circumstances allow--

1413
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,846
How about our team dinner?

1414
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,481
-To thank you all--
-Treat us to dinner.

1415
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,585
Let me check my time again

1416
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,221
-with my manager--
-You have to check again?

1417
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,123
-I'm sick and tired of this.
-Also…

1418
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,824
-Do you have a 2PM group chat?
-Yeah.

1419
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,192
-To message each other?
-Yeah.

1420
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:13,230
-Why don't you send our short-form video…
-Okay.

1421
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,598
-…and type three words.
-What?

1422
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,699
Bring it on.

1423
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,234
BRING IT ON

1424
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,635
Yeah, send "Bring it on."

1425
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,504
Nice!

1426
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,472
-I'll work harder. I'll be back.
-Woo-young.

1427
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,673
I'll be back!

1428
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,010
On the next episode of Screwballs.

1429
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,946
Very nice to meet you.
Thank you very much.

1430
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,115
We will now begin the Cho Sae-ho Show.

1431
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,450
LAUNCHING THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

1432
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,453
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

1433
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,288
SAE-HO OVEREXERTS HIMSELF

1434
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,423
The Cho Sae-ho Show is very charming.

1435
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,192
That's all for the Cho Sae-ho Show.

1436
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,327
See you again. Goodbye!

1437
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,630
-But the Cho Sae-ho show is fun.
-Don't go!

1438
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,165
My throat hurts so much.

1439
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,003
HE POURED OUT EVERYTHING HE GOT
IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS

1440
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,839
Gosh, Sook. I brought 200 won.

1441
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,542
Sae-ho, why did you leave us?

1442
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,177
Gosh, Sae-ho.

1443
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,378
PLEASE ACCEPT MY BOW, SAE-HO

1444
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,880
Who would bow like that?

SAE-HO'S TIME OF ORDEAL

1446
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,483
Let's all give him a glass.

1447
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,785
Geez. You don't put
things like these in a coffin.

1448
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,786
STEALING HIS BELONGINGS

1449
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,755
THE ENDLESS ATTEMPTS AT GOING TOO FAR

1450
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,856
You haven't forgotten me?

1451
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,658
Yes, you may kiss me.

1452
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:15,959
Why are you laughing?

1453
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,627
Hey, he died.

1454
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,462
-How could you laugh?
-What's wrong with you?

1455
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,965
