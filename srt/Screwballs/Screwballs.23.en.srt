1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,070
Authorities confirmed that Ms. Kim Na-bak
of the beloved girl group, doLIVE,

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,873
has been missing for some time.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,577
So you volunteered to look into
the unprecedented kidnapping of an idol.

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,580
You'll have to find all the hidden clues
and uncover the truths

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,181
to get to the bottom of this case

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,318
and find the missing Kim Na-bak.

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:19,986
THUS BEGAN THE INVESTIGATION

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,821
The orange ones are for music shows.

9
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,358
THE MONTHLY PLANNER
DREW THE HEROES' SUSPICION

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,426
Hey, just a second.

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,028
-What is it?
-We have a D.

12
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,095
-That's what you see?
-Yeah.

13
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,730
-They must form an alphabet each.
-It's an N!

14
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,798
AN "N" FROM THE LESSONS

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,866
We then get "dance."

16
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,467
That's it. "Dance."

17
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,869
Their first album was titled "Dance."

18
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,303
"In the Water."

19
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,805
-"In the Water."
-Something must be there!

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,073
COULD A CLUE BE IN THE WATER?

21
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,108
-This is it.
-Found it.

22
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,377
THE HEROES INCHED CLOSER TO NA-BAK

23
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,779
We have to find a code.

24
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,846
HOWEVER, TRIALS FOLLOWED

25
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:47,914
Confirm.

26
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,417
THEY TACKLED ALL TASKS

27
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,652
AND OVERCAME ALL OBSTACLES

28
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,155
THE TEAM WAS ON A HOT STREAK!

29
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,289
Go High Note was in fifth place.

30
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,357
Na-bak took her spot.

31
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,525
She was overtaken by Na-bak.

32
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,894
-"Ghost singer"?
-"Ghost singer contract."

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,328
THEY WERE CLOSE TO SOLVING THE CASE

34
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,930
Let's see what we can find here.

35
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,399
BUT THE FINAL TASK STOPPED THEM

36
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,168
It does feel like we're stuck here.

37
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,171
-Is it this place?
-Sae-ho!

38
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,806
-The plastic surgery clinic.
-Then, the pub.

39
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,375
She went to the agency,
the recording studio, and the pharmacy.

40
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,077
-The stadium.
-All the strokes might form a word.

41
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,411
-It's a character.
-That's a vowel.

42
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,313
-So…
-If we assemble all the letters…

43
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,514
Wait… It's "basement"!

44
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,882
The basement!

45
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,784
KIM NA-BAK'S LAST KNOWN LOCATION

46
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,854
The real deal is just about to begin.

47
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,525
It has been confirmed that the place
Kim Na-bak visited last was the basement.

48
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,061
Now, you'll each take a turn
to go down to the basement.

49
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,364
You must find a hint each
and return upstairs.

50
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,699
Dang it.

51
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,935
All five clues must be combined

52
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,438
for you to find the missing Kim Na-bak.

53
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,573
Bear that in mind.

54
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,008
TO FIND KIM NA-BAK,
THEY MUST FIND CLUES IN THE BASEMENT

55
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,045
An assailant holding a knife
doesn't scare me at all.

56
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,180
But I flinch
if someone charges at me yelling.

57
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,349
It's supposed to be fine
when you know it's all staged,

58
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,817
but that's not the case for me.

59
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,686
When we shot
a similar episode for Beat Coin,

60
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,488
a crew member brought
a massive doll, remember?

61
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,224
I greeted them while they were
having a break with a vape.

62
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,959
When I walked in, they greeted me.

63
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,561
So I promised to overlook the vape,
and we shook hands.

64
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,230
When they later rushed at me on set,

65
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,532
I knew who they were,
but still hated the experience.

66
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,733
That explains it all.

67
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,369
Who wants to go downstairs first?

68
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,705
We need our smart cookie to go later,

69
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,106
so kick us off, Woo-young.

70
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,608
-Go ahead, Woo-young.
-I guess I could.

71
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,643
Be honest.
Are you sure you can go down there?

72
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,678
Not really. I'm all about going up.

73
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,647
-Here's an idea--
-Can one of you come with me?

74
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,483
-I'll go after Woo-young.
-Here he goes again.

75
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,018
-Do I have to leave the house?
-Yes.

76
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,154
The basement here does creep me out too.

77
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,555
Still, off you go, Woo-young.

78
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,790
-Fine. I'll try to be brave.
-Good.

79
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,858
You can do this!

80
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,162
-I guess I'll man up for today.
-Good luck.

81
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,830
-Go!
-You've got this.

82
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,866
Show us how brave you are, Woo-young.

83
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,603
"WEAK HERO" DEPARTS FOR THE BASEMENT FIRST

84
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,906
I simply hate a lodge like this one.

85
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,809
THE OMINOUS VIBE IS PALPABLE
EVEN FROM THE START

86
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,711
Seriously, a lodge like this…

87
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,381
I mean, why would a lodge like this one…

88
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,016
Just…

89
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,184
ALREADY LOST THE POWER OF SPEECH

90
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,620
The concept of a lodge itself
is the absolute worst.

91
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,590
Can't you come with me, Director?

92
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,293
You can take my camera with you.

93
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,828
I seriously dislike a lodge like this.

94
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,896
A BODYCAM AS A COMPANION

95
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,266
Dang it. They got things set up again.

96
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,768
FACES HIS OBJECT OF FEAR, THE LODGE

97
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,875
THE EERIE ENERGY SWARMS IN THE STAIRWAY

98
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:33,846
GROANS

99
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,953
THE ENTRANCE TO THE BASEMENT

100
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,754
So we're doing
another summer horror episode?

101
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,891
THE THREATENING BLUEISH LIGHT
"WELCOMES" THE HERO

102
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,760
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED TO THE PREGNANT,
THE ELDERLY, AND THE INFIRM

103
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,062
I'm so sorry.

104
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,431
I beg of you…

105
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,834
I'm just scared witless, that's all.

106
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,704
A WAIL

107
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,905
Dang it.

108
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,540
MORE WAILING

109
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
Come on.

110
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,445
A NEWBORN'S CRY
COMING FROM THE RESTROOM

111
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,215
Seriously, come on.

112
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,419
Why do I hear a baby crying in here?

113
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,687
YOU CAN'T IGNORE A WAILING BABY

114
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,160
Wait, that one's locked.

115
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,263
This one too.

116
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,330
NEIGHBORING DOORS ARE LOCKED

117
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,733
Why do we have so many doors here?

118
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,969
Cut me some slack, please.

119
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,745
INSTEAD OF A BABY,
A SPOOKY DOLL GREETS WOO-YOUNG

120
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,247
THE BABY'S CRY WAS JUST A DECOY?

121
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,851
For goodness' sake!

122
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,753
IT'S JUST THE FIRST TASK,
AND HE'S FED UP ALREADY

123
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,087
I can't believe you people.

124
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,156
Where's the hint?

125
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,294
GINGERLY BEGINS TO SEARCH THE DOLL

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,561
Damn it.

127
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,298
THE NOTE AROUND ITS NECK
ANNOUNCES THE NEXT MISSION

128
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,033
"Go to the dance studio"?

129
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,304
BARELY MANAGED TO LEARN THE NEXT MISSION

130
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,142
THIS WAY TO THE DANCE STUDIO

131
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,511
NEXT UP IS THAT ROOM, HUH?

132
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,547
RIGHT HOOK, LEFT HOOK!

133
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,283
COME AT ME, WORLD!

134
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,353
APPROACHES THE STUDIO
AFTER WASTING 30% OF HIS ENERGY

135
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,422
Dang, it's spacious.

136
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,556
Man…

137
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,227
SECOND MISSION SITE
DANCE STUDIO

138
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,464
THE SUPPLIES ARE IN DISARRAY

139
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,802
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED LONG AGO
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON

140
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,605
WILL THIS PLACE GIVE WOO-YOUNG
A HINT ABOUT NA-BAK'S LOCATION?

141
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,409
Hold on. Let me tie up my shoelaces.

142
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,412
Hey, give me a second here.
I need to tie up my shoelaces quickly.

143
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,216
I'm going to be brave today.

144
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,618
I'm plucking up my courage.

145
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:05,898
IT'S TAKING HIM AGES

146
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,266
It's all good.

147
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,035
It's all good, okay?

148
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,670
BUT HE HASN'T RUN YET,
AND THAT'S SOMETHING

149
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,071
It's all good here.

150
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,409
We're okay, right?

151
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,477
IS THAT HIS WEAPON?

152
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,412
WAIT

153
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,247
Could it be in one of the lockers?

154
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,950
COULD THE CLUE BE THERE?

155
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,320
WOULD HE FIND THE HINT
BEHIND THE FIRMLY SHUT DOORS?

156
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,656
It took me five minutes already.

157
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,159
Can it be here?

158
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,293
CREEPS UP TO THE LOCKERS

159
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,498
BRAVELY OPENS THE FIRST LOCKER

160
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,302
ARE THOSE HANDS FROM A CORPSE?

161
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,905
WHOEVER IT WAS, THEY HAD PRETTY HANDS

162
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,975
VALIANTLY OPENS THE SECOND LOCKER

163
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,845
ARE THOSE CHICKEN FEET?

164
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,348
LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THOSE EERIE HAIR

165
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,751
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
HE ISN'T "WEAK HERO" BUT "COURAGEOUS HERO"

166
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,220
I have to rise above today.

167
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,523
IS HE REBRANDING AS THE TOUGH GUY?

168
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,191
I have to rise above today.

169
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,759
Today is the day I…

170
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,064
Today is the day I…

171
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,468
TODAY IS THE DAY "WEAK HERO"
BECOMES "COWARDLY HERO"

172
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,637
HE JUMPED FROM THIS POINT

173
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,838
AND LANDED ON THIS POINT

174
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,440
Shoot, my throat hurts.

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,276
-What was that?
-The hallway…

176
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,677
Excuse me?

177
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,912
Go to the hallway.

178
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,979
DON'T MAKE ME REPEAT IT

179
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,314
You want me to go this way?

180
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,549
I was just here, no?

181
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,017
I came from here.

182
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,586
HELLO?

183
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,788
SNEAKS A PEEK

184
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,324
Goodness. It goes on forever.

185
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,694
HE'S REACHED THE HALLWAY
MS. GHOST POINTED TO

186
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,298
Please, guys.
Go easy on me just this once.

187
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,499
I'm begging you.

188
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,034
Is this it?

189
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,574
A SAFE WITH A KEYPAD
FOUND AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

190
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,010
"Press the passcode and the 'E' button."

191
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,712
The passcode and the E button?

192
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,248
BUT HE HAS NO LEADS ON THE PASSCODE

193
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,850
THIS DOOR IS LOCKED

194
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,117
Okay.

195
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,786
IS THIS ONE LOCKED TOO?

196
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,087
What's this?

197
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,689
Is this supposed to open?

198
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,657
A passcode, huh?

199
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,459
THUD!

200
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,496
HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY
TO OPEN THE DOOR

201
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,165
WHEN A SUDDEN NOISE JOLTED HIM

202
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,135
I mean, the passcode…

203
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,704
CAN SOMEONE BE WAITING BEHIND THE DOOR?

204
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,706
How do we find the code?

205
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,208
THE LOCKED DOOR AND THE SAFE
REMAIN A MYSTERY

206
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,480
SUPPRESSING THE URGE TO RUN,
WOO-YOUNG RETURNS TO THE HALLWAY

207
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,518
I'M IN THE HALLWAY
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD TO COME HERE

208
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,387
BUT WHAT EXACTLY DO I HAVE TO DO HERE?

209
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,659
A FIGURE SUDDENLY JUMPS AT WOO-YOUNG

210
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,727
Darn it.

211
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,865
THEIR BIG BULK AND WADDLING GAIT

212
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,401
DEFINITELY SEEM FAMILIAR

213
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,839
ISN'T THAT THE DINOSAUR
FROM THE PREVIOUS SHOOT

214
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:04,143
WHO VALIANTLY SACRIFICED THEMSELVES
TO SECURE A PRESENT FOR SOOK?

215
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,314
WAIT, BUT WHAT IS THIS DINOSAUR
DOING IN THE BASEMENT?

216
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,616
MAKES A RUN FOR IT ANYWAY

217
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,084
THROWS A WEAPON AT THE DINOSAUR

218
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,686
Dude. What's your deal?

219
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,555
Tell me what you want!

220
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,356
THE DINOSAUR HELD A MISSION CARD

221
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,891
I have to go to the vocal training room?

222
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,459
Where is this place, anyway?

223
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,228
Can I get an autograph?

224
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,332
WHO CHARGES AT A CELEBRITY
TO ASK FOR AN AUTOGRAPH LIKE THAT?

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,466
-My marker…
-Are you okay?

226
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,534
It must've flown away.

227
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,802
Are you all right?

228
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,470
-Where's my marker?
-Where's this room?

229
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,473
Are you okay?
I'm sorry about chucking that chair.

230
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,976
THE MARKER MUST'VE BEEN LOST THEN

231
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,611
WIDE OPEN

232
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,146
I'm here.

233
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,315
STUMBLES INTO THE VOCAL TRAINING ROOM
WHILE RUNNING AWAY

234
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,650
I've reached my destination. I'm here…

235
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,619
LEAVES WITHOUT HIS AUTOGRAPH

236
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,220
Gosh, thank you for your trouble.

237
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,022
I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to.

238
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,024
It's just that I got startled
when you rushed in.

239
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,527
HIS EXIT ISN'T AS IMPRESSIVE
AS HIS DRAMATIC ENTRANCE

240
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,196
It's just that I got startled
when you rushed in.

241
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,198
ENTERS THE VOCAL TRAINING ROOM
AFTER THE APOLOGY

242
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,934
Karaoke?

243
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,302
THIRD MISSION SITE
VOCAL TRAINING ROOM

244
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,370
MISSION CARD

245
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,805
Hold on.

246
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,907
"Punch in 66782 and sing the song"?

247
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,309
Dang, my voice, though.

248
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,178
WILL HE BE ABLE TO SING
AFTER SCREAMING SO MUCH?

249
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,981
You want me to sing "Arirang"?

250
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,515
"ARIRANG," THE FOLK SONG?

251
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:20,820
YOU WANT ME TO SING "ARIRANG"
AFTER BEING CHASED BY THE DINOSAUR?

252
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,424
THIS FEELS LIKE A CHAOTIC DREAM
AFTER AN ESPECIALLY LONG DAY

253
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,427
All right. Let's calm down with the song.

254
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,632
A SWIG OF COLD WATER

255
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,969
SQUEAK

256
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,907
UNBEKNOWNST TO WOO-YOUNG,
THE DOOR CLOSES SHUT QUIETLY

257
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,977
Arirang…

258
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,179
FOR A HERO, HE'S NOT SO BRIGHT

259
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,981
ENGROSSED IN THE SONG

260
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,516
Arariyo

261
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,586
You're going over the Arirang Hill…

262
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,721
"DID I CLOSE THAT DOOR?"

263
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,425
FOCUSES ON THE SINGING MISSION

264
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,660
My love…

265
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,562
JUST WHEN THINGS GET RELAXED

266
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,299
THE ELECTRICITY GOES OUT
TO CREATE THE SUSPENSE

267
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,436
For goodness' sake, guys.
You're really ticking me off!

268
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:11,937
A SUDDEN KNOCK

269
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,139
You're really ticking me off!

270
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,077
THE "COWARDLY HERO"
TURNS OUT TO BE A HIGH-JUMP HERO

271
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,679
All right, fine.

272
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,448
I got your message. My bad.

273
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,117
I'm really regretting it. I mean it…

274
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,453
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

275
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,788
I apologize!

276
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,356
I apologize!

277
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,425
I made a mistake.

278
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,492
My apologies.

279
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,794
COMING THROUGH

280
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,329
FORGET ABOUT THE MISSION!
THIS HERO'S GOING TO RUN FOR IT

281
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,565
I feel you. I'll take off.
What do I do now?

282
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,633
Just a second!

283
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,702
What's this? Wait.

284
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,803
What is this?

285
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,671
MS. GHOST HANDS HIM SOMETHING
AFTER THE CHASE

286
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,972
Go up.

287
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,141
-You want me to go up?
-Go upstairs.

288
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,078
THANK YOU AND GOODBYE

289
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,914
I still think… I did pretty okay.

290
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,582
I did it.

291
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,652
LET ME GET BACK AND BRAG TO MY CASTMATES

292
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,587
Here he comes.

293
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,090
-I bet he failed.
-He'll ask us to come with him.

294
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,558
I did it all by myself!

295
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,759
-You got the clue?
-You did it!

296
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,461
-I did it by myself.
-What's the clue?

297
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,528
A tambourine?

298
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,464
What the… Why did I bring it with me?

299
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,266
-Why did you bring it with you?
-Look, it's number five.

300
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,367
-My gosh.
-I got my clue.

301
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,203
Did they make you solve a quiz for it?

302
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,205
Tell us. What's the vibe like down there?

303
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,006
Compared to the Beat Coin episode…

304
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,608
Well…

305
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,510
THERE WAS A SIMILAR EPISODE IN BEAT COIN

306
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,145
How should I put this?

307
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,780
There are more physical interactions.

308
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,848
So someone's down there?

309
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,349
Come on, give it to us straight.

310
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,951
-What did you do?
-I suppose

311
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,854
the whole point is to keep going.

312
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,589
Keep on opening new doors.

313
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,491
I got lost the last time.

314
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,159
-Did you have to open a lot of doors?
-Yeah.

315
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,062
I'm sweating buckets here.
Let me take off my wig.

316
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,899
-Who wants to go next?
-Me.

317
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,100
-Or me.
-I'm skittish, though.

318
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,301
I could take my turn next.

319
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,438
No, I'll go next.

320
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,040
Practice your one-two combo
before you go, Sook.

321
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,742
ALL YOU CAN COUNT ON ARE YOUR TWO FISTS!

322
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,010
Knock them down.

323
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,979
HONG GIL-DONG HEADS
TO THE BASEMENT SECOND

324
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,380
Good luck!

325
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,648
I'm sweating like crazy.

326
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,683
I'm terrible with directions.

327
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,519
COWARDLY AND HOPELESS AT DIRECTIONS

328
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,488
Honestly, this isn't at all to my liking.

329
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,556
WHINING FROM THE GET-GO

330
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,324
This type of challenge terrifies me.

331
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,094
DRAGGING HER FEET

332
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,831
Shouldn't you use the landscape mode?

333
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,636
THOUGH TERRIFIED, THIS HERO
STILL PROVIDES GREAT FILMING TIPS

334
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,640
Seriously though, I don't like basements.

335
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,076
I don't like basements

336
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,812
and the jump scares.

337
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,314
I don't like hints either.

338
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,716
Won't we be able to
proceed without my clue?

339
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,487
Do I have to go alone?

340
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,789
Don't be like that. Come with me.

341
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,093
LETTING THE CREW PUT A BODYCAM
WITHOUT COMPLAINT

342
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,595
It's not fastened down.

343
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,663
Are the straps loose?

344
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,964
Yeah, let me adjust them.

345
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,801
MY FEELINGS ASIDE, WE NEED GOOD FOOTAGE

346
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,303
Yeah, the bodycam is secure now.

347
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,470
I'll be back, then.

348
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,072
Dang it.

349
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,007
Is this it?

350
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,944
BACK TO WHINING

351
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,449
THE VETERAN HERO OF THE SHOWBIZ INDUSTRY,
HONG GIL-DONG, ENTERS THE BASEMENT

352
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,118
Gosh, this is insane.

353
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,220
SIGHING FROM THE GET-GO

354
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,588
Why must I go through with this?

355
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,725
Oh, shoot.
Look at the color of the lights.

356
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,762
CHECKS AGAIN
FREAKED OUT

357
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,332
This is driving me insane.

358
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,400
Did they have to turn the lights blue?

359
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,439
THE BASEMENT LOOKS DARKER
FROM GIL-DONG'S POINT OF VIEW

360
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,040
Don't do it.

361
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,243
I'm warning you.

362
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,310
A WAIL

363
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,979
OH, HEAVENS…

364
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,015
THE BASEMENT MISSION
STARTS WITH A BABY'S WAIL

365
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,651
Damn it.

366
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,454
THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR THE INITIAL TRIAL

367
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,655
Jeez.

368
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,093
This is insane.

369
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,733
SUPPRESSES HER FEAR
AND ENTERS THE BATHROOM

370
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,402
THE DOOR LEADING
TO THE NEXT ROOM IS LOCKED

371
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,770
The baby must be here.

372
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,172
The baby must be here.

373
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,341
ARE YOU HERE, LITTLE ONE?

374
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,210
THERE ARE NO BABIES HERE

375
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,846
Damn it!

376
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,482
Seriously, don't do this.

377
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,684
A LOUD WAIL

378
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,186
Seriously, I'm this close
to losing my wits.

379
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,558
THE BABY'S WAIL DIDN'T STOP
EVEN AFTER SHE OPENED THE DOOR

380
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,029
SHOULD SHE OPEN
THE FIRMLY SHUT DOOR ON THE LEFT SIDE?

381
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,998
The whole point is to keep going.

382
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,034
-Did you have to open a lot of doors?
-Yeah.

383
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,003
WOO-YOUNG CLEARLY SAID TO KEEP GOING

384
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,407
HE DIDN'T OPEN THAT DOOR, THOUGH

385
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,509
WILL THERE BE ANOTHER HINT
BEHIND THE DOOR?

386
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,710
JUST A LITTLE BIT…

387
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,348
IS THERE REALLY A BABY GHOST?

388
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,317
That doll.

389
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:52,985
KIM YU-GYEONG, PRODUCER

390
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,753
-That doll.
-The what?

391
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,322
LOOK AT THE DOLL IN THE BACK, NOT HERE

392
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,658
TURNS OUT I DIDN'T HAVE TO CHECK THERE

393
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,694
EMBARRASSED

394
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,363
CRACKS UP

395
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,499
I really panicked
when that door slid open.

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,236
OLD SAYINGS TEACH YOU
TO FEAR PEOPLE MOST FOR A REASON

397
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,139
I have to go to the dance studio?

398
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,208
Where is the dance studio?

399
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
SHE BARELY LEARNED THE NEXT MISSION

400
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,046
Oh, please…

401
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,114
Please…

402
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,083
Please don't lunge at me.

403
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,150
ENTERS THE DANCE STUDIO

404
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm losing my mind here.

405
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,322
This is the worst…

406
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,390
Don't do anything.

407
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,825
Please don't try anything.

408
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,727
I swear I'll…

409
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,863
ON HIGH ALERT

410
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,067
TIPTOEING AROUND

411
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,373
SPOTS THE FIRMLY SHUT LOCKERS

412
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,875
THOSE LOCKERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE OPENED

413
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,478
BEGRUDGINGLY APPROACHES THEM

414
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,847
HYPERVENTILATING

415
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,315
NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE YET

416
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,483
Don't do it.

417
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,420
HOW WILL THIS HERO REACT
AFTER OPENING THE LOCKERS?

418
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,192
Damn it. Those crazy bastards.

419
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,594
SHOOT, I'M ON CAMERA

420
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,996
GETS IT TOGETHER
AND OPENS THE SECOND LOCKER

421
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,064
RED CHICKEN FEET

422
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,365
Are you kidding me?

423
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,434
Why put chicken feet in here?

424
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,903
HERE COMES THE LOCKER GHOST

425
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,772
Why put chicken feet in here?

426
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,208
WE GOT YOU ON YOUR TOES AGAIN, DIDN'T WE?

427
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,644
SOOK SLAMMED THE DOOR BY REFLEX

428
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,913
DON'T YOU DARE, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU

429
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,182
-Go to the hallway.
-What?

430
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,383
Go to the hallway.

431
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,818
Goodness.

432
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,886
THUMP

433
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:34,953
Quickly.

434
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,389
Dang it. Which way is it
to this hallway anyway?

435
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,125
I'm hopeless at directions,
but you put me through this every time.

436
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,796
SOOK STILL GOES IN THE DIRECTION
MS. GHOST POINTED TO

437
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,198
Why is it so complicated down here?

438
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,535
A BANG SNAP GOES OFF

439
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070
Those rascals.

440
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,439
Damn them all.

441
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,541
SHE'S TOO FRIGHTENED TO SWALLOW THE CURSES

442
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,409
Damn them all.

443
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,678
WOULD SHE GIVE ME AN AUTOGRAPH
IF SHE'S AS MAD AS SHE SOUNDS?

444
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:04,917
STILL, I HAVE A JOB TO DO

445
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,452
WHAT IS THAT NOW?

446
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,519
Give me an autograph.

447
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,254
PLEASE GIVE ME AN AUTOGRAPH

448
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,756
What's with you, punk?

449
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,124
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

450
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,526
-Where's the vocal training room?
-Here's a marker.

451
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,929
-What was that?
-Please give me an autograph.

452
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,364
Did you have to charge at me
to ask for an autograph?

453
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,838
Where's the vocal training room?
Can you give me a general direction?

454
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,773
RUNS AWAY TO KEEP A SECRET

455
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,341
That punk… He popped a bang snap too.

456
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,144
Where is the vocal training room anyway?

457
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,414
Oh, man. This is driving me nuts.

458
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,449
Where is this place?

459
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,550
FOUND IT

460
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,287
I have a heart condition, you know.

461
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,857
ENTERS THE FINAL CHALLENGE OF IT ALL

462
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,292
Why does it look so ominous?

463
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,360
Don't do it.

464
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,062
Just don't.

465
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,463
WHATEVER IT IS, PLEASE DON'T DO IT

466
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,299
"Punch in 66782 and sing the song."

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,401
What, "Arirang"?

468
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,972
I GUESS THAT COULD HELP ME CALM DOWN

469
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,909
THE SONG GOES GREAT WITH HER COSTUME

470
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,211
CHECKS THE MIC

471
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,448
LET US CLOSE THE DOOR FOR YOU, MA'AM

472
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,887
THE DOOR IS CLOSED QUIETLY YET AGAIN
WHILE THE MACHINE KEEPS THE HERO OCCUPIED

473
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,989
Arirang

474
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,957
Arirang

475
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,025
Arariyo

476
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,227
ADDS BLEATING SOUND EFFECT BY HERSELF

477
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,230
You're going over…

478
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,932
THE LIGHT GOES OFF

479
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,433
JUST WHEN SHE LETS HER GUARD DOWN

480
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,235
WE STRIKE AGAIN

481
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,803
What's going on?

482
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,372
IT'S TIME TO GO, SOOK

483
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,073
Come on, turn the light back on.

484
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,976
Jeez, I can't open that door.

485
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,179
Dang it.

486
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,347
WALKS IN HERSELF

487
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,583
The light. Please turn it back on.

488
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,418
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO SCREAM

489
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,486
BUT MERELY HOLDS THE CLUE OUT

490
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,554
Is it for me?

491
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,621
YEAH

492
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,689
Sorry about that.

493
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,292
Is it for me?

494
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,359
NO SCREAMING FOR THE COWARD

495
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,827
Sorry about that.

496
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,196
Go up.

497
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,297
What?

498
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,831
-Go up.
-To where?

499
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,700
Is it over now?

500
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,902
-Go upstairs.
-Okay.

501
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,771
After you.

502
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,105
YOU'RE BLOCKING MY WAY

503
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,508
Jeez, I'm so sorry.

504
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,476
But I can't handle this.

505
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,045
Please go. Please.

506
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,513
Enough fooling around, okay?

507
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,448
It was my bad.

508
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,083
Honestly…

509
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,786
HONG GIL-DONG
FINALLY CLEARS THE LAST TRIAL

510
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,889
I hate to bother you again,
but I'm terrible with directions, you see.

511
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,025
Dang it. Where the heck am I?

512
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,095
Dang it. Where the heck am I?

513
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,733
CLUELESS SOOK

514
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,001
I'm no good with directions.

515
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,369
THIS WAY IS THE EXIT

516
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,538
Oh, I ran this way.

517
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,406
I turned this corner…

518
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,143
DANCE STUDIO

519
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,478
Don't do anything.

520
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,146
PRO TIP FOR THE DIRECTIONALLY CHALLENGED

521
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,949
RETRACE YOUR STEPS
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE EXIT IS

522
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,551
Goodness. Don't try anything.

523
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,887
Which way did I come in again?

524
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:56,955
IT'S THIS WAY

525
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,323
Probably here, right?

526
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,226
Here it is.

527
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,562
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE YOU
A MAZE MISSION NEXT TIME

528
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,230
She's back.

529
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,298
HERE COMES SOOK

530
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,367
-She looks super mad.
-Dang it.

531
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,701
What's the matter?

532
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,305
Gosh, is that five or two?

533
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,373
TAKE IT, IT'S NUMBER 5

534
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,241
-It's five.
-It's five again.

535
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,043
-I'm so pissed.
-What happened?

536
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,345
You can't handle it, Sae-ho.

537
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,614
Why do you say that?

538
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,782
You can't go in there.

539
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,617
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING ON THE SUBJECT

540
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,685
Why can't I go in there?

541
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,953
Talk to me, Sook.

542
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,121
You just can't.

543
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,123
CRACKING UP

544
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,291
Tell me why.

545
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,227
WOO-YOUNG KNOWS WHAT'S UP
WHILE SAE-HO IS CLUELESS

546
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,461
WHY IS EVERYONE LAUGHING?

547
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,596
What's the matter?

548
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,197
DON'T EVEN TRY IT, SAE-HO

549
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,199
-You have no hope.
-But why? Tell me why, Sook.

550
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,202
If she held a cigarette,

551
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,504
-it'd look perfect.
-Yeah?

552
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,106
I'd love to slide a stick here.

553
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,276
It feels like we need some smoke
covering up Sook's face.

554
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,644
I can only say…

555
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,780
that it ticked me off.

556
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,915
What's with the vibe downstairs?

557
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,751
For me, the last part was the worst.

558
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,320
It was so frightening.

559
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,721
My heart is still racing.

560
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:03,789
STILL THUMPING HARD

561
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,625
Whatever they've got,
those are mere setups. I'll be fine.

562
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,060
PUTS UP A CALM FACADE

563
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,029
I'm not talking about the setups.
The general vibe is awful.

564
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,097
And she's right.

565
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,199
Isn't it super humid downstairs?

566
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,569
I've been wondering
what they must've done.

567
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,871
When they come running…
No, I shouldn't say that.

568
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,274
If you ask me, the bathroom…

569
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,775
Forget it.

570
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,876
SO MANY QUESTIONS

571
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,378
The…

572
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,612
Just see for yourselves.

573
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,349
FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE
WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING

574
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,983
PATS FOR COMFORT

575
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,051
It's okay.

576
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,286
After I pushed a chair…

577
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,854
FLASHMAN GOES THIRD

578
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:36,955
-I'll get going.
-Good luck, Sae-ho.

579
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,490
-Okay.
-Sae-ho.

580
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,558
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK

581
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,227
Didn't I make it back
earlier than Woo-young?

582
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,296
Not really. You took long too.

583
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,364
14 MINUTES VS. 13 MINUTES

584
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,866
That stuff's too much for me.

585
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,634
HOW LONG WILL FLASHMAN TAKE?

586
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,303
Is it better than the Beat Coin shoot?

587
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,808
THERE'S NO BETTER TEACHER
THAN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

588
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,912
MARCHING ON LIKE A BRAVE SOLDIER

589
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,783
Hold on. It looks so spooky.

590
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,851
What should I do?

591
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,622
All right! Settle down, everyone.

592
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,259
I DARE YOU

593
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,394
Come on out.

594
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,996
FLINCHES

595
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,399
THE MISSION FINALLY BEGINS

596
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,466
Come on now.

597
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,935
All right, then.

598
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,605
Why are you crying?

599
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,706
A LOUD WAIL

600
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:28,974
I got…

601
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,443
I got it, okay?

602
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,612
WILL HE BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS COOL?

603
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,118
Goodness. The dance studio, huh?

604
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,653
That was intense.

605
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,288
Jeez.

606
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,491
Seriously, what was that?

607
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,893
WHAT HAPPENED? HE'S NOT THE BRAVE TYPE

608
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,461
Come on out. Come on.

609
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,929
SO, DO I SCARE YOU?

610
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,998
-Go to the hallway.
-Come again?

611
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,332
-Where was that? Hello.
-The hallway.

612
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,068
Jeez. My goodness.

613
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,503
Thanks anyway.

614
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,038
SHUTS THE DOOR TIGHTLY

615
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,075
YOUR MARRIAGE CHANGED YOU, HUH?

616
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,144
PROUD AND BRAVE

617
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,479
I got it, okay?

618
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,247
HE DID GET BETTER AT MANAGING DOORS TOO

619
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,649
That was intense.

620
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,219
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
HE'S SHUT THE DOOR SECURELY

621
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,457
NEXT UP IS MR. DINOSAUR, THE CRAZED FAN

622
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,928
An autograph, please.

623
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,263
What's your name?

624
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,466
Your name, please.

625
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,733
"To. Mr. Dinosaur."

626
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,837
FAILED TO SURPRISE HIM
AND ONLY SECURED HIS AUTOGRAPH

627
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,438
ONE MIGHT THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY HIS FAN

628
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:40,045
HOW WILL HE MANAGE
THE VOCAL TRAINING ROOM MISSION?

629
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,380
Arirang

630
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,316
Arirang

631
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,185
Arariyo

632
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,453
REMAINS VIGILANT

633
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,022
THIS IS THE CREW'S ROOM

634
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,958
-You're choosing
-This isn't ideal.

635
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,227
-To leave me behind
-We can't shut the door with him watching.

636
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:02,567
REMAINS EVER SO VIGILANT
AS IF HE IS PROTECTING HIS NEW FAMILY

637
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,669
In less than four kilometers

638
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,908
FINALLY, THIS IS THE CHANCE
TO CLOSE THE DOOR

639
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,811
KICKS IT OPEN

640
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,179
DOES IT HAVE A CLOSING MECHANISM?

641
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,115
THUD, THUD

642
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,150
Come on. That's not cool.

643
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,921
Come on. That's not cool.

644
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,222
This isn't cool, I tell you.

645
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,191
Come on now.

646
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,592
HERO SCOLDS THE GHOST

647
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,394
TAKES THE HINT BY FORCE

648
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,229
Thanks. Can I go upstairs now?

649
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,664
-Go up.
-Okay.

650
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,901
-Go upstairs.
-Sure.

651
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,003
GET UP THERE AND LET'S NOT MEET AGAIN

652
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,872
COMES OUT AS BRAVE AS EVER
IN JUST 6 MINUTES

653
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,140
Dang it!

654
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,011
IT SEEMS HE STILL HATED THE EXPERIENCE

655
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,879
-He's back.
-Here he is.

656
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,714
FLASHMAN RETURNS
AFTER FINISHING HIS ASSIGNMENT

657
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,049
Goodness.

658
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,785
WHY THE APPLAUSE
AS IF HE HAD PULLED OFF AN EPIC TASK?

659
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,521
WHY THE FORMAL GREETING?

660
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,923
Good work.

661
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,224
What number did you get?

662
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,927
WHAT NUMBER DID FLASHMAN GET?

663
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,128
It's seven.

664
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,096
IT SEEMS THE CREW DID GET TO HIM

665
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,165
THOUGH HE GRITTED HIS TEETH
AND SOLDIERED ON

666
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,834
My gosh, this is killing me.

667
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,104
I get what you meant now.
The whole vibe was really bad.

668
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,574
I'll just go downstairs
and get it over with.

669
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,375
-Good luck, Jin-kyung.
-See you soon.

670
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,145
-Jin-kyung, try not to panic.
-Got it, Sook.

671
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,247
-Good luck with collecting the hint.
-Okay.

672
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,453
WONDER WOMAN ENTERS THE BASEMENT

673
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,425
SHAKING LIKE A LEAF

674
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,027
A WAIL

675
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,532
SPOOKY WAILING COMING FROM THE BATHROOM

676
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,600
Where do I go?

677
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,134
TAKES A QUICK LOOK

678
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,972
Give me a direction.

679
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,007
Where should I go?

680
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,308
-Can you hear the baby crying?
-Yes.

681
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,476
Head that way.

682
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,612
I'm supposed to
follow the sound of the baby?

683
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,980
-To the bathroom?
-Yes.

684
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,750
I HAVE TO GET IN THERE?

685
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,219
SHAKEN

686
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,687
Why is that necessary?

687
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,422
Because the baby is crying.

688
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,992
-Excuse me?
-The baby is crying in there.

689
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,127
What if that kid is terrifying me?

690
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,563
-I bet it's not a baby.
-It is a baby.

691
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,697
Are you sure?

692
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,165
This is nuts.

693
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,435
EVENTUALLY HEADS TO THE BATHROOM
TO SOOTHE THE BABY

694
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,170
EVEN A LOUDER WAIL

695
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,439
Where's the sound coming from?

696
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,941
IN HERE

697
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,009
Where are you?

698
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:25,944
Are you in here?

699
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,014
HI THERE

700
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,482
Oh, there you are.

701
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,083
Are you in here?

702
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,687
RUNS AWAY

703
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,522
Seriously, you people.

704
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,824
What's that?

705
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,526
A sign hangs around its neck.

706
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,895
It's just way too much for me.
Come with me.

707
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,397
-Why would I…
-Please?

708
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,832
-There's nothing to be scared of.
-Really?

709
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,501
OUR HERO IS A GRUMBLER

710
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,069
Let's get it over with.

711
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,204
Come on.
You have something around your neck?

712
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,240
You want me to go to the dance studio?

713
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,709
Here it is.

714
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,744
FOUND THE NEXT MISSION SITE
AFTER MUCH COMPLAINING

715
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,579
SPOOKED

716
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,517
WELCOME TO THE DANCE STUDIO

717
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,852
WHY IS EVERYTHING IN RED HERE?

718
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,020
The dance studio.

719
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,289
Why did they send me here?

720
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,357
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

721
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,126
SHE HAS TO OPEN THESE LOCKERS

722
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,194
This place is…

723
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,330
SPOTS THE LOCKERS

724
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,200
PRETENDS NOT TO HAVE SEEN IT

725
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,802
BLATANTLY IGNORES THEM

726
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,869
Where's the next clue?

727
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,606
It's not scary at all.

728
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,608
Where am I supposed to find the code?

729
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,410
A COP-OUT HERO

730
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,611
The code…

731
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,679
IGNORES THE LOCKERS

732
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,747
AND RUNS AGAIN

733
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,415
Where is this passcode?

734
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,550
I'M CHOOSING NOT TO OPEN THEM

735
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,488
MR. DINOSAUR ON STANDBY

736
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,556
Excuse me.

737
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,623
HE CAN'T BE SEEN YET!

738
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,627
I need to… find the code.

739
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,864
JUMPS IN AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
TO CUT HER OFF

740
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,266
-What's the matter?
-What did I just see?

741
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,568
LET'S JUST LAUGH IT OFF

742
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,603
-The passcode?
-Where can I…

743
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,038
find the passcode?

744
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,040
-In the lockers.
-What?

745
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,108
In the lockers.

746
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,409
But they won't open.

747
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,477
They won't?

748
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,979
-I couldn't open them.
-They're unlocked.

749
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,881
The lockers are right there,

750
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,683
-behind the pillar.
-I see.

751
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,984
Go check them out.

752
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,521
SNICKERS

753
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,623
I just saw something hilarious.

754
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,558
"SOMETHING HILARIOUS"

755
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,893
IS SHE GONE NOW?

756
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,162
The blue lockers. There they are.

757
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,232
But no one told me I had to open these.

758
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,801
SPOOKED

759
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,206
Is something in here?

760
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,810
SCARED STIFF, BUT MOVES ON TO THE NEXT ONE

761
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,813
THE CLUE ISN'T HERE EITHER

762
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:44,849
You startled me!

763
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,051
A TERRIBLE BEING JUMPS OUT

764
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,119
You startled me!

765
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,854
-Go to the hallway.
-What?

766
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,323
-Go to the hallway.
-You want me to go to the hallway?

767
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,459
-Quickly…
-Quickly?

768
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,060
Get going!

769
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,898
FINE, I WAS GOING TO LEAVE ANYWAY

770
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,500
REACHES THE HALLWAY
AFTER GHOST'S DISMISSAL

771
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,568
Will I find it here?

772
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,371
THIS IS THE HALLWAY…

773
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,074
HER REUNION WITH MR. DINOSAUR IS IMMINENT

774
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,011
RUSTLING SOUNDS

775
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,479
What the…

776
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,414
What is this?

777
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,582
What do you want?

778
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,584
FINALLY REUNITED WITH MR. DINOSAUR

779
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,286
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN

780
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,754
You startled me, dang it.

781
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,055
An autograph, please.

782
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,391
My goodness.

783
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:28,960
You want an autograph?

784
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,863
I have to go to the vocal training room?

785
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,264
Where is it, anyway?

786
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,866
RIGHT HERE

787
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,067
Vocal training room…

788
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,836
MR. DINOSAUR IS QUITE THE GENTLEMAN

789
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,439
VOCAL TRAINING ROOM

790
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,674
This is it.

791
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,544
"Punch in 66782 and sing the song"?

792
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,346
Six, six, seven, eight, two.

793
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,715
YOU CAN COUNT ON HER TO TAKE ORDERS
EVEN WHEN SHE'S SCARED

794
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,252
SHE'S READY TO SING

795
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,696
AT THAT MOMENT…

796
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,967
THE DOOR CLOSES EVER SO SLOWLY

797
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,102
Arirang

798
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,238
Arirang

799
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,106
Arariyo

800
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,174
ENGROSSED IN THE SONG

801
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,577
DID I CLOSE THE DOOR?

802
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,746
BLACKOUT

803
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,481
My gosh.

804
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,549
THUD, THUD

805
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,485
Are you for real?

806
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,821
I can't believe you.

807
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,889
What's the matter?

808
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,529
HERE

809
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,864
TAKE THIS

810
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,132
Go up.

811
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,800
You want me to go up?

812
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,636
Where? On the couch?

813
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,739
Take this and go upstairs.

814
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:48,873
What is it?

815
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,141
It's a hint.

816
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,542
Oh, there it is.

817
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,278
Dang it. Where is it?

818
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,346
Where did it go?
I dropped it, and it's gone.

819
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,348
Where did it go?

820
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,183
I dropped it. What should I do?

821
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,286
Can you turn the light back on?

822
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,655
TURNS THE LIGHT BACK ON

823
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:04,722
Gosh, my heart.

824
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,925
Where did it go? There it is.

825
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,794
DO I HAVE TO PICK IT UP FOR HER?

826
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,862
I'll be on my way.

827
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,163
-Go upstairs.
-I will.

828
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,066
SHE LEFT THE KIND GHOST BEHIND…

829
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,200
Goodness.

830
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,836
…TO RUSH BACK TO HER COSTARS

831
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,972
-I can see her now.
-There she is.

832
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,607
-Hey, Jin-kyung.
-It wasn't so bad.

833
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,908
-You're right.
-It was okay.

834
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:24,976
Great job.

835
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,044
It was all right.

836
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,179
Oh, it's number nine.

837
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,480
-Is it six or nine?
-It's six.

838
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,916
We have five, five, seven, and six.

839
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,484
Good luck, Woo-jae.

840
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,186
This is Optimus Prime, moving out.

841
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,888
You look drained already.

842
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,692
OPTIMUS PRIME
PREPARES TO LEAVE FOR HIS MISSION

843
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,560
He's milking that outfit
for all its worth.

844
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,762
Doesn't it feel like we're watching a boy?

845
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,031
His mom bought that costume
for his birthday,

846
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,866
and the kid insists
on wearing it all the time.

847
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,502
He'd even wear that
to go hang out in the playground.

848
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,372
NO ONE CAN STOP ME NOW

849
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,440
Off you go.

850
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,609
-Set a new record.
-How cute.

851
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,778
-Watch your step.
-He's a ball of energy today.

852
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,048
I should start acting now.

853
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,050
For ghosts to hurt me,

854
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,086
they'd have to make contact with me.

855
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,521
-That means I can touch them too.
-Of course.

856
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,823
That's Newton's third law of motion.

857
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,758
That means I can beat them up.

858
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,961
WALKS UP WITH HANDS CLENCHED INTO FISTS

859
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,097
MAKES A FUSS FOR SHOW

860
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,367
I'M SO SCARED, HEH-HEH

861
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,435
A WAIL

862
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,770
A baby's crying.

863
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,406
The kid is crying.

864
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,807
I SHOULD GO SOOTHE THE LITTLE ONE

865
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,509
Where's the mother?

866
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,378
SOB, SOB

867
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,714
WAIT FOR ME, I'M COMING

868
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,816
WAH, WAH

869
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,752
"Go to the dance studio"?

870
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,053
THIS MANLY MAN ISN'T AFFECTED

871
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,588
Where's the dance studio?

872
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,524
Here it is. I found it.

873
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,192
OVER-THE-TOP SILLY ACT

874
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,629
THE GHOST MIGHT PUNCH HIM
FOR BEING SO LOUD

875
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,433
REACHED THE LOCKERS
WHERE THE GHOST IS HIDING

876
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,369
WILL HE BE ABLE TO REMAIN CALM
UNLIKE HIS CASTMATES?

877
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,706
HMM…

878
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,941
GRINS

879
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,009
HE'S CAUGHT ON

880
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,411
Someone must be behind the lockers.

881
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,182
SLOWLY CHECKS OUT THE BACK OF THE LOCKERS

882
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,851
ASTUTE KIDS ARE THE WORST

883
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,319
What on earth?

884
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,654
I don't get it. No one's there.

885
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,356
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

886
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,593
THE GHOST BEHIND THE LOCKERS
SOMEHOW DISAPPEARED?

887
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,195
IS NO ONE HERE THEN?

888
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,765
EVEN THE CREW MEMBERS
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE GHOST WENT

889
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,903
WHERE DID THE LOCKER GHOST DISAPPEAR TO?

890
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,772
CAREFULLY OPENS UP A LOCKER

891
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,208
WHAT ARE THOSE?

892
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,544
Those are chicken feet.

893
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,480
STARTS TO FEEL UNEASY

894
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,316
My goodness.

895
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,652
My goodness.

896
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,786
Go to the hallway.

897
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,921
What?

898
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,055
Go to the hallway!

899
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,123
The hallway?

900
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,959
The hallway…
By the way, you have such big eyes.

901
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,995
THEY LOOK SO KIND TOO

902
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,530
Can we chat for a bit?

903
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,332
If a ghost appeared before me,

904
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,534
I'd be super amazed.

905
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,037
Their presence defies all logic
of the scientific knowledge.

906
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,805
I'd have to ask
what their current status is,

907
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,507
how long they've been dead,

908
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,675
how they've come to pass,

909
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,810
and if they're wearing
what they wore when they died.

910
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,379
Ask them about their current place
of residence too.

911
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,848
Can we chat for a bit?

912
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,015
Go to the hallway.

913
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,650
The hallway?

914
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,119
You want me to go to the hallway?

915
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,354
Hold on. Let's chat, okay?

916
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,491
I couldn't see anyone behind the curtains.

917
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:27,992
How are you hiding here?

918
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,761
EVEN GHOSTS WOULD BE AMAZED

919
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,531
POP, POP

920
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,099
BANG SNAPS GOT YOUNG WOO-JAE EXCITED

921
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,368
HE'LL RUN INTO MR. DINOSAUR SOON

922
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,104
SOUND EFFECTS ON

923
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,642
CHILDREN WOULD LOVE TO SEE
MR. DINO GO AGAINST OPTIMUS PRIME

924
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,444
IGNORES HIM

925
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,945
STILL, MR. DINOSAUR TRAILS AFTER HIM

926
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,180
Can I get an autograph?

927
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,549
-You want my autograph?
-Yes.

928
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,917
What's your name, please?

929
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,985
It's Seon-min.

930
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,119
-Seon-min, correct?
-Yes.

931
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,655
"To. Seon-min."

932
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,590
Thank you for your efforts.

933
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,226
Here you go.

934
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,228
"Go to the vocal training room"?

935
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,699
MR. DINOSAUR TAKES OFF WITH THE AUTOGRAPH

936
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,403
It's karaoke.

937
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,338
SPOTS THE MISSION CARD

938
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,573
The song for 66782?

939
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,644
WHILE WOO-JAE PUNCHES IN THE NUMBER

940
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,613
THE DOOR TO THE NEXT ROOM OPENS SLOWLY

941
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,685
OBLIVIOUS, YOUNG WOO-JAE STARTS TO SING

942
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,989
Arariyo

943
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,891
MS. KIND GHOST CLOSES THE DOOR CAREFULLY

944
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,295
USES ALL SORTS OF TECHNIQUES

945
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,231
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT

946
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,434
My love, you're choosing to…

947
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,836
IS ANYONE THERE?

948
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,641
SHE'S DETERMINED TO SCARE HIM

949
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,478
SHRIEKS

950
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,381
What's this? Give it to me.

951
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,217
You have something for me, no?

952
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,485
THE HINT

953
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,555
MISSED HIS HAND IN THE DARKNESS

954
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,791
LOOKS FOR THE CLUE

955
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,025
Are you looking for the hint?

956
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,561
I wonder where it is.

957
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,530
Help me find it.

958
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,099
THE CLUE IS IMPORTANT, SO…

959
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,901
-I found it.
-Don't I scare you at all?

960
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,669
You petrify me.

961
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,870
-I do?
-Yeah.

962
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,938
FINALLY, A DECENT CHAT

963
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,540
I think I got it.

964
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,675
-Is this it?
-Yes.

965
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,645
Go up.

966
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,779
I must say,

967
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,416
it's not right to cut the song mid-verse.

968
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,686
The polite thing to do
is to let people finish the first verse.

969
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,854
Go upstairs.

970
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,093
RETURNS WHILE KICKING UP A DUST

971
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,861
HE'S MAKING A FUSS AGAIN

972
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,831
IT WAS SO SCARY, GUYS

973
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,366
You're so annoying.

974
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,800
Goodness.

975
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,769
What I wouldn't do to smack him.

976
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,171
I can't stand the sight of him.

977
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,773
Give us your clue!

978
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,842
Let's assemble them now.

979
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:58,909
-Okay.
-Let's do that.

980
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,878
-It's purple.
-Is it number one?

981
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,548
THEY MUST RESCUE KIM NA-BAK
WITH THE NUMBERS THEY FOUND

982
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,983
What if…

983
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,186
these form a passcode
to the safe downstairs?

984
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,689
When I gave it a shake,
it made clunking sounds.

985
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,625
AND LOCKED DOORS WERE BESIDE IT

986
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,727
I guess we have to return to the basement.

987
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,463
-It looks that way, but…
-It'd take ages to find the right combo.

988
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,698
Tell me about it.

989
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,502
-We should sort it out--
-I bet they handed out the clues in order.

990
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,338
-It'll be 55761.
-That makes sense.

991
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,006
They would've given us the clues in order.

992
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,208
We didn't have to overthink things, then.

993
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,643
YOU FOOLS

994
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,079
-Five, five, seven, six, one.
-That never occurred to me.

995
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,148
-Let's pick up a number each…
-Let's head downstairs.

996
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,250
-Remember, the code is 55761.
-Let's roll.

997
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,851
-Let's go.
-After you.

998
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,853
Can Woo-jae go alone?

999
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,257
WILL THE HEROES
BE ABLE TO RESCUE KIM NA-BAK SAFELY?

1000
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,325
Here it is.

1001
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,559
-You meant this spot, right?
-Yeah.

1002
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,627
Right here.

1003
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,695
-Here?
-Yeah.

1004
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,962
FEARLESS

1005
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,230
SCARED

1006
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,166
It's down at the end.

1007
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,233
STILL LOCKED SAFE

1008
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,203
What's with the basement anyway?

1009
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,771
-Damn it.
-What the…

1010
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,839
YOUNG WOO-JAE'S EXCITED

1011
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:02,907
The bang snaps.

1012
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,608
Give it a rest, will you?

1013
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,944
I'm popping them up
so you won't get startled.

1014
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,180
REACHED THE SAFE

1015
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,581
Here we are.

1016
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,117
-Shall I punch in the code?
-Yeah.

1017
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,052
It's 55761.

1018
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,224
WILL THE HINTS FORM THE PASSCODE
AS THEY EXPECT THEM TO?

1019
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,292
That didn't work.

1020
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:22,993
-What?
-Did we get it wrong?

1021
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,129
Maybe my number is nine instead of six.

1022
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,731
Come again? You think your number is nine?

1023
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,566
-I guess so.
-Try 55791.

1024
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,169
TRYING AGAIN WITH 55791

1025
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,237
It worked!

1026
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,305
That did it.

1027
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,940
-It's now open.
-Really? Let me see.

1028
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,174
-How incredible.
-What's in there?

1029
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,509
There's something in here.

1030
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,478
-Take it out.
-Dang, I don't like this.

1031
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,047
-Water.
-I'm scared.

1032
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,382
I can see some chocolate bars.

1033
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,449
Those are my favorite.

1034
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,585
AND A FLASHLIGHT?

1035
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,153
-What's this?
-Is that a key?

1036
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,221
ISN'T IT TOO LATE FOR THIS?

1037
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,789
It won't turn on.

1038
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,191
-Hold on. Are they sending us out again?
-Take everything out.

1039
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,627
A FLASHLIGHT WITH BLUE LIGHT FOUND

1040
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,995
Something fell off. It's a key.

1041
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,731
A MYSTERIOUS KEY FOUND

1042
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,134
Wait, is this what I think it is?

1043
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,235
Try it on one of these doors.

1044
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,536
Come on, Sook.

1045
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,572
THE KEY WOULDN'T TURN

1046
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,640
Use it on the other door.

1047
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,776
MAYBE WE CHOSE THE WRONG DOOR?

1048
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,811
A BUNDLE OF NERVES

1049
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,112
Try turning it.

1050
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,614
-It opened.
-Na-bak must be here.

1051
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,449
-She must be locked up in there.
-Na-bak!

1052
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,551
Hello?

1053
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,719
Are you here, Ms. Kim?

1054
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:22,787
Look, there's a closet.

1055
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,021
-Here it is.
-Look, a closet.

1056
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,122
A CLOSET FOUND UPON ENTERING

1057
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,690
She must be in there.

1058
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,125
Right in this room.

1059
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,527
She bought a closet.

1060
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,928
A RECEIPT FROM GO HIGH NOTE'S DIARY

1061
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,097
Na-bak could be stuck
in some closet in this house.

1062
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,398
Guys, come here.

1063
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,467
-Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Kim.

1064
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,502
There must be someone there.

1065
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,237
Look.

1066
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,006
WE'LL SAVE YOU SOON, MS. KIM!

1067
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,476
EMPTY

1068
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,211
NO ONE'S THERE?

1069
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,746
She might be in that room.

1070
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,714
Woo-jae, let's check out that room.

1071
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,584
-She must be in there.
-Go on, Woo-jae.

1072
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,685
BRAVE WOO-JAE IS THEIR CRUTCH

1073
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,555
A PITCH-DARK ROOM OF MYSTERY

1074
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,989
-Turn on the light.
-Turn it on.

1075
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,624
Maybe there's no lighting in here.

1076
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,792
HERE'S THE SWITCH

1077
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,127
They had the switch covered.

1078
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,495
Maybe we're supposed to go in.

1079
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,563
SO GET IN THERE, WOO-JAE

1080
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,630
Do you see a closet there?

1081
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,466
Give me that flashlight.

1082
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,000
Tell us if there's a closet or not.

1083
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,336
What's this place for anyway?

1084
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,038
What's that?

1085
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,539
What is this?

1086
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,674
Look closely.

1087
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,741
A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT FOUND!

1088
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,809
If you ask me…

1089
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,110
These are coat hangers.

1090
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,113
It looks like a pile of trash.

1091
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,382
-A closet should be here.
-Did we come into the wrong room?

1092
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,817
-No way.
-But she has to be here.

1093
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,853
Maybe we opened the wrong door.

1094
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,454
HMM…

1095
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,522
What? Look here.

1096
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,624
"When will I see light again?"

1097
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,960
Maybe she's locked away somewhere.

1098
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,729
AND…

1099
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,500
-Isn't that an arrow?
-It is!

1100
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,936
WHAT CAN THIS MEAN?

1101
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,773
THEY RETURN TO THE ROOM
THE ARROW IS POINTING TO

1102
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,408
We might find another code here.

1103
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,177
This isn't just a normal flashlight.

1104
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,313
It sure isn't. Check out the ceiling.
There you go.

1105
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,718
What if there's a secret button
that can reveal a hidden closet?

1106
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,587
Perhaps there's a secret door somewhere.

1107
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,989
The light came on.

1108
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,090
LET'S LOOK FOR A SECRET SPACE

1109
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,626
Don't turn on the light.
They covered up the switch on purpose.

1110
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,161
Look. There's a pattern down here.

1111
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,497
-Where?
-Maybe I'm mistaken.

1112
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,000
-I don't think there's anything here.
-Check this place too.

1113
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,635
Shine the flashlight onto this wall.

1114
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,637
-No, I don't think this is it.
-Something might be here.

1115
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,704
No.

1116
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,773
But the arrow
is clearly pointing to that room.

1117
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,841
Where is the arrow?

1118
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,543
-It does look like an arrow.
-Down there.

1119
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,711
AN ARROW TELLING THEM
TO GO TO THE NEXT ROOM

1120
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,014
WHAT IF IT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING?

1121
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,082
Guys, look here.

1122
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,618
This is well-organized,
almost suspiciously so.

1123
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,887
-Where do you mean?
-Here in the closet, Sook.

1124
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:37,955
WOO-YOUNG HAS DOUBTS HERE

1125
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,990
-This place is…
-Wait. I still--

1126
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,058
What the?

1127
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,695
WHILING FEELING OUT THE WALL,
HE'S NOTICED SOMETHING STRANGE

1128
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,630
SLAP, SLAP

1129
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,599
-Hey!
-What's the matter?

1130
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,304
-Dang.
-Let's move the closet.

1131
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,772
-What's up?
-This is it.

1132
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,440
Tell me.

1133
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,709
Wait. This isn't just a false wall.

1134
00:42:58,776 --> 00:42:59,777
We can just take it off.

1135
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:00,878
Let's rescue her quickly.

1136
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:01,946
We have to hurry.

1137
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,013
I can rip it open.

1138
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,114
-You can?
-Yeah.

1139
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,482
-Tear it off.
-Go ahead.

1140
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,684
You do it.

1141
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,751
THEY'RE ALL TOO AFRAID

1142
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,054
IN THE END, THEY PRESSURE
YOUNG WOO-JAE TO HANDLE THE TASK

1143
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,226
THE WALLPAPER IS EASILY PEELED OFF

1144
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,294
Someone's there.

1145
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,462
Gosh, this is crazy.

1146
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,631
-It's insane.
-We found her.

1147
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,800
-Someone's there.
-My gosh!

1148
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,668
-Right there.
-It must be Na-bak.

1149
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,804
Hey, Na-bak.

1150
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,239
We found Na-bak!

1151
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,175
-Ms. Kim!
-We found her.

1152
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,010
Na-bak is right here.

1153
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,545
That was incredible, Woo-young.

1154
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,581
Maybe the other room served as a hint
to make us check all the walls.

1155
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,684
Jin-kyung was right
to knock on all the walls.

1156
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,786
Ms. Kim, are you okay? Let's untie her.

1157
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:43,854
Yeah, let's do that.

1158
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,889
Great job hanging in there.

1159
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,058
I'm sorry it took us so long.

1160
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,194
Why didn't you get here earlier?
I've been waiting for you.

1161
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,261
This should do it.

1162
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,231
I bet it'd drive you insane,
being held in a place like this.

1163
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,799
Ms. Kim.

1164
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,968
THE PROLONGED CAPTIVITY
HAS MADE KIM NA-BAK WEAK

1165
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,572
-My gosh.
-Are you okay, Ms. Kim?

1166
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,241
The false wall idea was really neat.

1167
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,745
-They used the same wallpaper.
-Good work.

1168
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,912
How meticulous.

1169
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,347
THE NPCS HAVE COME OUT TO CELEBRATE

1170
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,816
All right. We did it!

1171
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,086
KIM NA-BAK FINALLY RETURNS
TO HER TEAM, DOLIVE

1172
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,655
Great job, everyone.

1173
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,224
GHOSTS: CHOI YU-RI, KIM RO-HA
DINOSAUR FAN: EOM SEON-MIN

1174
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,527
Ms. Kim Na-bak of the idol group doLIVE

1175
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,764
has been safely rescued
after being missing for three days.

1176
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,699
It has been confirmed

1177
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,368
that Ms. Kim had been confined
in the basement of her dorm.

1178
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:35,239
The culprit, Go High Pitch,
a former trainee of DRVR Entertainment,

1179
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,940
tried to flee the scene,

1180
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,509
but the police apprehended her.

1181
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:42,579
According to Ms. Kim's statement,
her rescuers were a group of superheroes.

1182
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:47,284
But their identities remain undisclosed
as they disappeared after her rescue.

1183
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,553
Many fans of doLIVE
and those in the showbiz industry

1184
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,389
stated that they'll remember
the unidentified group as true heroes

1185
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,991
and praised them highly.

1186
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:57,594
Could Ms. Kim's rescuers
have been true superheroes?

1187
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,667
HEROES DON'T PUSH ONESELF FORWARD

1188
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,369
Let's go!

1189
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,240
BUT IF SOMEONE IN NEED
STRETCHED OUT THEIR HAND…

1190
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,744
There he goes again.

1191
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,179
THE HEROES MIGHT RETURN FOR THEM

1192
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,214
Dang. I need to take a dump.

1193
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,282
Me too.

1194
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:23,253
THE HEROES WILL RETURN

1195
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,589
Next episode on Screwballs…

1196
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:26,657
To survive as characters

1197
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,325
-from fairy tales.
-A magical being of the lamp!

1198
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,393
GENIE

1199
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,694

CAPTAIN HOOK

1202
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,399
AND THE GUARDIAN DEITY OF MOUNTAINS

1203
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,668
CHARACTERS STRAIGHT FROM THE PICTURE BOOKS

1204
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,236
Your task for the day

1205
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,039
is to overcome
various trials and hardships

1206
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,941
to complete your own fairy tales.

1207
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,209
-Three and nine over two?
-Wrong.

1208
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,044
Why can't I handle such a simple question?

1209
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,179
Let's do this!

1210
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,647
HARDSHIPS ARE MEANT TO BE OVERCOME

1211
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,182
JUMPS TO HER FEET

1212
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,853
I think this is the most extreme task
in the history of Korean variety shows.

1213
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,288
-Okay.
-That is correct!

1214
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,758
-It's a success!
-Okay!

1215
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,292
LET'S CREATE OUR UNIQUE STORY TOGETHER

1216
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,827
AND YET…

1217
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,863
THEY ARE WAY TOO IMMATURE

1218
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,930
AND UNSUITABLE FOR CHILDREN

1219
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,066
-What on earth?
-A lizard in mating season.

1220
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,701
It's a math quiz.

1221
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,804
-We need the y-intercept.
-White patterned rice cake?

1222
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,572
-Patterned rice cake…
-It tastes amazing.

1223
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,041
-Totally.
-The chewy texture makes it my favorite.

1224
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,144
THEIR MATHEMATICAL UNDERSTANDING
IS AT PRESCHOOL LEVEL

1225
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,245

You and your tricks.

EVEN THE MOST DRAMATIC SOAP OPERA
WOULDN'T GO THIS FAR

1231
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,959
WILL THIS BAND OF IMMATURE ADULTS

1232
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,128
BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR OWN FAIRY TALE?

1233
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,464
This is a pure dumpster fire.
