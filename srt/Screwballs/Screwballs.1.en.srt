1
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,627
500 WON

2
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,468
A 500-won coin showing heads?

3
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,848
SCREWBALLS
IN SEARCH OF LOOSE SCREWS

4
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,223
WE GATHER TO OPEN UP
A NEW CHAPTER AT A NEW HOME

5
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,660
ARMED WITH NEW RESOLVES
EARLY INTO THE NEW YEAR

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,729
-Help us out. Make them laugh.
-Okay. Here goes.

7
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,397
-Get us three big laughs.
-Got it.

8
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,436
Freeze!

9
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,439
THE MOOD FREEZES OVER

10
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,773
SECOND ATTEMPT

11
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,809
SHAKING

12
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,876
My voice is going again.

13
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,878
That always happens whenever I'm here.

14
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,683
ALMOST DAMAGED HIS VOCAL CORDS
WHILE SHOOTING THE TEASER

15
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,552
Freeze!

16
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,087
YOU CHOSE THAT CHARACTER YOURSELF…

17
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,756
DRESS CODE FOR THE FIRST SHOOT

18
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,191
Please come in, ma'am.

19
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,695
The spirits graced her today.

20
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,500
AUNTIE OMAKASE NO. 1
FROM CULINARY CLASS WARS

21
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,304
I've prepared some dried seaweed.

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,439
SPIRITS MUST'VE HELPED
JUDGING BY HER PERFECT STYLING

23
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,742
Please try it. I used my secret recipe.

24
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,312
-Did you use rock laver?
-Yes. It tastes great.

25
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,147
Hello, it's been so long.

26
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,415
Gosh, it's so nice to see you again.

27
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,316
WIDE SMILE

28
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,217
SERIOUS FACE

29
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,954
This is one of a kind.
You won't find anything like this.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,856
Try it.

31
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,023
If it's to your liking,

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,460
you can always buy
10 sheets for 39,900 won.

33
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,629
It's great. Not too salty.

34
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, my. It's so nice to see you again.

35
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,801
I made it to the top six, you know.

36
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,702
QUICK BRAG

37
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,371
Next up is…

38
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,440
-I saw a vagrant in the back.
-Right.

39
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,842
He was originally a wild boar,

40
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,478
but a garlic-heavy diet
turned him into a man.

41
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,214
He used to be a boar.

42
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,083
I wonder who he is supposed to be.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,051
Blowing bubbles is his talent.

44
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,487
Would you like some dried seaweed?
That's 39,900 won a pack.

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,691
-Who are you supposed to be?
-What are you, a hedgehog?

46
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,959
Who are you?

47
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,027
Take a guess.

48
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,665
DID ANY OF THE SHOWS ON NETFLIX
HAVE ANY CAST LIKE HIM?

49
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,500
You look like a bum.

50
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,236
A Killer…

51
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,304
A killer?

52
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,607
You're just a killer?

53
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,875
What's going on?

54
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,310
-I'm Jang--
-A killer?

55
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,611
I'm Jang Nan-gam.

56
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,247
-"Jang Nan-gam"?
-Is this a joke?

57
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,515
SURELY, YOU CAN'T BE SON SUK-KU

58
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,017
CRIMINAL ACT, ARTICLE 307
ONE WHO DEFAMES ANOTHER…

59
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,118
You're not him at all.

60
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,220
He's feeling unsure himself.

61
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,422
-He's acting all awkward.
-You must feel it too.

62
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,658
I couldn't get his voice right.

63
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,494
-Go get it right and come back.
-But it's so difficult.

64
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,562
VOICE ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM

65
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,730
BUT WITH SOOK…

66
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,799
She got the character down 300%.

67
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,900
To be honest,

68
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,269
-I got so jazzed while drawing my brows.
-This time…

69
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,472
THE NEXT MEMBER WALKS IN
THOUGH NO ONE INVITED HIM

70
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,540
What the heck?

71
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,608
Again?

72
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,609
HE PROMPTLY EXITS

73
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,512
THE OTHERS GAVE THEIR ALL
FOR THE FIRST EPISODE

74
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,480
I'M SO MOVED

75
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,850
Why is he cracking up? I don't get it.

76
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,320
Why are you so dressed up?

77
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,788
-Who are you anyway?
-You're so you.

78
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,689
Who are you?

79
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,991
I'm the Professor from Money Heist: Korea.

80
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,292
PROFESSOR FROM MONEY HEIST:
KOREA

81
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,360
Now I get it.

82
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,196
-But you're closer to a bill of money.
-He's paper-thin.

83
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,399
Seriously, he's gotten thinner somehow.

84
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,634
Who is he supposed to be?

85
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,269
-He said he's a killer.
-A wild boar.

86
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,071
-A killer?
-That's what he said.

87
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,106
-Why a wild boar?
-Straight from the mountains.

88
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,175
Please don't misunderstand, dear viewers…

89
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,476
AMIDST THIS CASE OF DEFAMATION

90
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,811
THE LAST MEMBER AWAITS

91
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,879
…I'm dressed up as Son Suk-ku
from A Killer Paradox.

92
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,348
Everyone, not that way.

93
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,283
Son Suk…

94
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,853
A CERTAIN PERSON CAME PREPARED
TO GET THE YOUNGSTERS IN ORDER

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,155
HERE'S HONG YOUNG-HEE

96
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,992
Let us begin the game.

97
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,294
HER HEIGHT IS SIMILAR

98
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,396
Green light, red light

99
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,468
My goodness. You've prepared thoroughly.

100
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,336
WITH THE KIMCHI-SELLING YOUNG-HEE…
THAT MAKES ALL FIVE

101
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,537
These two are a couple!

102
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,339
BOTH DRESSED IN SQUID GAME COSTUMES

103
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,642
-They're of one mind.
-You two really click.

104
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,243
I used the bathroom earlier,

105
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,112
-and I clearly locked the door.
-And?

106
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,179
The thing is,

107
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,216
the door swung open
while I was wiping myself clean.

108
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,286
THE BATHROOM DOOR OPENED
WHILE HE WAS WIPING?

109
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,955
It was Jin-kyung, and I felt so violated.

110
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,356
THEN, JIN-KYUNG CAME IN

111
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,724
Why didn't you lock up?

112
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,226
I did, but she opened it anyway.

113
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,361
She has a habit of doing that.

114
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,929
IT'S NOT AN ESCAPE ROOM

115
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,665
-Are you a locksport?
-She's pretty skilled.

116
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,034
-Why would you do that?
-His skin was so milky white.

117
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,468
Jeez, you're awful.

118
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,137
Freeze!

119
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,905
Try that all you want.

120
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,241
-She won't get it. She didn't watch it.
-Yeah.

121
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,677
Her expression says it all.
"What is he doing?"

122
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,378
You know who you're dressed as, right?

123
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,080
Of… of course.

124
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,782
As for our Squid Game,

125
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,084
-it is one of the world-acclaimed shows
-"Our Squid Game"?

126
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,854
serviced through Netflix
as well as KBS… Oh, no.

127
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,956
I LOVE YOU, NETFLIX

128
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,392
We're still the same.

129
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,661
It's nice to greet you together
after a year-long break.

130
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,097
Our show has a new name.

131
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,598
In Korean, it's Screwdriver.

132
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,668
It fits us perfectly, doesn't it?
We're all screwdrivers.

133
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,203
Please love and support the show.

134
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,238
-Don't forget the subhead.
-Our warmest greetings to you.

135
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,373
What's the subhead?

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,508
-In Search of Loose Screws.
-In Search of Loose Screws?

137
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,912
-Screwdriver: In Search of Loose Screws.
-Let's take a bow.

138
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,980
Please shower us with love.
We'll do our best.

139
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,482
Please show us a lot of support!

140
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,653
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year!

141
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,388
WE MADE IT BACK

142
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,424
-To think we'd live to see this day.
-It's unbelievable.

143
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,892
It's been exactly one year.

144
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,594
Here's what I'm wondering.

145
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,696
Why does it feel like
I saw you just last week?

146
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,299
-She's right.
-All of the crew, too.

147
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,368
The cast hasn't changed,

148
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,704
and almost all of the crew returned, too.

149
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,773
This is truly touching.

150
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,274
The streaming platform was changed,

151
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,377
-but the production team's all here.
-It's a wonder.

152
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:21,114
-What group or company are you with?
-Before…

153
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,317
-Why are you sticking together?
-It's almost like a cult.

154
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,188
I even saw some producers
currently employed by KBS.

155
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,457
They're currently with KBS,

156
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,093
-so why would they come here?
-I hear they had some business nearby.

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,395
FEELS LIKE THE HOLIDAYS

158
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,563
I can now say this out loud.

159
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,932
My mother-in-law
was very excited about the reboot.

160
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,970
-You talk business with her?
-Right, that's different about you now.

161
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,773
I'M A MARRIED MAN NOW

162
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:51,477
Thank you, the cast and crew,
for coming to my wedding.

163
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,281
OCTOBER 20, 2024
SAE-HO'S MAGNIFICENT WEDDING

164
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,750
He said he only swung by

165
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,086
to check if this wedding wasn't a sham.

166
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,822
He could be getting married to a hologram.

167
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,426
THE WEDDING VOW FOLLOWS

168
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,995
Do you truly swear?

169
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,764
-Yes, I do!
-Yes…

170
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,766
ANIMATED

171
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,635
-Did she answer?
-Yeah, in a smaller voice.

172
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,370
I don't think she did.

173
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,971
First, the groom…

174
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,875
LEE DONG-WOOK'S CONGRATULATORY SPEECH

175
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,644
That was a great line.

176
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,446
I came to see Dong-wook, actually.

177
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,282
TAEYANG'S CONGRATULATORY PERFORMANCE

178
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,452
I honestly came here to hear Taeyang sing.

179
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,087
BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER

180
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,091
THOUGH THEIR GOALS DIFFERED,
THE CAST ATTENDED THE EVENT TOGETHER

181
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,127
By the way, Jin-kyung didn't come.

182
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:44,997
It was so shocking.

183
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,933
BREAKING NEWS
DID JIN-KYUNG MISS SAE-HO'S WEDDING?

184
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,035
-Seriously, Auntie!
-It really was shocking.

185
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,305
I mean, I looked for her everywhere.

186
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,440
After all those years--

187
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,309
-Watch it, you!
-For years,

188
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,712
you called Sae-ho and Chang-hee
your dearest friends

189
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,915
whom you loved like brothers.
So why did you miss it?

190
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,017
The situation was beyond my control.

191
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,118
Like what?

192
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,020
-You want to know what happened?
-Tell us.

193
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,023
-By the way--
-I'll tell you

194
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,992
-all the details later.
-Okay.

195
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,461
Can't you share your story on Netflix?

196
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,665
I'll fill you in on all the details.
You'll see that I had an emergency.

197
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,502
You know, I had an emergency earlier too.

198
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,669
PAT ON THE SHOULDER

199
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,439
PERHAPS THEY WERE A MARRIED COUPLE
IN THEIR PAST LIVES…

200
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:31,477
We have found a new home on Netflix.

201
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,980
When a show becomes a hit on Netflix,

202
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,115
you can earn international fame.

203
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,553
Even now, fans all over the globe
would be watching us.

204
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,687
They're watching!

205
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,189
There's this show I'm on.

206
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,091
I'm one of the hosts on, I mean…

207
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,861
I am a Single's Inferno emcee.

208
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,763
THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME

209
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,732
-Some will be delighted--
-Out of the blue?

210
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,800
As I was saying,
some will be glad to see me again.

211
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,404
Jin-kyung kept being recognized
by the locals in Hong Kong.

212
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,908
What's our show's international title?

213
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,876
It's Screwballs.

214
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,244
Oh, Screwballs?

215
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,281
Why don't you explain what it means,
since you're our global market expert?

216
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,849
So speaking of Screwballs,

217
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,052
You will find popsicles called "Screwbar"
in any Korean supermarket.

218
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,888
On Netflix, you can find Screwballs.

219
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,059
It means that something is twisted
like the groovy sides of a screw.

220
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,294
DID I GET IT RIGHT?

221
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,628
DID I GET IT WRONG?

222
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,196
-I guess you get partial points.
-Right.

223
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,464
Why don't we each make a guess?

224
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,300
What was it again, Scramble?

225
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,269
-That's my take.
-I see.

226
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,505
It means eccentric people.

227
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,006
I like the meaning.

228
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,910
The show will be promoted as Screwballs
in the international market.

229
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,746
This is my first appearance
on a Netflix original series.

230
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,682
I should tell you this first, though.

231
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,183
Technically speaking,

232
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,421
-this isn't a Netflix original series.
-I see.

233
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,488
Is it a domestic series?

234
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,490
Oh, no. It will reach overseas viewers.

235
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,026
-It's a weekly variety series--
-Still, it's on Netflix, right?

236
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,095
Got it. To put it simply,

237
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,530
the equivalent of KBS Joy.

238
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,199
-That's good.
-You nailed it.

239
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,435
COLD-HEADED SELF-ASSESSMENT

240
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,970
-Just like KBS Joy.
-Is that right?

241
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,572
At the end of the day,
it all comes from the same root.

242
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,640
You're so bright.

243
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,975
Or MBC Every1.

244
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,610
-Right?
-So we're calling it "Netflix Joy"?

245
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,346
The Netflix Joy setup
will be much easier for us.

246
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,114
Diving headlong can be tough.

247
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,515
So we'd better take it easy?

248
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,952
Before we begin the shoot in earnest,

249
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,688
let us know if we can mention
brands or business names.

250
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,357
You can talk about AMOUPRE freely.

251
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,259
Oh, my. AMOUPRE!

252
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,931
FINALLY FREED FROM THE SHACKLES
OF THE PUBLIC NETWORKS

253
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,633
MOVED

254
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,301
YOU'RE AMAZING, NETFLIX

255
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,473
Here's a shoutout
to Jin-kyung's THE MANDOO!

256
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,642
We're allowed to do that.

257
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,344
I've been dying to shout THE KIMCHI.

258
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,712
Thanks for that.

259
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,215
Bring your kimchi next week.
Let's have some while we shoot.

260
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,451
-That's a good idea.
-You can rock your AMOUPRE outfits.

261
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,054
-We sure seem to have more freedom.
-Totally.

262
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,257
To be honest,
I feel disappointed by you two.

263
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,625
We've longed for this reunion.

264
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,828
Couldn't you have done more for the team?

265
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,096
I mean, look at Sook.

266
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,933
-This is her usual look.
-I dress like this these days.

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,969
SOOK'S OUTFIT OF THE DAY

268
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,971
Couldn't you have made more effort?

269
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,241
At least I'm dressed
as a recognizable character.

270
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,509
Are you a person or an animal?

271
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,110
SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE HECK?

272
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,080
It should be made clear
if he's a person or not.

273
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,583
-He's a Neanderthal.
-Whether I'm a person or not…

274
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,785
A Neanderthal?

275
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,486
AHEM…

276
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,925
You know, this is the mustache
I wore on Beat Coin.

277
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,227
I took it out after a full year.

278
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,264
-You know that feeling, right?
-Sure.

279
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,267
Allow me to explain.
Let's say that I'm a boxer.

280
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,737
I've put on my gloves
to return to the ring after a year.

281
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,173
-Like a return match.
-That's how great it felt.

282
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,675
Or homo ludens.

283
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,810
Homo ludens?

284
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,079
Didn't I tell you
that my mother-in-law loves this show?

285
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,814
And you call me a Neanderthal.

286
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,582
IN CASE YOU FORGOT,
THIS IS HIS SON SUK-KU IMPRESSION

287
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,650
LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY

288
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,486
I guess he is giving me
a sense of déjà vu.

289
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,620
CHUCKLE

290
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,256
There's this picture depicting
the human evolution, isn't there?

291
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,960
Can you get up
and take on this pose, Sae-ho?

292
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,995
Just this once. Like so.

293
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,297
I've seen it somewhere.

294
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,900
AND HE DOES AS HE IS ASKED

295
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,136
THAT'S… PRETTY SIMILAR

296
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,537
-I see the resemblance.
-This is it, right?

297
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,206
We need another person.

298
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,442
LET ME JOIN YOU, THEN

299
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,645
SNORT

300
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,149
-That was hilarious.
-This is nice.

301
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,617
Yeah, it really is nice.

302
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,786
Whenever we got together,

303
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,721
we always talked about getting a reboot.

304
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,622
THAT'S RIGHT

305
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,891
When was that meeting again?

306
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,827
The time we shared a meal together

307
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,796
-with a camera up and rolling.
-It was mine, actually.

308
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,297
That was in June.

309
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,699
Yes, it was last June.

310
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,833
Was it last year?

311
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,502
WE KEPT IN TOUCH TO PLAN A REUNION

312
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,971
Look at us, teaming up again.

313
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,105
How long has it been?

314
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,974
Thanks for coming. My heart is racing.

315
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,076
See you soon.

316
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,047
LIKE A MIRACLE,
THE CAST GATHERED AGAIN AFTER A YEAR

317
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,216
It feels odd, somehow.

318
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,085
PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT US

319
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,088
By the way, while we were on break,

320
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,158
I read up on loads of articles
covering Woo-jae

321
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,261
and learned that he was friends
with Byeon Woo-seok.

322
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,629
-They're besties.
-I didn't know.

323
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,497
-Here she goes again.
-I had no idea.

324
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,534
But why would you
randomly demand an introduction?

325
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,736
As a fellow model…

326
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,271
It's not like I wanted to meet him.

327
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,940
We had an encounter.
I'll be upfront with you.

328
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,975
I might as well be honest.
We met in Japan.

329
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,744
-Did you pick his pocket?
-No.

330
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,045
How'd you encounter him then?

331
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,415
-I hope he can make a guest appearance.
-Why don't we invite Woo-seok over?

332
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,483
-Seriously?

333
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,118
THAT'S WOO-JAE FOR YOU

334
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,553
I bet he's lying again.

335
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,321
-This is insane.
-Our producers could do that.

336
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,057
-Give him a call.
-Why would I do that?

337
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,193
-If you're really close, call him.
-Go ahead.

338
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,828
-You can do it.
-You're being silly.

339
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,763
I saw them hanging out,
and they looked very close.

340
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,432
-Call him.
-Hey! A true close friend would pick up.

341
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,633
Do it.

342
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,268
-Call him.
-Yeah.

343
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,204
-Try it.
-Call him.

344
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,271
Call him.

345
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
-If you're really close, he'd answer.
-That's right.

346
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,609
-But it's too early to call just yet.
-Come on.

347
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,444
HIDING HIS PHONE FOR SAFEKEEPING

348
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,946
A real friend picks up in the morning.

349
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,449
If I ever do get in touch,
there's something I'm dying to ask him.

350
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,218
I have this question.

351
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,686
Send him a DM.

352
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,522
Can't you just DM him?

353
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,723
THAT'S GENIUS

354
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,327
We bumped into each other in Osaka, Japan.

355
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,962
-Were you two alone?
-And then he…

356
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,896
ALL EYES ON HER

357
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,131
WHAT EXACTLY DID HE DO

358
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,067
WHEN YOU TWO MET?

359
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,936
Forget it.

360
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,638
I'm not telling.

361
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,975
Jin-kyung was there
to attend the 2024 MAMA Awards.

362
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,109
-Oh, there?
-I see.

363
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,310
SO IT WASN'T A CHANCE ENCOUNTER

364
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,747
Woo-seok did tell me this
after his trip to Osaka.

365
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,150
"I ran into Mr. Han Ki-bum
while I was in Osaka, Woo-jae."

366
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,386
He said he felt conflicted
whether he should greet him.

367
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,488
-Did he play basketball too?
-That must've been Jin-kyung.

368
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,657
-It's because he's tall.
-Oh, I see.

369
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,292
That's what she must be talking about.

370
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,427
Could you ask Jae-yeong
to accompany Woo-seok?

371
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,330
-Jae-yeong is Sook's favorite.
-That's true.

372
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,598
She loved the Judge from Hell.

373
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,301
JAE-YEONG?

374
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,703
It wasn't all too long ago that I…

375
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,273
-Did you run into Jae-yeong too?
-No, I meant to say--

376
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,241
He said he met Mr. Han as well.

377
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,713
NEVER MIND…

378
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:19,118
Can we invite guests to the show?

379
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,219
Of course.

380
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,620
So you're open to our input.

381
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,155
Jun-ho should come visit too.

382
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,491
YOU ARE ALL WELCOME

383
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,592
-Call him.
-Do it.

384
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,894
Let's talk about
what Jin-kyung's been up to.

385
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,629
She took the Korean GED.

386
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,633
-I learned that people put up prize money.
-They sure did.

387
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,735
To be honest,
I could've put up 300 million won.

388
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,974
Because I was so sure
that she couldn't get a perfect score.

389
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,944
-Shall we compete on middle-school GED?
-My goodness.

390
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,211
CAN THE CREW PLACE BETS?

391
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,380
-My gosh.
-Don't give us time to prepare, though.

392
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,550
-Give us exam papers out of nowhere.
-That's insane.

393
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,686
Okay. Let her take pens and paper.

394
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,454
I'll take the exam
with my hands behind my back.

395
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,324
SERIOUSLY, THAT JERK…

396
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,192
While these two work on the exam,

397
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,727
we can prepare the school lunch together.

398
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,396
We'll roast the dried seaweed,

399
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,499
and deliver the lunch boxes
during the shoot.

400
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,601
I want spicy stir-fried pork, please.

401
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:14,606
It's been about 20 to 25 minutes
since we began filming,

402
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,742
and I haven't even read
the first sentence of my script.

403
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,377
-But that's nothing new.
-Right.

404
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,180
Let's be original and ditch the scripts.

405
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,082
-Won't it be more fun that way?
-But I respect him

406
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,585
for preparing scripts though he knows
he'd never get to read them.

407
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,120
Let me read what I prepared.

408
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,588
Here we go.

409
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,458
I'll now read the first line
from the second page.

410
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,893
This is the logline of our show.

411
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,498
"The top 99% of talents working through
the ups and downs of their lives."

412
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,871
"The top 99%"?

413
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,174
Where does that put us, exactly?
What does that mean?

414
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,542
IS THAT A GOOD THING?

415
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,879
When I first heard of the show's title,
I thought it captured our essence.

416
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,316
I mean, we all have a screw loose.

417
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,052
I honestly think I have a couple loose.

418
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,221
-We're aware of that.
-When I look at Jin-kyung,

419
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,189
I sometimes think

420
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,525
that she's missing about four huge nails.

421
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,662
We all have a screw loose
whereas his is on far too tight.

422
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,164
He needs to loosen up.

423
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,432
TURN, TURN, TURN

424
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,834
Honestly,
Woo-jae is the brains of this show.

425
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,302
Not at all. I said so before,

426
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,472
but let me repeat it. I'm not smart.
These guys are just too dim.

427
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,208
I see you haven't changed at all.

428
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,378
I've never felt that I was smart
in any other group.

429
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,614
But in Woo-jae's case,

430
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,316
he falls behind
when it comes to personality.

431
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,285
-That's right.
-He's rock-bottom.

432
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,353
He's far from decent.

433
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,255
-He's got an awful personality.
-He's like a robot.

434
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,189
THANK YOU

435
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,360
HE'S ACTUALLY KIND AND TENDER-HEARTED

436
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,763
Here's to hoping that Screwballs
makes it big on Netflix.

437
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,299
Now, I'll announce the theme of the day.

438
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,868
-It's Killer Boot Camp.
-"Killer Boot Camp"?

439
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,538
-Killer Boot Camp.
-Do we have to become a killer?

440
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,574
Netflix is the home
to top-quality killer content.

441
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,675
For the show to do well…

442
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,410
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO
FOR ITS SUCCESS?

443
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,311
…you have to…

444
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,114
WOO-YOUNG CAN'T BELIEVE IT

445
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,482
He can't even read off the page.

446
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,616
Didn't he write it himself?

447
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,851
What's up with him?

448
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,587
IT IS TOO EMBARRASSING
TO PRESENT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE

449
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,523
Netflix is the home
to top-quality killer content.

450
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,760
For the show to do well,
you have to train as killers.

451
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,762
-All right.
-Killers need to be composed.

452
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:21,266
You'll carry out various tasks
prepared to train you further.

453
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,168
-Killer training, huh?
-That's all.

454
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,004
Before we begin the training,

455
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,641
let's check out the code of conduct
that all killers observe.

456
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,778
I believe it is necessary to be aware.

457
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,114
PRESENTING A HANGING SCROLL

458
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,515
-Shall I untie it?
-Go ahead.

459
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,351
Are we really becoming killers?

460
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,019
This's something you'd see
on the John Wick series.

461
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,454
The killers…

462
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,989
Oh, right. John Wick.

463
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,391
WHAT ARE THESE DANGEROUS
SCREWBALL KILLER CODES?

464
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,727
How are we going to be killers
when she can't even untie that?

465
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,562
Is she tying it back up?

466
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,763
Hang on.

467
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,466
Did you have to tie the knot so tightly?

468
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,034
Help us, Sook.

469
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,936
Pulling it might do the trick.

470
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,404
-Do all five have to do it?
-Pull it.

471
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:04,176
PRESENTING THE TOP 99% OF KILLERS

472
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,944
-Up here.
-Does anyone have scissors?

473
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,079
AT LEAST SOOK USES HER HEAD

474
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,015
-Cutting it here will do.
-Wait, wait. Let's put it on the floor.

475
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,718
Is this necessary?

476
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,120
-I really want to untie it.
-Jeez.

477
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,321
Next time, I won't tie it.

478
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,589
PULLING THE CORD WOULD UNTIE IT

479
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,825
Oh, let's just cut the cord.

480
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,826
We can cut it here.

481
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,295
EVENTUALLY AGREED TO CUT IT

482
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,363
-Done.
-Phew.

483
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
Here.

484
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,601
One, two, three. Ta-da.

485
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,271
FINALLY, THE KILLERS' CODE

486
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,040
"Killers are brave."

487
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,544
-Wait. Those supposed codes…
-"Killers persevere."

488
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,979
I can picture myself in about 20 minutes.

489
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,814
Could you read them out loud, Sook?

490
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,083
"Killers are brave."

491
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,519
-"Killers persevere."
-That's ominous.

492
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,088
"Killers never waver."

493
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,724
-I see you really haven't changed.
-"Killers are mind readers."

494
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,893
"Killers are sexy"?

495
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,397
-"Killers are strong."
-So annoying.

496
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,832
"Killers don't nitpick."

497
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,535
I don't like the sound of the last one.

498
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,005
-We're not supposed to nitpick?
-I guess we'll be tickling each other.

499
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,808
I visualize water guns
from how we're not supposed to waver.

500
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,043
-What about being mind readers?
-We have to be psychics?

501
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,044
WHAT COULD IT BE?

502
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,515
Now, I would appreciate it
if you participated in today's training

503
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,617
with those codes in mind.

504
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,054
I have received some reports.

505
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,324
Apparently, many of you have acted in ways

506
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,027
that go against the code
that killers should be cold-blooded.

507
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,095
Sook.

508
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,898
Me? I'm as cold-blooded as anyone can be.

509
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:38,003
One of our camera crew is
a camping enthusiast.

510
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,073
We were told you gave away
one million won's worth of camping gear?

511
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,842
You didn't budge
when Woo-young begged for it.

512
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,910
WEEP

513
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,978
Me?

514
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,846
What did I give them?

515
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,181
It was a lamp.

516
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,416
-Right, I gave you a lamp.
-A lamp.

517
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,118
-It didn't cost that much.
-Also,

518
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,754
he's been with us ever since Beat Coin.

519
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,191
Over the year we worked together,
I always greeted him politely.

520
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,260
I went, "Hello, sir,"
and bowed to him, too.

521
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,195
He'd go, "Hi, Sae-ho."

522
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,732
We became close, and I've always
treated him like an older brother.

523
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,469
I joined Two Days and One Night
and heard Se-yoon addressing him casually.

524
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,603
THEY ARE THE SAME AGE

525
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,473
So I went, "Show him manners.
He's older than us."

526
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,508
Se-yoon goes, "He's the same age as us."

527
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,010
HE WASN'T OLDER THAN ME?

528
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,211
What the heck?

529
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,979
HEH, SORRY

530
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:25,717
Ji-hun told me that he couldn't get
the right moment to tell me that.

531
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,887
-We've become such good friends.
-So you have.

532
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,991
For your information,
his name isn't Ji-hun. It's Ji-ung.

533
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,061
-Your name was Ji-ung?
-"Ung."

534
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,195
Seriously, dude.

535
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,964
-I thought it was Ji-hun.
-You know nothing.

536
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,266
IT TURNS OUT SAE-HO DIDN'T KNOW
HIS NAME NOR HIS AGE

537
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,101
Pay more attention to our crew.

538
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,003
She's right.

539
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,338
Stop right there. Sit back down.

540
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,973
KILLERS EVADE ADVERSITY

541
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,908
Jin-kyung.

542
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,178
I've had reports
that you're far from cold-blooded.

543
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,447
Apparently, you've sent
kimchi and dumplings

544
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,751
to producers, writers,
and crew every holiday.

545
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,119
That's huge, right?

546
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,821
She really does…

547
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,190
have a knack for buttering up top dogs.

548
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,858
What are you on about?

549
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,759
THAT JERK AGAIN…

550
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,995
There are better expressions
like creative powers.

551
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,797
-Wait--
-She's an ace at flattery.

552
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,265
She made sure not to miss

553
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,900
even the most junior members.

554
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:15,834
Kudos, Jin-kyung.

555
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,904
-You didn't have to bring that up.
-So that's how you earn 100 billion won.

556
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,572
-Stop it.
-You have a problem there.

557
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,375
Let's move on to Sae-ho.
While we were working on Beat Coin,

558
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,911
two of our writers got married.

559
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,580
And you volunteered to emcee
both their weddings.

560
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,549
A KILLER SPECIALIZING IN EMCEEING

561
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,817
You emceed twice?

562
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,152
-How could I not?
-Well done.

563
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,454
DISQUALIFIED KILLER

564
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,189
-Since we're a team.
-And Woo-young.

565
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,026
At every team dinner, you stayed to
check that all of the crew got home safely

566
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,794
before you went home yourself.

567
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,329
UNSURE

568
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,430
But that's--

569
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,499
He just wanted to drink more himself?

570
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,434
-She's right!
-Is that commendable?

571
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,702
I can explain--

572
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,105
Didn't he once return
even after we sent him home?

573
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,140
AN INFLUX OF TESTIMONIES

574
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,475
Don't forget that epic night.

575
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,845
He left the karaoke to go home
only to be singing in the next room.

576
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:00,912
It was 5 a.m.

577
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,348
-That was Jin-kyung.
-Oh, was it?

578
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,416
Stop right there.

579
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,752
-You talk too much.
-So that was Jin-kyung.

580
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,554
Well, the reports are true.

581
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,323
DISQUALIFIED AS A KILLER BY A TINY MARGIN

582
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,824
Whenever we had drinks.

583
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,826
Now that your cold-bloodedness--

584
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,294
-Was there nothing on him?
-Wait. Woo-jae!

585
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,964
Last but not least,
let's talk about Woo-jae.

586
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,666
SUDDENLY ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY

587
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,468
Maybe you're a natural-born killer.

588
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,970
I'm just a killer now?

589
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,037
They must have nothing.

590
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,273
-That must be it.
-He's truly cold-blooded.

591
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,642
-There's nothing on him?
-None.

592
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,110
He must have something.

593
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,512
-You have nothing?
-Really?

594
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,247
They're putting on an act.

595
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,517
-Seriously, is this a skit or what?
-You must have something.

596
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,118
This isn't even funny.

597
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,953
-It's because he's so calculating.
-Give them time.

598
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,588
-"One, two, three, four."
-You're trying to mess with me.

599
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,390
-Drop the act.
-Let me help.

600
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,792
THEY TICK ME OFF

601
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,661
I felt so grateful to Woo-jae

602
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,062
only a few days ago.

603
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,397
When I walked into the set,

604
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,565
he said, "You're here."

605
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,233
PFFT

606
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,170
I can't tell you how grateful I felt.

607
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,674
-My heart swelled with gratitude.
-Viewers might actually believe you.

608
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,309
Still, that was funny. It was!

609
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,811
KILLERS DON'T NITPICK (WHEN IT'S FUNNY)

610
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,879
We have determined that Woo-jae

611
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,849
has all the qualities of a fine killer.

612
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,417
Congrats, Woo-jae.

613
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,420
Wait, we have one report. I knew it.

614
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,923
-Don't make it up now.
-While we were working on Beat Coin,

615
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,726
Woo-jae once won
a coffee machine as a prize.

616
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,796
When the writer working with him
looked at it with envious eyes,

617
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,566
he handed it over right on the spot.

618
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,168
Seriously, guys. That's so lame.

619
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,205
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

620
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,506
Come on.

621
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,144
We've all been dying to say that.

622
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,181
Even I think that was well-deserved.

623
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,885
How could they prepare
such an anticlimactic tale?

624
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,186
This is ridiculous.

625
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,556
They should've just pictured me
as a cold-hearted villain.

626
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,226
-At least you looked charismatic then.
-That was fun.

627
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,461
It was a good bit.

628
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,764
Well, yeah. I do remember
giving my prize to the writer.

629
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,633
DISQUALIFIED FOR
BEING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SKIT

630
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,668
-All right.
-That was hilarious.

631
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,739
Your task for today is to become
cold-blooded, brutal killers.

632
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,876
Please don't forget the codes
no matter what befalls you.

633
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,345
Persevere against the hardships

634
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,480
and demonstrate bravery
befitting your role.

635
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:20,185
Please take part in today's training
with enthusiasm.

636
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,486
When is our lunch break?

637
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,791
I'll clap the slate now. One, two, three.

638
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,060
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE BOOT CAMP
OF THE RAGTAG WANNABE KILLERS?

639
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,730
SCREWBALLS OST - REBOOT
