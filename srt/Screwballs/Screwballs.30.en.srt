1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,235
AT LEAST ONCE IN A LIFETIME,

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,404
YOU PICTURE HOW YOU WANT TO BE

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,506
Because of this thought

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,378
WHILE SOME DREAM
OF BECOMING YU JAE-SEOK…

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,448
OTHERS DREAM
OF BECOMING A HIP-HOP KID

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,083
CHOOGUMI

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,219
A COINED TERM WHICH MEANS

8
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,089
THE IDEAL VIBE, IMAGE, OR STYLE
THAT A PERSON WISHES TO PORTRAY

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:27,093
TODAY'S DRESS CODE
"CHOOGUMI"

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,229
-When I heard today's dress code,
-What's yours?

11
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,998
-I wondered what my choogumi was.
-Jung Woo-sung?

12
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,967
-Denim.
-That's too much.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,169
I'll have to complain a bit today.

14
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,170
I mean it.

15
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,606
And you think that's a proper choogumi?

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,075
You think it actually makes sense?

17
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,877
HOW ON EARTH ARE THEY DRESSED UP?

18
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,780
Willy Wonka

19
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,648
Willy Wonka

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,883
HER CHOOGUMI IS WILLY WONKA?

21
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,353
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

22
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,188
Welcome.

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,156
TA-DA

24
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,690
I'm Kim Sook, the factory chief

25
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,361
from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,
who always has her way in life.

26
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,663
HER CHOOGUMI IS
TO LIVE THE WAY SHE WANTS

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,799
-Willy Wonka
-Look.

28
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:06,699
Willy Wonka…

29
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,934
-Wait. Oompa Loompa?
-I…

30
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,103
Isn't it supposed to be choogumi?

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,404
That's right.

32
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,174
That's not choogumi.
She just dressed up as she wanted.

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,342
What are you saying?
This is my Choogumi!

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,079
My outfit is way too normal. I just…

35
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,713
HIS CHOOGUMI IS JUST DENIM
WHICH IS VERY ORDINARY

36
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,049
You did your thing.

37
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,984
-What?
-You're dressed up like Jung Woo-sung.

38
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,352
"Did you eat anything?"

39
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,454
You are, right?

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,488
"Did you?"

41
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,857
Do "If you drink this up,
you'll go out with me."

42
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,492
Apologize to me!

43
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,229
But really, I'm not lying.
As soon as I arrived…

44
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,899
You'll see those
who distorted the meaning of choogumi.

45
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,668
If this is how it is,

46
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,670
just don't give us a dress code.

47
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,105
-I precisely followed…
-Don't--

48
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,207
How many customers are we having today?

49
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,242
-Two, four, six…
-See?

50
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,010
-This is ridiculous.
-We have a lot here today.

51
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,645
-Welcome.
-What's his?

52
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,747
For 20 years,

53
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,050
I've been running a jjuggumi restaurant

54
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,885
by the shore in Busan.

55
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,687
-It's choogumi.
-Jjuggumi as in webfoot octopus.

56
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,088
That's today's dress code, no?

57
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,623
-Choogumi.
-Jjuggumi.

58
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,325
-Choogumi.
-Jjuggumi.

59
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,329
I've sold spicy webfoot octopus
for 20 years by the shore in Busan.

60
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,331
-I'll make it delicious for you.
-Three servings.

61
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,235
From next time, I'm going to distort
whatever dress code that's given to me.

62
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,805
I've brought a whole lot
of webfoot octopuses today.

63
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,240
Do you mind if I go bring them?

64
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,774
Is that okay?

65
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,743
Are they fresh?

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,882
HERE COMES THE WEBFOOT OCTOPUS

67
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,850
I've brought so much.

68
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,185
What's wrong?

69
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,287
Today's dress code

70
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,421
is jjuggumi, no?

71
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,390
Gosh, I don't wanna do this.

72
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,592
Isn't it Jjuggumi Day?

73
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,096
Don't they know what choogumi is?

74
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,430
-Today is…
-Swell

75
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,566
THE STAFF DEFINITELY TOLD THEM
IT WAS "CHOOGUMI"

76
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,436
-Jjuggumi in the water
-It's worth tens of servings.

77
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,472
-Spicy webfoot octopus.
-I am

78
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,174
-How do you want me to cook it?
-Jjuggumi

79
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,242
-Jju
-Do you want me

80
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,777
-to add some cheese?
-Jjuggumi

81
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,479
-Hold on.
-Swell

82
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,014
Aren't you the Capsaicin God?

83
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,316
No, I'm different from him.

84
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,084
-Aren't you that guy?
-I am…

85
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,920
Jjuggumi

86
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,655
Swell

87
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,625
SUSPICIONS OF HIM PLAGIARIZING HIMSELF

88
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,960
Let me explain a bit.

89
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,164
My manager said
today's dress code was jjuggumi.

90
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,133
I was like, "Jjuggumi? That's so random."

91
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,102
He said, "No, it's choogumi."

92
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,506
Then, I realized my choogumi
was a sense of innocence.

93
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,242
-But you don't look innocent.
-So,

94
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,677
I decided to me ambitious.

95
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,711
Jjuggumi!

96
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,279
You guys make a nice duo today.

97
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,549
He said he was a jjuggumi place owner,
so I told him to stir-fry me.

98
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,884
I'll do just that.

99
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,385
-How many portions?
-Then,

100
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,223
the two of you didn't plan this in advance

101
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,557
-They didn't.
-…or anything, did you?

102
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,226
-Never.
-You found out when you came?

103
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,495
I'm sorry, but I love you
Everything is a lie

104
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,565
-Sorry I didn't know, I realized it now
-Is she Andy Warhol?

105
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,866
Walk right out, please.

106
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,935
-I'm sorry, but I love you
-She's Andy Warhol?

107
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,737
RUDLY ENOUGH,
HER CHOOGUMI IS G-DRAGON

108
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,506
You're like a character
from The King of Fighters.

109
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,244
Seriously, he didn't put
any effort into it at all.

110
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,614
We all get paid for this show,
but look at what you're doing.

111
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,016
I can wear costumes and stuff too.

112
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,619
As if we don't want to look cool.

113
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,221
Are you saying G-DRAGON isn't cool?

114
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,091
No, that's not it.

115
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,027
I'm not.

116
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,996
I mean, weren't you going
for something cool?

117
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,998
-I am.
-Then, what?

118
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,733
I look so cool today.

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,835
I love it.

120
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,169
You made a perfect impersonation.

121
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,638
-Right.
-It suits you so well.

122
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,007
If you were going for this style,

123
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,341
you should've worn what
you bought in Stockholm.

124
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,213
You bastard.

125
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,181
I'm gonna kill you.

126
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,082
Aren't I right?

127
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,384
-Wait.
-You're dead meat.

128
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,419
-It's similar.
-Jjuggumi over there.

129
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,756
Nevertheless, you outdid yourself.

130
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,591
-Is your choogumi G-DRAGON?
-Yes.

131
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,192
Can you tell us why?

132
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,362
I wasn't going to say this,

133
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,898
but I'm being serious.
I'm not trying to be funny.

134
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,799
G-DRAGON and I…

135
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,634
-You guys are close?
-What?

136
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,003
CHUCKLES

137
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,904
What is it?

138
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,938
CONFUSED JJUGGUMI

139
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,873
What can be there?

140
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,341
-I guess there isn't. Let's move on.
-Wait.

141
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,111
I'm just being careful
in case news reports are made.

142
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,380
-It can't be worse than then.
-Well…

143
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,416
THERE CAN'T BE MORE ARTICLES THAN THEN

144
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,684
Watch your back.

145
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,786
-Hit him once.
-Get on the floor.

146
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,687
OFF TO DISCIPLINE

147
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,788
I can take the beating.

148
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,691
We don't beat people directly.

149
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,292
Let's stop here. Get up now.

150
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,193
HE SUPPORTS NON-VIOLENCE

151
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,962
-We have to consider our situation.
-Thank you, sir.

152
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,666
So, Jin-kyung, tell us the story.

153
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,669
Tell us at least one of the two stories.

154
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,905
Your story with G-DRAGON,

155
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,307
or your recent news.

156
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,309
Be honest with us.

157
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,678
-You and your words, seriously.
-Oh, recently?

158
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,915
Why bring up something
that's already over?

159
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,650
No, it's only the beginning.

160
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,185
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME

161
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,621
I was very reluctant to come here.

162
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,891
We can talk about this
because it's only among us.

163
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,728
Jin-kyung has said she'd sign up
to Duo, the matchmaking agency.

164
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,598
It's just among us.

165
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,102
-Sorry.
-She actually texted on our group chat

166
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,537
that she'd sign up to Duo.

167
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,872
You read that, right?

168
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,340
She must've did that

169
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,710
because we were so worried
regarding her issue.

170
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,412
There's one called Gayeon too.

171
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,148
This means

172
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,950
all of us can do it together.

173
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,152
-A blind date?
-Yes.

174
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,286
The truth is,

175
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,655
I really wanted
to join you guys back then.

176
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,557
SHE REALLY WANTED TO JOIN THE BLIND DATE

177
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,227
Don't tell me that was why you…

178
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,962
Let's move on.

179
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,830
IT WAS JUST FOR LAUGHS

180
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,633
This morning, G-DRAGON and I…

181
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,901
-A call?
-Or a text?

182
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,802
I wrote him a letter.

183
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,238
-That's called a fan letter.
-Is that so?

184
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,807
That's called unilateral communication.

185
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,510
We've got to talk about him first.

186
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,411
-What about me?
-What about him?

187
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,880
What happened with him
at the get-together?

188
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,915
-Get-together?
-Sit down.

189
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,250
-Let's sit down and talk.
-He…

190
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,451
-I meant to be funny.
-Can I?

191
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,619
Let's talk. You…

192
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,987
It was to be funny. I sent the money.

193
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,823
I sent you double the amount,
so why didn't you…

194
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,325
-That's…
-I gave it back to you.

195
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,194
-Whatever. Let's make this clear.
-We must.

196
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,695
-It's already clear.
-Look.

197
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,964
Let me explain the situation clearly.

198
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,400
We had dinner all together
after a long time that day

199
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,435
at Bubble and Cockles.

200
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:19,806
The staff said they'd pay half the bill.

201
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,507
We drew two people from a roulette.

202
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,643
-What the?
-Yes, this roulette…

203
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,112
The staff, Woo-young, and I were

204
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,248
to pay for the bill that day.

205
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,083
There were many people,

206
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,886
and the bill was around two million won.

207
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,722
Woo-young had to leave early
due to his morning schedule.

208
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,257
And then, it was time to pay.

209
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,226
The staff said they'd pay a million won.

210
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,662
But someone said, "That's not right

211
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,198
considering how much
the staff is going through."

212
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,266
Then, Mr. Hong Jin-kyung…

213
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,202
-Oops, my bad.
-Mister?

214
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,337
-She's suddenly a mister?
-Sorry.

215
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,305
I'm sorry.

216
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,372
OPEN YOUR EYES

217
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,541
She gladly paid a million won.

218
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,311
Give her a hand!

219
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,579
JIN-KYUNG PAID A MILLION WON

220
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,518
I've got to pay on behalf of the staff.

221
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,553
-No, Jin-kyung.
-Don't. Come on.

222
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,623
-No, we said we'd…
-Okay?

223
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,124
FORGET IT

224
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,826
THANK YOU

225
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,996
-Hong Jin-kyung!
-Hong Jin-kyung!

226
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,333
AND THE PAYMENT WAS SETTLED
CORDIALLY…

227
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,736
The restaurant owner is
a childhood friend of mine.

228
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,907
I told him that Woo-young and I
would split the rest.

229
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,809
He said Woo-young could take his time.

230
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,411
"It'd be awkward for you to pay it all
and ask him later on.

231
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,480
Since you guys are close friends,

232
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,884
I'll ask him
to pay the bill later myself."

233
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,252
That was what happened.

234
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,621
But it was better to settle it soon,
so the next day,

235
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,557
I called and sent him the money.

236
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,359
-Then…
-That's good.

237
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,029
What I thought was messy was…

238
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,999
I checked my texts
after filming another show.

239
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,401
There were so many unread texts.

240
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,502
It turned out Sae-ho…

241
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,605
SORRY, WOO-YOUNG,
BUT I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE MONEY

242
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,541
SAE-HO WAS WAITING
FOR THAT MONEY TO BE WIRED

243
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,776
I LEFT IT IN YOUR MAILBOX

244
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,478
BUT THIS IDIOT WASN'T EASY

245
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,181
"Woo-young,
I just got a call from the owner."

246
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,284
"He says he's struggling."

247
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,087
Jin-kyung said, "He's about to go broke
because of that 500,000 won."

248
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,290
She said he couldn't buy ingredients.

249
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,092
-They were making up stories.
-We made things up.

250
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,227
Everything was to be okay

251
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,996
-if he sent 500,000 won.
-Which he didn't.

252
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,364
-He didn't.
-He didn't.

253
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,667
He stayed silent without answering us.

254
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,535
He even left the group chat.

255
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,970
-That's not true.
-He did.

256
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,672
-We invited you back.
-He sent the money

257
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,940
That's not true.

258
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,541
She thinks I left for real.

259
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,877
He texted,
"Jang Woo-young has left the room."

260
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:38,778
Well…

261
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,815
Look. He wrote that up. It was a prank.

262
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,483
I thought you left.

263
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,720
-In-seok wrote that.
-I thought…

264
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,089
he left the group chat
over that 500,000 won for real.

265
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,124
That was why I wrote,
"What a horrible guy."

266
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,827
-She thought you left for real.
-No!

267
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,030
-No wonder why she all got worked up.
-I thought he left.

268
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,099
"We need to discipline this guy."

269
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,268
I was like, "I'm still here.
Why does she keep…"

270
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,736
Discipline me for what?

271
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,771
-So…
-Was that why you said that?

272
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,840
-You thought he left?
-Exactly!

273
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,909
-I wanted to knock some sense into him.
-She suddenly

274
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,010
went crazy.

275
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,613
Dear viewers, consider it a skit.

276
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,348
It wasn't for real. It was staged.

277
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,817
-So, please understand.
-No! It wasn't staged.

278
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,051
That part was staged.

279
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,320
I… Listen to this first.

280
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,455
It was funny.

281
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,160
I couldn't buy ingredients today.

282
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,096
This is his actual voice.

283
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,233
I called him and he asked, "What's up?"

284
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,534
I said, "Let's cut to the chase."

285
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,471
"Record 'I couldn't buy ingredients today'
and send it to me." He asked why.

286
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,373
I said, "Just send it. I need it."

287
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,410
I couldn't buy ingredients today.

288
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,512
-Because of Woo-young.
-So,

289
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,114
Woo-young wired the money.

290
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,882
I thought everything was settled.

291
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,151
But this lunatic wired 50,000 won.

292
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,119
HE WIRED 50,000 WON

293
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,787
I just said I'd send the money.

294
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,522
It was just too messed up.

295
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,225
-Woo-jae sent 500,000 won.
-I did.

296
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,993
WOO-JAE SENT 500,000 WON

297
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,664
-He…
-I was joking around when he suddenly…

298
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,165
Because you sent 50,000 won.

299
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,400
You left the group chat.

300
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,335
No, I didn't!

301
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,870
That was In-seok who texted,

302
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,139
"Jang Woo-young has left the group chat."

303
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,940
-You didn't leave?
-I didn't actually leave.

304
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,511
Woo-jae was so annoying there.

305
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,713
He said he'd send the money and he did.

306
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,150
I was like, "Hold on.
I was just joking around."

307
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,419
He went, "This is how
we get our opening story."

308
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,486
THIS IS HOW WE GET OUR OPENING STORY

309
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,821
YOU'RE JUST DYING TO GET ME

310
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,691
Share our text exchanges with the viewers.

311
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,859
THEY'RE SCREWED EVEN IN THEIR DAILY LIVES

312
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,262
Once, I ate with Woo-young.

313
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,596
We ate together.

314
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,065
-He's making it up again.
-He said

315
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,566
he needed to go for a recording.

316
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,902
I told him not to pay the bill
just in case.

317
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,171
He said, "I feel sorry
that you treat me all the time."

318
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,505
"Let me pay the bill today."

319
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,773
I said, "Just go."

320
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,975
"No, I'll pay for our food today."

321
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,243
Then, he left.

322
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,112
Later, I started walking out

323
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,513
when someone stopped me and went,

324
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,514
"You haven't paid the bill."

325
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,682
"What?"

326
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,751
WHAT?

327
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,919
"Woo-young didn't?"

328
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,054
"What… He just left."

329
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,290
-I wish I could stir-fry you.
-Go ahead.

330
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,425
HE'S ALWAYS OPEN TO STIR-FRYING

331
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,494
This story was made up.

332
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,029
HE MADE UP THIS STORY

333
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,097
WOO-YOUNG SENT 500,000 WON TOO

334
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,631
I'm good at making stories, right?

335
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,235
That day, Woo-young
sent me 500,000 won too.

336
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,970
So, we have 500,000 won

337
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,638
saved for our next get-together.

338
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,307
What Woo-jae sent?

339
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,908
-It's saved.
-We have it saved.

340
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,811
Remember. I'm keeping it with me.

341
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,214
-Have you no conscience?
-No.

342
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,281
HE KEPT THE LEAST BIT OF HIS CONSCIENCE

343
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,917
-You guys are all fired up today.
-So it seems.

344
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,385
Did we even get one line in
from today's script?

345
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,054
Not even a single sentence.

346
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,622
Read it another time.

347
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,923
We have enough for today.

348
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,558
I didn't realize the situation.

349
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,162
Today's given dress code is choogumi.

350
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,998
One misheard it as jjuggumi.

351
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,001
Another intentionally misheard it.

352
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,970
Today's special is about the words

353
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,539
that have been going viral
along with choogumi.

354
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,241
-Jin-kyung, do you perhaps…
-Go on.

355
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,910
…know what a Teto woman
and an Egen woman are?

356
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,879
-Of course.
-An Egen man?

357
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,215
A Teto woman means a woman

358
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,317
with a lot of testonia.

359
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,787
-And an Egen…
-What did you say?

360
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,191
An Egen woman is a woman
with a lot of egenstory.

361
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,192
"Egenstory."

362
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,294
A man with a lot of egenstory!

363
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,129
She's gotten worse.

364
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,030
SHE GOT NOTHING RIGHT

365
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,099
Have you heard of testonia or egenstory?

366
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,268
But you guys all understood.

367
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,869
-That's what matters.
-Right.

368
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,271
-As long as you understand.
-We got you.

369
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,606
-Of course.
-We talk to communicate, you know.

370
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,008
Humans made those words too.

371
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,609
-Of course.
-It doesn't matter.

372
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:35,014
Teto human is from the word, testosterone.

373
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,583
-It refers to those who act…
-They act before talking.

374
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,388
…before talk, and values facts
and energy rather than emotions.

375
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,090
Examples of Teto celebrities may be…

376
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,358
Choi Min-soo.

377
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,327
-Don Lee.
-Choo Sung-hoon.

378
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,196
-Right, them.
-Sung-hoon.

379
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,599
On the other hand, an Estrogen human is

380
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,202
from the word, estrogen.

381
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:01,106
It refers to those who are relatively
sentimental and delicate.

382
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,777
They easily empathize with others.
They're sweet and warm.

383
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,747
Examples of Egen celebrities
who are often mentioned online

384
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,317
are Park Bo-gum, Jung Hae-in,

385
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,019
Joo Woo-jae, and others.

386
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,788
I'm in the wrong category.

387
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,923
I shouldn't be in this category.

388
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,024
I'm a Teto guy.

389
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,160
-Your choogumi is Teto?
-Yes.

390
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,695
I'm rather a Teto guy.

391
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,996
A guy with a puke attitude.

392
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,631
A GUY WITH A PUKE ATTITUDE?

393
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,000
Tell me if this is an example of Teto.

394
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,935
I went to a sauna once.

395
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,104
Someone older than me came in.

396
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,474
He started brushing his teeth.

397
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,081
SHOUTS

398
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,416
-Egen.
-He just has no manners.

399
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,417
-You know, right?
-Hey.

400
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,652
RETCHES

401
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,787
THAT'S DISGUSTING

402
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,422
Sae-ho, that's Egen.

403
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,891
That's Egen?

404
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,993
They don't even think
about cleaning their tongues.

405
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,795
With a huge toothbrush, they go…

406
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,197
Nows that's Teto.

407
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,865
THAT'S HOW TETO PEOPLE BRUSH THEIR TEETH

408
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,966
This is what Teto guys do.

409
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,237
LET'S BRUSH OUR TEETH QUIETLY
IN A PUBLIC PLACE

410
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,473
We talk about these terms for fun,

411
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,410
-but it never means one is better.
-Never.

412
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,512
-It's like MBTI.
-It's a preference.

413
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,149
Right, it's a fun way
to define each other's preferences.

414
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,452
Today, you're going to play team games.

415
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,390
You'll be divided into two teams,
Team Teto and Team Egen.

416
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,559
It's a team game
with three players on each team.

417
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,194
-We need one more person.
-We're one man short.

418
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,030
-We must have a guest.
-A guest?

419
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,898
A camera director?

420
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,934
A GUEST OR A CAMERA DIRECTOR?

421
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,602
We have our typical example
of Egen over there.

422
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,937
-Right.
-He armwrestled me.

423
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,338
Our audio director.

424
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,572
Sun-kyu.

425
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,108
Like the blind date special,
usually when the number is odd…

426
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,311
-Are we having Hye-seon?
-Is it Hye-seon?

427
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,211
Is Hye-seon coming?

428
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,880
Are we going to get beaten up again?

429
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,382
We have someone here.

430
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,584
-Really? That's good.
-Yes.

431
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,287
Tell us if it's a man or a woman.

432
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,290
We've invited a woman
to meet the gender ratio.

433
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,125
-Is it Hye-seon?
-It must be her.

434
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,761
YES OR NO?

435
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,763
It's Hye-seon for sure.

436
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,098
-It's not her.
-It's not her.

437
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,299
-No.
-No?

438
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,301
Which one of us is
a good match with her?

439
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,905
In my opinion, maybe Sook.

440
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,240
-Hold on.
-Eun-i?

441
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,209
-Eun-i?
-She might be pretty old.

442
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,844
-Maybe it's her.
-Is it Eun-i?

443
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,647
-No, Eun-i…
-Eun-i!

444
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,783
Please come out.

445
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,051
Who is it?

446
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,420
CURIOUS

447
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,691
WAIT, THAT'S…

448
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,463
CHO HYE-LYUN, A PERFECT FIT
FOR THIS BATTLE OF TETO VS EGEN

449
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,332
-Hye-lyun!
-Hello.

450
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,002
HER SIGNATURE MOVE

451
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,571
WOO-YOUNG, THAT'S PARK KYUNG-RIM'S SONG

452
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,107
Stop. Let's act normal.

453
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,876
-"I'll make you pay."
-No.

454
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,611
-Octopus.
-Hye-lyun.

455
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,512
Stop it, Octopus.

456
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,080
-How have you been?
-I…

457
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,782
-I… Hold on.
-Hye-lyun.

458
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,984
-Congrats on coming back.
-I thought…

459
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,754
I'm here.

460
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,155
As soon as she saw me,

461
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,924
she said, "Congrats on coming back."

462
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,659
Now that the world is better than before,

463
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,728
-she make it back without a hitch.
-Of course.

464
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,164
It was quite tough for me, you know.

465
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,466
But she benefited from the better world.

466
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,035
Like this…

467
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,369
What matters is you're happy now.

468
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,937
-I'm happy now.
-Right.

469
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,139
-Congrats.
-That's good.

470
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,840
-Well done.
-Hye-lyun is here with us!

471
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,542
IN ANY CASE, WELCOME!

472
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,943
Cho Hye-lyun!

473
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,345
-Cho Hye-lyun!
-Cho Hye-lyun!

474
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,680
I'm actually here as an Egen woman.

475
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,082
She's an Egen woman.

476
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,053
Her outfit has more of an Egen vibe.

477
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,321
You know Saja Boys, right?

478
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,457
-You know them?
-I do.

479
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,491
-They're popular.
-From K-pop Demon Hunters.

480
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,026
Yes, in that movie,

481
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,628
they sing Rolling Pop… Something Pop.

482
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,762
-It's Soda Pop.
-Oh, right.

483
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,266
-"Rolling Pop."
-I didn't have much time to study.

484
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,635
You read Wikipedia
on your way here, didn't you?

485
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,870
THIS IS IT, RIGHT?

486
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,105
HER CHOOGUMI IS K-POP IDOL

487
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,642
I'm sorry, but your jeans alone

488
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,812
are like what a wrestler
from the WWF wears.

489
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,680
No, they're idol jeans.

490
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,881
-A warrior's.
-It's for idols.

491
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,783
-No.
-A little…

492
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,085
It's because you see it that way.

493
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,186
A little like…

494
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,254
If you don't mind,
please introduce yourself.

495
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,422
-There's no need.
-No?

496
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,857
That's old-fashioned.

497
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,559
-I see.
-Introduce myself? It's all done.

498
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,029
TETO'S ENERGY INTIMIDATES JJUGGUMI

499
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,897
-Just add subtitles.
-Right.

500
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,799
"Egen Lady Cho Hye-lyun." Like that.

501
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,700
JUST AS YOU ASKED

502
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,036
I'm sorry, but could you
show us a wrestling move?

503
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:24,970
A wrestling move?

504
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,073
Why I oughtta just catch you up…

505
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,041
And it's over.

506
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,409
I'm actually here as an Egen woman.

507
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,477
JUST 1 MINUTE AGO

508
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,778
You're an Egen woman?

509
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,980
-I am.
-You are?

510
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,515
-An Egen woman…
-That's not it.

511
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,684
You're making me look like…

512
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,852
-Right.
-I…

513
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,955
I woke up at 5:20 a.m.
and got my makeup done in Cheongdam.

514
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,125
But your hair tells me
that you go to a barber shop.

515
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,793
No. No, no. This is…

516
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,028
NO X 3

517
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,031
-They cut it too short this time.
-Don't they apply shaving cream

518
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,099
-and shave your neck first?
-No, they didn't.

519
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,001
-No?
-Why must I explain myself?

520
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,236
I don't understand.

521
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,238
One of the things we have in common

522
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,974
is that we have to explain many things
as soon as we appear.

523
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,376
I needed to explain many things in life.

524
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,180
Anyway, Hye-lyun is here
with us on Screwballs.

525
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,681
Please say hello.

526
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,183
Gosh, Screws.

527
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,618
-"Screws"?
-What?

528
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,287
THAT'S NICE AND FOLKSY

529
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:16,955
It's not Screws.

530
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,257
-It's Screwballs.
-"Screws."

531
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,325
You sound just like my dad!

532
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,728
In Search of the Lost Key. Right?

533
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,196
-No?
-What…

534
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,766
SCREWS: IN SEARCH OF THE LOST KEY

535
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,569
WE'LL WORK HARDER

536
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,470
-What?
-What?

537
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,639
-Lost… Oh, Lost Steering Wheels.
-Right.

538
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,874
It's been five minutes

539
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,075
since she joined us.

540
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,344
We questioned her 17 times.

541
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,281
And she explained herself 20 times.

542
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,248
No.

543
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,783
She was questioned 17 times.

544
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,784
NO, 30 TIMES

545
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,986
No, that's not it. No.

546
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,956
-Well… Right.
-Well done.

547
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,558
-You keep…
-She's…

548
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,127
-Well done.
-You keep…

549
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,496
-Why do you keep…
-That marks the end.

550
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,097
What a nice end.

551
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,332
Anyway, let's go.

552
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,500
ANYWAY, LET'S GET TO WORK

553
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,467
What should we do?

554
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,370
-You released songs too.
-My recent song is Broken Time Machine.

555
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,574
I have a live show at 2 p.m.
that I have to go to after this.

556
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,976
-The song's good.
-It's really good.

557
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,912
Wearing makeup and high heels

558
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,783
-Who asked her to sing?
-Looking pretty walking

559
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,819
-Is she perhaps here to promote her album?
-No.

560
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,389
-It's no use anyway.
-She doesn't join shows to promote stuff.

561
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,959
-She joins shows out of loyalty.
-Of course.

562
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,094
-Of course.
-That alone.

563
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,763
When her colleagues or juniors
get married,

564
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,132
-she offers to perform.
-She performs at their weddings.

565
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,701
I was meaning to say this.

566
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,303
On Sae-ho's wedding day,

567
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,138
I had something pre-scheduled.

568
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,775
-I wanted to perform for him.
-Right.

569
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,444
Didn't Gummy do it?

570
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,678
Well…

571
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,414
-Didn't GUMMY…
-She couldn't make it.

572
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,784
-TAEYANG did it because she couldn't.
-Right, he did.

573
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,353
I did ask him, though.

574
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,255
I felt so bad that I called him

575
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,057
and asked if he could change
his wedding date

576
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,692
-so I could sing.
-You really wanted to do it.

577
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,661
She asked me when,
and I said it was the 20th.

578
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,763
She asked if I could change it
to the 19th.

579
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,765
That was because I wanted
to do it for him.

580
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,400
And he was very polite.

581
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,736
He could've said, "That's ridiculous."

582
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,970
But he didn't.

583
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,740
When I asked him to change the date,
he said, "Oh, the date?"

584
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,142
"You mean, change the date?"

585
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,744
He repeated it six times.

586
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,847
-Hye-lyun.
-He should've just been direct.

587
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,582
You don't have to feel bad

588
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,718
because you have four chances left

589
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,786
to sing at our weddings.

590
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,588
-Why?
-You have us four.

591
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,723
Oh, you'll get married again?

592
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,924
-She's open.
-Support her.

593
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,660
-Right. Okay.
-She's open to it.

594
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,495
-As many as four.
-Okay.

595
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,331
If you find her agreeable,
can't you marry her?

596
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,332
-Me?
-Once will do.

597
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,301
-They are the couple in this show.
-I see.

598
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,202
You know, earlier this morning…

599
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,172
I was quite bothered
when the news articles were out.

600
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,640
WHAT IS HE SAYING?

601
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,442
Seriously. I wondered
if it was because of me.

602
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,110
HIS EGO IS OVERINFLATED

603
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,712
-Just in case, you know.
-Right.

604
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,981
How do you feel about Jin-kyung?

605
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,215
How do you feel about Jin-kyung?

606
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,651
A SHOCKING QUESTION

607
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,086
She needs to do it soon

608
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,755
because her estrogen levels
will take a nose dive.

609
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,658
-Goodness.
-She's at that stage…

610
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,794
What are we even talking about?

611
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,629
Let's welcome Hye-lyun!

612
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:11,563
QUICKLY WRAPPING UP

613
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,032
THEIR TIE FROM THE PAST LIFE
WOULDN'T BE CUT OFF EASILY

614
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,801
We broke up.

615
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,836
Since we're your juniors,

616
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,404
we'd like you to tell us.

617
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,007
-What?
-How far can you tolerate us?

618
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,276
Tell us what you'd find offending.

619
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,279
First off,
my husband finds it uncomfortable

620
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,214
with anyone physically touching me.

621
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,616
That'd be uncomfortable for us too,
so don't worry.

622
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,718
-You guys?
-Yes.

623
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,486
Why would you be?

624
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,122
Why? You're actors.

625
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,390
Well, in any case.

626
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,525
-Would you be uncomfortable?
-Excuse me?

627
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,394
-It'd be uncomfortable to touch me?
-Excuse me?

628
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,032
Thank you so much for joining us today.

629
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,569
An old picture of you and Sook

630
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,604
-went viral on social media once.
-Right.

631
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,505
At Seoul Grand Park.

632
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,974
I was 20, and were you 23?

633
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,676
-Yes.
-Right.

634
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,445
She's two years my senior.

635
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,314
-Yes.
-I'm from the 12th recruitment.

636
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,349
-And she's from the 10th.
-The 10th.

637
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,053
I don't think she enjoyed
group activities back then.

638
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,954
Right.

639
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,390
Once, we went somewhere
with all the fellow comedians,

640
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,560
and she said,
"Hey, let's go out front for a bit."

641
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,562
I said, "Let's go smoke."

642
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,465
We smoked back then.

643
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,701
She was my only smoking buddy.

644
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,303
I'm holding a cigarette box
in the picture.

645
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,508
THE LONG-TIME FRIENDS HAVE MET
IN A LONG WHILE…

646
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,309
-Show us your dance.
-The two of us?

647
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,145
-Yes, you two.
-However we want?

648
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,212
Yes. Music, please.

649
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,649
THE SENIOR AND JUNIOR
HAVE GROUPED UP

650
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,851
BOUNCES

651
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,153
IN PERFECT HARMONY

652
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,421
Amazing.

653
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,322
Here they go!

654
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,690
MOVING THEIR JOINTS
IN UNISON

655
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,192
What a scene!

656
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,593
BEFORE GOD SOOK,
THERE WAS HYE-LYUN

657
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,829
-They're using a lot of space.
-It's like a battle.

658
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,432
THEIR JUNIOR WIGGLES HARD,
WANTING TO JOIN THEIR DANCE PARTY

659
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,402
APPROACHES

660
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,505
THE COMEDIANS GATHER AT THE CENTER
AS IF THEY'RE BEWITCHED

661
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,374
Let's do a lap. We'll follow you.

662
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,442
Follow me.

663
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,509
Follow me, guys.

664
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,244
CONGRATS, SAE-HO AND JIN-KYUNG

665
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,613
CHO HYE-LYUN, THIS WOMAN ALONE

666
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,016
MAKES GROUP MADNESS POSSIBLE

667
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,051
NO ONE HAS ASKED FOR THIS

668
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,120
-This is addictive.
-Gosh.

669
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,788
Hey. Let's stop.

670
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,158
-Tidy the carpet.
-Okay.

671
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,494
SHE SAID NO MORE

672
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,628
Are you kidding me?

673
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,864
-That was fun.
-Let's take a break.

674
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,299
PUT THE AC ON FULL BLAST

675
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,102
-Let's get you guys into teams now.
-Okay.

676
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:35,073
Go ahead and talk
about what you think you are in turns.

677
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,508
-We'll touch on it.
-Well…

678
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,843
I think…

679
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,612
-Egen. Anyone can see that.
-Actually…

680
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,215
I was an idol with a wild image.

681
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,149
You're right.

682
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,917
-I'm…
-So, you're Teto.

683
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,319
And I'm…

684
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,888
On the outside, I'm a little…

685
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,690
Well…

686
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,757
Spit it out.

687
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,860
CAN'T TOLERATE HIS SPEED

688
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,361
-I'm sorry.
-She hates that.

689
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,662
-So slow.
-Don't hesitate.

690
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,164
That was enough for three sentences.

691
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,033
-Now…
-The whole world watches this on Netflix.

692
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,536
That's enough for her
to make us laugh three times.

693
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,204
Make it quick, or be out.

694
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,273
Are you Teto or Egen? Choose one.

695
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,542
-One, two, three.
-I choose Egen.

696
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,644
-You think you're Egen?
-Yes.

697
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,279
-Egen.
-What about you, Jin-kyung?

698
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,614
-Egen.
-She's a divorcee.

699
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,982
RIGHT, OF COURSE

700
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,216
-Right, you're…
-Then…

701
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,018
But she runs a business and stuff.

702
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,754
-Right.
-She's completely Teto.

703
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,955
She's global.

704
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,858
-"I can expand my business to the States."
-Right.

705
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,060
-Given that, she's Teto.
-You're right.

706
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,729
-You're not Egen.
-Right.

707
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,732
-Your caliber is on another scale.
-Of course.

708
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,033
Okay, I'll go with Teto.

709
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,801
-Okay.
-You're Teto. Sook?

710
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,138
-I'm…
-You seem like a Teto person,

711
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,707
but on the inside,
I think you're Egen to the bone.

712
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,578
There was a time when I was Egen.

713
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,314
I really like to use the sewing machine.

714
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,215
Oh, right.

715
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,517
-You studied design.
-I like embroidering.

716
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:56,621
I used to enjoy doing things
while seated like drawing.

717
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,593
But now, I enjoy camping and fishing.
And stuff like that.

718
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,962
Isn't your current favorite brand Bosch?

719
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,933
-I love it. I really do.
-They sell drills.

720
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,436
You actually do woodworking
in carpenter pants.

721
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,473
As I learned woodworking and stuff,
I became a Teto woman.

722
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,675
Woo-jae?

723
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,809
I'm Teto.

724
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,710
What?

725
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,045
WHY DOES HE INSIST ON IT?

726
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,746
-What?
-Explain.

727
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,114
A man with a puke attitude.

728
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,449
HE GOT THE CONCEPT WRONG

729
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,984
What about you, Sae-ho?

730
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,252
I wonder what I am.

731
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,987
What do you think?

732
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,792
Honestly speaking, I kind of like
to lead people and all.

733
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,728
-But on the inside, I'm…
-Right, you're delicate.

734
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,297
-But his energy flat-out says he's Teto.
-That's interesting.

735
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:43,068
Say I call him ten times.

736
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,469
Nine out of ten times,

737
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,672
-he'd say he's out with people.
-Right.

738
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,907
He's always with people.

739
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,742
That energy must be Teto.

740
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,678
But with Hye-lyun here, we're all Egen.

741
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,879
ALL EGEN COMPARED TO HER

742
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,083
-Compared to her, we're all Egen.
-Right.

743
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,918
Then, Hye-lyun.

744
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,786
Who would you choose
if you were to recruit

745
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,555
-two people as the leader of Team Teto?
-Me?

746
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,357
-Yes.
-Sae-ho for sure.

747
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,758
GOOD CHOICE

748
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,393
And Sook.

749
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,096
-Okay. I guess that's rather right.
-Sure.

750
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,364
We're Team Comedian.

751
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,166
-Team Comedian.
-They've got all the looks…

752
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,370
If we take a picture together,
everyone might believe we're family.

753
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,606
-Perfect.
-Of course.

754
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,375
FAMILY MOTTO: A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY

755
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,778
Do you admit to being Egen, Woo-jae?

756
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,081
Teto people don't care
which team they're in.

757
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,716
"Why even discuss
whether you're Teto or Egen?"

758
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,818
-"I just say I'm Teto."
-Accepting it means you're Teto.

759
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:34,986
-I accept it.
-Okay.

760
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,755
HOLD ON, THAT MEANS…

761
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,656
-Okay.
-The three of us…

762
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:41,593
Are we perhaps going to play games
in two teams of three?

763
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,894
-Yes.
-Yes.

764
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,029
HMM

765
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,164
NEGATIVE DREAM TEAM

766
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,233
Do we have to use our bodies?

767
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,567
For some games.

768
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,636
Some games require wit.

769
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,038
Sounds good.

770
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,839
Woo-jae, we can do it.

771
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,108
-We can do it.
-Yeah.

772
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,377
All right, then.
The final members of Team Teto

773
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,212
are Hye-lyun, Sook, and Sae-ho.

774
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,848
The members of Team Egen
are Jin-kyung, Woo-jae, and Woo-young.

775
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,317
You'll compete
in these two teams of three today.

776
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,752
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

777
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,824
ACTING COOL AS IF HE'S TETO

778
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,159
Goodness, Woo-jae…

779
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,260
What are you doing, Woo-jae?

780
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,495
I don't know.
I'm sure it's not easy for him.

781
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,030
His butt will get sore.

782
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,066
-What about him?
-Look at what he's doing.

783
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,767
He wants to prove he's Teto.

784
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,804
-He's a bit like a junior comedian.
-Yes, you're right.

785
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,338
He practically is.

786
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,873
A good-looking comedian.

787
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,942
If he'd auditioned, he would've passed it.

788
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,577
Have a seat and take it easy.

789
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,312
Let me tell you about today's games.

790
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,716
If the games are too much about one side,

791
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,617
it may be disadvantageous
for the other side.

792
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,819
So, we've prepared games.

793
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,522
Some that are advantageous for Egens,
and some that are advantageous for Tetos.

794
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,392
A humiliating penalty

795
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,461
-awaits the losing team.
-Humiliating?

796
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,329
-Humiliating.
-The first game

797
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,899
requires the symbol of testosterone,
a strong physical abilities.

798
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,268
-It's a Pillow Fight.
-Okay.

799
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,305
-When you were young, have you ever…
-On field trips.

800
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,773
-We would.
-Sure.

801
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,475
It was menacing back then.

802
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,443
Teenagers can take it too far, you know.

803
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,446
Some went overboard
and put stuff in the pillows.

804
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,749
-Like bricks?
-No, bricks are going too far.

805
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,984
-That'd be a crime.
-Right.

806
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,520
They'd put something a bit heavy inside.

807
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,588
THEY DIDN'T BREAK THE LAW

808
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,056
We've prepared pillows

809
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,425
with nothing but cotton inside.

810
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,529
One is big, and the other two are small.

811
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,197
Here's the rule.

812
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,534
You'll kneel on the folded blankets
and have a one-on-one fight.

813
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,237
The first person to fall
will be the loser.

814
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,539
In short,
it's about how strong your core is.

815
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,042
You have to win three out of five matches.

816
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,378
Since this is a Teto game,

817
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,248
a player from Team Teto will choose

818
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,684
who will play from the other team.

819
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,253
What's important here is,

820
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,588
it's feels bad
being struck in the head with a pillow.

821
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:51,589
Right.

822
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,559
You can come to an agreement on that.

823
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,362
You can agree not to aim at the face,
to aim only at shoulders,

824
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,564
-or to aim only at the face.
-That's very Egen of you.

825
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,099
Well, you know…

826
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,400
I just won't use a pillow.

827
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,636
How do you win then?

828
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,904
By enduring it.

829
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,906
-I'll tire them out.
-Really?

830
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,340
Now that's a real fight.

831
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,910
-I'll make the other get exhausted.
-Mark your words.

832
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,444
You better keep your word.

833
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,147
How about this, then?
I'll be against Jin-kyung

834
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,282
-and take her attacks…
-Okay.

835
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,917
…without hitting her
until she gets exhausted.

836
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,686
-With your hands behind your back.
-That or…

837
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,021
-how about this?
-How exciting.

838
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,423
-I'll take her attacks like this.
-Good.

839
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,691
Just hit him hard.

840
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,793
-Beat her.
-I'll mark an easy start, then.

841
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,496
This is a game, so please understand me
saying, "You, come out."

842
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,031
-You, come out.
-Okay.

843
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,999
Okay. Do we do as discussed?

844
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,467
-Yes.
-You sound like a go-getter!

845
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,136
You, come out!

846
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,103
Okay…

847
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,172
Jin-kyung, give me that. Take this and…

848
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,341
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO HOLD IT

849
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,511
GATHERING ALL THE COTTON
FOR STRONGER HITS

850
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,981
Gosh, Woo-jae knows how to play this game.

851
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,383
Just in case, let me…

852
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,421
Why are you doing that?
You said you wouldn't hit me.

853
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,555
I'm just going to hold it.

854
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,891
-You said you'd do this.
-You said you wouldn't hit me.

855
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,459
-That you'd put your hands like this.
-Yeah.

856
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,527
I'll do this.

857
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,495
-No!
-Listen. It's because…

858
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,497
-Don't be a coward.
-Hear me out.

859
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,765
This is just in case

860
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,435
I fall to the back and hit my head.
It's for protection.

861
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,604
-Come on, Hye-lyun. He said this earlier.
-I won't.

862
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,105
He said he'd do this,

863
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,608
but he didn't say
he wouldn't use a pillow.

864
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,508
Teto.

865
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,277
-I'll just do this.
-Okay, protect your head.

866
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,211
-Just this.
-It's for balance.

867
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,946
This is so not Teto.

868
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,214
Goodness.

869
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,582
Jin-kyung is strong.

870
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,286
-If she sways first…
-It might actually work.

871
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,888
-She may sway.
-There's a good chance.

872
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,189
She can't even keep her balance.

873
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,824
She can't even stay seated.

874
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,791
This is over.

875
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,495
The blankets are leaning forward
on this side.

876
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,697
HER DELICATE EGEN TEAMMATES
ADJUST THE BLANKETS FOR HER

877
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,665
There, Jin-kyung.

878
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,033
-Come up here.
-I'm tired.

879
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,068
You didn't do anything to be tired.

880
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,938
-Come on!
-I won't hit you.

881
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,339
Strain yourself.

882
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,141
-Strain your lower abdomen.
-There you go.

883
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,409
-Can I let go?
-Yes.

884
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,379
ABSOLUTELY CALM
AS HIS OPPONENT IS ALREADY STRUGGLING

885
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,147
Okay. Good.

886
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,582
-Ready, go.
-Sae-ho, just…

887
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,783
Just withstand it.

888
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,418
Just withstand it.

889
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,287
Just stay still.

890
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,622
-Stay still.
-No. You can do it, Jin-kyung.

891
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,291
In the Zero Two pose.

892
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,625
SHE'S ATTACKING ALL SHE WANTS

893
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,693
Just stay still, Sae-ho.

894
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,863
TEAM EGEN HAS HOPES OF WINNING
AT THIS RATE

895
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,131
Jin-kyung will fall on her own.

896
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,867
There you go. It's over.

897
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,268
-Next.
-Okay.

898
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,670
You can come down now.

899
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,705
TEAM TETO
CHO SAE-HO WINS

900
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:25,376
See? True victory is beating the other
without even harming them.

901
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,444
That's what real swag is.

902
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,480
-Sook, are you up?
-Yes.

903
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,448
SOOK IS UP FOR ROUND 2

904
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,984
Hold on. Hey, you. Come out.

905
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,752
JANG WOO-YOUNG, COME OUT

906
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,989
Woo-young must've done this
many times in the past.

907
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,192
I can do a lot of acrobatic stunts
and stuff.

908
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,094
I can even dance on top of this.

909
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,595
Your feet touched the floor.

910
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,164
-Did they?
-That's not acceptable.

911
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,432
Feign ignorance.

912
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,533
-Ready.
-Get ready.

913
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,234
-Set.
-Sorry, Sook.

914
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,602
You can go first.

915
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,804
Wait.

916
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,838
That's too weak.

917
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,173
That's not Teto.

918
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,207
Feel free to attack first.

919
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,976
-It might be upsetting.
-Keep going.

920
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,978
Right. Good.

921
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:00,878
It's okay.

922
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,413
This is a game, so…

923
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,614
This is a game.

924
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,018
SOOK TOOK A STRONG BLOW

925
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,486
WHILE TEASING HIM AT EASE

926
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,254
Sook, this is a game.

927
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,155
We're here shooting.

928
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,090
I BETTER NOT PLAY EASY

929
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,358
Sook, you're…

930
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,059
This is just a game!

931
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,261
It's all right. Bring it on.

932
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,130
Nice. Okay. It's all right, Sook.

933
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,431
Sook.

934
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,835
AFTER ALL THAT BEATING,
HE BEGINS TO ATTACK

935
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,871
BUT THEN, HE LOSES BALANCE IN HIS CORE

936
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:27,939
TEAM EGEN
WOO-YOUNG LOSES

937
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,107
-Gosh.
-What was that?

938
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,608
She looks so scary.

939
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,843
He sucks.

940
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,511
-What was that?
-Sook is amazing.

941
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,480
-Let me fight with Woo-young.
-Okay.

942
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,882
-Since this is a game, I'll…
-Of course.

943
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,117
-Okay.
-Let's make it this high.

944
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:43,087
-Okay. Right.
-Then, it'll be like old times.

945
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,956
Ready.

946
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,224
-Set.
-Attack first.

947
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,258
-Go.
-Really?

948
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,827
-I feel bad.
-It's all right.

949
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:50,762
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

950
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,297
FLINCH

951
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,198
-I'm scared.
-It's okay.

952
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,400
Your eyes are so scary.

953
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,401
It's okay.

954
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,668
It's the makeup.

955
00:33:58,836 --> 00:33:59,670
THEN, LET ME…

956
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,305
You can hit my face. Give it a try.

957
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,608
-Do it.
-You'll quickly get used to it.

958
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,143
-Are you going to kill me?
-No.

959
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,811
Attack my face.

960
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,814
Hold on. The pillow bounced back.

961
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,652
THIS TETO LADY TOOK ALL THE DAMAGE
WITH HER FACE

962
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,388
Hold on. The pillow bounced back.

963
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,525
LET THE REAL GAME BEGIN

964
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,893
Now, go. Go.

965
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,461
Try me.

966
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,163
STUNNED

967
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,831
Damn it.

968
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,232
Geez, Cho Hye-lyun.

969
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,102
-You bastard.
-Cho Hye-lyun the Gollum.

970
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,072
HE THROWS A STRONG ATTACK

971
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,239
BUT HYE-LYUN WITHSTANDS

972
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,341
AND THE EGEN MAN WHO ATTACKED…

973
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,342
Woo-young, are you okay?

974
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,777
-Don't cry.
-Are you okay?

975
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:41,979
Let's have a match between two men.

976
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,014
-Let's do that.
-Right.

977
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,115
-Bring it on.
-A man versus a man.

978
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,349
-Because we're women…
-Right.

979
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,350
Teto guy, you're up.

980
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,820
-I'd like to attack hard too.
-Teto guy.

981
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,188
-Sae-ho.
-Okay, let's go.

982
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,689
Woo-jae, show us what you can do.

983
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,558
Woo-jae, prove that you're Teto.

984
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,792
WORKING ON THEIR WEAPONS

985
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,694
-If you win, we'll admit to it.
-Dang.

986
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,962
You can't even hold it…

987
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,664
If you win, we'll admit.

988
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,932
He turned it hard, and it slipped.

989
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,300
Darn, it's futile.

990
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,302
-There you go.
-He's drained.

991
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,703
There are small ones here too.

992
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,105
He can't even turn a pillow.

993
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,940
What are you doing? Don't.

994
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,575
He's wasting all his energy.

995
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,143
-Don't do it.
-It's perfect.

996
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,079
-I got a good grip.
-Sae-ho is holding it well.

997
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:15,980
Hey, look forward to it.

998
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,715
-You might get thrown.
-Let's not be upset.

999
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,851
MATCH BEGINS

1000
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:20,952
What? You'll attack first?

1001
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,254
THAT'S QUICK-WITTED OF YOU

1002
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,390
WHEN YOU AREN'T STRONGER THAN THE OTHER,
ATTACKING FIRST IS THE BEST MOVE

1003
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,494
LOOK AT THIS GUY,
I'LL SOON GIVE HIM A HEAVY ATTACK

1004
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,428
-I lose.
-What…

1005
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:31,996
-I lost.
-What the…

1006
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,266
HE HIT SAE-HO ALL HE WANTED

1007
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,301
AND THREW IN THE TOWEL NICE AND CLEAN

1008
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,336
Gosh, I lost.

1009
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,605
HIGH-FIVE TO CELEBRATE THE DEFEAT

1010
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,606
I can't see.

1011
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,040
I can't see.

1012
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,676
Gosh, I ended up losing.

1013
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,044
-I could've won.
-Hey, you won.

1014
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,380
You won.

1015
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,250
HE'S VERY UPSET

1016
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,451
-You won.
-Good strategy.

1017
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,153
-Goodness.
-Gosh, Woo-jae.

1018
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,088
I'm so jealous! I want to win too.

1019
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,823
ROARS

1020
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,293
HE JUST CAN'T STAND THIS

1021
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,862
HE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REAL ATTACKS

1022
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,100
BUT THE GAME ENDED
WITHOUT GETTING TO ATTACK AT ALL

1023
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,536
THE LOSER IS BEING WAY TOO ANNOYING

1024
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,971
GOING WILD

1025
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,806
ANGRY JJUGGUMI

1026
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,877
TRYING TO CALM HIS ANGER

1027
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,846
I wish I could win too.

1028
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,247
Sae-ho, do it with Woo-young.

1029
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,482
Woo-young, do it.

1030
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,716
-Why again?
-Just once.

1031
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,652
-Do a men's fight.
-Woo-young, just once.

1032
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:31,956
Teto men need to release it
or their frustration piles up.

1033
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,357
-I need to take it out.
-Right.

1034
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,559
I need to take my anger out.

1035
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,793
Why take it out on me?

1036
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,662
I wish I could win at least once.

1037
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,997
Woo-jae, that was a nice move.

1038
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,332
Nothing good about losing.

1039
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,633
Don't you work out, Woo-jae?

1040
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,468
-Not at all.
-He doesn't.

1041
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,403
I see.

1042
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,638
You're very clever.

1043
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,540
-He is.
-Right.

1044
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,243
DETERMINED NOT TO LOSE THIS TIME

1045
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,312
Nice. It's nice and tight.

1046
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,181
Let's be dead serious…

1047
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,016
-Okay.
-…about this.

1048
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,219
-As a fight between men.
-Okay.

1049
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,486
Yeah, show us.

1050
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,655
It doesn't matter how we attack, right?

1051
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,490
-Right.
-But don't push the other.

1052
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,392
-Or he'll be pushed out. Just hitting.
-Got it.

1053
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,328
I'm from Busan,

1054
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,896
so I love milmyeon.

1055
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,231
Milmyeon in Busan?

1056
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,466
-That's how he is.
-His jokes are like Lim Ha-ryong's.

1057
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,135
BUSAN MILMYEON VS SEOUL JJUGGUMI

1058
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,837
-Don't be offended.
-I won't.

1059
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,539
We're just…

1060
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,708
I said I wouldn't be offended.

1061
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,378
HE'S LEARNED THE FIRST-ATTACK SKILL
FROM HIS PREVIOUS EGEN OPPONENT

1062
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,346
Focus on attacking.

1063
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,447
I won't be offended.

1064
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,448
You hit me?

1065
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,383
-Yes, I did.
-Bring it on.

1066
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,253
Bring it on.

1067
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,022
WAIT, THAT'S QUITE STRONG

1068
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,358
HE'S FULL OF SPITE ON HIS THIRD MATCH

1069
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,293
-Bring it on.
-Keep your balance.

1070
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,396
-Bring it on.
-He took yours away.

1071
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,597
He took it away.

1072
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,432
Gosh, you're holding his knees.

1073
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,636
DUAL PILLOWS

1074
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,703
Bring it on!

1075
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,006
FOLLOWING THE WEASEL,
HE'S TAKING THE BLOW FROM THE IDIOT

1076
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,341
Bring it on, Sae-ho.

1077
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,310
I will… Sae-ho!

1078
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,213
HE TAKES ALL THE BEATING

1079
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,515
AND WINS AGAIN

1080
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,919
-What the heck is this?
-Sae-ho took a beating and won again.

1081
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,522
He won again. I'm so jealous.

1082
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,990
Sae-ho won three times.

1083
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,592
Three times in a row.

1084
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,360
SHOUTS

1085
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,428
He's pissed.

1086
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,496
Sae-ho won three times.

1087
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,398
THE HERO BEGINS ROARING AGAIN

1088
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,633
ROARS

1089
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,870
I'm so jealous
you won three times in a row.

1090
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,472
I want to do it too.

1091
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,741
HIS TEMPER… NO, HIS TETO SIDE
SPIKES UP ONLY AFTER THE GAME

1092
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,343
-Three times in a row.
-But strangely,

1093
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,145
it feels like he lost.

1094
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,280
He can't release his frustration this way.

1095
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,581
-Don't. You might rip it.
-No.

1096
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,783
THE HERO KEEPS BEING SELF-DESTRUCTIVE

1097
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:39,850
No.

1098
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,585
-Stop it.
-An octopus has eight legs.

1099
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,487
-An octopus needs eight legs.
-Don't rip it.

1100
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,523
All right. The first game.

1101
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,724
You hit him like three times more.

1102
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,192
Team Teto is the winner.

1103
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,293
-Congratulations.
-Gosh.

1104
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,662
I need to play the daegeum
at least to feel…

1105
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:57,168
HE JUST WANTS TO GO HOME EARLY
AND GET HIS OCEAN FRIENDS' COMFORT

1106
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,269
I need peace of mind.

1107
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,804
Dip it in chojang if you're having a bite.

1108
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,606
ONE HOUR LATER

1109
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,418
-Nice.
-Why are they so good?

1110
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,887
GODLY MOVEMENT

1111
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:27,465
