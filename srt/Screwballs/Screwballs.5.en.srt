1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,773
GLEAMING SURFACES
AND SHINY ORNAMENTS

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,175
ARE EVERYWHERE
IN THIS LUXURIOUS PLACE

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,980
AN INVITATION
TO THE GRAND MANSION

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,085
SOMEONE CAUTIOUSLY ENTERS

5
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,495
SO UNSERIOUS

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,662
Isn't that his phone?

7
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,167
THE MAN IN THE SUIT
KICKS UP DUST FROM THE GET-GO

8
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,301
How do you do?

9
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,771
My name is

10
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,707
Vincenzo Giocarlos III.

11
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:41,908
It's a pleasure.

12
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,844
WHO CARES

13
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,146
A future mafia boss.

14
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,416
TODAY'S DRESS CODE
HEIR

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,318
I can well imagine how I'll be received.

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,120
When my castmates join me,

17
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,790
they'll criticize me
for not dressing the part.

18
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,091
-But--
-Yo, brother!

19
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,727
It's nice to see you, man.

20
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,795
AN EXTRA FRIENDLY HEIR

21
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,596
Sweet pickle. The cameras are rolling.

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,332
Those designer brands know their stuff.

23
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,233
GOLDMOON'S HEIR

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,469
The tinted glasses are…
Wait, I shouldn't swear.

25
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,071
These are so nice.

26
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,606
Come on, man.

27
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,775
Shouldn't you have at least
made some kind of effort…

28
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,012
I knew you'd say that.
Let's leave the decision to the viewers.

29
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,148
After the crew shared
this week's theme with me,

30
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,883
I prepared my look based on it.

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,319
That's how I got Vincenzo,
the mafia family's heir.

32
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,222
Look. I came bare-footed
in the middle of winter.

33
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,924
-Here she is.
-Don't you get it?

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,292
-I understand, dear.
-Ma'am.

35
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,359
-Of course I do.
-This guy here…

36
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,627
DON'T FIGHT, GOLDEN KIDS

37
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,363
-…he's a troublemaker.
-I'm here to ease your heartaches.

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,631
Show me what you've got.

39
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,301
-Come fight me.
-I'm Dr. Oh Eun-hyeong.

40
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,602
I can read your heart.

41
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,204
Come on, doc. Let's rumble.

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,072
-You're holding your phone.
-Over here, doc.

43
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,807
THIS TROUBLEMAKER LOVES
PRETEND GUNS

44
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,509
-Ma'am.
-Does this look like a phone to you?

45
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,211
Come on. Let's see your skills.

46
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,979
-You're wearing a white jacket.
-Come on.

47
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,114
-I see.
-Come get me.

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,849
It's nice to see you all.

49
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:56,916
NO DELINQUENTS HERE

50
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,585
THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN
BROUGHT UP WEIRD…

51
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,120
-Come in.
-You forgot your costume.

52
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,154
No, I'm wearing it.

53
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,089
-Come on in.
-What the heck?

54
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,824
-Come on in.
-What the heck?

55
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,928
-What the heck?
-Good morning.

56
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,797
-Who is he dressed up as?
-Who might that be?

57
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,132
Who are you, exactly?

58
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,467
May I ask who you are?

59
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,003
Hello, everyone.

60
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,471
I can't even guess who you are.

61
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,973
-Choi Hong-man?
-Excuse me?

62
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,274
You sound like him.

63
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,077
I'm Sa-rang's dad, you see.

64
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,012
-Oh, right.
-Yeah, it's a pleasure.

65
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,114
The next zaddy in line.

66
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,183
-That's me, Choo Sung-hoon.
-I get it now.

67
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,018
-I really do.
-Hello.

68
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,119
CHEWED-UP SUNG-HOON

69
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,054
But where did the muscles…

70
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,023
-Oh, you're not exactly fit.
-Well…

71
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,459
I didn't think this week's shoot would be…

72
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,327
Is this a vein or what?

73
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,730
-It's not a vein.
-What's that?

74
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,498
This is my mic cable.

75
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,368
As for these here, they are nipple covers.

76
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,669
-Nipple covers?
-Yeah.

77
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,538
-I see.
-Again, it's my pleasure.

78
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,107
But here's the thing.
Today's dress code was "heirs,"

79
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,042
not celebrity characters of your choice.

80
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,143
TRIGGERED

81
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,745
-They went off course…
-I'm Jung Cheong,

82
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,813
-the heir to Goldmoon.
-…save for you and me.

83
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,182
-Wait--
-Let's catch up later.

84
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,350
First off,
let's greet the industry veteran.

85
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,252
Welcome, Kang Jin,
the singer of "Wild Bee."

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,689
THE HEIR TO THE KOREAN TROT,
NOT GOLDMOON SYNDICATE

87
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,624
-And you are?
-Vincenzo.

88
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,660
Seriously, Vincenzo?
You crossed the line there.

89
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,797
That's Sebastian III,
Lim Hyouck-feel's character.

90
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,798
"Wait outside!"

91
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,700
HOLDING BACK A LAUGH

92
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,069
You're doing an impression of him, right?

93
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,537
I remember that on Gag Concert.

94
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,807
LIM HYOUCK-FEEL? X
BARRON TRUMP? O

95
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,176
-Please say, "Wait outside."
-You look so weird.

96
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,645
-"Wait outside!"
-Say that to Woo-jae.

97
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
Wait outside!

98
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,249
See? She's Sebastian III, all right.

99
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:42,989
You forgot the verb.

100
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,224
-I'll be frank here.
-Yeah?

101
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,692
-It's upsetting.
-But why?

102
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,894
The most veteran of us all,
Sook, dressed up for today.

103
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,630
-Look, I'm barefoot.
-You came well-prepared, too.

104
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,666
I even got my ear pierced again
to fully get into character.

105
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,201
-So thorough.
-Right?

106
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,970
-How thoughtful.
-But he's done nothing.

107
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,504
-He's right.
-What's the difference

108
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,106
between Vincenzo and the Professor?

109
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,876
-Let's have a draw for next week.
-Look here, guys.

110
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,411
-Good idea.
-What have I done wrong?

111
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,146
Try to put more effort into your costumes.

112
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,849
A QUARREL BREAKS OUT
THE MOMENT EVERYONE IS ON SET

113
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,218
-We could all dress to impress, you know.
-That's my point.

114
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,153
-"Wait outside!"
-We could outshine you any day.

115
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,555
Fine, when you inform me

116
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,757
-of next week's dress code…
-How irresponsible.

117
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,892
…spell out how I should sabotage my look.

118
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,793
-Good call.
-Okay.

119
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,428
Here's an idea for next week.

120
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,731
Woo-young can dress up as Kang Jin,

121
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,965
and Sook as Kim Yonja.

122
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,101
Let's pay tribute to trot stars.
He can be Na Hoon-a.

123
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,703
-That's for our crew to decide.
-Leave it up to them.

124
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,272
Can't I pitch an idea?

125
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,773
INDIGNANT

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,841
-Come fight me.
-I mean,

127
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,076
Sun-hui and I talked forever
on the phone just this week.

128
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,313
Give him some credit, okay?

129
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,581
GREAT JOB, SWEETIE

130
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,515
All right.

131
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:46,986
We requested that you come to the set
dressed up as heirs for a reason.

132
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,888
Please show us today's theme.

133
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,690
-Is something set up? Oh, there.
-Look that way.

134
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,558
-What is that?
-Is the banner ready?

135
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,526
What's this about?

136
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,228
Is that the banner he's talking about?

137
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,396
Where's that banner?

138
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,931
I see it. Jin-kyung,
jump up there and let it loose.

139
00:04:58,998 --> 00:04:59,866
CHUCKLE

140
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,268
And how is that coming down?

141
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,837
Jae-hun promised to lower it
when I give him the cue.

142
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,240
-Did he clock out?
-Could you lower the banner?

143
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,409
Maybe he needs a clear sign.
Please lower the banner.

144
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,344
HANDS APPEARING

145
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,779
CHAEBOL HEIR AUDITION

146
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,581
AN OLD-SCHOOL SYSTEM

147
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,949
What the heck?

148
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,850
That's hilarious.

149
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,455
AN UNEXPECTEDLY
STATE-OF-THE-ART DEVICE

150
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,356
You know what?

151
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,759
I was actually impressed,
thinking you had installed a machine.

152
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,694
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING

153
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,496
The guys had to
really stretch out their arms.

154
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,864
It's not very close.

155
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,499
It was hung up pretty high,

156
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,135
-so I expected it to be quite long.
-Me too.

157
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,304
It turns out
I lowered my gaze for nothing.

158
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,405
IT FELL SHORT IN MANY WAYS

159
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,541
That sure is original.
You caught me off guard.

160
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,575
We're struggling.

161
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,377
How pathetic.

162
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,481
Today's theme is Chaebol Heir Audition.

163
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,250
The briefing on the audition

164
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,087
will be held by a certain person
who has a stake in it.

165
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,755
-Really?
-Are we meeting an actual mogul?

166
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,990
We coordinated with Chairman Do…

167
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,093
-"Chairman"?
-…to prepare a clip for you.

168
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,661
-A clip?
-We're getting a video.

169
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,396
Here's Chairman Do's video message.

170
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,333
AND WHO IS
THIS MYSTERIOUS CHAIRMAN?

171
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,169
WHO COULD IT BE?

172
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,004
SWIVELS

173
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,707
That's Song Eun-i.

174
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,778
I'm Chairman Do Ra-hui,
leading the Dora-Group.

175
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:24,550
I built up my company from the bottom up,
with a single 500-won coin I had long ago.

176
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,754
Its current market cap stands
at a whopping 380 trillion won.

177
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,022
YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY?

178
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,891
That's my company's current value.

179
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,892
Alas,

180
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,128
-the time has come…
-What's up with her?

181
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,664
…for the Dora-Group to find a new leader.

182
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,468
I considered leaving the group
in the hands of my kid.

183
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,537
-But Eun-i doesn't have one.
-The thing is,

184
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,539
I had disowned that brat.

185
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:51,544
That is why I'm holding an audition
to find a talent worthy to be my heir.

186
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,982
Now, I'm looking for someone who
can lead the Dora-Group to a bright future

187
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,884
after I am gone.

188
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,954
A competent and bold person
with qualities befitting a leader

189
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,589
shall become the winner,

190
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,392
and I will bequeath
the Dora-Group to them.

191
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,293
One more thing.

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,896
They will also receive
a handsome prize money!

193
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,164
There's money involved?

194
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,267
-Netflix is bound to be generous.
-The dough, huh?

195
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,768
Do you want to become a chaebol?

196
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,603
-Sure!
-Of course!

197
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,172
Then, show the world…

198
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,541
what you've got.

199
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,511
Thank you, Eun-i. I wish you all the best.

200
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,980
This kind of arrangement
might actually benefit her.

201
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,483
-Is she a real magnate?
-She has no one to share her wealth

202
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,652
because she's unmarried and childless.

203
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:37,123
The video message ran
for approximately two minutes,

204
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,792
and a true mogul among us
didn't show it much interest.

205
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,061
Yeah, she's a true billionaire.

206
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,863
-That jerk…
-I couldn't help but notice

207
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,699
-how disinterested she was.
-I'm going to crush him today.

208
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,802
-Technically speaking…
-She lacks desperation.

209
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,304
…we only pointed out the truth.

210
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,840
You're running a company
beloved by many people.

211
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,209
That's an undeniable fact.

212
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,345
Her sales would easily outnumber
that of Chairman Do.

213
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,514
-That's a fact.
-It seems we have much to discuss.

214
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,116
I'M HUSTLING DAY AND NIGHT
TO KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT…

215
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,818
I hope you'll try my new product.

216
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,654
I'm sure you're familiar
with the term "chaebol."

217
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,390
It refers to enterprises
whose group of executives

218
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,127
belong to the same family
which owns an extensive amount of capital.

219
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,530
And yet, the Dora-Group's heir audition

220
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,665
doesn't require familial relationship.

221
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,169
As long as you are the last one standing,
you can join its ranks.

222
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,037
Chairman Do spoke of prize money.

223
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,172
Did you really prepare it?

224
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,807
-In hard cash, yes.
-Really?

225
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,242
-Hard cash?
-How much is it?

226
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,177
Even if they did their best,

227
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,412
it might not be enough
to impress Jin-kyung.

228
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,548
Give it a rest, Sook.

229
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,083
-A huge sum for us--
-Tell you what,

230
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,318
she holds a serious amount of capital.

231
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,953
Let me break it down for you.

232
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,722
In Jin-kyung's case,

233
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,592
-her earnings go into her business.
-You bet.

234
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,328
But with Sook,
all her earnings go into her safe.

235
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,563
You're annoying.

236
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,532
You're like the two titans,
Samsung and LG.

237
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,467
AT LEAST THEIR BIG HEARTS
ARE ON THAT LEVEL

238
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,835
We should point out

239
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,537
that this guy needs to work more.

240
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,639
CONCERNS FOR
HIS FINANCIAL STANDINGS

241
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,375
Whenever I call him,
he always says he's at home.

242
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,476
I still remember that day.

243
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,747
It was around the time we shot the
later episodes of our predecessor show.

244
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,683
I can't forget how happy he looked
about booking one radio appearance.

245
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,951
A SINGLE GIG MADE HIM HAPPY

246
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,786
His work schedule hasn't changed much.

247
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,021
How are things these days?

248
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,722
These days…

249
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,991
We have our show, Screwballs.

250
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,294
I've got the shoots for it on my calendar.

251
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,062
Aren't you hosting a new show?

252
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,797
That's about to wrap pretty soon.

253
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,265
So soon?

254
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,200
It hasn't been all that long, has it?

255
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,403
-My contract was for ten episodes.
-Oh, ten.

256
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,838
-Screwballs is all I need.
-Wow, that's admirable.

257
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,273
Would you turn down new offers?

258
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,075
Well, shall we say…

259
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,843
I'd need to review the contract first.

260
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,545
You're very cautious, then.

261
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,114
-He's very particular.
-And picky, too.

262
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,050
My eye is on Screwballs, and nothing more.

263
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,585
For what it's worth,

264
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,621
here's hoping you'll become the heir
and win the prize money.

265
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,889
What will the audition entail?

266
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,992
Allow me to explain the rules
of the Chaebol Heir Audition.

267
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,528
A worthy chaebol
must be able to build a fortune

268
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,863
utilizing various options.

269
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,132
You will now embark on a journey

270
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,868
to make your fortune
by participating in various games.

271
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,804
You will be ranked later

272
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,907
based on your assets
after all games have been played.

273
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,276
The person who acquired
the largest fortune

274
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,445
will be declared the final winner.

275
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,180
The winner's perks include

276
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,116
full control over the Dora-Group

277
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,652
and a gigantic prize money
befitting a chaebol.

278
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,420
-Why don't I disclose the amount?
-Go ahead.

279
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,524
-It's a million won.
-That's huge!

280
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,560
-There's no doubt about that.
-It's no joke.

281
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,894
That would make anyone's day.

282
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,663
-It's a bonus, then.
-Sure.

283
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,431
Gosh, who doesn't love a bonus?

284
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,066
-I want that badly.
-Now,

285
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,469
please note that there's a penalty
for whoever places last.

286
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,573
We'll be traveling out of town
for next week's shoot.

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,775
The person who places at the bottom

288
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,811
will have to wear a costume
as outlandish as prosthetic makeup

289
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,913
-throughout the shoot.
-Okay.

290
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,316
-Woo-jae should do it.
-Are the others exempt from costumes?

291
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,752
No, the others' costume
would be on today's level.

292
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,520
The remaining four can decide

293
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,323
what the bottom contestant
will have to wear.

294
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,624
FEELING FAINT

295
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,726
Jin-kyung would look amazing
dressed as Groot.

296
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,329
Could we add about a dozen branches?

297
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,198
-That's my pitch for next week.
-She'd look adorable.

298
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,700
I'll make that happen.

299
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,403
We're currently in Paju. Isn't that right?

300
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,704
-Yes.
-We came all the way here.

301
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,540
Here's the thing.
I've spent some time on YouTube

302
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,610
and found out that Jin-kyung
often shoots her videos at home.

303
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,712
Right, it's upsetting
that you've never invited us.

304
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,281
I wondered why we couldn't shoot there.

305
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,183
Sae-ho's new home is also a nice idea.

306
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,918
I don't mind shooting at my place.

307
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,522
I shoot videos for my YouTube channel
at home most of the time.

308
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,058
First things first.
You subscribe to my channel, right?

309
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,025
-You bet.
-Thought so.

310
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,728
-I can show it to you right now.
-Oh, really?

311
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,929
How about…

312
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,864
we check everyone's subscription list

313
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,499
to see if all our channels are there?

314
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,600
DO WE TRULY LOVE ONE ANOTHER?

315
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,070
-Look at my account, Sae-ho.
-Surely we're all subscribers.

316
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,304
Here's my subscription list.

317
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,606
-I have everyone's channel on it.
-So you do.

318
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,675
-How's life these days?
-I subscribe to everyone.

319
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,378
There's no reason why I wouldn't.
I've got everyone here.

320
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,246
-That's Jin-kyung.
-You must have everyone.

321
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,582
-Wait, I don't think I have Sook.
-You little…

322
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,518
That explains why the subscriber count
fell short by one.

323
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,787
-My channel's missing, too.
-Woo-jae's isn't there.

324
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,856
That's the sordid truth of Screwballs.

325
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,624
THE SUPPOSED
STRONG BOND UNMASKED…

326
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,660
CONNECTIONS JUST FOR SHOW

327
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,295
-I'm so disappointed.
-Unbelievable.

328
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,663
-After everything…
-You're awful.

329
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,698
All that talk
about being a family was a lie.

330
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,101
-Whose channel has he been subscribing to?
-None.

331
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,135
-None at all?
-Yeah.

332
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,670
-Wait.
-You're trash.

333
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,371
-Let's see yours.
-Mr. Jang: A Man of Leisure.

334
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,773
THE NEXT TARGET SEEMS SUSPICIOUS

335
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,007
Show us yours, Jin-kyung.

336
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,644
I promise I won't feel let down.
You might choose not to subscribe.

337
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,779
-I'd understand.
-Me too.

338
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,914
But I'm a subscriber of yours, Jin-kyung.

339
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,916
My gosh. How startling was that?

340
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,018
-Where's your phone?
-I left it in my car.

341
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,220
-I'll go get it.
-No, don't.

342
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,721
Stop! Please don't go.

343
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,957
-Where did our managers go?
-Let's focus on the shoot.

344
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,826
-So you've doubted me all along.
-Yeah.

345
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,461
Come on, guys.

346
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,030
We've been close friends for ages.

347
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,333
-Whose phone is it?
-It's Jin-kyung's.

348
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,968
-Unlock it.
-Launch the YouTube app.

349
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,403
-How do I unlock it?
-Let's see for ourselves.

350
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:52,805
The passcode--

351
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,706
FACIAL RECOGNITION

352
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,607
Hey!

353
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,376
USING THE FACE ID
WITHOUT CONSENT

354
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,145
Did that unlock the device?

355
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,547
REAL TRICKSTER KING

356
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,450
You know what? That didn't work
because of all the makeup.

357
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,787
Look. This is my account,
Real Study King Hong Jin-kyung.

358
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,855
-That's the account I'm using.
-Okay.

359
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,258
We didn't mean this account.

360
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,060
Show us your personal account,
not the one for your channel.

361
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,029
-Switch the account.
-Switching now.

362
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,364
YOU CAN'T DO THAT

363
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,632
Hey, Woo-jae.

364
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,833
Account switched.

365
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,837
-Wait, Woo-jae!
-You're going to make her cry!

366
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,839
-Unbelievable!
-She might really cry.

367
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,508
-She only subscribes to her own channel.
-Really?

368
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,911
What the hell is your problem?

369
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,479
Look inward and focus on your life.

370
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,615
-You called me trash.
-Did you forget

371
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,484
that you insulted Sae-ho just now?

372
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,052
-You're trash.
-Where are you going?

373
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,721
-Don't storm away out of the blue.
-Where are you off to?

374
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,089
I'm done for the day!

375
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,191
-What do you mean?
-Seriously?

376
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,926
Is she hitting the subscribe buttons?

377
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,927
THIS IS THE ENTRYWAY

378
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,296
-Jin-kyung.
-Tell us. What happened?

379
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,131
What happened to boundaries?

380
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,667
Can I ask you this one question?

381
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,368
Have you subscribed to Netflix Korea?

382
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,070
That's like the basics.

383
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,005
She's been on Single's Inferno for years.

384
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,907
I'm not so shameless compared to her.

385
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,979
I really feel bad about this,
but let me be honest.

386
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,315
Frankly, I'm way too swamped with work.

387
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,219
-What's that supposed to mean?
-What did she say?

388
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,055
-What does that have to do with anything?
-Okay, I get it.

389
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,123
TEARS FOLLOWING
A HEARTFELT CONFESSION…

390
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,227
I collapse into my bed right on 9 p.m.

391
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,230
Here's your first challenge
of Chaebol Heir Audition.

392
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,132
Chairman Do made a special request to us.

393
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,170
He wants his heir to be someone
who can enjoy a good party.

394
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,638
-Those are his words.
-This won't be easy.

395
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,573
Chairman Do loves parties.

396
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,175
Without further ado,

397
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,644
-let's have Dance Time.
-"Dance Time"? Oh, right.

398
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,612
Oh, shoot.

399
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,047
It's too early for that.

400
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,983
It's not even 9 a.m. yet.

401
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,585
-What time is it? I'm so cold.
-The heater's still warming up the set.

402
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,722
I mean, we have years under our belts.

403
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,925
Watching each other dance
doesn't do anything for us.

404
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,494
Consider the new global viewers.

405
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,029
Shouldn't we give them the taste

406
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,565
of Jin-kyung and Woo-young's dance skills?

407
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,900
Look, Woo-young is warming up.

408
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,435
-I only have eyes for Screwballs.
-Wait.

409
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,437
If it's not too much to ask…

410
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,341
Considering the cold weather here,
I'd like to button up my cardigan.

411
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
-The cold made his veins stand out.
-I mean…

412
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,178
Have a look for yourself.

413
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,146
Look at the goosebumps.

414
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,416
I chose this T-shirt because Sung-hoon
wears one with the same material.

415
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,952
He's incredible. I can assure you that.

416
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,554
-He wears this gauze in this weather.
-But you look so shabby.

417
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,523
HE'S SURE TO CATCH A COLD

418
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,758
You look so cold.

419
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,860
You look like a poor old man
from the back.

420
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,295
-Come on, now.
-His skin is so dry.

421
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,130
-My intent was--
-From the back,

422
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,365
he looks like a ballerino
who's holding on to his dream.

423
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,200
PLUMP

424
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,101
Here's the problem.

425
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,270
-I'm freezing out here.
-Your devotion rocks.

426
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,571
Get your cardigan back on.

427
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,308
-How's a dance-off to shake off the cold?
-Okay.

428
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,443
A dance-off to shake off the cold?

429
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,312
That's actually a clever expression.

430
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,847
A dance-off to shake off the cold.

431
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,985
The most important factor
in today's audition is your asset.

432
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,588
The winner of this dance-off
will receive a billion won.

433
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,890
Oh, wow.

434
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,892
We get to start the race
with a billion won?

435
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,827
The winner will be decided

436
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,497
by the votes
from the fair everyman producers.

437
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,865
"Everyman producers"?

438
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,100
Who are they?

439
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,035
We are the everyman producers.

440
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,571
Oh, the everyman…
And that's you. I get it now.

441
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,341
Dance a miracle. This is Dance Time.

442
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,676
Let us begin.

443
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,244
I'm not much of a dancer.

444
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,947
-Do we have to dive headlong into this?
-Sure.

445
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,650
-But still…
-We can get things going no problem.

446
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,285
I'm sorry to interrupt,

447
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,221
but what age are we in, exactly?
Are we shooting X-Men?

448
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,690
-They're like, "Just dance!"
-Chairman Do asked for it.

449
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,692
-I'm just--
-Feel free to sit this one out.

450
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,593
If I'm being honest…

451
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,162
BEAT IT IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT

452
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,530
I don't get it, though.

453
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,399
But honestly, guys. I think…

454
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,067
Have you begun rating our performances?

455
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,736
We'll play some music for you.

456
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,538
When they play the music,
whoever gets the vibe can come dance.

457
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,741
My moves have gotten…

458
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,509
They are now more refined.

459
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,077
-Is that right?
-Sure.

460
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,579
That's a relief, I guess.

461
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,947
-I'll keep it classy.
-Okay.

462
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,082
Let's play some music for Jin-kyung.

463
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,453
JIN-KYUNG TAKES THE STAGE

464
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,757
YOU'RE WITNESSING
THE HOST OF SINGLE'S INFERNO

465
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,559
FAILING TO RECOGNIZE
A SONG FROM THE SHOW

466
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,329
DESPITE BEING SO PREOCCUPIED
WITH WORK

467
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,398
SHE HAS MANAGED TO PICK UP
A STRANGE MOVE

468
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,866
What on earth?

469
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,667
-What the heck?
-Can we air that?

470
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,705
CHEEKY DANCE MOVES

471
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,141
Netflix's US headquarters might call you.

472
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,211
DEAR PRODUCERS, PLEASE PICK ME

473
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,414
EXITING AFTER
THE SCANDALOUS DANCE

474
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,215
-What exactly did you change?
-My moves.

475
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,950
-Jin-kyung--
-To make it stylish,

476
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,219
you only need the slightest bounces--

477
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,222
Can you show us how you used to dance?

478
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,757
-One last time.
-It was tacky.

479
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,758
Play the second song

480
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,628
-prepared for Jin-kyung, please.
-I was a young fool to dance that way.

481
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,496
I was too eager to stand out back then.

482
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,732
OH, THE YOUTHFUL,
ATTENTION-SEEKING DAYS…

483
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,234
FULLY IN CHARACTER
OF JIN-KYUNG FROM 2024

484
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,436
SHALL WE, THEN?

485
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,538
SO SILLY

486
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,705
It went like this.

487
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,642
This is how I used to dance.

488
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,377
Here's the updated moves.

489
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,778
SWISHING THE JACKET

490
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,980
THE CHANGES ARE NOTICEABLE,
AT LEAST

491
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,151
BEFORE, AFTER

492
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,854
-That's about it.
-Why does she keep repeating this?

493
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,657
What's going on?

494
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,759
-Why did you turn off the music?
-Come on, man.

495
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,627
That song was for Jin-kyung.

496
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,430
I saw her leaving the center stage,
so I was getting in the mood.

497
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,965
Why did you turn it off?

498
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,166
Where's your cardigan?

499
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,734
You're an eyesore. Leave the set.

500
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,671
-We've prepared enough music, Sae-ho.
-Oh, really?

501
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,408
By the way, wasn't the change noticeable?
My moves are more reserved.

502
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,343
-Your moves now have a lot of charm.
-Really?

503
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,846
Before, they were hideous.

504
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,348
-Now, they're so appealing. I mean that.
-Thanks.

505
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,885
-We'll now play a song for Sook.
-I have no repertoire.

506
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,821
-Won't I get to dance?
-No, you'll get your turn.

507
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,523
I prepared a little something.

508
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,724
WHAT COULD HE HAVE PREPARED…

509
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,626
Let's see Dr. Oh Eun-hyeong dance first.

510
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,795
-I'm no dancer, though.
-She might do a headspin.

511
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,363
What if she pulls off the windmill?

512
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,998
LISTENING INTENTLY

513
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,200
IS SHE IN THE ZONE?

514
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,301
That's hip-hop.

515
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,039
SOOK TAKES THE STAGE

516
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,209
HER MADNESS SEEPS THROUGH
THE MOMENT SHE STARTED DANCING

517
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,446
What was that?

518
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,748
AN ULTIMATE MORNING OUT
OF DR. OH EUN-HYEONG

519
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,783
RELIEVING HERSELF OF THE STRESS

520
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,385
FROM TENDING
TO THE TROUBLEMAKERS

521
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,587
Her eyes are glinting
with the desire to win.

522
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,757
OH, I SEE - MY EYES BURN
WITH THE DRIVE TO WIN

523
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,025
I GET IT NOW

524
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,561
Get back, Mr. Ready-to-bust!

525
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,166
Can't we see Woo-young show off his skills

526
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,001
-to a hot tune?
-Hear, hear.

527
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,004
If Woo-young doesn't feel comfortable,
Sae-ho can do his bit first.

528
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,307
I didn't exactly prepare a bit.
I only wanted to dance with you guys.

529
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,708
We've got you covered, Sae-ho.

530
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,945
I'll transfer my energy to Sae-ho.

531
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,647
Dance right after me, Sae-ho.

532
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,548
Okay.

533
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,684
Gosh, this suits you.

534
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,553
-Hey, we're playing it seriously.
-Okay.

535
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,355
REVVING UP THE DANCE MACHINE

536
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,256
Treat it seriously.

537
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,258
WOO-YOUNG TAKES THE STAGE

538
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,296
Look at his joints locking.

539
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,531
AT LONG LAST, HIS HIP JOINTS
ARE WORKING PROFESSIONALLY

540
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,409
DISCARDING THE SLIPPERS
AND DANCING BAREFOOT

541
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,345
SO HOT, SO PROVOCATIVE

542
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,113
REMINDING US

543
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,250
THE CLASS OF THE TOP CONTESTANT
FROM JYP'S AUDITION

544
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,918
COME ON, SAE-HO!

545
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,255
FINALLY, IT'S MY TURN!

546
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:25,991
OH, MY

547
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,093
Way to go!

548
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,661
OH, GOSH

549
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,365
THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE DANCE
FEATURING ACTING EMBARRASSED

550
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,466
What's this about?

551
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,367
You're amazing!

552
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,703
-What is he doing?
-He's feeling shy.

553
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,671
THE BALLERINO'S DREAM IS
REALIZED AT LAST

554
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,441
I'M COUNTING ON YOUR SUPPORT,
PRODUCERS

555
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,876
Dr. Oh! Please join him!

556
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,878
Oh, no.

557
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,380
I'm not going to dance.

558
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,782
BUT YOU CAN'T RESIST
THIS SICK BEAT

559
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,152
DR. OH TURNS TO THE DARK SIDE

560
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,358
BOUNCING TO THE BEAT ABRUPTLY
FOR NO APPARENT REASON

561
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,960
Vincenzo!

562
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,362
AND FINALLY…

563
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,399
CARLOS TAKES THE STAGE
WITHOUT A HESITATION

564
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,501
SCREAM TO THE LEFT SIDE

565
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,571
HOLLER TO THE RIGHT SIDE

566
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,773
FOR THE FINALE…

567
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,608
What's gotten into her?

568
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,477
What happened to being reserved?

569
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,747
-What's this gesture supposed to mean?
-You're not being subtle.

570
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,250
I'D RATHER NOT WATCH HER

571
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,485
That's a wrap.

572
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,720
THE ELEGANT DANCE TIME ENDS

573
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,190
So, you were asked to dance a miracle
for Chaebol Heir Audition.

574
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,627
The everyman producers will now vote
based on their objective assessment.

575
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,430
Everyman producers,

576
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,565
please select a Chaebol heir trainee

577
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,436
who impressed you
with superior dance skills

578
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:48,140
or whose moves touched your heart
for whatever reason.

579
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,076
I hope you'll make your decision
based on our charms.

580
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:55,213
Here's food for thought. Whose moves
had the potential to set a new trend?

581
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,684
I did my absolute best today
despite the cold weather.

582
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,486
You sure did. I get the feeling
that Woo-young will win the billion.

583
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,889
-Well, I'll humbly accept…
-Oh, sure.

584
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:08,126
The everyman producers are all armed
with common sense and decency.

585
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,763
But the competition ran so fierce.
Placing last is no reason to feel ashamed.

586
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,132
-We did great together.
-It's neck and neck.

587
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,735
It appears that all votes came in.

588
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,572
Oh, wow.

589
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,941
-It was all very close.
-That can't be right.

590
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,445
I mean, only one person danced properly.

591
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,347
How did it end up being
a neck-and-neck game?

592
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,315
Woo-young was miles better than us.

593
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,317
But his moves were more like acrobatics.

594
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,019
Their views could differ from ours.

595
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,822
Okay. I'll announce third place first.

596
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:40,792
Third place will receive
a prize money of 200 million won.

597
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,695
-Oh, goodness.
-If only those 200 million were real.

598
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,365
-Dance Time… Focus, guys.
-We shouldn't have danced that way, then.

599
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,500
THESE MOVES AREN'T WORTH
200 MILLION

600
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,434
Be real, Jin-kyung.

601
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,269
-That's true.
-Someone might've lost an arm.

602
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,505
Like I said, 200 million
is awarded to third place.

603
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,007
-Screwballs has all my attention.
-Now, in third place…

604
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,542
I'm pouring my all into it.

605
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,111
Sook took third place. Congrats.

606
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,445
Me? That's insane!

607
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,748
My goodness! Look at this.

608
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,882
DR. OH PLACED THIRD?

609
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,985
I placed third. This is amazing.

610
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,987
Oh, wow.

611
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,255
Screwballs is my everything.

612
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,125
Wait, the bills don't look right.

613
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,694
-Doesn't this look off?
-What's the matter?

614
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,996
-Why is my face here?
-That's Sae-ho.

615
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,632
So you used my portrait
on a 50-million-won bill.

616
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,700
Because he's so respected?

617
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,468
FEATURING THOSE WHO WILL BRING
HONOR TO SCREWBALLS

618
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:28,106
For your information, one vote decided
the fates of fourth and fifth places.

619
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,777
The same goes for the top two candidates.

620
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,878
-I'd love to win.
-Wait.

621
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,379
It really ran close.

622
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,248
-I like my chances.
-That doesn't feel great.

623
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,016
-I'll announce fourth place.
-Number four.

624
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,986
-Their prize money is 100 million won.
-A whopping 100 million?

625
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,888
Who wouldn't want to get that?

626
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,356
Fourth place goes to…

627
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,358
Jin-kyung.

628
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,593
What's the matter?

629
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,263
WHY ARE YOU MAKING THAT FACE?

630
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,232
-Were you aiming at winning?
-She's gotten so arrogant.

631
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,834
Were you hoping to win?

632
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,536
How could she be so…

633
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,139
-Come on, learn to be grateful.
-It's sad. My new vision was snubbed.

634
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,808
-I offered a paradigm shift.
-Think of it

635
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:06,178
as you being far too ahead of the times.

636
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,913
Seeing how she placed fourth,

637
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,715
I would've placed fifth.
That's for certain.

638
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,018
You placed fifth, Woo-jae.
Congratulations.

639
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,352
THAT'S RIGHT
WOO-JAE PLACED FIFTH

640
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,855
-Does Woo-jae get nothing?
-Is there no prize money for him?

641
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,224
Is there seriously
one-vote difference between us?

642
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,326
That must mean… Oh, gosh.

643
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,895
-Did I lose to this move, then?
-All right.

644
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,831
Okay. You two can take center stage.

645
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,232
One of you won the competition.

646
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,134
-I'll now announce the winner.
-Oh, yes!

647
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,469
It was my honor

648
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,338
-to dance with you.
-It was my pleasure after so long.

649
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,473
I loved it.

650
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,509
The person who won the most support
from the everyman producers…

651
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,578
-Let's root for whoever wins.
-Of course.

652
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,712
The winner…

653
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,714
-Let's hear it.
-…of Dance Time…

654
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,649
That can't be Sae-ho, can it?

655
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,285
No matter who wins,
our friendship will remain strong.

656
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,720
Congratulations,

657
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,821
Sae-ho.

658
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,557
FIRST PLACE, CHO SAE-HO

659
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,292
SNEER

660
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,500
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE,
WOO-YOUNG

661
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,968
I can't believe this.

662
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,505
THANK YOU, EVERYMAN PRODUCERS

663
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,007
Oh, dear, Woo-young.

664
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:09,908
Come on.

665
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,510
Didn't we agree
to root for the winner?

666
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,678
I can't believe he placed second.

667
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,680
That pisses me off.

668
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,118
This move is really rubbing me
the wrong way.

669
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,353
Excuse me, Woo-jae.

670
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,021
This is a no-smoking zone.

671
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,055
We can't have you smoke.

672
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,024
DON'T USE YOUR LIP BALM THAT WAY

673
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,958
Thank you.

674
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,427
The whole system must be overthrown.

675
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,796
Stay behind after the shoot wraps.

676
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,666
I was worried they might find
my new move unpleasant.

677
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,968
It seems they found it refreshing instead.

678
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,704
-Isn't this preposterous, Jin-kyung?
-Thank you.

679
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,839
PLEASE TAKE MY SIDE

680
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,542
I THINK I DESERVED FIRST PLACE,
WOO-YOUNG

681
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,811
My gosh.
Guys, the portrait on a billion-won bill

682
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,547
is none other than Sook's.

683
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,282
-Dang.
-This is a billion-won bill.

684
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,550
Different portraits were used.

685
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,051
Hold on.

686
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,188
WHY IS THAT BILL
CRACKING THEM UP?

687
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,057
She's giving a major Hong Kong trot star.

688
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,593
DOES SHE LOOK LIKE A SUCCESSFUL
HONG KONG TROT SINGER?

689
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,161
Let's find Woo-jae's portrait.

690
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,031
-I'm on a ten-million-won bill?
-Woo-jae.

691
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,533
It didn't feel right
to have you go empty-handed.

692
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,202
-Give him the car fare.
-Take this for your troubles. Come here.

693
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,338
-What's that?
-That's the decent thing to do.

694
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,106
Is that… It's one million won.

695
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,675
A GENEROUS SUM OF A MILLION WON

696
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,577
-A million?
-Is Woo-young on it?

697
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,945
ROUND 1, DANCE TIME
SAE-HO, 1 BILLION

698
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,413
WOO-YOUNG, 500 MILLION
SOOK, 200 MILLION

699
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,948
JIN-KYUNG, 100 MILLION
WOO-JAE, 1 MILLION

700
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,883
This realization hits me on every shoot.

701
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,720
I really should stop joining in
on the professional clowns' fight.

702
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,122
I can't compete against these comedians.

703
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,290
Come on. Don't be like that.

704
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,592
Woo-jae.

705
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,528
-Next up is a quiz show.
-Oh, really?

706
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,929
Okay, I'm bagging that one.

707
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,397
Let's move on.

708
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,466
Why bother with quizzes?
Let's dance the day away.

709
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,567
I'm seconding that.

710
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,769
Let's just dance and show off our skills.

711
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,837
GOOFING OFF

712
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,740
Let's use our words, for goodness' sake.

713
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,343
-Refrain from slapsticks.
-Come on. Why can't we use slapstick?

714
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,579
How's this? We'll alternate
between dancing and solving quizzes.

715
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,082
We can repeat the cycle
and wrap it up at 6 p.m.

716
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,918
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, ONE OF THEM
WILL BECOME THE CHAEBOL HEIR

717
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,888
While I was trying out this move,

718
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,224
I had a sudden reality check.

719
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,859
It's nothing now,

720
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,227
not until you have a kid.

721
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,229
You'd then have to attend PTA meetings,

722
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,897
acting sensible the whole time.

723
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,933
"It's nice to meet you.
I'm La-el's mother."

724
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,768
"You must be her teacher. Hello."

725
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,802
When I'm shooting, I go…

726
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,305
SO NAUGHTY

727
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,842
When you have to go to school
after your show airs,

728
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,510
you can't make eye contact with them.

729
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,545
If anyone says,
"I enjoyed your show last night,"

730
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,614
you get the pang
even if you know it was for work.

731
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,916
A MOTHER'S DAY AT WORK

732
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,818
-All right.
-My gosh.

733
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,755
That dance-off has lifted up my mood.

734
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,491
Jeez, I ruined the day's flow for nothing.

735
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,625
I still don't get it.

736
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,693
NOT CONCEDING DEFEAT

737
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,230
While my moves
weren't so highly regarded today,

738
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,866
I'm sure it'll be all the rage
in the latter half of 2025.

739
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,000
I'll keep pushing for it.

740
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,503
Seo Taiji and Boys received
harsh criticisms at first.

741
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,637
That's true.

742
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,938
-But they became trailblazers.
-Wait.

743
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,740
How could you compare them to her?

744
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,808
A PANG OF CONSCIENCE

745
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,243
Aren't you going too far?

746
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,512
NEW PARADIGM SHIFT
IN KOREAN DANCING

747
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,681
What's with those horses?

748
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,417
This is ridiculous.

749
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:06,818
What are these for?

750
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,186
5 SUSPICIOUS HORSES

751
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,790
I'm only asking this to avoid
any miscommunication.

752
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,959
-Didn't you say we'd have a quiz show?
-Oh, I did.

753
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,361
The explanations will…

754
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,096
Why do we need them for quizzes?

755
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,231
If I may, I'd like to ask

756
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,466
if those were custom-made.

757
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,134
You can't get them in Korea.

758
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,570
-I thought they seemed rather…
-They're imported goods.

759
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,038
RARE HORSES FROM OVERSEAS

760
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,173
GALLOPING SOUNDS

761
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,341
STATE-OF-THE-ART SOUND EFFECTS

762
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:34,012
I've just discovered
a critical flaw of these horses.

763
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,680
It can move forward,

764
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,248
but not backward.

765
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,284
-Yes, that's true.
-Hang on.

766
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,854
-The sound effects suggest high quality.
-These are amazing.

767
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,023
Why don't we have someone test-drive it?

768
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,458
-Sae-ho.
-How about you, Woo-jae?

769
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,193
-Why don't I try it?
-Okay, then.

770
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,861
SAE-HO TRIES IT FOR THE TEAM

771
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,296
GETTING ON CAREFULLY

772
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,630
Put your feet on the pedals.

773
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,332
Push them down. There you go.

774
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,934
-Put more force into them.
-It moves!

775
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,902
AN UNEXPECTED HIGH SPEED

776
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,138
-What on earth?
-Look at him go!

777
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,307
This is the secret weapon
for the audition episodes.

778
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,875
-That's dope.
-It's incredible.

779
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,644
-Can we buy them from you?
-I want one, too!

780
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:07,612
-Me too.
-You'd like one?

781
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,646
-Sure.
-It's quite fancy.

782
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,714
Incredible, even.

783
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,950
-Let's take one home each.
-This is amazing.

784
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,686
My niece has learned to talk and run.

785
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,653
It's the perfect gift.

786
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,622
I think she'll enjoy riding it.

787
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,857
UNCLE WILL BRING YOU A GIFT

788
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,126
As you can see, the next segment combines

789
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:25,029
a quiz show with horseback riding,
a sport favored by aristocrats.

790
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,432
It's Horseback Quiz Show.

791
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,734
Dang it. We'd have to ride those things.

792
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,836
That's right. Behind those doors

793
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,872
-lies an elevator.
-I see.

794
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,508
We have marked
a starting line in front of it.

795
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,978
-Mount your horses and start from there--
-Hold on.

796
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,347
-So we're not covering just this much?
-No.

797
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,349
-Where is it?
-We have to travel from back there?

798
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,317
Where is this elevator?
This is a one-story building.

799
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,352
CONFUSEDLY OPENING THE DOORS

800
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,287
-What the heck?
-It's too far!

801
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,355
It's over there.

802
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,623
A VAST AMOUNT OF SPACE

803
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:52,857
The line is back there.

804
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,092
THE STARTING LINE IN THE BACK

805
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,628
You'll have to get in single file
in front of me.

806
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,662
Okay.

807
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,132
Please select a horse each.

808
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,235
Can we have some time
to get accustomed to our rides?

809
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,137
-Well--
-Oh, my!

810
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,338
I mean… Gosh!

811
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,007
What's the matter?

812
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,342
-That's how it moves.
-You scaredy-cat.

813
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,511
-It feels amazing.
-Jeez.

814
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,548
It's a new-found delight.

815
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,149
THEN, PAY UP 500 WON PER RIDE

816
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,585
HEIR TRAINEES WAIT
AT THE STARTING LINE

817
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,854
You look so cute together. I love it.

818
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,022
You're adorable.

819
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,023
DIGNIFIED HEIR TRAINEES

820
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,658
Oh, the camera's rolling here.

821
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,792
V FOR VICTORY

822
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,628
This is insane.

823
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,629
MS. FASHIONISTA

824
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:32,997
WOO-JAE BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER

825
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,132
Hang on a second.

826
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,201
Sitting here in a row made me realize

827
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,069
that it's all still lame even on Netflix.

828
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,604
Of course.

829
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,006
-They have enough classy stuff elsewhere.
-Yes, that hits the spot.

830
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,210
Now, I'll announce the prize money.

831
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,011
Each question equals 100 million won.

832
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,149
-A correct answer gives you 100 million.
-That's a big one.

833
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,218
EVEN THE FRONT-RUNNER
IS NOT SAFE

834
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,019
10 CORRECT ANSWERS
CAN GET YOU ON TOP

835
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,423
WHICH TRAINEE WILL PROPEL
THEMSELVES TO THE TOP?

836
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,291
Ready.

837
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,861
GO!

838
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,897
WHO WILL BECOME
THE CHAEBOL HEIR?

839
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,004
SCREWBALLS OST - REBOOT
