00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs…

00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,639
JOO WOO-JAE'S EXPERIMENT CAMERA

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,209
ONE OF THE STAFF ASKS WOO-JAE

4
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,844
TO COVER FOR HIS MISTAKE

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,213
I didn't charge it.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,714
If it happens to turn off,

7
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,118
I was wondering if you could
act like you can hear the music.

8
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,987
WILL WOO-JAE TAKE ON
THE RIDICULOUS REQUEST?

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:21,955
To Reach You!

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,256
HE'S GOOD

11
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,891
He's a member of BIGBANG.

12
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,626
BUT THE HEADPHONES TURNED OFF
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

13
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,294
BIGBANG.

14
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,295
WHAT WILL HE CHOOSE TO DO?

15
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:30,830
Big Bob?

16
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,865
BIGBANG!

17
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,133
ACTING LIKE HE CAN'T HEAR

18
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,034
Door.

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,769
-Go slower.
-Basketball player.

20
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,605
WOO-JAE'S TRUE COLORS ARE FINALLY REVEALED

21
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,141
TIME TO REVEAL THE TRUTH

22
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,475
Today's Experiment Camera's star.

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,177
-Joo Woo-jae!
-Okay!

24
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,745
THE EXPERIMENT CAMERA WAS A HUGE SUCCESS

25
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:46,980
My face is turning super red.

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,015
He could hear us,
but he acted like he couldn't.

27
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:49,949
It was hilarious.

28
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,117
HUMILIATION TO THE MAX

29
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,419
He's in shock right now.

30
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,087
BUT THERE'S NO TIME
TO BE SPACING OUT

31
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,290
THE REAL DECONSTRUCTION SHOW
STARTS NOW

32
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,592
All the games will be him
against the four of you.

33
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,027
If Woo-jae wins,

34
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,328
it'll be the "Woo-jae" meal.

35
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,730
WOO-JAE MEAL IS ALL DESSERTS

36
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,965
-If you four win, you get a Korean meal.
-Okay.

37
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:06,966
Let's do this.

38
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,401
Joo Woo-jae's Comment Quiz.

39
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,437
-Bone visuals.
-Correct.

40
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,072
"The hanger speaks very well."

41
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,840
HAPPY, SAD

42
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,109
We can eat Korean food.

43
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,245
You had me play these games
feeling nearly dead from the start,

44
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,414
so my brain wasn't working.

45
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,283
WHAT WILL BE THE FATE OF WOO-JAE?

46
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,386
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the food.

47
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,520
Enjoy the food.

48
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:32,592
THE PRECIOUS KOREAN FEAST
THAT THE ETC TEAM WON

49
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,669
YUM

50
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,204
It's so good.

51
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,839
What did you eat?

52
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,373
-Stir-fried pork in a wrap.
-Good.

53
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,810
The shredded radish salad is great.
This is insane.

54
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,312
IS IT?

55
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,947
Must be from a really good place.

56
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,685
Actually, did you
look behind you, Woo-jae?

57
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,021
We had originally prepared Woo-jae's meal.

58
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,556
Woo-jae would have loved those.

59
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
Aren't those desserts?

60
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,525
LIKE PIE IN THE SKY

61
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,361
-Wow.
-The marinated crab is amazing.

62
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,730
AT LEAST HE CAN ENJOY THE SMELL

63
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,998
Wow.

64
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,901
I can devour these in no time
with a latte.

65
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,169
CAN'T SEEM TO LET IT GO

66
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,237
Wow. Smell these.

67
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,340
No, the marinated crab.

68
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,308
What if I mix it in with rice?

69
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,409
I still can't have any?

70
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,310
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

71
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,512
You want to mix that in rice?

72
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,680
PUT IT BACK

73
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,582
-Sorry.
-It's such a waste though.

74
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,483
The staff?

75
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,585
I'm a staff member too.

76
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,987
I'm one of the makers as well.

77
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,557
Just enjoy your kimchi stew.

78
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,193
Personally, I was wondering
about this, Woo-jae.

79
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,161
Yes.

80
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,796
Looking back on
your life up to this point,

81
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,734
when would you consider it to be
the golden era of your life?

82
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,302
Is it when you were a model or now?

83
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,804
I think

84
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,374
it was around 2022.

85
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,475
It was then.

86
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,343
-What were you doing?
-It's in the past.

87
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,012
When I first met Beat Coin?

88
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,047
TOUCHED

89
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,248
Really?

90
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,184
Look. This kind of seems…

91
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,285
-What?
-Is it for real?

92
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,320
It's obvious that you made that up.

93
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,256
It should be a time
when you were pretty active

94
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,092
and people were watching you
and asking for you more than

95
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,027
-you expected--
-Okay.

96
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,496
-Yeah?
-The actual golden era,

97
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,231
psychologically speaking,

98
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,999
I think it happened twice.

99
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,736
One was when I was busy with my modeling.

100
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,405
When was that?

101
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,576
Let's see. I debuted in 2013.

102
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,644
I guess from 2014 to 2017?

103
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,480
The second time I felt it was

104
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,284
when I was on Love Naggers
which is where I met Sook.

105
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,185
I see.

106
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,621
When I was on Love Naggers,

107
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,856
the ladies on that show including Sook

108
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,826
were so supportive of me,

109
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,994
no matter what I said.

110
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,028
Until then,

111
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:54,200
there were a few people who knew me
as a quiet and cynical model,

112
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,437
but I became more of an entertainer
from that show.

113
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,106
-So many people asked about him from that.
-Yeah.

114
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,376
They asked, "We're starting a new show.
What do you think about Joo Woo-jae?"

115
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,245
-She kept blocking my path.
-Yeah.

116
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,713
I didn't want him to leave.

117
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,249
I was originally a fan of Woo-jae.

118
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,051
Remember the pilot episode of Beat Coin?

119
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,953
-You didn't know who I was.
-No, she was…

120
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,155
AWKWARD LAUGH

121
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,090
How did she not know?

122
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,758
-So funny.
-She didn't know me at all.

123
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,194
She said, "I don't know
who Joo Woo-jae is."

124
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,495
For real.

125
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,063
Since when were you his fan?

126
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,066
-How can you say that you were my fan?
-Let's hear you out.

127
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,968
Since when were you his fan, Jin-kyung?

128
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,637
I'm getting indigestion.

129
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,173
Usually, when people have indigestion,
they don't eat a lot.

130
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,075
I was wondering about this.

131
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,077
You did a lot of things
before becoming a model.

132
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,813
-Yeah.
-You took reins of your own life.

133
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,948
You hosted a radio show

134
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,417
and even planned performances
for that show.

135
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,487
If you were to compare
those days with now,

136
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,888
which period made you happier?

137
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,659
It's not a matter of being happier.
They are completely different.

138
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,695
I think I was happy back then
because I was carefree.

139
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,829
I was just carefree

140
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,265
-back then.
-Weren't you worried about getting a job?

141
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,700
Not really. I just

142
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,935
jumped into it without any concerns.

143
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,505
I wasn't worried
about my career or anything.

144
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,906
I attended college--

145
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,509
I guess you didn't want to
seriously think about those things.

146
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,311
I wasn't that. I was just carefree.

147
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,445
-Oh.
-I just did it.

148
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,848
Back then, Woo-jae's standards were

149
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,050
just having fun

150
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,985
-even though you didn't make any money.
-Yeah.

151
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,420
It was because

152
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,122
I wasn't terribly rich,

153
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,191
but I wasn't very poor either.

154
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,694
So I was just… Geez.

155
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,761
Are you okay, Jin-kyung?

156
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,531
GAGGING

157
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,199
I should stop eating.

158
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,269
I'm having a hard time digesting.

159
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,537
Stop eating then.

160
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,872
Now that we have eaten this,

161
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,575
-my eyes keep going to Woo-jae's meal.
-Me too.

162
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,010
-As snacks.
-Let's eat snacks.

163
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,278
Can't we eat one?

164
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,412
Let's eat snacks.

165
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,814
-Yeah.
-Want some?

166
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,148
Yes, I'm craving them now.

167
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,017
Didn't Jin-kyung just say

168
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,352
she should stop eating?

169
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,252
I'll get the snacks.

170
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,654
Let's clear these out.

171
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,089
Wow. Awesome.

172
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,223
Let's clean up.

173
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,691
Since it's a happy day…

174
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,892
CASUALLY CHANGING THE TABLE

175
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,494
Let's just place these here for now.

176
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,529
I haven't eaten like this in ages.

177
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,797
-Look at these.
-They prepared

178
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,733
-so much.
-My appetite comes alive here.

179
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,700
Awesome.

180
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,604
It's hard to talk about myself when
everyone is listening carefully to me.

181
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,839
I want to hear some more.

182
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,475
Can I quickly use the restroom right now?

183
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,743
-Sorry.
-Of course you do.

184
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,643
The restroom, please.

185
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,578
-Briefly.
-Go ahead.

186
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,213
-I'm dying here.
-Okay.

187
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,548
I don't think everyone is
listening that carefully.

188
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,083
I'm the only one.

189
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,285
-I'm listening too.
-Me too.

190
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm listening too.

191
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,822
So I did various things. Now what?

192
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,723
How happy was I?

193
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,759
I don't think he is that ambitious.

194
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,429
A few years ago, he told me, "Sook,
I don't need to make any more money."

195
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,132
-He isn't that materialistic.
-Yeah.

196
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,633
Even when I'm buying a car,

197
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,535
I set a limit on how much I'll spend.

198
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,569
I buy within that limit.

199
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,537
BUYS CARS WITHIN HIS BUDGET

200
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,073
During my own personal time,

201
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,242
I don't go on long-distance trips

202
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,543
-like Sook.
-Yeah,

203
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,444
you're just at home.

204
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,212
He drives a 200-million-won car.

205
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,017
Did you help me out
when I was buying my car?

206
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,854
I worked hard to pay that car off.

207
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,557
This is what I mean by
the difference in what makes us happy.

208
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,559
-My standard is very low.
-It is.

209
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,095
-Did you make enough money, Sae-ho?
-Me?

210
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,563
-Yes.
-The thing is--

211
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,899
-You're materialistic.
-I am materialistic.

212
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,234
The reason why I buy these things

213
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,103
is because I want to
be responsible for them.

214
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,473
Not too long ago,
someone asked me why I work so hard.

215
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,808
So I told them,

216
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,943
"Because I want to buy something."

217
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,911
Honestly,

218
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,747
I want the people around me
to eat good food

219
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,049
because of me,

220
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,086
and I want my family to
be able to enjoy a little more in life

221
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,988
because of me.

222
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,457
SLIDE

223
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,859
Jin-kyung, what have you done
since you came today?

224
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,894
I'm really curious.

225
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,797
-Let's eat dessert while we talk, guys.
-Woo-jae.

226
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,501
I'M NOT DONE TALKING THOUGH

227
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,270
-Yeah, let's eat.
-I get such an appetite when I come here.

228
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,171
Just eat.

229
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,706
-Really?
-Go ahead and eat.

230
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,807
Let me try this one.

231
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,542
-That was cool of you.
-I want to try just one.

232
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,643
EAT BEFORE HE CHANGES HIS MIND

233
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,549
I thought you had to be everywhere
to get work, so when I was just starting,

234
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,052
I walked
the broadcast station hallways nonstop.

235
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,154
If it's a producer I know, I'd say hello.

236
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,055
When I said hello,

237
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,590
they'd get me to do a reenactment.

238
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,758
That's how I would get my jobs back then.

239
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,126
I went everywhere.

240
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,362
-I even did experimental shows.
-You sought out work.

241
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,931
-We met when I was an assistant producer.
-Yeah.

242
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,534
-Sae-ho is very nice, right?
-Yes.

243
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,469
When he forgets that he's nice

244
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,472
and just focuses on being funny,

245
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,773
he's hilarious.

246
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,141
Nowadays… How should I put this?

247
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,344
-The kind person mode is--
-You're right!

248
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,645
I felt that about you too.

249
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,280
I wish you would bring out

250
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,616
-the comedian side more.
-You see it on Screwballs though.

251
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,017
We do see it on our show.

252
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,752
-We see it on our show at least.
-Yeah.

253
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,421
-I watched the entire Interview Episode.
-Okay.

254
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,224
-You were kind of like that.
-What do you mean?

255
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,294
When he was an interviewer,
he had his comedian mode on

256
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,162
and just came at me.
But when it was his turn…

257
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,464
THE LOOK OF NO COMPROMISE

258
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,499
I thought he was on an actual interview.

259
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,800
I was going to tease him,

260
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,236
-but it looked like he couldn't take it.
-No, I can take it.

261
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,871
-That's not true.
-He sat like this.

262
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,741
-That was really petty, you know.
-Sorry.

263
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,442
-You see--
-Apologize now!

264
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,577
I'm sorry. You see,

265
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,880
I was worried about the aftermath
of slipping up.

266
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,615
And what about us?

267
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,250
When you were attacking others…

268
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,352
That's not my business.

269
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,021
It isn't.

270
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,155
That's for you to overcome.

271
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,091
When we asked about your ex-girlfriend,
you got sensitive, didn't you?

272
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,127
-No, I'm not sensitive.
-That's right.

273
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,796
Please send a video letter
to your ex-girlfriend.

274
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,098
HIS COMPOSURE SHATTERED
AT THE SUDDEN EX-GIRLFRIEND ATTACK

275
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,967
We can joke about it for a good laugh,

276
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,569
but he got all serious about it.

277
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,603
It's because he's nice.

278
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,638
You talk about my ex-husband all the time.

279
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,940
When did I do that?

280
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,641
-Woo-jae, why don't you be cool
-Okay

281
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,110
and send a video letter
to your ex-girlfriend?

282
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,679
-Yeah.
-Yeah, he's right.

283
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,280
I heard you cry every day.

284
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,848
Even still.

285
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,519
I heard you still cry a lot,
even after all these years.

286
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,888
What can you do?
That's just the kind of person I am.

287
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,423
-You're a scumbag.
-Be happy.

288
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,659
But we had a lot of good times,

289
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,896
so isn't that enough?

290
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,931
THE JERK SIDE OF HIM
EXCEEDS OUR IMAGINATION

291
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,633
Don't we date to be happy?

292
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,668
After he says all this, he'll go home

293
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,036
and call her and say, "It's me."

294
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,606
"It'll air around the end of October."

295
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,241
"I'm so sorry."

296
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,777
-"I'll send you some money. I'm so sorry."
-Since I

297
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,180
sent one to my ex-girlfriend,
he should send one

298
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,481
to his current girlfriend.

299
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,050
Geez. What?
Why do you keep messing with me?

300
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,152
-People will believe you.
-I know.

301
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,521
-Just make it funny.
-How can I make it funny?

302
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,459
After that episode aired,
I was very happy with the comments.

303
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,427
A small number of them said,

304
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,762
"I bet he has a girlfriend."

305
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,330
-Really?
-Then,

306
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,065
-look.
-I was so satisfied.

307
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,267
-Why?
-Answer honestly.

308
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,969
-What is your type?
-What?

309
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,070
What's your type?

310
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,805
Don't joke about it. Be serious.

311
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,041
You know, I thought I had a type,

312
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,577
but I realized how pointless that was
as time went by.

313
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,413
Then, what about this?
What type don't you like?

314
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,448
-What type don't you like?
-Someone

315
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,952
who is just drop-dead gorgeous.

316
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,553
-Like a celebrity.
-So not me.

317
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,255
-Me neither.
-Nope.

318
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,957
It has nothing to do with you two.

319
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,025
Anyone can tell.

320
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,127
-How annoying.
-You clearly look like a celebrity.

321
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,863
Now that I look at the two of you,
you guys are fancy.

322
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,899
-You definitely are fancy.
-Then,

323
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,368
let me ask you, Sook.
I am really curious about this.

324
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,437
What is your type, for real?

325
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,372
-Let me--
-Gu Bon-seung.

326
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,241
GU BON-SEUNG

327
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,510
Let me tell you what I don't like.

328
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,844
Okay.

329
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,446
I don't like guys who mess around.

330
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,914
You must hate Woo-young.

331
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,250
What if you met him as a man?

332
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,319
Someone who responds jokingly
when we are having a serious conversation?

333
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,587
I hate that so much.

334
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,524
Of the three of us,
whose personality do you like the most?

335
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,093
Considering just the personality.
It would be Woo-jae.

336
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,596
Woo-jae wouldn't joke
when someone is being serious.

337
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,497
-I see.
-She's right.

338
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,866
The problem is that
he doesn't really listen carefully.

339
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,868
"Fatigue? What is that? Why?"

340
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,336
"Why are you sad about that, Sook?"

341
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,605
-He may say that--
-I'll listen to all of that.

342
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,274
He may say that, but he would…

343
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,675
I just remembered an incident.

344
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,577
One day,

345
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,814
I met her on set
and she told me out of the blue,

346
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,916
"Woo-jae, I have decided

347
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,317
to become kind."

348
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,619
"I was talking to Sae-ho yesterday

349
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,189
and I realized how kind he was."

350
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,157
She said she felt so many things

351
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,027
and that she was
going to be kind from now on.

352
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,697
So I said "Okay, Jin-kyung."
But when I saw her the next time,

353
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,832
she was the same.

354
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,267
HER RESOLUTION LASTED ONE DAY

355
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,305
You know, I realize that
I should be kinder

356
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,406
when I see Sae-ho.

357
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,875
Do you know how kind he is over the phone?

358
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,845
-Yeah, he's kind.
-"Jin-kyung, have you eaten yet?"

359
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,647
-It warms my heart.
-Gosh.

360
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,517
Woo-jae may be prickly to other people,

361
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,152
-but he's kind to us.
-Yeah.

362
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,253
-Right.
-I'm not prickly.

363
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,921
He just can't express himself well.

364
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,456
-I don't know how.
-He's kind.

365
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,158
Woo-jae, what's going on here?

366
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,260
-You were so sweet.
-While I was zipping up…

367
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,863
-That must have hurt so much.
-While I was zipping up…

368
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,198
-Are you being kind all of a sudden?
-What's happening?

369
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,166
-Am I kind?
-What?

370
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,235
-Am I kind?
-I almost threw everything up.

371
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,569
-Am I not kind?
-What the heck?

372
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,338
It doesn't suit her, does it?

373
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,672
-No.
-Doesn't she look scary?

374
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,642
Woo-jae, you should
put some cream on it.

375
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,111
That doesn't suit you.

376
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,679
She sounds awkward.

377
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,281
We have a kind game prepared.

378
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,783
-Okay.
-Yeah.

379
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,951
-Shall we play a kind game?
-Okay.

380
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,954
Our staff members should eat too.

381
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,624
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE SCARING US

382
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,425
-Geez.
-Three, two, one.

383
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,528
That was a learned kindness.

384
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,862
I mean it.

385
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,864
I'm going to be kind.

386
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,966
KIND HONG JIN-KYUNG IS COMING SOON

387
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,602
NETS ARE SURROUNDING THEM

388
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,970
What's this?

389
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,138
Are we going to wrestle?

390
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,473
WE WERE GOING TO PLAY A KIND GAME
WHY IS A NET HERE?

391
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,374
A match?

392
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,877
-Let me explain the game you'll play.
-This is suspicious.

393
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,079
-We're going to play a few games.
-What is it?

394
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,416
-These games will be one against four too.
-One against four.

395
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,852
Depending on the final result,

396
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,987
the losing team will face a humiliating

397
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,589
-punishment.
-Humiliating?

398
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,560
Woo-jae's life is integrated
into this game as well.

399
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,964
Do you know what your strength is
as a model, Woo-jae?

400
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,499
My strength as a model?

401
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,700
-Yes.
-His tall height.

402
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,101
Not gaining weight.

403
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,671
-I'm not that tall for a model.
-Not gaining weight.

404
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,939
Others are skinnier than me.

405
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,208
He doesn't gain weight though.

406
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,709
My strength as a model?

407
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,744
-Walking?
-No.

408
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,346
-Long legs?
-They all have long legs.

409
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,014
-Your pose.
-It's not that great.

410
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,983
Your face, your expression, your vibe?

411
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,319
How can I put this? Well…

412
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,287
nothing.

413
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,756
-Nothing?
-I think it's this.

414
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,159
Basically, Woo-jae likes clothes.

415
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,162
-Yeah.
-Some models aren't interested in clothes.

416
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,330
-Yeah.
-There are a lot.

417
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,434
I think Jin-kyung pointed out something
that I didn't even think about.

418
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,537
There aren't that many
that actually wear the runway look.

419
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,905
It's rarer than you think.

420
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,242
Woo-jae's career as a celebrity
started out as a model.

421
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,211
I heard you didn't start it
with the future in mind.

422
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,112
I didn't.

423
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,914
Everyone was lined up for the audition.

424
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,283
It's set up like a studio
with full-length mirrors.

425
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,053
When I stood next to some of them,
I felt intimidated.

426
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,823
So I thought to myself,
"Since I can't become the best,

427
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,059
I thought I could try to be unique.
Look for an opening."

428
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,060
CARVING OUT HIS OWN NICHE

429
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,063
So we prepared a game about Woo-jae

430
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,532
that is like walking through his life,
facing a pitch-black wall

431
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,701
where you can't see an inch ahead.

432
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,571
This is a game that captures
his passion of tirelessly moving forward

433
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,106
even in the darkness.

434
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,007
It is called

435
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,211
Try to Catch Me if You Can.
If I Catch You, You're Dead.

436
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,179
It must be like a game of tag.

437
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,247
Try To Catch Me?

438
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,050
What does that have to do
with the life I lived?

439
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,285
You're really pushing it.

440
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,086
-No.
-What does that

441
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,589
have to do with the life that I lived?

442
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,191
-One step at a time. Carefully.
-Geez.

443
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,294
-You're trying too hard.
-All right.

444
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,561
No, it isn't.

445
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,196
The diligent life you lead.

446
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,666
You can see it as a game that is

447
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,635
-exactly like your life, Woo-jae.
-Okay.

448
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,704
Of course, it's four against one.

449
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,440
Woo-jae, you're the tagger.

450
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,742
-If we get caught, we die?
-Yeah.

451
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,277
As the tagger,

452
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,614
you will wear a blindfold
and hold a pool noodle.

453
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,683
You have to listen closely
for anyone's presence

454
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,385
and hit them with your pool noodle.

455
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,388
During the game,
the rest of you will be wearing slippers.

456
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,259
A chicken will be glued
to the bottom of your slippers.

457
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,193
The screaming chicken.

458
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,330
-It'll scream whenever you take a step.
-It screams.

459
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,932
IN THE 2ND ROUND, THERE WILL BE
A CHANGE IN OFFENSE AND DEFENSE

460
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,734
You have 100 seconds.

461
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,839
THE TEAM THAT HITS MORE
DURING THE 100 SECONDS WINS

462
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,374
That's easy for me.

463
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,109
I know. He has long arms.

464
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,077
Exactly.

465
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,712
I can just spin around.

466
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,148
But he lacks stamina.

467
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,283
True.

468
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,484
He's already tired.

469
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,155
QUACK

470
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,496
That thing is so loud.

471
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,964
It's too loud.

472
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,200
THE CHICKENS ARE SCREAMING
WHENEVER THEY MOVE

473
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,502
You have 100 seconds.

474
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,603
IF I CATCH YOU, YOU'RE DEAD

475
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,774
COME AND CATCH ME

476
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,746
Let's all run around
and make a lot of noise

477
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,447
-to confuse him.
-Yeah, let's do that.

478
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,915
STRATEGY: MAKE A LOT OF NOISE
TO CONFUSE HIM

479
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,151
FOLLOWING THE SOUND

480
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,020
Ready.

481
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,821
Set.

482
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,289
Why is he following me?

483
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,592
GO!

484
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,662
HIS ARM IS VERY LONG

485
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,265
SO CLOSE

486
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,533
Someone's here.

487
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,934
SOMEONE'S HERE

488
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,170
HE CAN FIND HIS ARCH-NEMESIS
EVEN WITH HIS EYES CLOSED

489
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,705
LIFE SUCKS…

490
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,743
CAN'T TELL WHO HAS THEIR EYES COVERED

491
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,146
SWITCHING TARGET

492
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,080
Here's one.

493
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,451
SWITCHING TARGET AGAIN

494
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,090
SWITCHING TARGET FOR THE 3RD TIME

495
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,861
THE EXECUTIONER RULES THE RING

496
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,964
THE TARGET MOST FUN TO HIT IS JIN-KYUNG

497
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,201
THIS ONE'S AN EASY TARGET

498
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,673
WHY ARE YOU ONLY HITTING ME?

499
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,409
SHE GOT HIT COUNTERCLOCKWISE

500
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,278
AND SHE GOT HIT CLOCKWISE

501
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,947
COME ON

502
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,883
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

503
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,319
SOMEHOW IT ENDED UP BEING A ONE-ON-ON GAME

504
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,754
RUN, RUN, RUN

505
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,757
SOOK HIDES ON ONE SIDE
COUNTING ON JIN-KYUNG

506
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,595
SHE'S IN DANGER OF BEING CAUGHT

507
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,330
TAP

508
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:20,799
Who is this?

509
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,635
AS IF BEATING THE DUST OUT OF A BLANKET

510
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,237
Who is this?

511
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,209
HIDING BEHIND HIS BIG SIS
WHO IS GETTING BEAT UP

512
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,178
HE SPOTS THE BIG SISTERS EVERY TIME

513
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,079
Who's there?

514
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,056
WHILE SOME MANAGE TO STAY STILL
AND AVOID GETTING HIT…

515
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,557
WHY DOES HE KEEP HITTING ME…

516
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,727
TERRIFIED

517
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,464
THANKS TO SAE-HO SHE IS SAVED

518
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,200
Someone's here.

519
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,203
HE SEEMS TO HAVE GPS FOR THE BIG SISTERS

520
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,807
SLOWLY GETTING TIRED

521
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,477
Someone's here.

522
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,982
FINAL SPURT

523
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,819
Someone's passing by.

524
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,189
GAME OVER

525
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,424
Geez. He is so good at hitting us.

526
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,527
Oh, my gosh.

527
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,795
OUT OF ENERGY

528
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,898
-Let me tell you the final count.
-Okay.

529
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,065
He got

530
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,834
a total of 84 hits.

531
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,736
I knew it.

532
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,271
-He hits well.
-He was good.

533
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,640
Jin-kyung got about 60 of those.

534
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,209
He could spot Jin-kyung so well.

535
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,577
There are those

536
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,479
who do something when you hit them.

537
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,880
They duck to get away.

538
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,015
But one person

539
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,617
would just keep making noises
as they walk by me.

540
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,987
All I had to do was hit
the person that kept making that noise.

541
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,888
THAT WAS HONG JIN-KYUNG

542
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,457
That was so funny.

543
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,825
-Really?
-How do we switch?

544
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,195
This time, the members are the taggers

545
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,697
and Woo-jae has to run away from you.

546
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,399
It's going to be hard

547
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,000
if the four of them come at me.

548
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,236
Watch out. I'm going to hit hard.

549
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,304
WARNING HIM OF A SAVAGE REVENGE

550
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,140
We're ready.

551
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,878
THE PAST HUMILIATION
OF BEING DEFEATED BY WOO-JAE

552
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,845
What the heck?

553
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,014
Isn't yours already decided?

554
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,152
MOST OF THE TIME, JIN-KYUNG IS HIS VICTIM

555
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,388
When we hear something,

556
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,258
-we'll corner him like this.
-Okay.

557
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,794
Swing this around so he can't get out.

558
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,195
-Okay.
-Yell "I got him!"

559
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,530
I got him.

560
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,732
Let's tell each other where he is.

561
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,100
THEY'RE GOING TO TELL
ONE ANOTHER WHERE HE IS

562
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,035
Ready.

563
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,070
THEY MUST HIT HIM MORE THAN 84 TIMES

564
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:38,971
Set.

565
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,572
GO!

566
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,944
HE QUICKLY RUNS AWAY

567
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:47,646
WHACK

568
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,915
THE BEATING FEELS PERSONAL

569
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,518
WHERE DID HE RUN OFF TO?

570
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,419
TAP

571
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,721
Who's this?

572
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,189
Behind you. He's behind you.

573
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,524
I FOUND YOU, WOO-JAE!

574
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,692
CRYING

575
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,399
DEVELOPED THE SKILL OF
WALKING WITHOUT MAKING ANY NOISE

576
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,234
I don't hear anything.

577
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,204
-Over there. Behind you!
-Here he is.

578
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,439
Behind you.

579
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,443
Who's over here?

580
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,145
Who is this?

581
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,847
HE'LL GO TO ANY LENGTHS

582
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:24,850
Behind you!

583
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,418
KILLING THEIR OWN TEAM

584
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,121
WHILE THINGS ARE A BIT OF A MESS

585
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,291
THE NET CLOSES IN ON HIM LITTLE BY LITTLE

586
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,059
Who is this?

587
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,360
I think he's here.

588
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,628
Who is this?

589
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,963
I think he's here.

590
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,366
UNABLE TO TELL FRIEND FROM FOE

591
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,535
SEEMS LIKE THE STORY OF OUR LIVES

592
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,970
We can't hear anything.

593
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,371
Listen carefully.

594
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,806
RELAXED

595
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,810
-Hey, Sae-ho!
-Is it you?

596
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,413
-Come on, man!
-He isn't here. It's just us.

597
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,181
Listen for the noise.

598
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,986
Who's this?

599
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,020
Who is this?

600
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,924
WHERE THE HECK IS HE?

601
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,761
-Hey
-Who is this?

602
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,229
-It's me.
-It's Sae-ho.

603
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,332
Hang on. Let's gather around.

604
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,534
-Hey, I'm here.
-Where are you?

605
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,102
-Where are you, Sae-ho?
-It's me.

606
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,136
-Jin-kyung.
-And Sae-ho?

607
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,338
He took it off.

608
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,872
-Here we are.
-Hey.

609
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,574
-What?
-He's behind me.

610
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,842
-Where?
-Behind you.

611
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,143
-Behind me?
-Where is he?

612
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,045
-Swing it.
-Darn it.

613
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,246
Where?

614
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,815
GAME OVER

615
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,818
IS HE DOING IT ON PURPOSE?

616
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,719
Who's this?

617
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,454
Didn't he cheat during the game?

618
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,888
I think he took off his shoes.

619
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,023
Shall I tell you the truth?

620
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,892
I didn't take them off.
I just left the ring.

621
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,094
What the heck?

622
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,428
I can do what I want.

623
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,930
That's cheating though.

624
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,732
-I knew it. It made no sense.
-Do over.

625
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,400
-Let's do it again.
-Fine. I lost.

626
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,301
-No.
-Do over.

627
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,202
Why?

628
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,503
-Stand in the center.
-No.

629
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,238
I want to beat you properly.

630
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,306
-In the center.
-I lost.

631
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,674
-Do over.
-I cheated so I lost.

632
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,908
-We'll have a do-over.
-Yeah.

633
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,478
-Let's hold hands and corner him.
-Okay.

634
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,313
THEY GET ANOTHER CHANCE AT REVENGE

635
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,614
Ready.

636
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,784
Set.

637
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,687
GO!

638
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,357
WHERE'S JOO WOO-JAE?

639
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,727
WOO-JAE IS CORNERED FROM THE START

640
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,265
-He's here.
-Over there!

641
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,301
Hey, it's me. Stop. It's me.

642
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,137
THEIR STRONG WILL TO BEAT WOO-JAE

643
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,005
Ouch!

644
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,941
HE GETS BEAT UP IN THE END

645
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,578
FRIENDLY FIRE ON THE HEAD

646
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,648
SHOT ON THE HEAD WORTH 100 POINTS

647
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,786
FEAR YOUR OWN TEAM MEMBERS THE MOST

648
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,155
Listen for him.

649
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,189
GETTING AWAY THANKS TO THEM

650
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,525
WHACK

651
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,927
LAUGHING

652
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,463
THIS TARGET IS GREAT TO HIT

653
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,565
Hey, it's me. It's Sook.

654
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,438
MEANWHILE, HE QUICKLY GETS AWAY

655
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,073
Over there. He's over there!

656
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,342
HITTING THEIR OWN TEAM

657
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,012
What?

658
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,014
-It's me.
-It's me.

659
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,248
-It's me.
-It's me!

660
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,983
It's me.

661
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,151
WHEN DOES THIS END?

662
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,920
It's me. It's me.

663
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,521
I said it's me.

664
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,522
LAST WHACK

665
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,357
I told you that it was me, Sae-ho.

666
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,926
Where on earth is he?

667
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,427
Were you here this whole time?

668
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,062
YEAH

669
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,730
Geez. That sneaky scumbag.

670
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,732
How many times did we hit Woo-jae?

671
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,700
A total of 35 hits.

672
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,335
-35 hits?
-A total of 35.

673
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,437
We hit him more than I expected.

674
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,872
Wait, I won then.

675
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,674
Woo-jae won this round.

676
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,909
-I accept.
-I accept this one.

677
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,315
Currently Woo-jae is
leading with one to zero.

678
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,416
THE GAME THAT THEY'LL PLAY NOW

679
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,917
Okay. This game

680
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,419
will not be physical.

681
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,787
Will we use our brains?

682
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,121
Then, we'll lose.

683
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,157
NO CONFIDENCE BEFORE THEY EVEN START

684
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,025
Do you know the game Kung Kung Dda?

685
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,360
Of course.

686
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,896
Kung Kung Dda was a huge hit

687
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,499
-on a show at KBS.
-Kung Kung Dda.

688
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,867
It's a word chain game.

689
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,337
But you have to maintain the rhythm.

690
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,839
You play a word chain game
with three syllable words.

691
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,875
The beauty of this game

692
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,110
is the never-ending Kung song.

693
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,380
Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung

694
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,915
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

695
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,450
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

696
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,018
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

697
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,720
Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung

698
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,955
-It starts again.
-Yes.

699
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,258
The beauty of it is that
you don't know when it'll start.

700
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,960
You're right. We are going to
play the game Kung Kung Dda,

701
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,263
but it's the Last Kung Kung Dda.

702
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,664
The Last Kung Kung Dda?

703
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,034
You'll play the three-syllable
word chain game one by one.

704
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,168
But this is different.

705
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,403
Sae-ho.

706
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,040
The first player has to say a word
that starts with the Korean character

707
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,608
-I give you.
-Okay.

708
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,511
From that point,
you do the usual word chain,

709
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,880
but before Woo-jae's turn starts,

710
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,149
I'm going to give you
the name of a location.

711
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,853
You must say a word
that would exist in that location.

712
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,621
THIS IS DIFFICULT

713
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,523
-For example, if I say,
-Let's try it.

714
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,426
"Spinach." Kung Kung Dda.

715
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,495
Toothpaste.

716
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,163
-That's two syllables in Korean.
-No.

717
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,431
TOOTHPASTE IS TWO SYLLABLES IN KOREAN

718
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,632
Chiaksan Mountain.

719
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,733
Good job.

720
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,634
That was hard.

721
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,237
Chiaksan Mountain. Kung Kung Dda.

722
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,672
Wild…

723
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,140
-Rabbit.
-Rabbit.

724
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,743
Excuse me, but I don't think
my turn will come at this rate.

725
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,844
That's the point.

726
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,246
-It won't reach me.
-Wild rabbit.

727
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,380
-There's nothing.
-Try it.

728
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,150
Outgoing. Kung Kung Dda.

729
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,519
It has to start with EE,
but let's say I give you

730
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,421
"market" as a location.

731
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,723
Something that starts
with EE in the market.

732
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,624
Auntie.

733
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,393
I'll accept it even if
it isn't three syllables.

734
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,262
Even if it's 20 syllables, I'll accept it.

735
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,231
So if the location is market
and the word has to start with EE,

736
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:45,170
I can say, "A child born to
the Lee family went to the market."

737
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,071
No, that's wrong.

738
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,138
Something in the market.

739
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,673
-It has to be a noun.
-Geez.

740
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,142
Can't it be something like,
"A child wearing a name tag?"

741
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,844
-Can't it be like that?
-Yeah.

742
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,213
It can be a sentence,
but it has to end in as a noun.

743
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,083
I'm not kidding around.
You'd better play well.

744
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,018
-Okay.
-Because I don't think it'll reach me.

745
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,387
That's why this game
can ruin your own team.

746
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,690
-Because we play with each other?
-Right. Until you make it to Sook…

747
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,958
Should I go first?

748
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:07,892
Okay.

749
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,160
-Right?
-Yeah.

750
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,195
STRATEGICALLY CHANGING POSITIONS

751
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,865
So when Woo-jae succeeds,
he gets one point,

752
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,202
and if he fails,
the four of you will get one point.

753
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,103
Okay.

754
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,237
Don't mess up.

755
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,373
-One, two, three. We got this.
-We got this.

756
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,874
It won't come to me.

757
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,242
Okay.

758
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,678
At the last point of
the Kung Kung Dda song,

759
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,180
can we put our own name for this game?

760
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,415
WHAT IF WE PUT OUR OWN SIGNATURE SOUND?

761
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,651
How about this? The Joo Jerk!

762
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,085
-The Joo Jerk?
-Yeah, the Joo Jerk.

763
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,320
-Let's do it.
-Let's try it.

764
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,255
-The Joo Jerk?
-I'll win anyway.

765
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,790
One, two, three, four.

766
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,526
-Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung
-Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung

767
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,961
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

768
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,329
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

769
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,764
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

770
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,198
The Joo Jerk

771
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,933
The Joo Jerk

772
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,368
Okay.

773
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,469
-Are you okay?
-All good.

774
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,571
-Are your feelings hurt?
-Not at all.

775
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,407
With all due respect,

776
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,076
there's only five of you,
so can we keep the direction in sync?

777
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,178
IT'S A SIMPLE MOVE, LET'S GET IT IN SYNC

778
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,079
Hey, dancer.

779
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,214
-The left, okay?
-Yes, start with the left.

780
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,582
Here's the topic.

781
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,484
I'll give you
the first letter and the topic.

782
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,119
The syllable Ga.

783
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,020
Cafe.

784
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,355
One, two, three, four.

785
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,591
-Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung
-Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung

786
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:14,693
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

787
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,994
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

788
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,395
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

789
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,897
The Joo Jerk

790
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,166
Giant family funeral.

791
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,002
Jean Valjean.

792
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,036
Jean Val…

793
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,371
Geez.

794
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,272
Fail.

795
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,239
Come on.

796
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,374
Why can't we move forward?

797
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,376
There were so many options. Just pick one.

798
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,477
Couldn't you do your name?

799
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,645
You could do your name.

800
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,447
-Okay. I'll give you another one.
-Okay.

801
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,715
GET A GRIP
HERE GOES THE 2ND ROUND

802
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,349
A Korean word that starts with Ma. Cafe.

803
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,251
-Okay. Ma.
-One, two, three, four.

804
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,153
IT'S ONLY THE FIRST GAME
JUST ENJOY IT AND TRY AGAIN

805
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,188
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

806
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,155
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

807
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,123
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

808
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,591
The Joo Jerk

809
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,526
Stable.

810
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,295
Braised liver.

811
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:54,799
BRAISED LIVER?

812
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,067
Does this make sense or…

813
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,235
Listen, Producer Park.

814
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,471
-It kind of makes sense, right?
-Look. It's already…

815
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,172
Isn't it already three to zero now?

816
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,240
Look it up.

817
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,141
They have it.

818
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,809
If there's braised liver, we pass.

819
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,311
-Yeah.
-Like pork liver.

820
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,046
-It's braising liver.
-Yeah.

821
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:08,947
I found it.

822
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,348
-Right?
-It's real?

823
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,649
BRAISED LIVER

824
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,585
I told you that there's braised liver.

825
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,353
-It's in the Dongui Bogam.
-Let's keep going.

826
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,421
Let's start from that.

827
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,690
-Jin-kyung knows all about Korean food.
-Remember "cafe."

828
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,425
-She knows Korean food.
-One, two, three.

829
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,227
Braised liver.

830
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,862
Im Kkeok-jeong.

831
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,430
Jeongbalsan.

832
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,732
STARTS WITH "SAN" IN KOREAN
AND IS AT A CAFE

833
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,967
Coffee with acidity.

834
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,102
You got it!

835
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,003
JOO WOO-JAE WINS

836
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,806
-Where's he going?
-What?

837
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,508
I was really fast, wasn't I?

838
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,044
Wasn't that super fast?
Coffee with acidity.

839
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,080
Listen, I think I was…

840
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,114
(ANNOYED)

841
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,083
I got chills just now.

842
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,652
Why does he look so ugly today?

843
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,421
-It's okay if I'm ugly.
-Right?

844
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,023
I said, "Coffee with acidity."

845
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,559
-Good job.
-Gosh. This was a bit…

846
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,028
CAN'T HELP BUT ACKNOWLEDGE
HIS QUICK-THINKING

847
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:57,929
Woo-jae is good.

848
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,197
I'm insanely good.

849
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,032
Let's move on to the next one.

850
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,368
The first syllable is Go. Market.

851
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,236
-There's a lot at a market.
-One, two, three, four.

852
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,238
HE'S CONFIDENCE IS AT MAX LEVEL

853
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,973
THE FIRST PLAYER HAS TO THINK FAST

854
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,043
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda
The Joo Jerk

855
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,578
WAIT, WHAT STARTS WITH G?

856
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,679
Icicle.

857
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,282
-Geez.
-I'm sorry.

858
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,249
How could you?

859
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,884
Use the initial sound rule.

860
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,619
Find something that
starts with Leum or Eum

861
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,887
Hang on. Leum or Eum.

862
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,222
Eum.

863
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,191
WILL MY TURN EVER COME?

864
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,693
THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS GAME

865
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,461
-I got it.
-Ready, go.

866
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,630
Icicle.

867
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,365
Recording label.

868
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,167
Con man.

869
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,635
Geez.

870
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,305
CON MAN

871
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,540
What's wrong with you?

872
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,942
You told me to do a hard one.

873
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,911
We have to do a hard one for him, not me.

874
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,013
Can you find a word that follows that?

875
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,448
THEIR TEAMWORK IS ASTOUNDING

876
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,450
They planned on picking a difficult word,

877
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,852
but they did it to themselves.

878
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,953
Give us one more chance.

879
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,955
-One more chance.
-It's too hard!

880
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,423
Another Korean word with Sa.

881
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,425
CEO.

882
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,993
We have to start from Icicle.

883
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,229
What? You'll start from there?
Are you okay with that?

884
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,097
Just hold still. Don't do anything.

885
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,131
-Go on.
-Ready, go.

886
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,299
Geez.

887
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,334
CEO.

888
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,336
Imjingak.

889
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,737
-What?
-Imjingak

890
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,239
Protractor.

891
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,441
-What?
-They sell them in markets.

892
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,842
-No, they don't.
-Do they?

893
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,310
Protractors at markets?

894
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,245
Stationery stores.

895
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,680
There were two stationery stores
in the market

896
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,849
at Gaeumjeong-dong in Changwon
where I lived.

897
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,852
They had protractors and compasses
and everything.

898
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,888
I think we need to sort this out.

899
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,090
You messed up when you said "Con man."

900
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,691
-No.
-Why?

901
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,059
It was from "recording label."

902
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,762
SHE PUT MORE THOUGHT
INTO CHOOSING HER LUNCH

903
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,464
Stay sharp, you guys.

904
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:40,999
Hong.

905
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,134
Hotel.

906
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,769
-Hotel?
-One, two, three, four.

907
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,306
THE ONLY THING THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT
KUNG KUNG DDA BY SCREWBALLS IS THE SONG

908
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,508
The Joo Jerk

909
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,409
Hong Jin-kyung.

910
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,244
Police station.

911
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,812
Station chief.

912
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,481
Imjingak.

913
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,216
Protractor.

914
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,550
Why would it be there?

915
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,718
Yeah!

916
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,820
-In a hotel--
-Come on.

917
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,422
-No protractors in a hotel.
-No way.

918
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,957
-Listen.
-Okay!

919
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,326
-Why would it be in a hotel?
-What else could I have said?

920
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:09,661
Cubed sugar.

921
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,095
Yeah, that works.

922
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,497
Yeah, hotels would have cubed sugar.

923
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,566
-Towels folded neatly.
-Yeah.

924
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,036
THAT'S TOO EASY

925
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,337
You guys should try it.

926
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,339
Did we win this round?

927
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,041
-You won one point.
-Okay!

928
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,043
I'm going to say end with "gak" again.
Watch out.

929
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,311
Darn it.

930
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,179
-Watch out.
-You'd better watch out.

931
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,247
Let's change seats.

932
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,548
-Yeah, let's change.
-Okay.

933
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,950
You should come first.

934
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,051
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

935
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,186
5TH ROUND GO

936
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,754
-A Korean word starting with Da.
-Da?

937
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,523
Playground.

938
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,124
One, two, three, four.

939
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,628
HE LOOKS MORE CONFIDENT
ABOUT THIS ONE THAN "HOTEL"

940
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,196
The Joo Jerk

941
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,898
Iron.

942
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,599
Beauty salon.

943
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,301
Salon manager.

944
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,003
Imjingak.

945
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,639
No!

946
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:55,540
No!

947
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,110
WE BEAT WOO-JAE

948
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,778
We did it. I like this route.

949
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,513
WHO KNEW I'D LOSE

950
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,882
-That was great.
-What was the location?

951
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,352
-It was playground.
-Oh, playground. I see.

952
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,987
A determined child.

953
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,990
A determined child who
wants to play in the playground.

954
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,491
Here goes another one.

955
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,159
Soo.

956
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,461
Gym.

957
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,763
-One, two, three, four.
-I don't know what's in a gym.

958
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,600
WHY WOO-JAE DOESN'T EXERCISE
I DON'T LIKE THE GYM…

959
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,102
Kung Kung Dda-ri, Kung Kung Dda

960
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,471
-The Joo Jerk
-The Joo Jerk

961
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,405
Wednesday.

962
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,308
Sunday.

963
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,409
Day…

964
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,610
Daily journal.

965
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,445
Jangdokdae.

966
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,882
WHAT WORD CAN HE THINK OF
THAT IS IN A GYM?

967
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:38,883
Pectoral muscle.

968
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,551
Pectoral muscle.

969
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,820
YES, THERE ARE
BULGING PECTORAL MUSCLES AT THE GYM

970
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:43,721
Pectoral muscles?

971
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,690
HE MUST HAVE PICKED IT UP FROM SOMEWHERE

972
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,958
Wasn't it supposed to be in a gym?

973
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,026
You got it.

974
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,428
What a shame.

975
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,132
HE GOES TO THE CROWD TO SHOW OFF AGAIN

976
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,233
Pectoral muscle.

977
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,168
Did you even think of that?

978
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,705
Did you see how I said "pectoral muscle"
as soon as I heard "gym"?

979
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,907
This is insane.

980
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,576
You don't have to accept it.

981
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,145
Pectoral muscle.

982
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,980
You don't have any.

983
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,815
-But you can find them at gyms.
-You don't.

984
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,016
You see them at gyms though.

985
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,251
He's good.

986
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,819
7TH ROUND GO

987
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,587
-Gi.
-Gi.

988
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,356
-That's hard.
-Woo-young's place.

989
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,024
-Woo-young's?
-One, two, three, four.

990
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,959
Kung, Kung, Kung, Kung

991
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,629
HE KNOWS WOO-YOUNG'S HOME
BETTER THAN THE GYM

992
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,065
The Joo Jerk

993
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:27,999
Giwa tile.

994
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,068
Jean Valjean.

995
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,471
Mother-in-law.

996
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,640
Kung Kung Dda.

997
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,275
Mackerel.

998
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,309
Kung Kung Dda.

999
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,377
Su-yeon.

1000
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,478
Su-yeon.

1001
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,746
SU-YEON?

1002
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,347
-Come on.
-What?

1003
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,982
-Su-yeon. His girlfriend.
-Come on.

1004
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,517
-That doesn't count.
-Are you insane?

1005
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,686
-Su-yeon.
-What girlfriend, man?

1006
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,421
That's correct, Woo-jae.

1007
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,823
What? That isn't correct!

1008
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,559
-Why is that correct?
-Su-yeon.

1009
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,096
I was debating whether I should
go with Su-jin or Su-yeon.

1010
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,099
No joke. When it was his turn,
I thought he was going to say Imjingak,

1011
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,035
so I was preparing to say
"Stylish girlfriend's outfit."

1012
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,237
So I switched it to "mackerel."

1013
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,705
GOT ATTACKED FOR NO REASON

1014
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,040
I debated that with Su-jin.

1015
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,309
What if I did Imjin River?

1016
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,211
-Kang Mi-young.
-Oh, Kang Mi-young.

1017
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,613
You can use names. This is hard.

1018
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,582
Okay. Let's start another game.

1019
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:21,152
Please pass the sketch books
to each member.

1020
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,654
Games that involve sketch books are fun.

1021
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,691
Why aren't you giving me one?

1022
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,326
You don't get one, Woo-jae.

1023
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,528
We're going to give you a quiz
from the screen.

1024
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,296
If it's math, we're dead.

1025
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,732
I'm sure the staff wouldn't
give us a math quiz.

1026
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,634
This is called Problem Solving Guy.

1027
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,670
We've prepared some problems
under that name.

1028
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,940
If calculations are involved,
the four of you can

1029
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,775
-write it down.
-Do it for us, Sae-ho.

1030
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,512
The four of you can
write down what you have to calculate.

1031
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,547
But Woo-jae can
only calculate in his head.

1032
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,415
I'm not good at that though.

1033
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,384
-I might lose.
-You'll still be good at it.

1034
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,352
DOESN'T MEAN IT AT ALL

1035
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,953
You have to call out "I got it!" first.

1036
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,755
And then, answer immediately.

1037
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,591
You can't call out "I got it!"
and then start calculating.

1038
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,894
It's really damaging to me
that they can write it down.

1039
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,963
FIRST PROBLEM

1040
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,498
-I got it. 216.
-I got it.

1041
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,933
That's correct.

1042
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,668
Why are you writing that?

1043
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,771
You're unbelievable.

1044
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,907
-You can write it down?
-Why write it down?

1045
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,975
Then, why didn't you get it?

1046
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,411
He said he'd calculate it,
so I didn't do anything.

1047
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,514
Why were you writing that down?
That is just unbelievable.

1048
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,917
THE SKETCHBOOKS DON'T SEEM TO BE HELPFUL

1049
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,352
I'd rather not have this.
I write on it since it's here.

1050
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,954
I can just calculate it.

1051
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,990
Here's the next problem.

1052
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:33,925
Here it is.

1053
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,227
SECOND PROBLEM

1054
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,695
-I got it.
-I got it. 366.

1055
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,596
No.

1056
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,665
-I got it. 386.
-376.

1057
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,999
-That's correct.
-What?

1058
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,536
-All of us got it wrong.
-Hang on.

1059
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,939
-Seven times eight is 56.
-Seven times eight is 56.

1060
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,441
-Four times eight is 32.
-Oh, it's 32.

1061
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,243
Did I mishear them?

1062
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,878
I heard seven times eight is 56.

1063
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,047
Seven times eight is 56.
What's wrong with that?

1064
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,815
I can't say that it's 70, can I?

1065
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,585
Fine. I guess you can mumble it.

1066
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:01,886
So what's the score?

1067
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,654
He got two points. It's two to zero.

1068
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,756
We didn't get this one either? I see.

1069
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,392
Don't write it down from now on.
Just do it in your head.

1070
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,361
Gosh, this is funny.

1071
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,763
THIRD PROBLEM

1072
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,365
Gosh, this one's really hard.

1073
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,935
SHE DEFINITELY TOLD THEM
NOT TO WRITE IT DOWN

1074
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,171
BUT HER HANDS HAVE
NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT

1075
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,307
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME

1076
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,345
HE IS IN A LONELY BATTLE WITHOUT ANY TOOLS

1077
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,914
CALCULATING ON PAPER VERSUS IN ONE'S HEAD
WHO WILL WIN THIS ONE?

1078
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:30,982
-I got it.
-I got it.

1079
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:31,916
Okay. Woo-young.

1080
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:32,817
490.

1081
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,151
-Okay.
-That's right.

1082
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,621
-He's right.
-Okay!

1083
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,155
You didn't know, did you?

1084
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,190
I knew.

1085
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,925
-I called out.
-No, you didn't.

1086
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,628
Be honest. You didn't know, did you?

1087
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,663
-Of course, I did.
-No, you didn't.

1088
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,064
-I knew.
-Come on. Stop.

1089
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,600
LET'S JUST SAY HE DIDN'T KNOW

1090
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,769
FOURTH PROBLEM

1091
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,037
-I don't know this.
-I got it.

1092
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,238
-Woo-jae.
-15.

1093
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,139
That's correct.

1094
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,774
Man, it's 15 times 15.

1095
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,145
I don't want to do this anymore.
It's upsetting.

1096
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,347
LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT

1097
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,716
I didn't calculate this one though.

1098
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,551
It was just a habit that came out.

1099
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,820
Fine, it's your habit.
And I knew it was 15 too.

1100
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,656
I wrote 15 here too.

1101
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,492
But can you explain
how to calculate the root of 225?

1102
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,027
-It's confusing.
-You see,

1103
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,463
the way to calculate the root of 225 is…

1104
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,464
Anyway,

1105
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,733
-Square root?
-it's a square root.

1106
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,636
What's that? If you multiply it by itself,
you get that number.

1107
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,604
-Right.
-The solution.

1108
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,206
You have to get 225
when you multiply it by itself.

1109
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,107
-Right.
-Right.

1110
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,075
That's how you get

1111
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,343
-the square root of 225.
-Yes.

1112
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,244
I know that too.

1113
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,478
Look, Sae-ho.

1114
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,180
It's like this.

1115
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,481
How do you do this?

1116
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,819
Five times four is 20.
So it is 45, okay?

1117
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,488
Five times nine is 45.
Then, you can divide it by three.

1118
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,357
-You end up with two each, right?
-I see.

1119
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,925
And five times three is 15.

1120
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,461
-You bring it out of the root.
-How simple.

1121
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,396
That method is called prime factorization.

1122
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,532
You have to do prime factorization.

1123
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,100
FIFTH PROBLEM

1124
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,868
-I got it. Four, five.
-Four, five.

1125
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,071
-You got it.
-No need to say "I got it."

1126
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,006
Let's do something other than math.

1127
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,310
I think this one is a bit of
a disadvantage for Woo-jae

1128
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,480
based on our experiences.

1129
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,350
-We'll do some nonsense quizzes.
-I love these.

1130
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,351
Oh, no. Kim Sook.

1131
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,585
THIS IS WHAT SOOK WAS GOOD AT!

1132
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,656
"One person died after a clapping sound.
What were they doing before their death?"

1133
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,691
After a clapping sound?

1134
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,759
The 369 Game.

1135
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,729
YOU NEED INTUITION IN THIS AREA
NOT BEING GOOD AT CALCULUS

1136
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,830
I did it.

1137
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:26,864
Oh, my.

1138
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,734
What's the number that
can get anyone to stand up?

1139
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,535
-A number that makes people stand up.
-Stand up.

1140
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,637
ANOTHER STRONG CONTENDER
IN NONSENSE QUIZZES, CHO SAE-HO

1141
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,272
Stand up.

1142
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,674
Give me number 20.

1143
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,842
CAN WOO-JAE BEAT THEM IN THIS?

1144
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,377
Do we have to call out "I got it"?

1145
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,412
I think he'll be good.

1146
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,647
You need this stick after you eat.
What is it?

1147
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,983
A stick after you eat?

1148
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,084
-I got it!
-Sae-ho.

1149
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:47,985
Toothpick.

1150
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,354
-That's correct.
-All right. Let's go!

1151
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,324
IT IS PROPER TO USE
A TOOTHPICK AFTER YOU EAT

1152
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,860
Good. Very good!

1153
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,827
-Good job.
-Toothpick.

1154
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,028
He's really bad at this.

1155
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,497
It's so childish.

1156
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,365
Toothpick

1157
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,635
I need this stick after I eat
is toothpick?

1158
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:05,669
Yeah, it's a toothpick.

1159
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,804
-Yeah.
-Right.

1160
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,806
-That's accurate.
-You use it right after.

1161
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:09,740
Here's the next one.

1162
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,309
-I think Sae-ho will be good at this.
-I love these so much.

1163
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,878
WHAT ANIMAL IS BORN UP HIGH?

1164
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,079
I got it!

1165
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,714
-Hyena.
-That's correct.

1166
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,749
HYENA

1167
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,851
SAE-HO GETS ANOTHER ANSWER CORRECT

1168
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,219
You're good.

1169
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,320
IT'S A PARTY

1170
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,855
Woo-jae doesn't get it.

1171
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,257
I had no clue.

1172
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,693
It's born high up!

1173
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,630
Shouldn't the spelling be different then?

1174
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,031
Let's move on.

1175
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,633
All right.

1176
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,568
Shouldn't it have another "a" in it?

1177
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,903
If it's being born up there?

1178
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,237
It's so illogical.

1179
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,641
What did the beer say before it died?

1180
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,210
I got it. Good beer.

1181
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,212
Wrong.

1182
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,549
What did the beer say before it died?

1183
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,585
SAE-HO IS HESITANT WITH THIS ONE

1184
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,220
Before it died?

1185
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,555
Beer.

1186
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,357
WHAT DID THE BEER SAY BEFORE IT DIED?

1187
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,593
Beer? Beer.

1188
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,495
Is "beer" in it?

1189
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,931
-You can't ask that.
-I got it!

1190
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,566
Hold my beer!

1191
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,634
HOLD MY BEER

1192
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,505
SAE-HO GETS 3 ANSWERS IN A ROW CORRECT

1193
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,840
Hold my beer.

1194
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,075
-Hold my beer.
-Awesome.

1195
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,310
You're the best.

1196
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,911
You're good at this!

1197
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,113
This one was a hard one. Well done.

1198
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,315
Gosh, this is…

1199
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,316
It just comes to me.

1200
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,284
This segment is made for Sae-ho.

1201
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,086
Gosh, this is hilarious.

1202
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,721
-How funny.
-How lame.

1203
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,490
-This is so fun.
-This is too lame.

1204
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,225
-Can't we do some more?
-Okay, we will.

1205
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,493
-Yeah.
-Got it.

1206
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,627
It's so funny.

1207
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,263
WHAT DID GOD FORGET WHEN HE MADE BABIES?

1208
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,564
What did God forget?

1209
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,333
What did God forget?

1210
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,703
I got it. He forgot the sleep button.

1211
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,205
That's correct.

1212
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,607
I was thinking in that direction.

1213
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,275
I was also going in that direction.

1214
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,610
Man, I was close.

1215
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,278
I wish I could've danced again.

1216
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,580
-Sae-ho, do better.
-Okay.

1217
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,549
-Good job.
-Here's the next one.

1218
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,618
We're all getting immersed in this.

1219
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,786
WHAT IS A HOOD YOU CAN'T WEAR
BUT YOU LOVE JUST THE SAME?

1220
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,255
I got it. Brotherhood.

1221
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,557
Wow. I knew this one already.

1222
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,825
Lalala soda pop

1223
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,726
SLAP

1224
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,296
HE'S MORE EXCITED NOW
THAN HIS MATH QUESTIONS

1225
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,199
Woo-jae can't be good at this too.

1226
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,400
I knew this one. He beat me.

1227
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,503
Since many of you are good at this,
let me give you a tough one.

1228
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,706
What's the name of the building
built with a cell phone?

1229
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,408
Building built with a cell phone?

1230
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,311
-Building.
-Cell phone.

1231
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,313
The difficulty level is high for this one.

1232
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,347
THE NONSENSE QUIZ GENIUS THINKS HARD

1233
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,049
HE'S THINKING HARD TOO

1234
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,617
-Oh!
-You got it?

1235
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,386
SAE-HO AGAIN?

1236
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,954
Colosseum?

1237
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,822
-That's right.
-Correct.

1238
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,626
-Wow!
-He's a genius!

1239
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,061
NONSENSE QUIZ GENIUS CHO SAE-HO

1240
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,497
Because "Col" sounds like "call."

1241
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,134
Oh, yeah. Call, call.

1242
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,869
-Col sounds like "call."
-Awesome.

1243
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,537
-Call-osseum.
-You're so good.

1244
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,406
I couldn't get that even if I had an hour.

1245
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,607
You're awesome, Sae-ho.

1246
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,775
I like these.

1247
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,510
You're a nonsense quiz genius.

1248
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,778
Here's the next one.

1249
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:01,946
THIS PERSON IS GETTING NERVOUS

1250
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,048
What do you call an indifferent knife?

1251
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,117
I got it. Bored knife.

1252
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,686
Incorrect.

1253
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:10,521
THIS ONE IS DIFFICULT TOO

1254
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,523
My mind got stuck on something else.

1255
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,725
Here's a hint.

1256
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,827
Think of the sharpness.

1257
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,463
I got it.

1258
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,397
He got it.

1259
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,266
Blunt knife. Lalala soda pop

1260
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,400
SLAP

1261
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,970
-Oh, blunt knife.
-Lalala soda pop

1262
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,305
-I didn't think of that.
-Blunt.

1263
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,841
-I didn't think of that.
-Blunt knife.

1264
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,543
-Blunt, right?
-So close.

1265
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,444
I should have…

1266
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,313
I think this one will be easy.

1267
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,882
Shall we give Sook and Jin-kyung a chance?

1268
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,150
-Okay.
-Not Sae-ho.

1269
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,518
-I'll stay out.
-Okay.

1270
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,786
-The three of us.
-Yeah.

1271
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,122
-Okay. Take a break, Sae-ho.
-The three of us.

1272
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,824
We've been playing this whole time.

1273
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,128
-That's surprising.
-We've been doing our best.

1274
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,930
Will Woo-jae not play either?

1275
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,665
Then, who will they play against?

1276
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,833
Then, I should play too.

1277
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:56,867
-I have to play.
-Okay.

1278
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,035
FEELING VERY COMPETITIVE
SINCE HE'S GOOD AT IT

1279
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,436
Let's see what it is first.

1280
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,206
GUESS THE SUBWAY STATION BASED ON THIS

1281
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,109
SAE-HO FIGURED IT OUT AS SOON AS HE SAW IT

1282
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,310
Geez!

1283
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,746
IT'S MY FACE

1284
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,947
-I got it.
-I got it.

1285
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,148
Sookmyung.

1286
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,049
-Incorrect.
-No.

1287
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,984
-Sookmyung Women's University.
-Correct.

1288
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:16,787
Sookmyung Women's University.

1289
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,256
Sookmyung Women's University
Sookmyung Women's University

1290
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,992
-I got the university right.
-You did.

1291
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,061
BUT I GOT THE ANSWER RIGHT

1292
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,863
Sookmyung Women's University, right?

1293
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,564
-Yeah.
-It's Sookmyung Women's University.

1294
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,333
-So funny.
-Sookmyung Women's University subway exit.

1295
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,435
-What about just these two?
-Those two?

1296
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,070
-One-on-one?
-Just for fun.

1297
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,138
This one's just for fun.

1298
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,074
Hasn't my victory been secured anyway?

1299
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,910
Okay. I'll give you one
that suits the two of you.

1300
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,679
Want to bet 100,000 won on it?

1301
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,080
-Sure.
-Okay.

1302
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,182
You'd better pay up today.

1303
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,183
NODDING

1304
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,218
Why do you assume I'll lose?

1305
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,154
-Because I'll definitely win.
-All right.

1306
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,388
WHAT IS SPARROW'S ENGLISH NAME?

1307
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,456
This one's too easy.

1308
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,125
-This is easy.
-This one should come easily.

1309
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,960
Isn't it "birds"?

1310
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,796
THE ONE GIFTED IN NONSENSE QUIZZES
GETS IT TOO

1311
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,364
This one should be easy.

1312
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,598
I don't know it either.

1313
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:02,566
-Why?
-Can I tell him?

1314
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,734
Okay.

1315
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,470
WHAT IS SPARROW'S ENGLISH NAME?

1316
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,905
Geez. Seriously?

1317
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,773
Why? We guess things like this well.

1318
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,675
IT MUST BE EASIER THAN WE THINK

1319
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,711
-With my logic--
-I got it.

1320
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,712
Chirp, chirp.

1321
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,881
Is there an English name called "Chirp"?

1322
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,583
Do it in an English pronunciation.

1323
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,552
Woo-young, steal it from her.

1324
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:22,820
CHIRP? ENGLISH NAME?

1325
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,787
Jirp, jirp?

1326
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,522
Jack, jack?

1327
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,391
-Quack, quack?
-Quack, quack?

1328
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,425
Chip, chip.

1329
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,594
You just said it.

1330
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,829
-Quack, quack.
-Not that.

1331
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,664
-Jack, jack?
-Hurry up.

1332
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,432
-Jack, jack.
-Jack, jack.

1333
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,433
Jack. Jack!

1334
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,102
Jack. I got it. Jack.

1335
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,436
Jin-kyung, that's correct.

1336
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,005
I don't have money.

1337
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,342
PUT IT ON MY TAB

1338
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,611
Let me tell you the final result.

1339
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,848
The episode themed around Woo-jae,
the first star of Season Three

1340
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,617
of the Deconstruction Show,
has come to an end.

1341
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,053
You all had some strange experiences
and other things happen

1342
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,788
since this morning.

1343
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,490
I'd like to thank all five of you.

1344
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,192
Here is the final result.

1345
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,328
The total score that Woo-jae acquired

1346
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,929
is 15 points.

1347
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,631
-He won a lot.
-He got a lot of points.

1348
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:09,099
Less than I thought.

1349
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,267
He won 15 points.

1350
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,636
The total score that the rest of you got

1351
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,705
-is…
-17 points?

1352
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,406
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE

1353
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,374
13 points.

1354
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,445
-Woo-jae is the final winner.
-What the heck?

1355
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,748
-You're amazing.
-I don't feel like celebrating.

1356
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,951
I get that dopamine rush
when I beat someone worthy,

1357
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:31,221
-but this is--
-So Woo-jae is the final winner.

1358
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,290
We told you beforehand that there would be

1359
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,792
-a humiliating punishment.
-Yeah.

1360
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,126
That's right.

1361
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,427
The punishment is

1362
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:38,896
to obey.

1363
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,431
PUNISHMENT: OBEY

1364
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,802
-Obey Woo-jae?
-He'll be given four buttons here.

1365
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,171
When he presses one,
you'll hear a voice summoning

1366
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,472
-a certain member.
-Okay.

1367
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,241
That member must go before Woo-jae

1368
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,810
and do what he says.

1369
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,211
-Okay. I got it.
-Yeah.

1370
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,880
But they're like
my big brothers and sisters.

1371
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,215
How can I make them obey me?

1372
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,717
Are those the buttons?

1373
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,953
-Are they the buttons?
-The buttons are…

1374
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,954
Woo-young, come.

1375
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,255
Kim Sook, come.

1376
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,792
THE BUTTONS ARE PLACED UNDER HIS FEET

1377
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,428
What are you doing?

1378
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:12,830
Can't you hear this?

1379
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,633
If they're not going to comply,
I don't want to do the punishment.

1380
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,901
SHOULDN'T THEY ACCEPT THEIR DEFEAT?

1381
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,770
STANDING UP

1382
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,706
SAE-HO IS HERE, SIR

1383
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,774
Sae-ho, come.

1384
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,908
I'm here.

1385
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,443
Bark.

1386
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,213
LIKE THIS?

1387
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,215
You pass!

1388
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:32,616
Thank you.

1389
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,484
Kim Sook, come.

1390
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,086
NEXT UP, KIM SOOK, COME

1391
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,121
-Hello, sir.
-Call me "Oppa."

1392
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,623
Oppa.

1393
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,557
ACTING CUTE

1394
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,327
Oppa, can I get 1,500 won
to buy some soju?

1395
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,595
Go back.

1396
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,330
-Oppa.
-Stop!

1397
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,331
Stop. Go back.

1398
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,398
I REGRET MAKING HER DO THAT

1399
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,335
HE FEELS DISGUSTED IN AN INSTANT

1400
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,469
It was a punishment for me!

1401
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,971
-You want to get soju?
-Yeah, I do.

1402
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,373
Woo-young, come.

1403
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,775
Well, I should come
if my big brother asks me to come.

1404
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,811
-Give me a 50,000-won bill.
-50,000 won?

1405
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,546
Let's say I did.

1406
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,114
You can't do that.

1407
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,782
I don't have any right now.

1408
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,684
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT

1409
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,785
SUMMONING THE LAST PERSON

1410
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,187
Jin-kyung, come.

1411
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,556
Jin-kyung, come.

1412
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,590
HURRY UP ALREADY, JIN-KYUNG

1413
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,158
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

1414
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,660
Give Woo-young 50,000 won.

1415
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,429
CREATIVE ECONOMY BUILT ON OBEDIENCE

1416
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,330
Pay up.

1417
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,599
-Can you give me a 50,000-won bill?
-Jin-kyung, come.

1418
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,102
Here. 50,000 won. Satisfied?

1419
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,803
PAID HIM BY BORROWING MONEY
FROM SOMEONE UNRELATED TO THE SHOW

1420
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,339
-Sae-ho, come.
-Yes, sir.

1421
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,941
-Here's some allowance.
-Thank you!

1422
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,043
Thank you, sir.

1423
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,511
OBEDIENCE ISN'T SO BAD

1424
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,313
-Sae-ho, come.
-Yes, sir.

1425
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,715
-Take off what's on your left wrist.
-Pardon?

1426
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,150
Oh, this is…

1427
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,852
Obedience!

1428
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,086
-This is--
-Just take it off.

1429
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,988
My grandfather gave it to me though.

1430
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,123
Your grandfather?

1431
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,557
CONFISCATED

1432
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,861
When I gave him 50,000 won,
it was caught on camera, wasn't it?

1433
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,229
Our deal has been made.

1434
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,263
I'm sorry, sir.

1435
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,165
It's from his grandpa.

1436
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,167
It's all on camera. His payment.

1437
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,602
-All right.
-Yes?

1438
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,104
-Here you go.
-Your grandfather gave it to you?

1439
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,206
-Your grandpa?
-Yes.

1440
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,576
NOW, EVERYONE MUST COME

1441
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,412
What? All of us? Yes, sir.

1442
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,480
Give me that 50,000 won.

1443
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,584
To the person who treats me
with the utmost care

1444
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,320
will be given this as a gift.

1445
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,455
How ridiculous.

1446
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,756
THE MASTER ASKS THEM
TO DO RIDICULOUS THINGS

1447
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,460
I'm doing a deep bow.

1448
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:24,861
GIVE ME MY WATCH BACK

1449
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,363
Sae-ho, come.

1450
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,132
PAYING THEM BACK FOR WHAT THEY DID
DURING THE EXPERIMENT CAMERA

1451
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,100
Are you done?

1452
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,668
-Yes.
-Yes.

1453
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,669
-Sae-ho.
-Yes, sir.

1454
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:33,570
Thank you.

1455
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,905
Shall we end it here?

1456
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,340
Was that a good ending?

1457
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,274
No.

1458
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,976
Let's end it like this.

1459
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,410
-Here you go.
-Okay.

1460
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,445
Give me my 50,000 won.

1461
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,246
Can't we end it
with him lording it over us

1462
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,614
and not with him returning them?

1463
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,984
Woo-jae is trying to
create a heartwarming ending.

1464
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,686
-He's worried about his reputation.
-Yeah, he is.

1465
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,521
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

1466
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,593

1471
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,536
It's Businesswoman Hong Jin-kyung.

1472
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,805
THE STAR OF ALL OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS
BUSINESSWOMAN HONG JIN-KYUNG

1473
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,540
While presenting new business ideas…

1474
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:13,110
Urban guesthouses have gone up 57.5%.

1475
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,177
Would people like that?

1476
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,912
Would people want to see that?

1477
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,481
And how much will you charge them?

1478
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,648
-What?
-How much?

1479
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,951
The easy quiz show, Easy Quizzy.

1480
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,919
-Which one is not an idol group?
-Wait.

1481
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,221
Are you for real?

1482
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,555
There is a ZEROBASETWO.

1483
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,823
You mean, ZEROBASEONE.

1484
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,626
-I'd like to apologize instead of her.
-I'll pay one million won.

1485
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,861
Which one is Young K?

1486
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:31,862
How about 1.5 million?

1487
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,196
Money can't solve everything.

1488
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,098
I'll pay for your trip to Guam.

1489
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,299
Do you like palm trees?

1490
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,101
Why is everyone picking on me?

1491
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,469
I quit!

1492
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,838
He's being weird. I can't take it anymore.

1493
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:42,739
Am I…

1494
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,574
This is the easiest one.

1495
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,076
