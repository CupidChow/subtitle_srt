1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,168
This is an exclusive event

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,337
open to only the top elite
of the celestial world.

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,139
-I'm the Ice God.
-I'm the Hungry God.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,741
THESE RAGTAG GODS
MAKE YOU WONDER

5
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,576
HOW THEY MANAGED
TO SECURE AN INVITE

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,879
Good looks, physique, talent, charms,

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,280
-tact, and sense of humor.
-Hey, Jin!

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,816
This God of K-Pop has indeed everything.

9
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,284
Your show's the hottest.

10
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,486
Let me hear you scream!

11
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,957
You have a grand place.
If you sold it, I'd join you as a regular.

12
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,926
THE FIRST GAME,
"DON'T SAY," BEGINS

13
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,895
-Please tell me you like me.
-Woo-young.

14
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,530
Just kiss already.

15
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,566
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
THE HOTTEST SHOW NOW

16
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,068
BUT YOU'RE ALL SO WEIRD…

17
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,237
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY?

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,206
EVEN AS CHAOS REIGNS…

19
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,474
Here's my signature move.

20
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,611
…A TRUE GOD FINDS A WAY TO ADAPT

21
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,079
PERFECTLY IN SYNC

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,415
THE DOG-EAT-DOG GAME ENDS

23
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,884
WITH NO ONE GETTING FOOLED
DESPITE EVERYONE'S EFFORTS

24
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,553
WHAT GAMES ARE IN STORE
FOR THE GODS?

25
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,423
Don't you have a lot going on now?

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,424
-Me?
-Yes.

27
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,827
-For me, starting today…
-Oh, just now?

28
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,662
-Today's my first shoot.
-I see.

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,397
-For your new album?
-Yes.

30
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,033
While we're on the subject,

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,669
-he had other engagements today.
-Really?

32
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,705
-He worked things around just for us.
-I can't imagine how busy he must be.

33
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,873
How touching.

34
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,709
I should be thanking you
for accommodating to my schedule.

35
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,312
Let's do something for him.
Let's pool something up.

36
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,047
I'd appreciate hard cash.

37
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,715
-How about our sincere gratitude?
-No way.

38
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,984
-No gratitude and love?
-I only accept cash gifts.

39
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,720
If that's the case,
let's chip in 1.5 million won each.

40
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,189
What, 1.5 million?

41
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,723
How did you come up with that number?

42
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,825
Two million seemed too much.

43
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,660
-And one million seemed too small?
-Exactly.

44
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,529
Let's resume the shoot.
It'd be better that way.

45
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,600
How could you shoot my idea down
by saying we should resume the shoot?

46
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,502
Cameras are already on us, aren't they?

47
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,403
I apologize.

48
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,405
-Really, it was my bad.
-"It'd be better that way"?

49
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,006
My heartfelt apologies to you.

50
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,341
-He didn't mean it.
-No.

51
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,376
Do you see the disrespect
I have to put up with?

52
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,911
-But you earned a fortune.
-Before we…

53
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,981
I can't believe it.

54
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,249
What a strange remark.

55
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,118
What is your MBTI personality type, Jin?

56
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,185
It's INTP.

57
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,153
I knew it.

58
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,322
The TP guys are brilliant.

59
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,890
-Now, Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

60
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,892
While shooting today's intro,

61
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,695
Jin told us of his upcoming album
and its title song.

62
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,831
Could you introduce the song
for the viewers again?

63
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,566
-That's over the top.
-Seriously.

64
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,568
We've covered it countless times already.

65
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,636
What's the song's title?

66
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,973
That was close, Jin-kyung.

67
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,274
Isn't it "You Say Don't Love Me"?

68
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,709
-So close.
-It begins with "Don't."

69
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,777
-Yeah.
-Was it "Don't You Say Love Me"?

70
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,780
That was it exactly.

71
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,253
He's the most knowledgeable comedian
on BTS in the country.

72
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,689
-I knew I could count on you, Sae-ho.
-He was born on December 4th, 1992

73
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,926
in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi-do.
Let's give him a big hand!

74
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,494
What is this for anyway?

75
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,428
THE BIRTH OF A GOD?

76
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,697
Oh, my birth itself. Thank you.

77
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,467
For the first game of the day,
you played Don't Say Game.

78
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,336
Your second game of the day
is called You Love Me.

79
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,372
Let us begin.

80
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,909
You'll find six chairs in the back.

81
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,744
THEY WILL PLAY 2 GAMES
FILLED WITH LOVE

82
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,279
I love you.

83
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,880
FIRST GAME
"I LOVE YOU" GAME

84
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,615
Select one direction from either side

85
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,484
-and say, "I love you."
-I love you.

86
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,019
THE OTHER PERSON
CAN EITHER RECIPROCATE…

87
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,520
-I love you.
-I don't.

88
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,656
The others must not burst into laughter.

89
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,057
LAUGHTER, NO RESPONSE:
MINUS POINT

90
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,260
-Simply put, you must not laugh.
-Oh, I get it.

91
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,829
You lose a point when you laugh.

92
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,465
Same as earlier,
the person with the least point deductions

93
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,268
-will be given one of the merchandise.
-Okay, let's roll.

94
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,370
But one look is enough
to get anyone laughing.

95
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,271
This should be fun.

96
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,707
-I'm already desensitized.
-Guys next to Jin-kyung may have trouble.

97
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,409
-Shall we, then?
-Okay.

98
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,410
Please go take a seat.

99
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,711
Placement will play a huge role.

100
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,280
Sitting next to Jin-kyung or Sae-ho
will give you trouble.

101
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,882
A FEW FACES WILL GIVE THE CAST
A HARD TIME

102
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,617
THE GODS GATHER ONE BY ONE

103
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,152
Sae-ho should sit next to Jin.

104
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,955
CAPSAICIN GOD HAS JOINED
THE GAME

105
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,890
STARES AT SAE-HO

106
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,592
-Dang it.
-What's wrong?

107
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,860
-I feel like laughing just looking at you.
-You do?

108
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,598
-Stop making that ridiculous face.
-Hello, everyone.

109
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,033
You look hilarious yourself, Jin-kyung.

110
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,936
You just don't realize it
because you can't see yourself.

111
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,739
Please begin the game.

112
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,841
-Let's play the I Love You Game.
-Starting from you.

113
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,310
We'll take turns clockwise. Here we go.

114
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,179
-Will you be my bae?
-Will you be my bae?

115
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,947
-I Love You Game
-I Love You Game

116
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,917
MR. CHILI SAUCE WILL KICK US OFF

117
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,886
CAPSAICIN GOD'S
GENTLE LEAN TO THE SIDE

118
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,691
I love you.

119
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,327
IN A GREASY TONE

120
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,431
Sook.

121
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,799
I love you.

122
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,901
This is scary.

123
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,939
-I love you.
-Heck no!

124
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,043
SHE COULDN'T HOLD IT IN

125
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,114
POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER

126
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,849
A DIRECT HIT TO THE FACE

127
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,384
UNBELIEVABLE

128
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,853
You guys laughed, but I didn't.

129
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,155
-Didn't Sook laugh quite loudly?
-But I didn't.

130
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,189
He cracked up too.

131
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,325
Jin-kyung, Sook, and Sae-ho. Own it.

132
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,027
-I'll own that.
-Me too.

133
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,662
-What about you?
-I'll own that too.

134
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,464
-So the penalty isn't for just one person?
-If you laugh…

135
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,800
-You lose a point.
-There's no break. Laugh, and that's it.

136
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,835
-Isn't this how it works?
-Let's start again from Sook.

137
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,275
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game

138
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,312
A DIRECT ADVANCE

139
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,782
ENCHANTING GOOD LOOKS

140
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,383
I love you.

141
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,318
WITH A DIRECT GAZE

142
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,620
HE WOULD'VE HEARD THAT
OVER MILLIONS OF TIMES

143
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,721
MOVES ON CASUALLY

144
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,694
I DARE YOU NOT TO LAUGH
AT THIS FACE

145
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,762
ON THE LINE

146
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,998
JUST ABOUT TO SNORT OUT A LAUGH

147
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,336
I love you.

148
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,474
KIM SEOK-JIN…

149
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,409
TOLD ME THAT HE LOVED ME…

150
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,212
-I love you too.
-The other direction.

151
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,447
I love you too.

152
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,681
RANDOM DECLARATION OF LOVE

153
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,283
Say that to the person on your other side.

154
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,217
DON'T GO FANGIRLING

155
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,353
TURNS TO WOO-JAE

156
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,587
Don't just do as you please.

157
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,089
DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT MOOD
SETS IN

158
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,757
Was that a laugh?

159
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,593
CONCENTRATE ON SAD THOUGHTS

160
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,895
GIVES UP HER SIGHT

161
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,963
Wasn't that a laugh?

162
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,864
BARELY REINS IT IN

163
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,998
I love you.

164
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,335
ALL RIGHT,
I'M OKAY WITH THAT FOR NOW

165
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,572
DEEP GAZE INTO SAE-HO'S EYES

166
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,274
WOO-JAE'S CAREFUL APPROACH

167
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,175
HIS AFFECTION…

168
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,378
OR AFFECTIONATE TOUCHES
ARE NOT REJECTED

169
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,114
OH, DEAR

170
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:23,983
I love you.

171
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,318
WHILE STROKING HIS CHEEKS

172
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,487
SATISFIED

173
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,822
UNSETTLED

174
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,291
HIS EYES START WANDERING
IN A PANIC

175
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,894
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM
CLOSES IN A FLASH

176
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,697
LOOK AT THIS ANNOYING POSE

177
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,599
THEY ALL TURN THE OTHER WAY

178
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,668
EYES LOCKED, THINGS GET HEATED

179
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,103
I love you.

180
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,004
ALMOST A WHISPER

181
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,408
THEIR FOREHEADS ALMOST TOUCH

182
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,210
GIVES UP WATCHING

183
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,679
-Closing your eyes is cheating, Jin.
-I love you.

184
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,881
YOU HAVE TO ENDURE IT

185
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,183
KING OF THE UNDERWORLD
GETS HIS SHOT

186
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,752
ONCE AGAIN,
THEY LEAN CLOSE TO EACH OTHER

187
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,423
DON'T MAKE IT
UNNECESSARILY STEAMY

188
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,958
I…

189
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:06,993
love…

190
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,062
you.

191
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,099
INTENSE LONGING

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,502
WHY WON'T YOU JUST KISS ALREADY?

193
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,138
BARELY LOOKS AWAY

194
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,107
TO GAZE AT HIS PREVIOUS CRUSH

195
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,076
THEY MUST HAVE
A SAD HISTORY BETWEEN THEM

196
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,980
-I--
-Forget it, you chili-sauce bastard.

197
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,916
Forget it, you chili-sauce bastard.

198
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,884
YOU SAW HIM LAUGHING, RIGHT?

199
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,686
-1 POINT FOR CAPSAICIN GOD

200
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,522
ONE MAN-GOD APPROACHES
THE HUNGRY GOD TO WIN HER OVER

201
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,425
A MELLOW GAZE

202
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,428
THE WOO-YOUNG
LOOKS AT HER INTENTLY

203
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,230
I love you!

204
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,667
REIN IT IN, YOU'VE GOT THIS

205
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,902
NOT ME

206
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,171
SHE LAUGHED

207
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,910
Laughter bubbles up
when I just look at her. I'm toast.

208
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,912
-1 POINT FOR GRASSHOPPER,
THE GOD OF TV SHOWS

209
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,215
Okay, let's play again.

210
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,152
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game

211
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,121
JIN GOES FIRST THIS TIME

212
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,833
ENJOYING THE CLOSE-UP VIEW

213
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,703
THE CURIOUS VIBE
TENSES UP THE OTHERS

214
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,606
GOSH, WHAT'S WITH
THIS WARM GAZE?

215
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,042
JEEZ, WHAT'S WITH
THIS LEERING GAZE?

216
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,080
He loses a point.

217
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,148
ON THE LINE

218
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,651
-But not the others.
-Look at Jin-kyung.

219
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,919
Your makeup…

220
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,621
-See?
-These two lose a point each.

221
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,458
I can't believe it's taking me so long
to get accustomed to your whole look.

222
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,392
Please start the count.

223
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,326
JIN'S TURN AGAIN

224
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,227
Ready, go.

225
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,898
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game

226
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,969
GRASSHOPPER'S DARING ADVANCE

227
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,939
I love you.

228
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,174
IN A SHAKY VOICE

229
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,175
I love you.

230
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,444
DOES HIS BEST
TO AVOID LOOKING AT HER

231
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,914
THOUGH HE AVERTED HER GAZE,

232
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,650
THE DELUDED GRASSHOPPER
DRAWS NEAR AS IF ENTRANCED

233
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,019
That might get his legal team involved.

234
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,887
My agency does have a legal team.

235
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,356
-Isn't that a laugh?
-Just now?

236
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,958
CRESTFALLEN

237
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,762
SHE WILL HAVE TO DIRECT HER
ROMANTIC FEELINGS TOWARD WOO-JAE

238
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,998
A RANDOM SLAP

239
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,734
NARROWLY AVERTS CRISIS

240
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,938
DESPERATELY LOOKING AWAY

241
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,073
WHY DOES MY CHEEK STING
WHEN WE'RE ONLY PROFESSING LOVE?

242
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,643
LOOK AT ME

243
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,848
OVERLY ENGROSSED

244
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,618
LET ME GRAB SOME POPCORN

245
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,522
I love you.

246
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,490
BLURTS IT OUT
AS IF OVERCOME BY EMOTION

247
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,460
BUT THE INDIFFERENT
MALE PROTAGONIST LOOKS AWAY

248
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,130
WHILE THE GRASSHOPPER
STILL GAZES AT HIM LONGINGLY

249
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,800
THIS GUY IS MAKING HIMSELF
PRESENTABLE FOR HIS BIG MOMENT

250
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,002
A PINCH

251
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,637
AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK
ON HIS NIPPLE

252
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,505
-He laughed.
-Sae-ho.

253
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,607
He did.

254
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,641
DING-DONG

255
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,976
WE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT'D MAKE YOU LAUGH

256
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,611
Sae-ho.

257
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,213
ROUND 6
ONCE AGAIN, JIN GOES FIRST

258
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,951
Ha! Love-love beam!

259
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,421
Love-love beam!

260
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,725
I think she's loving it.

261
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,227
-Look, she's smiling.
-Yes, that should count as a violation.

262
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,795
Don't take it earnestly, okay?

263
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,164
-She looks so happy.
-It's just a game.

264
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,333
Please don't take it the wrong way.

265
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,401
GRASSHOPPER WANTS TO BADLY

266
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,238
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game
-Will you be my bae? I Love You Game

267
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,777
WE MUST TEST OUR RESILIENCE
TO CRINGEY MOMENTS AGAIN

268
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,514
SHUTS HIS EYES TIGHT

269
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,216
WHY IS HE DOING THAT
WITH HIS LIPS?

270
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,353
It's been a while.

271
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,422
How have you been?

272
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,891
How have you been?

273
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,860
FEELING DAZED

274
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,796
HOT-J AND GIL-SOOK ARE
REUNITED AT LAST

275
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,864
Sook.

276
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,603
I love you.

277
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,374
THE MELODRAMATIC TONE IS
TOO MUCH TO BEAR

278
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,209
Okay.

279
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,444
BUT GIL-SOOK ABANDONS HIM

280
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,013
IN HOPES OF FINDING NEW LOVE

281
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,481
GAZES AT HIM FIXEDLY

282
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,449
He's about to lose it.

283
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,284
HE IS INDEED IN DANGER
OF DOING THAT

284
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,186
I wove you.

285
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,055
BARELY SMOTHERING A LAUGHTER

286
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,126
I will wove you forever.

287
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,329
CRACKS UP IN THE END

288
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,199
What's up with him?

289
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,134
LOL

290
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,103
CAN'T HOLD HIS HEAD UP

291
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,639
-1 POINT FOR SOOK,
JIN-KYUNG, AND WOO-YOUNG

292
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,076
THE GAME ENDS
WITH A LOUVRE-WORTHY CLIP

293
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,378
-Let's move on to the I Like You Game.
-Okay.

294
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,312
Here's the rundown.

295
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,882
-Let's play I Like You with Jin
-Let's play I Like You with Jin

296
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,284
TELL ONE PERSON YOU LIKE THEM

297
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,885
THEY CAN SAY THEY LIKE YOU BACK…

298
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,020
I like you, Sook.

299
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,455
…OR REJECT YOU

300
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,923
I like you, Jin-kyung.

301
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,092
-How much?
-This much.

302
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,994
ALTERNATIVELY, THEY DEMAND
THAT YOU PROVE YOUR DEVOTION

303
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,665
IF YOU MISS A BEAT OR FAIL
TO ANSWER, YOU LOSE A POINT

304
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,334
You should know that Jin-kyung…

305
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,269
-can't keep up.
-Hey.

306
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,671
Are you for real?

307
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,606
And what if I do well?

308
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,742
-I'm only stating a fact.
-Ten slaps to your face?

309
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,176
-I'll take them.
-Really?

310
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,078
-I'll do it like this.
-Go ahead.

311
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,880
Here's my condition. If you fail,

312
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,448
-I'll give you ten slaps.
-Okay.

313
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,317
-Okay, then.
-I'll wear my gloves.

314
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,585
-You do the same.
-Let's do a drill.

315
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,787
It feels worse
to be slapped by bare hands.

316
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,155
-Can I wear these?
-Okay.

317
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,823
I'll slap you ten times wearing these.

318
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,425
-There's no way you can.
-Be wistful.

319
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,427
You little brat.

320
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,097
-I'm going to give you ten slaps.
-I'll keep naming you.

321
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,565
Why don't we have Jin kick us off?

322
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,068
-Okay, you can go first.
-Ready, go.

323
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,171
-Let's play I Like You with Jin
-Let's play I Like You with Jin

324
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,873
I like you, Sook.

325
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,940
Get lost!

326
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,375
I like you, Sae-ho.

327
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,476
Elaborate.

328
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,511
I like you this much.

329
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,779
Can you dance as you answer?

330
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,680
-I like you this much.
-Dang, he's good.

331
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,581
I like you too.

332
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,949
I like you, Jin-kyung.

333
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,484
How much?

334
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,886
This much.

335
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,120
Get lost.

336
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,758
See? I got him.

337
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,794
You're good, Jin-kyung.

338
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,328
STILL IN SHOCK

339
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,898
-Wait, Woo-jae should get his ten slaps.
-Right, come here.

340
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,432
-No way!
-What do you even mean?

341
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,901
-She's right.
-I didn't mess up yet.

342
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,203
-Yeah, I'm right.
-I should fail first…

343
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,771
GET IN HERE

344
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,239
I should fail first…

345
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,141
SHE'S KNEADING
THIS DOUGH OF A FACE

346
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,044
She gets to slap him
if she wins over anyone?

347
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,512
I mean… My gosh, Jin-kyung.

348
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,581
-What happened?
-I should fail first!

349
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,283
And what if I do well?

350
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,418
HE DID AGREE TO GET SLAPPED
IF JIN-KYUNG DID WELL

351
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,054
-All right.
-Okay. Let's resume the game.

352
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,023
-"Get lost!"
-To be honest,

353
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,025
I didn't think she'd slap me for real.

354
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,928
We've spent all these years together
as close friends.

355
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,996
I think she did that for that very reason.

356
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,432
She just wanted to hit him?
Is that your real hair, Jin-kyung?

357
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,470
-"Get lost!"
-It can't be real, can it, Jin?

358
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,539
-It looks pretty real.
-It does look that way.

359
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,641
-That style suits her.
-It'd be cool if her hair grew.

360
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,876
-Let's resume playing.
-Okay.

361
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,877
Ready, go.

362
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,813
-Let's play I Like You with Jin
-Let's play I Like You with Jin

363
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,048
I like you, Woo-jae.

364
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,382
How much?

365
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,650
This much.

366
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,885
Dance as you answer.

367
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,420
I like you this much.

368
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,855
Get lost!

369
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,889
I like you, Sook.

370
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,023
Get lost!

371
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,458
I like you, Jin.

372
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,993
Get lost!

373
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,429
-I like you, Woo-young.
-Beat it, dude!

374
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,430
I like you, Jin-kyung.

375
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,764
Tell me how much sensually.

376
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,600
I like you this much.

377
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,068
I like you too.

378
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,135
I like you, Jin.

379
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,338
-I like you, Sook.
-What was that?

380
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,006
Who messed up here?

381
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,542
-It was Jin.
-I should've said I liked her back.

382
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,943
This is fun.

383
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,212
Darn it. I wanted to get that towel set.

384
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,780
-You're a master player, Jin-kyung.
-Totally.

385
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,650
-She didn't do well in Lung King Heen.
-Oh, right.

386
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,718
What was that?

387
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,753
Can you try "Lung King Heen three"?

388
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,421
-Sure.
-Ready, go.

389
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,290
Lung King Heen three.

390
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,392
-Lung Kinnie…
-She's still not good at it.

391
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,029
-She hasn't mastered it.
-So she's just good at this one.

392
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,932
-All right, let's have Jin go first.
-Jin can go first.

393
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,768
-Let's play I Like You with Jin
-Let's play I Like You with Jin

394
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,103
I like you, Jin-kyung.

395
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,437
I like you, Jin.

396
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,273
-Come on.
-You should've said you liked him back.

397
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,207
Give me a do-over.

398
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,209
Hey, wait. I want a do-over.

399
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,710
Fine, wear these at least.

400
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,014
-Okay, I won't slap you.
-What was that with the gloves?

401
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,583
THIN-LAYERED GLOVES
WERE THRUST INTO HIS HANDS

402
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,919
She thought I would slap her for real.

403
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,422
-I didn't think she'd accept a beating.
-So she pushed her gloves into my hands.

404
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,893
I thought it'd be better
to have him wear these than nothing.

405
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,662
What a fine human touch.

406
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,064
-It's weird that you thought he'd hit you.
-Yeah, he'd never.

407
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,198
What a friend she is.

408
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,833
-She can go first this time.
-Okay, let's go.

409
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,603
-Let's play I Like You with Jin
-Let's play I Like You with Jin

410
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,771
I like you, Jin.

411
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,072
How much?

412
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,707
This much.

413
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,942
Repeat that as you leave.

414
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,376
Repeat that as you leave.

415
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,477
As I leave?

416
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,612
As I leave?

417
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,081
-Good. Keep it going.
-This much.

418
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,317
-Keep it going!
-This much.

419
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,319
-You have to leave the circle.
-I'll get going.

420
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,553
This much.

421
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,854
I like you too.

422
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,056
I like you, Sook.

423
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,692
-Tell me how much as you dance.
-This much.

424
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,361
-Tell me how much as you sing.
-I like you this much

425
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,362
With a cutesy act?

426
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,730
I like you so much!

427
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,698
With a sexy dance?

428
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,032
Gosh, I like you.

429
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,734
Gosh, I like you.

430
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,769
I like you too.

431
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,071
I like you, Woo-jae.

432
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,907
-Tell me how much with your back to me.
-This much.

433
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,408
Try again as you leave.

434
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,843
This much.

435
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,945
-As you run.
-This much!

436
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,413
While doing laps on the lawn.

437
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,982
This much!

438
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,083
As you roll.

439
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,051
This much!

440
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,054
-As you roll backward.
-Damn it.

441
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,389
NO HESITATION

442
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,290
This much!

443
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,092
As you return to your seat.

444
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,493
This much!

445
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,561
Get lost.

446
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,765
I… like you, Jin-kyung.

447
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,600
YES, I GOT HER

448
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,269
-How dare you, you punk!
-You're so cruel.

449
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,772
I can't believe you accomplished the roll.

450
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,774
-This game is pretty fun.
-It's nice.

451
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,242
I feel so anxious right now.

452
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,677
You broke my heart.

453
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,978
LOVE,
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HURT

454
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,113
-Hey, Sook.
-Goodness.

455
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,415
It seems this game
has a new set of rules now.

456
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,683
Stay on your toes, everyone.

457
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,685
-You never know what you'd have to do.
-How nerve-racking.

458
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,188
WHICH GOD WILL HAVE THE FINAL
LAUGH IN THIS DISTORTED GAME?

459
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,124
-Let's pick up some speed.
-Okay!

460
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,327
-Let's play I Like You with Jin
-Let's play I Like You with Jin

461
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,661
I like you, Sae-ho.

462
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,629
How much?

463
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,697
This much.

464
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,765
Louder.

465
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,966
NOTICEABLY INCREASED PACE

466
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,134
Louder.

467
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,535
This much!

468
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,703
On your feet.

469
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,904
This much!

470
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,372
On the chair.

471
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,807
This much.

472
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,841
Louder!

473
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,009
This much!

474
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,844
Get lost!

475
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,347
I like you, Sook.

476
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,915
LOL

477
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,683
THAT CRACKED EVERYONE UP

478
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,118
Tell me how much sitting down.

479
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,020
-This much.
-Louder.

480
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,221
This much.

481
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,656
Get lost.

482
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,324
I like you, Jin.

483
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,959
How much?

484
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,294
How much?

485
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,829
WELCOME TO "HOW MUCH" PRISON

486
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,731
CRYING

487
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,066
-Louder.
-Am I the target now?

488
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,400
This much.

489
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,735
Louder!

490
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,370
This much!

491
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,471
On the chair.

492
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,006
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME ALREADY

493
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,007
You're doing great.

494
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,975
-I think I'm going to lose it.
-This much.

495
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,410
Louder!

496
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,179
This much!

497
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,613
Even louder!

498
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,315
THE GRASSHOPPER FLIES

499
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,283
Get lost!

500
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,184
TEARS

501
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,019
LOL

502
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,621
I like you, Woo-young.

503
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,856
I like you too.

504
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,224
I like you, Jin-kyung.

505
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,093
Get lost.

506
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,260
I like you too.

507
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,795
COME AGAIN?

508
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,896
That doesn't work.

509
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,064
SHE TOLD YOU TO GET LOST

510
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,966
You can't say that after "Get lost."

511
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,937
Let's wrap the game up here.

512
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,606
-We'll tally the points here.
-That was hilarious.

513
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:28,874
I laughed so hard.

514
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,177
PLEASE ENJOY THIS CLIP
AS WE TALLY THE POINTS

515
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,080
-The winner gets Netflix merchandise.
-I want one so badly.

516
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,615
I feel the same here.

517
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,318
I'll announce first place
and last place only.

518
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,987
-Let me announce the winner first.
-The one who laughed least.

519
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,057
This god laughed the least
and maintained their composure best.

520
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,592
I think that could be Jin.

521
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,793
Or Sae-ho.

522
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,394
-I barely laughed.
-He did pretty well.

523
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,064
Introducing the winner…

524
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,699
Congratulations,

525
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,901
Jin.

526
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,102
-See?
-Oh, really?

527
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,237
Thank you, everyone.

528
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,539
He has a knack for holding back laughter.

529
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,908
Did an ARMY member tally the points again?

530
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,910
Oh, no. Another crew member handled it.

531
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,346
There are shy ARMY members like myself.

532
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,149
What I mean by that
is that we keep it low-key.

533
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,651
Are you perhaps objecting to Jin winning?

534
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,454
-It does look that way.
-I won't take the prize, then.

535
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,190
How could he take one
if you keep questioning the results?

536
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,993
CRITICISM COMES FLOODING IN
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS

537
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,327
That will give me peace of mind.

538
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,396
THANKS FOR THE FUN RIDE SO FAR,
WOO-JAE

539
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,099
Sook, I feel like throwing up.
Can you rap my back?

540
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,668
-That's enough, Woo-jae.
-We'll let it slide if you throw up.

541
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,136
I'll take this one.

542
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,405
-The towel set, please.
-Oh, the towel set.

543
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,374
WINS THE TOWEL SET
HE'S HAD HIS EYE ON

544
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,644
Thank you so much.
Are you sure I can keep this?

545
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,612
-Really? Thank you.
-I love the colors.

546
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,616
Let's turn to the loser.
They'll get a finger flick.

547
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,784
Congrats, Jin-kyung.

548
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,486
-Congratulations, Jin-kyung.
-Me?

549
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,021
-I got it right?
-Yes.

550
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,856
Jin-kyung, please step forward

551
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,224
and sit on the lawn.

552
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,659
Who gives her the finger flick?

553
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,227
Woo-jae would be her best choice.

554
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,397
Jin took over the challenge
of the finger flick earlier.

555
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,099
-Let's ask Woo-jae to handle it.
-No, I don't want that.

556
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,035
-I could never.
-I don't want it to be him.

557
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,603
Seriously, I couldn't hurt her.

558
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,439
-It sure looks powerful.
-That'd pack a punch.

559
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,408
He has such long fingers.

560
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,109
Don't take it personally.

561
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,412
-That's bound to hurt.
-It's just a variety show.

562
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,648
I have faith in Woo-jae.
He may put up an act, but he's a softie.

563
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,550
-No, he isn't.
-He won't go all-in.

564
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,018
HE'S ACTUALLY A BIG SOFTIE

565
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,221
Okay, I won't slap you.
I have so much respect for you.

566
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,288
He's a good kid.

567
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,357
-I am, aren't I?
-You're really nice.

568
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:30,062
I would like to hear Jin's observation
about the current trend in variety shows.

569
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:34,499
I favor variety shows
where the cast is challenged physically.

570
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,036
That's the rule
that runs my show, Run Jin.

571
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,405
-You went all in with all your heart?
-He may say that now…

572
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,242
-We need authenticity.
-…but Jin is also kind.

573
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,177
GET IN HERE

574
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,178
HEH

575
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,513
-My gosh!
-He's all talk.

576
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,350
I thought he was going to shoot a gun,
judging by his pose.

577
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,852
You'll see what a gentle soul he is.

578
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,454
I guarantee you'll tear up.

579
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,423
It chokes me up
to think of his tender heart.

580
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,993
Okay. I'll keep smiling.

581
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,328
-I feel bad already.
-Three, two, one--

582
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,901
-I heard a snap.
-It was a crack. A thunderous one.

583
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,337
IT SOUNDED
LIKE SOMETHING POPPED…

584
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,338
TEARS

585
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,841
I got the green face paint
all over my finger.

586
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,542
It really got on your finger.

587
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,312
-Let me wipe it on your costume.
-Are you okay?

588
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,213
Did it hurt badly?

589
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,849
-Are you okay, Jin-kyung?
-I barely put any force.

590
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,917
She's bleeding green blood.

591
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,586
That took away all your makeup here.

592
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,487
Whatever.

593
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,389
-Let's roll.
-With what?

594
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,459
DANG IT

595
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,596
LOOK BACK ON WHAT YOU DID
AND CALL IT EVEN

596
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,499
-It's time for lunch!
-All right!

597
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,601
Let's get that lunch. I'm starving.

598
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,637
Please do the clapper for us,
God of TV Shows.

599
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,172
Didn't the finger flick count as one?

600
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,141
-Three, two…
-It was that loud.

601
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,475
I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM

602
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,277
Three, two, one.

603
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,247
AFTER COUNTLESS
DECLARATIONS OF LOVE

604
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,816
They changed the banner to say
"Along with Jin."

605
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,452
ALONG WITH JIN

606
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,255
You've got a fiery new hairstyle.

607
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,023
Yeah, I got so mad.

608
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,858
-You do look super mad.
-I really am.

609
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,493
TWO GAMES MADE
THE SCOVILLE SCALE GO UP

610
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,263
I'm truly sorry, Jin-kyung.

611
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,466
-Don't be. What's up with him?
-Yeah, don't be like that.

612
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,437
-I hit her so hard that my finger aches.
-Don't insult her with an apology.

613
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,238
She's the God of TV Shows.

614
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,306
A FINGER FLICK IS NOTHING

615
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,909
Let's take a selfie together,
the four of us.

616
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,777
-Can I join as well?
-Of course.

617
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,778
OF COURSE
WE'RE ALONG WITH JIN

618
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,780
Let's take it before Woo-young comes back.

619
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,783
I'M ALREADY HERE

620
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,954
THE COSTUMES MAKE IT HARD
TO GUESS WHY THEY'RE TOGETHER

621
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,490
-All right. We've updated the banner.
-Where is it?

622
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,958
"Along with Jin."

623
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,160
The banner in the front says
"Along with Jin."

624
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,162
Thank you for this.

625
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,665
Still, "the God" and "Jin"
are synonymous, no?

626
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,035
Is it not the case? I can't be sure.

627
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,003
GOODNESS

628
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,174
Thanks, Woo-jae. My fellow soldiers
did call me "the God" in the military.

629
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,509
You didn't have to chime in there.

630
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,277
-Did you have to do that?
-That was my nickname.

631
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,846
THE REGULAR OUTMATCHED
IN CHEEKINESS

632
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:01,913
BY THE WORLD-CLASS GUEST

633
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,584
We have heard
that you're an exceptional cook, Jin.

634
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,519
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

635
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,955
I can feed myself a decent meal.
That's about it.

636
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,924
What are the dishes you can prepare?

637
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,092
-Can you give us examples?
-Me?

638
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,995
I had some noodles yesterday.

639
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,865
-Which one? Banquet noodles?
-Yes, the banquet noodles.

640
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,300
What was the happy occasion
for the banquet noodles?

641
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,235
Oh, right.

642
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,170
THERE HE GOES AGAIN

643
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,338
I had today's shoot…

644
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,607
-Oh, that got you excited.
-…to look forward to.

645
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,674
I APPROVE

646
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,510
That's why I had the banquet noodles.

647
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,612
Gosh, thank you for such flattering words.

648
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,314
-We need someone at the grill.
-Are you good with the grill?

649
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,482
I'd like to volunteer.

650
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,284
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT

651
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,019
It won't do to make our guest work.

652
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,488
Also, our guy at the grill is Sae-ho.

653
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,525
Me? Is that right?
It's my first time hearing it.

654
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,794
-That must be why you re-styled your hair.
-Really?

655
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,663
-I'll grill amazing barbecue today.
-Coming to you straight from his hair.

656
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,432
So you're grilling the meat
over your head?

657
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,233
Okay, then. I'll give grilling a go.

658
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,369
OUTDOOR BARBECUE PARTY
WITH CAPSAICIN GOD

659
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,970
Can we get a few more tongs?

660
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,439
Here's one. Let me handle it.

661
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,174
Do you favor pork belly or pork shoulder?

662
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,309
-I prefer pork belly.
-Really?

663
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,977
The fire is burning too hot.

664
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,046
WHAT'S WITH THE SMOKE?

665
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,781
The meat is getting burnt.

666
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,683
We've got magma here.

667
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,552
The meat is getting badly charred.

668
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,054
-They added too many coals.
-Yeah. Dang, it's so hot.

669
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,191
Isn't the smoke
almost blurring Sae-ho out?

670
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,092
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO WARRANT THAT

671
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,194
Can you see his face?

672
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,130
Look. Just look at it.
The meat here is getting burnt.

673
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,199
DID I PICK THE WRONG GUY
TO MAN THE GRILL?

674
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,868
I PROMISED THEM AMAZING BARBECUE

675
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,404
BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN DELIVER

676
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,606
I'll take care of it. I'm the expert.

677
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,775
-The fire is burning way too hot.
-Don't worry.

678
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,444
-I forgot we had the master chef with us.
-All right.

679
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,247
Look. We'll cook the meat
with the heat on the edges.

680
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,417
-Gosh, these look like steaks.
-I'm getting super excited.

681
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,552
You can only enjoy this outdoors.

682
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,921
You can go take a rest.
I'll take it from here.

683
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,757
Don't try to piggyback on my efforts.

684
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,794
-Can I piggyback on your efforts?
-Of course.

685
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,029
-Wear these gloves for protection.
-Oh, wait.

686
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,397
But he's our guest today.

687
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,400
He may be our guest,
but he's entitled to want to try it.

688
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,301
-Good?
-Okay.

689
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,203
Watch out for the smoke. Come this way.

690
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,074
Move out, Sae-ho.
The smoke doesn't seem to go over there.

691
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,476
What does she even mean?
The smoke and what?

692
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,713
And what if the smoke didn't come my way?
I don't get what she's objecting to.

693
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,449
Oh, no. Come this way.

694
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,986
-Did you have a picnic with your team?
-Yes.

695
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,522
But I can't recall
if we grilled outdoors together.

696
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,390
When was the last time
I had an outdoor barbecue?

697
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,925
Were my members with me?

698
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,027
I do think I tried it once at least.

699
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,096
At any rate, I'm so happy right now.

700
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,566
The smoky scent enhances the flavor.

701
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,268
It looks great.

702
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,904
NOM

703
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,807
-It's good. So good.
-Really?

704
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,809
-The meat itself was very fresh.
-It's so good.

705
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,279
IS IT REALLY THAT GREAT?

706
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,613
It's amazing.

707
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,115
Coming on strong, isn't it?

708
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,851
I almost thought that the camera
moved in to get a piece.

709
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,620
Isn't it amazing?

710
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,622
MAGMA-LIKE HEAT GAVE THEM
GOLDEN-BROWN MEAT

711
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,924
Gosh, it's good.

712
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,493
This is a feast of gods,

713
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,995
-so let's make it festive.
-How about grape juice instead of wine?

714
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,032
A tight shot of Jin
pouring the juice, please.

715
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,368
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

716
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,737
Gosh, this is nice.

717
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,339
PHOTO TO KEEP
AS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM

718
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,575
-Why don't I pour you one too?
-Goodness, thanks.

719
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,610
-I hear you hold a wine bottle like this.
-Goodness.

720
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,546
2ND-GEN AND 3RD-GEN
IDOLS TOGETHER

721
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,881
Thank you.

722
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:24,916
What is it?

723
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,651
ARE YOU ALL WATCHING THIS?

724
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,919
THANK YOU

725
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,187
YOU FILMING THIS?

726
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,290
THERE, SATISFIED?

727
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,825
IT'S SO STRANGE
HOW I CAN'T HELP BUT SMILE

728
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,093
That's enough. Thanks.

729
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,528
Shall we have a toast?

730
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,063
-Sure!
-Jin can say a few words.

731
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,198
OKAY, EVERYONE RAISE
YOUR GLASSES

732
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,833
You have an album coming up, Jin.

733
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,368
Right, its title is Echo.

734
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,004
-I hope it makes it big.
-To Echo.

735
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,140
I also hope that Screwballs
will carry on forever

736
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,343
-and bring all of you huge profit.
-Goodness.

737
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,044
-How kind you are.
-That's a nice one.

738
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,846
Here's to the success
of Echo and Screwballs!

739
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,082
-To Echo and Screwballs!
-To Echo and Screwballs!

740
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,316
We've got this!

741
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,253
A SIP OF GRAPE JUICE
AFTER A FABULOUS TOAST

742
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,521
Gosh, that's good.

743
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,424
-Gosh, how is it so good?
-It's incredible.

744
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,328
-Thanks for the food.
-Let's enjoy it.

745
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,131
It depends on the cut.
When you eat pork neck slices…

746
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,199
APPRECIATIVE MOAN

747
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,702
-I often have pork belly.
-Oh, you do?

748
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,538
-It feels amazing to be out here.
-Really?

749
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,974
It uplifts my mood
to see you enjoy it so much.

750
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,883
"TO REACH THE PORK BELLY"
THE TRENDING YOUTUBER'S BITE!

751
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,685
I only eat my fill once a month.

752
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,720
JANUARY, FEBRUARY
MARCH, APRIL

753
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,122
I feel at home when I shoot this show,

754
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,990
I eat my fill once a month,
and that's today.

755
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,026
Oh, so it's your cheat day, so to speak.

756
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,994
He always ends up with an upset stomach.

757
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,331
The weather is so wonderful.

758
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,367
I've always wanted to have a picnic
on a day like this. My dream came true.

759
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,269
-It won't be easy for you to have one.
-Exactly.

760
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,671
I love it here.

761
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,374
Join us again when you have free time.

762
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,611
I'll make sure to free up some time
and join you again.

763
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,413
As long as I'll be welcomed here…

764
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,081
-Of course.
-That goes without saying.

765
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,751
BTS' achievement cannot be easily matched.

766
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,121
-"Dynamite" topped the Billboard's chart.
-We were very lucky.

767
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,290
Here's the thing with "Dynamite."

768
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,193
It was never the song
that the members favored.

769
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,931
We had a scheduled tour,
but it got canceled due to the pandemic.

770
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,301
We couldn't just idle,
so our agency prepared three demos for us.

771
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,503
"Dynamite" was the first one we heard.

772
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,340
We asked for alternatives,
but we liked the other two less.

773
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,010
We weren't exactly thrilled about it.

774
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,578
But you thought
it'd be better than nothing.

775
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,580
Exactly. So we went ahead and recorded it.

776
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,550
-And that made it big.
-It struck gold.

777
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,785
I guess some other gods looked out for us.

778
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,754
-That could be it.
-That's what I came to think.

779
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,191
Singers these days promote their new album

780
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,426
-two to three weeks.
-That's right.

781
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,196
-This guy promotes one for two years.
-My team is doing that.

782
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,664
So you must've released one recently.

783
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,100
Yes. I did release one recently.

784
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,770
I watched your YouTube videos.
You even received singing lessons.

785
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,872
-A vocal coach has been tutoring me.
-Really?

786
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,576
I'm sure you've come a long way.
Why don't you sing "Don't Say Goodbye"?

787
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,344
How could I do that before the world star?

788
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,046
You released an album, so we're peers.

789
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,447
Go sing behind him.

790
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,648
THAT MIGHT WORK

791
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:11,683
If facing him is too much.

792
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,019
-I can't believe it
-That'll solve your problem.

793
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,189
HERE'S THE CAPSAICIN GOD
SINGING "DON'T SAY GOODBYE"

794
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,227
Please don't leave me

795
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,096
Just like shooting stars

796
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,233
-I don't think I can sleep through this.
-Our memories rained down on me

797
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,503
-I burst into tears
-No one can sleep through this.

798
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,438
-Just like this
-He's singing so passionately.

799
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,673
Still, tell him nice things.
He'd appreciate it.

800
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,109
THANKFULLY,
THAT DIDN'T TAKE SO LONG

801
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,277
What did you think?

802
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,680
It was marvelous.
If I were… I mean, my goodness.

803
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,684
Your song would be enough
to bring me back to life.

804
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,585
-Really?
-Sure.

805
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,020
Can you recall the title?

806
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,189
-"I Love Today"?
-"I love today…"

807
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,557
You're absolutely right.

808
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,993
-That's its title moving forward.
-Are you updating it?

809
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,263
CHONAM ZONE'S SONG GETS A NEW
TITLE FROM THE WORLD-CLASS STAR

810
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,331
I'm going to change the title right away.

811
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,200
You can keep enjoying your lunch,

812
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,370
but we're going to
hold one-on-one interviews.

813
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,138
-An interview?
-That's right.

814
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,374
-That came out of nowhere.
-So please come and see me.

815
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,708
What is this interview for?

816
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,411
I'm in talks of replacing one of you.

817
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,680
I'll become the new regular
when one of you leaves the show.

818
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,016
REALLY?

819
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,918
Jin wouldn't have an interview, right?

820
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,386
-No, he needs one.
-Oh, I see.

821
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,854
Shall we have some noodles?

822
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,789
INTERVIEW SESSION BEGINS NOW

823
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,624
They must've prepared something.

824
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,928
WELL, YES

825
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,629
STRANGE-LOOKING BUTTONS

826
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,665
ARE PLACED ON THE TABLE
FOR INTERVIEWS

827
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:34,966
What's this about?

828
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,469
THE GODS HEAD
TO THE INTERVIEW ONE BY ONE

829
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,673
I thought we'd have an easy day
because we had Jin with us.

830
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,908
What is this for?

831
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,144
-Do I sit here?
-Yes.

832
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,913
-Thank you for your trouble today.
-Don't mention it. I'm having fun.

833
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,217
-You're here as Eros today.
-That's right.

834
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,552
-You're the God of TV Shows, correct?
-Yes.

835
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,654
-You're the King of the Underworld?
-Yes.

836
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,489
I'm the Capsaicin God.

837
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,958
-I'm the Hungry God.
-Right.

838
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,326
I had my fill.

839
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,528
Let's see. You're the Ice God.

840
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,730
-Yes, that's right.
-It's a pleasure.

841
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,466
Here we are at the party of the gods.

842
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,136
While this is an exclusive event
open only to the gods,

843
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,404
-we have…
-What is it?

844
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,841
We have received intel
that one human snuck in.

845
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,243
I see.

846
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,744
How amusing.

847
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,881
We have such an impudent mortal among us?

848
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,782
That's what the intel says.

849
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,451
Could that be you, Woo-young?

850
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,187
That came out of nowhere.

851
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,121
I'm obviously a god.

852
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,258
I'm the King of the Underworld,
for crying out loud.

853
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,828
It's far from a simple human.
I put so much thought into this character.

854
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,130
I haven't received any orders so far.

855
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,032
I'm the Capsaicin God, plain and simple.

856
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,668
We'll now check your identity.

857
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,837
You'll see one button in front of you.

858
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,238
Please press it.

859
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,741
You'll see six buttons in front of you.

860
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,509
Please press one of your choosing.

861
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,344
Please take a seat.

862
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,681
Goodness. What are those?

863
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,316
What are these?

864
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,686
THE BUTTONS USED IN THE PROCESS
OF IDENTIFYING THE HUMAN

865
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,154
HAVE BEEN REMOVED ONE BY ONE

866
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,590
You'll see one button in front of you.

867
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,225
Please press it.

868
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,393
PRESS IT AND LEARN YOUR IDENTITY

869
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,560
Please press one.

870
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,362
Jeez, you foolish human.

871
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,564
I'm a god.

872
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,434
IDENTITY CONFIRMED

873
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,503
What was that?

874
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,405
-We'll play a group game soon.
-I see.

875
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,607
The human will try to sabotage your game.

876
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,376
If the gods win, the prize will be theirs.

877
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,112
If not,
it will fall into the human's hands.

878
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,147
Once the game is over,

879
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,016
the gods will have to name one
they suspect to be human.

880
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,319
If the gods guess correctly,
they'll be the winners.

881
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,488
If their guess is incorrect,
the human will be the winner.

882
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,856
I understand.

883
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,391
You're free to return to the group.

884
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,396
HERE ARE THE INITIAL REACTIONS

885
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,165
OF THE CAST MEMBERS
AFTER THE REVEAL

886
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,970
TYPE #1: OVER-THE-TOP ACTING

887
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,638
What did the director want?

888
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,506
-The day's work…
-What have you learned?

889
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,541
It's finally beginning.

890
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,744
-Man, what a headache.
-He's spewing nonsense again.

891
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:01,980
TYPE #2

892
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,915
Please don't suspect me. I mean it.

893
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,583
SEEKING ALLIANCE OUT OF THE BLUE

894
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,486
TYPE #3: PUTTING ON
A FORCED SMILE

895
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,023
TYPE #4: PLAYING DETECTIVE

896
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,693
HERE COMES THE PERSON
TO WATCH OUT FOR

897
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,062
Here he comes.
Study his expression closely.

898
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,100
Man, it's so upsetting.

899
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,235
-I'm so ticked off.
-What's wrong?

900
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,137
What upset you so suddenly?

901
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,377
LAST BUT NOT LEAST…

902
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,379
There's no way it is her.

903
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,314
-What's more…
-It just can't be her.

904
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,017
Seeing how she's putting up an act,
she's a god for sure.

905
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,184
Is it you?

906
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,220
She's only managing that
because she's feeling at ease.

907
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,988
BE NICE AND DOUBT HER
LIKE THE OTHERS

908
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,224
THE GAME STARTS NOW

909
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,860
Dear Jin, you won't be going home today.

910
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,362
-Welcome to the club.
-What's this about?

911
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,131
Welcome to Screwballs.

912
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,432
The real deal has just begun.

913
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,467
So basically,

914
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,336
we have a human among us, correct?

915
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,104
We, the gods, have to find them.

916
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,106
Can't the human take a hint and leave?

917
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,908
How dare you crash a party for gods?

918
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,944
We, the gods, will obviously
work hard in the game,

919
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,747
-but the human likely won't.
-They'll slack off, right?

920
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,648
-And so--
-Wait.

921
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,251
Why do you keep saying "we, the gods"?

922
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,519
Because I am one.

923
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,120
-You seem very excited.
-But I am a god.

924
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,456
It's not like I'm lying.
Can't I share my status as a god?

925
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,258
While it's an obvious issue…

926
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,225
What kind of god are you?

927
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,394
Sorry? I'm the Capsaicin God.

928
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,363
But does capsaicin
command enough authority?

929
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,733
Of course. Capsaicin is highly respected
in the world of hot spices.

930
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,502
You're unusually talkative today.

931
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,571
I'm only reminding you guys
that I too am a god.

932
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,906
Gods, please raise your hands.

933
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,442
WHO WOULDN'T RAISE
THEIR HAND HERE?

934
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,712
I suggest that you try
to remain vigilant too, Jin.

935
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,981
-You seem most suspicious.
-It's not me.

936
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:49,120
HE SURE DOES LOOK
THE MOST SUSPICIOUS

937
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,589
Woo-jae. I think it's Sook.

938
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,657
-Sook?
-Yeah.

939
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,060
-Why do you think so?
-She's responding one beat too late.

940
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,596
You seem very calm and collected.

941
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,564
-Who?
-You.

942
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,499
It's because we have food here.
I'm the Hungry God.

943
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,468
She doesn't look at ease
like on any other shoot.

944
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,369
Really? Where is she?

945
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,672
She's disappeared.

946
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,006
HUNGRY GOD VANISHED
AT SOME POINT

947
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,643
-Please take a seat.
-The braided hair looks so nice on you.

948
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,744
-Sook.
-Let's roll.

949
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,146
You styled yourself like a human.

950
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,683
I'm a god, obviously.
Do you even have to doubt me, you guys?

951
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,618
"You guys"?
Are you perhaps referring to the gods?

952
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,919
Hey.

953
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,088
You're acting weird.
Why are you tugging at me?

954
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,157
-It's such a random move.
-Who's tugging at you?

955
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,525
WHY THE STUTTERING
OUT OF THE BLUE?

956
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,494
-Why are you targeting me?
-You seem flustered.

957
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,095
I'm keeping my eye on Jin.

958
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,531
Me? But guests are rarely asked
to carry out important roles.

959
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,499
Hold on.

960
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,368
Did the crew have
a certain cast member in mind

961
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,036
-and hand out the role?
-We did a draw.

962
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,239
-Don't tell me you forgot about it.
-You selected a button.

963
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,642
I wouldn't know. I went last,
so I didn't get to choose my button.

964
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,678
-Oh, that makes sense.
-You would've had only one button there.

965
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,447
-Did you all get to choose?
-Yeah.

966
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,282
I had to press the button
the crew gave to me.

967
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,551
The crew didn't have a hand
in the selection, then.

968
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,720
-It was chosen randomly.
-All right, then.

969
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,756
Let us begin the battle
between the gods and the human.

970
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,526
I have heard
that you're a fan of dad jokes, Jin.

971
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,827
-Is that true?
-I love them.

972
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,163
JIN: A MOSQUITO BIT ME
WHEN I STARED AT IT, IT SAID,

973
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,498
"BUZZ-BUZZ, BUZZ OFF"

974
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,369
JIN HAS SHARED
COUNTLESS DAD JOKES SO FAR

975
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,771
-The game shares some elements with them.
-Really?

976
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,540
Yes, we can say that about the next game.

977
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,441
Here's the first group game
for Along with Jin.

978
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,143
It's Youngsters' Take on Idioms.

979
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,245
I'm not well-versed in those things.

980
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,446
It's going to be difficult.

981
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,283
-We tried it back in Paju, didn't we?
-Yes, you played it before.

982
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,451
The younger generation
reinvented the well-known idioms

983
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,655
using memes and new expressions
and gave them youthful vibes,

984
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,923
taking the internet by storm.

985
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,192
When we show you the reinvented idiom,

986
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,793
you have to tell us its original version.

987
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,962
So we have to nail the original idiom?

988
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,031
Yes, that's exactly what you have to do.

989
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,599
I have absolutely no idea.

990
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,069
I think you're laying it on too thick
before you mess up big time.

991
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,904
I'm just no good
at understanding the youngsters.

992
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,541
We would give you three seconds only
if this were an individual match.

993
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,010
But since it's a group game,
you get 20 seconds.

994
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,212
-Okay.
-Just 20 seconds?

995
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,248
-We have to answer 6 quizzes correctly?
-Yes, 6 quizzes in 20 seconds.

996
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,450
Seating arrangement matters
as you'll answer in that order.

997
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,852
Let's select our prime suspect
after a discussion

998
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,521
and have them take the first seat.

999
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,823
-They'll make an obvious error.
-They'll knowingly get it wrong.

1000
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,259
-Let's see and find out.
-Yeah, we'll be able to catch them.

1001
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,494
-Let's have suspicious people sit there.
-Sook can come here.

1002
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,463
-It's a game, after all.
-Wait, Sae-ho.

1003
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,864
Even if they get it wrong,

1004
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,467
they can weasel out
by saying the game is too difficult.

1005
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,969
We should have Jin in the first seat.

1006
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,237
I'm not good with the new trends.

1007
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,305
-Go ahead, Jin.
-Even so, we have to get to know you.

1008
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,507
Man, I'm starting
to question Jin's identity.

1009
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,677
SECOND SUSPECT
HE MAY BE HUMAN WITH GODLY FORM

1010
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,212
Are we losing you, Jin?

1011
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,647
No, I'm staying in the game.

1012
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,182
Okay. Now…

1013
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,850
Tuck your tummy in, Sae-ho.

1014
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,454
Woo-jae, we need you
to do your thing here.

1015
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,322
You really don't have to mistrust me!

1016
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,690
GLARE

1017
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,892
Let's have Sook sit in the middle.

1018
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,127
Why do you keep doubting me?

1019
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,929
-Unbelievable.
-This is it.

1020
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,964
Will you stop questioning me
if I get it right away?

1021
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,065
-I'd like to get one.
-Sae-ho.

1022
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,667
So you're saying you're not human.

1023
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,369
I'm a god.

1024
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,237
We'll find out soon enough.

1025
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,906
We still have
many Netflix merchandise left.

1026
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,341
You can discuss among yourselves

1027
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,844
and select which item
you want to receive as the prize

1028
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,513
when you have won this game.

1029
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,815
-Let's go for the big one.
-This is likely it.

1030
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,284
-Okay, so Prize Five.
-All right.

1031
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,952
-Agreed.
-We get that when we win.

1032
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,287
I'll do my best.

1033
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,989
I'll buy you enough time
so you can even take a nap, Jin-kyung.

1034
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,424
Here's your first set of quizzes.

1035
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,294
Ready, go.

1036
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,595
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS?

1037
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,363
You reap what you sow.

1038
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,264
Correct.

1039
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,399
WHAT A HOT AND ENTICING CAKE

1040
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,634
You can't have a cake and eat it too?

1041
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,503
What? That's not it.

1042
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,904
"You can't have a cake and eat it too"?

1043
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,139
CONFUSED

1044
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,707
-He got it wrong.
-Selling like hotcakes?

1045
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,875
What?

1046
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,245
-He's dragging it out on purpose.
-I get it now.

1047
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,315
The icing on the cake.

1048
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,883
-That's correct.
-Jeez.

1049
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,085
-What on earth?
-Your 20 seconds are up.

1050
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,986
What?

1051
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,588
I answered in two seconds flat!
What do you think you're playing at?

1052
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,924
YOU'RE THE HUMAN, AREN'T YOU?

1053
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,826
-Just a second.
-After all your talk, Woo-jae.

1054
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,828
-This is an unexpected setback.
-But I'm a god!

1055
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,363
What are you doing here, human?

1056
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,531
That was tricky!

1057
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,666
You have no business
mingling with gods, human.

1058
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,269
Come on, it was difficult.
I'm sure you had no idea either.

1059
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,670
It was because of the keyword, "cake."

1060
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,473
I think he made an honest mistake here.

1061
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,042
-See? Sae-ho understands me.
-He didn't mess up on purpose.

1062
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,277
-Because--
-Look, Jin.

1063
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,046
HE IS TRYING TO ARGUE
THAT THE KEYWORD CONFUSED HIM

1064
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,182
-That came to my mind first.
-I still don't get it.

1065
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,517
-Why are you defending him?
-Why would you side with him?

1066
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,153
-Can there be two humans?
-No, there's only one.

1067
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,189
WHISPERING IN SECRET

1068
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,291
Give me a chance to redeem myself.

1069
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,493
Why don't I move to the back?

1070
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,095
I've proved myself, haven't I?

1071
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,796
-For now…
-You can't doubt me.

1072
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,532
-Yeah, you did great.
-I answered right away.

1073
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,467
No, wait.

1074
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,235
You have to remember this, though.

1075
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,670
We only get 20 seconds.

1076
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,538
Even if the human did their best,

1077
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,707
the chances of us winning are very slim.

1078
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,776
IS THAT RIGHT?

1079
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,444
LET'S NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS
WITH ONLY ONE GAME

1080
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,179
Why do you keep suspecting me?

1081
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:46,617
When I couldn't get the right answer,
Jin accused me way too harshly.

1082
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,086
THOSE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
ARE USUALLY THE BAD GUYS

1083
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:53,457
LACK OF FAITH
AMONG THE DISTRUSTFUL GODS

1084
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,727
The human among you
is currently leading by one point.

1085
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,196
-But 20 seconds are too short.
-Give us 30 seconds at least.

1086
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,199
We're only saying that because it gives
the human the perfect cover.

1087
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,202
-How about 25 seconds? We'll go with that.
-We'll take that offer.

1088
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,270
-Let's do it.
-Ready.

1089
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,739
Set, go.

1090
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,441
EMPTY VESSELS TRY WAY TOO HARD

1091
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,576
-Empty vessels make the most noise.
-That's easy.

1092
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,611
WATER: DEPTH MATTERS MOST

1093
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,414
-Still waters run deep.
-That's correct.

1094
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,382
I'LL BE THAT DOG
FOREVER SERENADING THE TREE

1095
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,784
The tree… The dog…

1096
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,286
-Bark up the wrong tree.
-That's correct.

1097
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,554
What was that?

1098
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,522
HUH? WHAT'S UNDER MY NOSE?

1099
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,824
-Right under one's nose.
-That's correct.

1100
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,293
BIRD: THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD
FOR EARLY-RISERS

1101
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,261
WORM: YOU'RE AWFUL

1102
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,829
The early bird…

1103
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,930
WHY DID IT GET UP EARLY?

1104
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,064
The early bird…

1105
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,866
-Would you look at that?
-Jeez!

1106
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,935
How did it go? The early bird…

1107
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,770
-But it's a piece of cake.
-You timed out.

1108
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,306
-You cannot know this!
-Guys, how did it go?

1109
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,074
The early bird catches the worm.

1110
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,443
Yeah, but what's the correct idiom?

1111
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,279
-It's about bird feeding.
-Yeah, but what does the bird feed on?

1112
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,281
The early bird…

1113
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,416
-He honestly has no clue.
-He can be very dense.

1114
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,951
-He's an idiot.
-He has no idea.

1115
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,454
I really am clueless here.
I can't get the right words.

1116
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,123
-But "worm" is spelled out for you.
-It got so confusing for me.

1117
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,090
My brain froze.

1118
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,294
These two also took quite long
for easy questions.

1119
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,728
-I thought so too.
-Don't doubt me.

1120
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,263
BUT YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS

1121
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,599
-I did my very best.
-I answered right away.

1122
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,669
Let's have Jin-kyung and Woo-young
in the first two seats.

1123
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,037
-We're going there?
-Get moving.

1124
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,572
-It's so confusing for me.
-Come on.

1125
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,174
I answered both questions right away.

1126
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,009
I'm a god. That's for sure.

1127
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,680
JIN ANSWERED THE QUIZ IN ALL
OF THE PREVIOUS ROUNDS QUICKLY

1128
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,882
-Please don't mind us doubting you.
-Oh, I won't.

1129
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,017
You've done well so far.
We'll see how it goes this time.

1130
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,719
Let's see how you do this time.

1131
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,954
Ready.

1132
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,756
Set, go.

1133
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,327
GOOSE: YOU TOO, GANDER?

1134
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,995
What on earth, you?

1135
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,499
What's good for the goose…

1136
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:42,566
-What?
-Jeez.

1137
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,734
This isn't that difficult.

1138
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,203
-What are you doing?
-He's being blatant about it.

1139
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,271
Just a second.

1140
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,640
Goose said, "You too, Gander?" The goose…

1141
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,442
Seriously…

1142
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,810
He's just really clueless.

1143
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,645
What is good for goose…

1144
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,946
Yes, all the keywords are there.

1145
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,349
…is good for the gander.

1146
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,250
You failed!

1147
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,885
-Hold on.
-You wasted all our time.

1148
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,887
Don't fool around, Woo-young.

1149
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,855
COULD WOO-YOUNG HAVE
EATEN UP THE TIME

1150
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,190
DESPITE KNOWING THE ANSWER?

1151
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,059
You're in big trouble if you're human
or if you simply had no idea.

1152
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,728
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE

1153
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,464
It's the latter, Woo-jae.
My brain is just not working.

1154
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,134
EVERYONE IS SUSPICIOUS
AT THIS POINT

1155
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,772
PANICKED SCREAM

1156
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,673
Wait.

1157
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,542
TEARS

1158
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,976
Man, it's so cold!

1159
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,478
We're almost there.

1160
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:32,883
NO DECENT PERSON WOULD GO AS FAR
AS THESE IMPOSTER-GOD SUSPECTS

1161
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,452
Are you serious?

1162
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,856
AND YET…

1163
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:43,027
ONE IRREGULAR BEING
HID THEMSELVES AMONG THE GODS

1164
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,167
WHICH ONE OF THEM IS THE HUMAN?
