1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs…

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,106
Today's theme is "Couple's Inferno."

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,808
Unlike in Single's Inferno,
singles will go to Paradise

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,811
while couples will end up in Inferno.

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,815
The person who is placed at the bottom
must remain at Inferno for a date.

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,651
Their partner to endure it with

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,055
will be decided by the votes
from the Love Kibitzers, the crew.

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,223
BUT THEN

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,626
A FEMALE GAME CHANGER FIGHTS OFF
HER SECURITY TO FIND LOVE HERE

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:28,561
THE HEIRESS, MS. KIM

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,163
I'll find the right guy for me.

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,601
FIRST GAME, TRIANGLE TUG-OF-WAR
ALSO KNOWN AS DEX GAME

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,704
LOSE THE GAME, AND YOU MUST
HAVE A DATE WITH YOUR COSTAR

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,373
I'll work harder
than in any of the episodes so far.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,441
I'm going to go to Paradise.

16
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,709
CURRENT SCORE
SOOK, SAE-HO: 100 PTS

17
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,677
HYE-SEON, WOO-YOUNG: 30 POINTS
JIN-KYUNG, WOO-JAE: 0 POINTS

18
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,781
AS THE WORLD BASKS
IN THE WARM SPRING SUN

19
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,317
THE BOLD AND SPICY
BLIND DATE CONTINUES

20
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,287
-We're here for a blind date, aren't we?
-Sure.

21
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,855
Oh, is that right?

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,957
-Right, this is a blind date.
-Of course.

23
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,426
Yeah, three girls and three guys.

24
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,894
THIS IS A THREE-ON-THREE
BLIND DATE

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,095
Jin-kyung.

26
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,432
Do couples sent to Paradise
stay the night there on Single's Inferno?

27
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,332
Yeah.

28
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,400
They stay the night there?

29
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,202
-Of course!
-In the same room?

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,572
Guys and girls usually make an arrangement
not to share the room together.

31
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,707
-But a couple shared a bed this season.
-They slept together.

32
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,875
I remember that.

33
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,277
What? I'm not doing that.

34
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,913
DEEPLY TROUBLED

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,515
-But we--
-I need to ask my dad about the sleepover.

36
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,651
HUH?

37
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,586
Can't I wrestle with Hye-seon instead?

38
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,589
OH, NO…

39
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,293
The spicy dating show.

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,161
Deepen your emotional connection

41
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,031
and understanding with one another
with the game we prepared.

42
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,833
This game will make you call
your costar's name,

43
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,068
giving you an opportunity
to acknowledge their presence

44
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,370
and seek emotional connection.

45
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,840
The next game to determine your fate

46
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,609
-is "Call My Name."
-I see.

47
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,745
THEY MUST HUDDLE AROUND CLOSE
ENOUGH TO HAVE THEIR KNEES TOUCH

48
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,982
When the first player
calls out someone's name and a number…

49
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,118
THEY MUST THEN CALL
THAT PERSON'S NAME

50
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,018
Hye-seon, three.

51
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,689
YOU LOSE IF YOU CALL
A WRONG NAME OR MISS A BEAT

52
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,758
-What does that mean?
-Suppose Hye-seon said,

53
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,193
"Sae-ho, three."

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,728
THEN HE MUST CALL HER NAME

55
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,830
-That sounds difficult.
-Jin-kyung, two.

56
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,798
Sae-ho, Sae-ho.

57
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,933
Oh, I get it now.

58
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,636
WHILE CONCERN FOR
A CERTAIN PERSON STILL LINGERS…

59
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,039
As usual,
we'll keep count of your mistakes.

60
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,209
-My goal is to be the runner-up.
-The person with the least mistakes

61
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,677
will receive 100 points.

62
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,012
Second place, 50 points.

63
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,347
Third place, 30 points.

64
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,548
Fourth place, ten points.

65
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,616
Fifth place, five points.

66
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,151
Sixth place, zero points.

67
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,519
That's the rule.

68
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,122
I've seen the young people
bring up the number to eight.

69
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,824
-Are we sticking to four names?
-Goodness.

70
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,626
-That's hard enough.
-How do you fit eight names in?

71
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,028
Sae-ho, there's always
a time and place for everything.

72
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,329
-I see.
-It's difficult enough.

73
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,864
RIGHT, I FORGOT WE HAD JIN-KYUNG

74
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,399
-All right. Up to four names only.
-Okay.

75
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,235
You'll find the cozy space
we set up for you in the back.

76
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,104
Aren't the seats set up too close?

77
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,039
Our knees would touch.
Is that appropriate?

78
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,708
Here's a suggestion.

79
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,444
Let's try to keep the mood
light and friendly for this special day.

80
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,313
If anyone loses their temper

81
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,515
or has an outburst,
saying they feel targeted,

82
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,218
please give them a penalty.

83
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,720
AN OUTBURST
WILL COST THEM A POINT

84
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,357
-So, let's have a pleasant time together.
-Yeah, let's do that.

85
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,759
-Let's keep a smile on.
-Yeah.

86
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,894
Even if I lose my temper or act annoyed…

87
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,963
-Was that a warning?
-I meant even if we felt that way,

88
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,097
let's not show it.

89
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,266
-Got it.
-Let's keep it friendly for the date.

90
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,570
I hear someone's going to write us up
if we have a temper tantrum.

91
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,405
Points are involved,
so let's keep it cordial.

92
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,775
THE THRILLING INDOOR BLIND DATE
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE STARTS NOW

93
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,312
-I wanna hear you call my name
-I wanna hear you call my name

94
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,880
Woo-jae, two.

95
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,481
Sook, Sook.

96
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,983
BREEZING THROUGH

97
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,551
Jin-kyung, four.

98
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,652
Jin-kyung…

99
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,588
SHOOTS DAGGERS

100
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,122
I'm afraid you got it wrong there.

101
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,657
-Smile.
-Are you perhaps annoyed?

102
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,160
Did you have to
throw a curveball with four?

103
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,895
-Are you complaining here?
-Oh, no.

104
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,129
He was flirting with you.

105
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,698
I guess I was showing interest.

106
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,732
Jin-kyung.

107
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,666
He must like her.

108
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,669
I mean, she's sitting to my right.

109
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,073
Sook showed me interest,
and I merely passed it to Jin-kyung.

110
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,108
It sure felt like
you were flirting with Jin-kyung.

111
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,877
Oh, no. I shouldn't let
my feelings show just yet.

112
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,579
-He was flirting?
-Let's resume the game.

113
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,082
Please let me keep my feelings a secret.
I'm on the line here.

114
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,618
He seemed to like her from the start.

115
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,286
What did you find so appealing about me?

116
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,722
What did you find so appealing about me?

117
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,057
Can we take a short break?

118
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,525
THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY

119
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,296
I'm sorry, but another remark like that
will get your points docked.

120
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,965
-All right.
-Let's laugh it off.

121
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,001
PRO TIP:
DON'T RUSH AND MESS UP YOUR SHOT

122
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,602
One, two, three, four.

123
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,805
-I wanna hear you call my name
-I wanna hear you call my name

124
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,474
Woo-jae, four.

125
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,676
Jin-kyung, Jin-kyung,
Jin-kyung, Jin-kyung.

126
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,610
Jin-kyung, four.

127
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,812
THIS MAN RESPONDED
TO HER IMMEDIATELY

128
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,014
Jin-kyung, four.

129
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,150
ONCE AGAIN, WOO-JAE SHOWED
HIS INTEREST IN JIN-KYUNG

130
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,022
-Just a second.
-His flirting game is on another level.

131
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,691
-What's going on?
-The heart wants what it wants.

132
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,059
I think he's smitten with me.

133
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,194
Excuse me,
but we're getting sidelined here.

134
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,829
-Should we leave?
-I apologize.

135
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,531
-Think about Hye-seon too.
-I'm so sorry.

136
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,167
But once the sparks start to fly…

137
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,135
Gosh, that's scary.

138
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,970
If you do that one more time,

139
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,672
we'll just give you two the room.

140
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,474
I'll try to direct my attention
to other ladies here too.

141
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,376
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

142
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,078
Seriously though, what caught your eye?

143
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,079
Please refrain from---

144
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,048
-Was that a complaint?
-Of course not.

145
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,984
-Director, let's do jump ropes instead.
-You seem infatuated with me.

146
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,919
-I apologize. I can't hide my feelings.
-Shall we?

147
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,287
Are we ready for another round?

148
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,889
One, two, three, four.

149
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,725
-I wanna hear you call my name
-I wanna hear you call my name

150
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,160
Woo-young, four.

151
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,128
Jin-kyung, Jin-kyung,
Jin-kyung, Jin-kyung.

152
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,129
Sae-ho, two.

153
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,098
Woo-young, Woo-young.

154
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,032
Woo-young, three.

155
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,802
-Woo-young, three.
-Sae…

156
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,937
-1 POINT

157
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,339
CRACKING UP

158
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,374
-It was just…
-Dang it.

159
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,776
-Seriously though…
-It's almost scary.

160
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,613
The game requires great concentration.

161
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,382
It's so difficult to switch gears.

162
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,117
Out of all the games we've played so far,

163
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,786
this seems to demand
the highest level of concentration.

164
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,254
I'm shaking here.

165
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,322
Let's try to focus.

166
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,124
GAME'S RULES ARE CONFUSING

167
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,259
AND ONE MISTAKE
CAN PLACE YOU IN INFERNO

168
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,062
REMINDER:
COUPLES WILL END UP IN INFERNO

169
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,666
-This is so difficult.
-This game's not Woo-young's thing either.

170
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,568
I feel bad for you.

171
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,869
TEARS

172
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,038
Shall we, then? One, two, three, four.

173
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,807
-I wanna hear you call my name
-I wanna hear you call my name

174
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,342
Hye-seon, one.

175
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,277
Woo-young.

176
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,178
Sae-ho, three.

177
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,047
Hye-seon, Hye-seon, Hye-seon.

178
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:21,948
Sook, four.

179
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,583
Four. Oh, no.

180
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,085
Four. Oh, no.

181
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,122
-Four…
-How adorable.

182
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,423
I can't believe it.

183
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,160
By the way, you're so adorable…
Oh, you're super muscular.

184
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,363
Her triceps are incredible.

185
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,165
-Hey, Sook.
-Wanna give it a poke?

186
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,434
-How is your arm this rock solid?
-To tell the truth,

187
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,035
these aren't puff sleeves.

188
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,004
-My arms are puffing the sleeves up.
-You're jacked.

189
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,473
What's your total on the big three?
I meant in the gym.

190
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,041
Oh, no. I'm not into those.

191
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,977
She's just into boxing.

192
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,780
SHE'S INTO
DRAGGING PEOPLE AROUND TOO

193
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,549
-I wanna hear you call my name
-I wanna hear you call my name

194
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,917
Sae-ho, four.

195
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,886
Sook, Sook, Sook, Sook.

196
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:00,787
Sook, three.

197
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,522
Sae-ho, Sae…

198
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,891
Sae-ho, Sae…

199
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,329
-I said three.
-You know, these two are being so obvious.

200
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,864
Wait. That's too much touching.

201
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,367
-Oh, no.
-You two are being way too obvious.

202
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,536
Even if you're attracted to someone,

203
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,104
remember that we've just met

204
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,772
-and try to contain your feelings.
-Yeah.

205
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,809
-You're giving me undivided attention.
-Sorry, I didn't mean to, though--

206
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,076
Kiss the girl.

207
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,813
RANDOM CHANT FOR A KISS

208
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,548
-Kiss the girl.
-Kiss the girl.

209
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,283
-Kiss the girl.
-Kiss the girl.

210
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,018
STRETCHING OUT WIDE

211
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,753
OH, MY

212
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,955
Are we good? Can we air this?

213
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,957
They say we have a tight schedule, so…

214
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,158
THIS IS FOR ALL OUR SAKES

215
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,693
LET'S SPEED THINGS UP

216
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,895
Woo-jae, two.

217
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,263
Sook, Sook.

218
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,164
Sae-ho, four.

219
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,099
Woo-jae, Woo-jae, Woo-jae, Woo-jae.

220
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,000
Woo-young, three.

221
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,036
UMM… I DUNNO

222
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:50,937
Dang it.

223
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,207
WOO-YOUNG GETS IT WRONG AGAIN

224
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,875
WHY WON'T YOU ACCEPT
MY REGARD FOR YOU?

225
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,310
Are you perhaps upset?

226
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,446
-You're hopeless.
-What's wrong?

227
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,981
-It's difficult.
-I'm so pissed.

228
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:02,882
-1 POINT

229
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,917
-I mean--
-You lost a point.

230
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,652
-How manly.
-They wrote you up.

231
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,787
It wasn't bad.

232
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,756
That was inappropriate language.

233
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,326
AS THE BLIND DATE CONTINUES
IN FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE

234
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,328
GIDDY DELIGHT
HITS YOU LIKE A TRUCK

235
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,897
COULD THIS BE LOVE, THOUGH?

236
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,867
WHILE THEIR EMOTIONAL TURMOIL
CONTINUES,

237
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,268
THE GAME REACHES ITS FINAL ROUND

238
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,736
WOO-JAE GOES FIRST THIS TIME

239
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,637
Jin-kyung, four.

240
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,772
IT'S ME AGAIN, JIN-KYUNG

241
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,978
-Don't look so annoyed.
-You should just ask her out.

242
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,780
-You only have eyes for her, don't you?
-It's time we gave them the room.

243
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,349
Yeah, let's not be tactless.

244
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,718
Why are you so fixated on her?

245
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,520
If this is how things are,
I don't think I can keep participating.

246
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,155
-Why not?
-What's wrong?

247
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,190
Are you upset?

248
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,459
He's merely paying you attention.

249
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,694
-I think she's moved.
-Looks that way.

250
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,031
-I must've overwhelmed her.
-You made it so obvious, so…

251
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,766
-We rather felt uncomfortable.
-Exactly.

252
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,269
How exactly do you feel? Can you tell us?

253
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,171
I don't think she can.

254
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,041
-Maybe she's feeling shy?
-Could that be it?

255
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,644
I'm concerned
I'm not exactly clicking with you,

256
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,380
being a Hong Konger and all.

257
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,849
…being a Hong Konger and all.

258
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,250
WAIT, LET'S REIN IT IN

259
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,252
CRACKS UP

260
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,320
-She's a Hong Konger?
-What the…

261
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,421
BUT SHE SPEAKS NO CANTONESE

262
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,624
-Could I make a small suggestion?
-Sure.

263
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,594
Why don't we dock a point
if we can't hold back laughter?

264
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,695
Oh, okay.

265
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,697
We're throwing that in?
I'm barely managing here.

266
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,367
As we continue with the challenge
while holding back laughter,

267
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,069
could I ask a small question?

268
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,604
-May I do that?
-Sure.

269
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,707
-We'll have to avoid laughing from now on.
-Of course.

270
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,743
Which middle school did you attend?

271
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,811
IS THIS OFTEN ASKED ON DATES?

272
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,079
Me?

273
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,981
-That was meant for everyone.
-Oh, everyone.

274
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,382
All right. It's for small talk.

275
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,585
My alma mater is Stuck-In Middle School.

276
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,486
My alma mater is Stuck-In Middle School.

277
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,355
FLINCH

278
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,490
That's not a problem for you, is it?

279
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,026
I graduated from Kimil Middle School.

280
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,530
I MUST REMAIN CALM

281
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,066
My alma mater is… But I'm not sure
if I should say this on air.

282
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,667
This is going on air, right?

283
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,135
CONCERNED FOR PRIVACY

284
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,604
Mine's Diddle-For Middle School.

285
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,975
-So that's your alma mater.
-Yeah.

286
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,409
My alma mater is

287
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,546
-Kimsang Middle School.
-Oh, Kimsang Middle School. That place…

288
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,348
Isn't it an all-boys school?

289
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,249
-1 POINT

290
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,052
Isn't it an all-boys school?

291
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,988
TEARS

292
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,992
LET'S THINK ABOUT SAD THINGS

293
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,760
FLINCH

294
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,996
-Oh, you can't do that.
-Isn't that inappropriate?

295
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,966
FAILS TO HOLD BACK LAUGHTER
AS HER PAST IS EXPOSED SO EASILY

296
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,868
THEY'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET

297
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,170
I'm a graduate
of Lan Kwai Fong Girls' Middle School.

298
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,172
LAN KWAI FONG?

299
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,508
TWITCH

300
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,745
Oh, if it's not too much to ask,

301
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,848
could you please sing us
a verse of your school song?

302
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,617
SCHOOL SONG?

303
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,254
Sherry Sherry Lan Kwai Fong

304
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,058
Sherry Sherry Lan Kwai Fong

305
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,862
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

306
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,531
Sherry Sherry Lan Kwai Fong…

307
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:06,932
-1 POINT

308
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,537
Sherry Sherry Lan Kwai Fong

309
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,839
WE MUST REIN IT IN

310
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,477
THE SONG HAD QUITE AN IMPACT

311
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,546
I'm mad now. So mad.

312
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,681
She's the worst!

313
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,149
She wasn't lying, all right.

314
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,084
-What about college?
-Oh, college?

315
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,586
-What about…
-As for me…

316
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,022
IT'S COLLEGE THIS TIME

317
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,692
-…I graduated from Flirty Hill College.
-Oh, that place?

318
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,294
-That's an elite school.
-In my case,

319
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,730
I actually went to the same college
as one of my close friends.

320
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,866
My friend Gyeong-hwan and I
are alumni of Stillhere College.

321
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,168
That's another prestigious place.

322
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,003
-The one in Gyeongsang Province?
-Yeah.

323
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,939
Can you sing us a verse
from your college's song?

324
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,575
MY COLLEGE'S SONG?

325
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,645
We're still here in this place of learning

326
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,681
We're still here in this place of learning

327
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,982
Here at Stillhere College

328
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,851
-That's our song.
-I see.

329
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,886
-The song has a high BPM.
-Yeah, it's for dancing.

330
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,389
-Around 130 RPM, right?
-Just about 130, yeah.

331
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,325
-But in BPM, not RPM.
-Don't we use RPM to talk about engines?

332
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,061
-2PM isn't a measurement unit, right?
-Right.

333
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,599
Now that we've heard
about your middle school and college,

334
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,601
can I ask which high school you attended?

335
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,203
-Must we answer?
-Should I?

336
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,771
To tell the truth,

337
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,873
my alma mater is Royal Flush High.

338
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,308
So I see.

339
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,544
-That's one of the top schools.
-It makes you unstoppable.

340
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,313
What about you, Woo-young?

341
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,416
I'm afraid I'll need some more time.

342
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,718
-But what can be so difficult…
-I just need some time.

343
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,254
-about telling us your school's name?
-Maybe he transferred?

344
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,856
What about you, Hye-seon?

345
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,991
Gunsan Girls' Commercial High School.

346
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,926
SERIOUS

347
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,762
THAT'S A SMILE

348
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,230
Hey, Woo-jae.

349
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,598
But that's… I mean,

350
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,899
I didn't expect to hear…

351
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,069
-such a detailed answer.
-Excuse me.

352
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,204
Are you sure
it was an all-girls high school?

353
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,473
Yeah, I attended an all-girls high school.

354
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,609
-I've been a girl since then.
-In an all-girls school?

355
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,245
In my case,

356
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,247
I meant to take the GED tests.

357
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,517
But I somehow met a teacher
working in the high school

358
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,252
that eventually became my alma mater.

359
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:10,589
A VERY LONG BACKSTORY ABOUT
HOW HE ENROLLED IN THE SCHOOL

360
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,892
The teacher then said,

361
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,393
"Make your name at Made-Up High."

362
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,695
"Make your name at Made-Up High."

363
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,465
That's what he said.

364
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,766
-1 POINT

365
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,938
DO TRY TO MAKE A BIT MORE EFFORT

366
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,775
That remark moved me so much
that I enrolled in that school.

367
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,378
So, you're an alum of Made-Up High.

368
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,447
I don't get why people always laugh

369
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,316
-at my high school's name.
-Why would they do that?

370
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,985
-We promise not to laugh.
-What could your school's name be?

371
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,021
Pickled Veggie Preparatory.

372
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,456
Pickled Veggie Preparatory.

373
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,192
-1 POINT

374
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,728
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER

375
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,765
IT'S NOT FUNNY… IT'S NOT…

376
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,166
Pickled Veggie Preparatory, huh?

377
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,968
-Isn't it--
-What do they teach there?

378
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,070
-Pickled Veggie Preparatory…
-I can't help but wonder

379
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,573
-what you learn there.
-Can you sing us your school song?

380
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,841
A verse, please.

381
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,976
Oh, Pickled Veggie Preparatory

382
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,911
Oh, Pickled Veggie Preparatory

383
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,515
-How strange is that?
-Stay salty, Pickled Veggie Preparatory

384
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,518
I'll now announce the results

385
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,119
-of this game.
-"Pickled Veggie"?

386
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,821
First place goes to…

387
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,156
Oh, it's this person.

388
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,924
WHO TOOK FIRST PLACE
IN "CALL MY NAME" GAME?

389
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,893
Congratulations, Sae-ho.

390
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,329
1 LAUGH
FIRST PLACE, SAE-HO

391
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,831
Please give me a big hand. Thanks.

392
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,932
CONGRATS

393
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,967
You won 100 points.

394
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,035
Next is second place,
who will receive 50 points.

395
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:30,936
JUMPS THE GUN

396
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,038
Congratulations, Woo-young.

397
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,473
-What?
-What's this?

398
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,942
-Huh?
-What seems to be the problem?

399
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,844
Third place goes to Sook.

400
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,779
3 MISTAKES AND 2 LAUGHS

401
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,882
Did you laugh a lot?

402
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,517
-Fourth place goes to Hye-seon.
-What?

403
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,453
Who was in charge
of counting up the laughs?

404
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,354
DEEPLY UPSET

405
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,322
Fifth place goes to Jin-kyung.

406
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,457
4 MISTAKES AND 4 LAUGHS

407
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,559
Sixth place goes to Woo-jae.

408
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,160
You must've laughed a lot.

409
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,329
Gosh, so you're a smiley type.

410
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,131
Who handled the counting?

411
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,867
EVEN A HINT OF YOUR SMILE
MELTED OUR HEARTS

412
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,702
You could make a comeback

413
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,437
-with the final game.
-All right!

414
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,706
It's a team game this time.

415
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,542
You'll pair up with a member
of the opposite sex to form a team.

416
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,847
The pair's partnership
will play a key role in this game,

417
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,516
so you'll have to be very prudent
in choosing your partner.

418
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,952
The partners will receive the same points.

419
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,988
The most affectionate pair
will likely have an edge in this game.

420
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,092
The ladies will be given the choice
to select their partners.

421
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,895
Could you please take turns

422
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,732
to tell us who you'd like to pair up with?
Does anyone want to go first?

423
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,334
Personally,

424
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,904
I've thought that the coolest guy here

425
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,906
is Woo-young.

426
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,341
SOOK CHOSE WOO-YOUNG

427
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,610
I'll never forget that moment.

428
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,281
How should I phrase this…
Her smile touched my heart.

429
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,418
I'd say my heart is behaving erratically.

430
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,753
Why am I getting choked up?

431
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,224
-…is Woo-young.
-I see.

432
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,459
THAT MOMENT…

433
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,529
-…is Woo-young.
-I see.

434
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,763
Damn it.

435
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,667
SHERRY HONG HAD HER EYE
ON WOO-YOUNG TOO

436
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,970
Jang Woo-young?

437
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,005
What do you like about him?

438
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:17,176
I don't particularly feel
drawn to Woo-young.

439
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,144
It just that others…

440
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,346
Frankly, they suck.

441
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,350
I had Woo-young as my partner earlier

442
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,884
in the Lipstick Game.

443
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,953
So I was considering

444
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,723
partnering up with Woo-jae next.

445
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,227
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU INITIALLY

446
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,465
BUT YOU'RE THE PERSON
I CHOOSE IN THE END

447
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,968
Was this the way it was supposed to be?
I felt so confused.

448
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,636
CRYPTIC EXPRESSION

449
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,272
Okay, I'll be your partner
for whatever game that's in store for us.

450
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,375
If you're not happy with it…

451
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,442
-Wait.
-…I'll go with Sae-ho.

452
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,844
I was just considering strategies.

453
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,512
I can't explain it,

454
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,315
but it feels like we've spent
seven years together in our past lives.

455
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,150
-If you mind, I could go with Sae-ho--
-Not at all.

456
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,651
-I'm thrilled.
-So you're okay with it?

457
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,754
-Of course. Please do me this honor.
-In that case…

458
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,522
I'd like to partner with Woo-jae.

459
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,324
If I had to make a choice,

460
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,426
I'd like to go with Sae-ho.

461
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,828
-Consider yourself lucky.
-Oh, okay.

462
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,831
He rushed toward me so daringly earlier,

463
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,467
-and he looked so manly then.
-I see.

464
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,369
I'll go with Woo-young.

465
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,172
-It's been settled peacefully.
-Sure.

466
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,074
It seems the decisions
were made without a hitch.

467
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,976
Let's do our best in the last game.

468
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,177
-Sure.
-Let's do that.

469
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,646
YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LOVE
CAN BETRAY YOU SOMETIMES

470
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,481
ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON

471
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,849
FINAL GAME OF COUPLE'S INFERNO

472
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,917
I'll now explain the rules.

473
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:37,656
Woo-young and Jin-kyung
are facing each other now.

474
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,260
One of you will now hold
a lollipop and a bar of soap in each hand

475
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,631
and push one forward to your partner
according to the direction.

476
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,200
When that person holds out the lollipop,
their partner must lick it.

477
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,070
When they hold out the soap,
their partner must smell it.

478
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,038
The third and last direction
is "Swap hands."

479
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,607
If you have the lollipop
and the soap in your hands,

480
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,409
swap their places.

481
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:01,447
Sae-ho will do the honors
of giving the pair the direction.

482
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,184
ONE OF SHORT-FORM CONTENT
CREATORS' FAVORITE CHALLENGES

483
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,619
HAS BEEN ADAPTED SO THAT
A COUPLE MAY TRY IT TOGETHER

484
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,521
-We'll give you one minute.
-Understood.

485
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,123
One minute goes far longer
than you'd expect.

486
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,591
-Did you understand the rules?
-Yeah.

487
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,359
You too, Jin-kyung and Woo-young?

488
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,994
Okay. Get ready for your one minute.

489
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,030
Ready. Go.

490
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,997
Soap.

491
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,999
Lollipop.

492
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,067
Lollipop.

493
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,368
Soap.

494
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,403
Soap.

495
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,804
Lollipop. Lollipop.

496
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,739
Lollipop. Lollipop.

497
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,740
Lollipop. Soap.

498
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,110
Swap hands.

499
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,311
Soap.

500
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,779
Lollipop.

501
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,814
WHY IS HE FINDING IT FUNNY?

502
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,483
-Swap hands.
-I can feel it coming.

503
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,717
-Lollipop.
-Be ready.

504
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,319
Soap. Soap.

505
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,887
Swap hands.

506
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,821
Soap.

507
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,590
LICKS

508
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,858
HEH

509
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,758
Soap.

510
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,261
Lollipop. Swap hands.

511
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,230
Soap.

512
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,198
Lollipop. Lollipop.

513
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,266
Lollipop.

514
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,534
Soap. Lollipop.

515
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,835
Swap hands.

516
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,270
Lollipop. Soap.

517
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,506
-Soap. Soap.
-Oh, dear. Her nose.

518
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,406
Soap.

519
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,774
SMACK!

520
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,176
I'M SORRY

521
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,377
Swap hands.

522
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,778
Swap hands. Soap.

523
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,614
Soap. Soap.

524
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,848
Lollipop. Swap hands.

525
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,916
CRACKS UP

526
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,951
Soap.

527
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,487
Lollipop. Lollipop. Lollipop.

528
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,890
Lollipop. Lollipop.

529
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,391
Lollipop. Soap…

530
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,593
THEY'RE KEEPING IT GOING SOMEHOW

531
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,095
Lollipop. Swap hands.

532
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,963
Soap.

533
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,165
STRUGGLES AGAIN

534
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,366
You timed out.

535
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,368
I'm sorry, Jin-kyung.
I almost lost control.

536
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,903
-Did we do okay?
-She ate the soap.

537
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,137
We still did great.

538
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,740
Sae-ho was too preoccupied
to tap Jin-kyung for her mistakes.

539
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,409
-Let's leave that to someone else.
-That would be better.

540
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,510
-Did I hurt you?
-I'm good.

541
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,913
-I'll tap the player from behind.
-I freaked out for a second.

542
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,114
You'll have to see how they do.

543
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,383
-She did so well, though.
-I'm impressed.

544
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,051
You did an amazing job, Jin-kyung.

545
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,152
Does it get confusing?

546
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,854
-They both looked confused.
-Not at all.

547
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,390
What do you mean?
You took a huge bite here.

548
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,059
Then, why is there lipstick on the soap?

549
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,295
-She stopped midway before a big bite.
-I see.

550
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,864
-Jin-kyung will now hold the items.
-I hope we're getting a new set.

551
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,765
We prepared a bunch.

552
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,601
-A true couple would share, though.
-Of course.

553
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,436
I'll move my head just a tiny bit.

554
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,771
Let's give it a try. Soap.

555
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,310
HE LOOKS SO ANXIOUS
FOR SOME REASON

556
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,947
-Looks like strawberry-flavored ice cream.
-Why are you sniffing the lollipop?

557
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,682
That somehow looks more delicious.

558
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,884
Ready.

559
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,253
Set. Go.

560
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,789
Lollipop. Lollipop. Swap hands.

561
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,057
Soap.

562
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,592
Lollipop.

563
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,493
Lollipop.

564
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,095
Lollipop.

565
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,163
Lollipop.

566
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,165
Lollipop. Soap. Soap.

567
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,500
Soap. Soap.

568
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,568
Soap. Swap hands.

569
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,337
Soap.

570
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,738
Soap. Lollipop.

571
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,774
-Amazing.
-Lollipop. Soap. Lollipop.

572
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,009
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

573
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,510
HEH

574
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,145
Lollipop. Soap.

575
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,180
-Don't shove it in.
-Soap.

576
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,615
Lollipop. Soap.

577
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,916
See? She's shoving them all in!

578
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,719
SHE'S PUSHING BOTH ITEMS
INTO HIS MOUTH INDISCRIMINATELY

579
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,621
Soap. Soap.

580
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,223
IT'S CLEAR SHE'S DOING IT
ON PURPOSE NOW

581
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,259
-Soap.
-She's pushing the soap to his mouth.

582
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,394
-Jeez! She's not paying attention.
-Lollipop.

583
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,996
Remember, we're on the same team.

584
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,397
Swap hands. Go on.

585
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,298
Swap hands.

586
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,267
YOU THINK I CARE?

587
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,168
HERE'S WHAT WE THINK

588
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,505
WOO-YOUNG IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S PUTTING IN ANY EFFORT

589
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,641
AT ANY RATE,

590
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,110
THE GAME CONTINUES

591
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,412
-Soap. Soap.
-He said soap.

592
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,180
GO ON, EAT BOTH

593
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,883
CONGRATS, YOU GOT TO ENJOY THE
TASTE OF THE SOAP YOU ADMIRED

594
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,185
ENOUGH WITH THE SOAP!

595
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,788
Soap. Soap.

596
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,889
Soap.

597
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,226
Lollipop. Lollipop.

598
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,161
AS LONG AS WOO-YOUNG
LICKS THE SOAP,

599
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,929
EVERYTHING IS GOOD
FOR HIS CASTMATES

600
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,131
Lollipop.

601
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,066
Soap. Lollipop.

602
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,002
Soap. Soap. Soap.

603
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,103
Damn it!

604
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,105
Jin-kyung!

605
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,607
We're on the same team!

606
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,909
SHERRY HONG IS
DELIGHTED NONETHELESS

607
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,177
Let me ask one thing.

608
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,113
Is this supposed to be edible?

609
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,049
He practically ate it.

610
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,085
-This is insane.
-Gosh, that's hilarious.

611
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,688
You could say I ate a candy
that tastes like soap.

612
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,156
I honestly had one…

613
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,824
He might get soap bubbles soon.

614
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,892
AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

615
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,760
-I'm so screwed.
-The soap has gone mushy.

616
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,796
-I bombed that so badly.
-This isn't easy.

617
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,298
Jin-kyung has no interest in winning.

618
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,666
Maybe you should go brush your teeth.

619
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,601
-I already feel like I did it.
-Oh, yeah?

620
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,370
-Rinse your mouth with water.
-Okay.

621
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,639
A SWIG AND GARGLE

622
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,140
We might see bubbles forming.

623
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,209
Yeah, I see them.

624
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,344
Goodness.

625
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,745
What's gotten into you?

626
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,281
-Okay, now that I've done that…
-Do you feel better?

627
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,682
No, it feels the same.

628
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,486
THIS IS ALL JIN-KYUNG'S FAULT!

629
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,355
Let's roll.

630
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,723
NEXT UP ARE HYE-SEON AND SAE-HO

631
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:38,924
Ready, set, go.

632
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,460
Soap. Soap. Soap.

633
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,694
Lollipop.

634
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,062
Lollipop. Lollipop.

635
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,198
Lollipop. Swap hands.

636
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,367
WOW, SHE'S ON FIRE

637
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,636
-Lollipop. Soap. Lollipop.
-Neener.

638
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,938
-Soap.
-Neener.

639
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,872
Lollipop.

640
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,674
Soap. Soap.

641
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,577
Lollipop. Lollipop. Lollipop.

642
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,479
Swap hands. Lollipop.

643
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,780
Soap.

644
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,548
-Soap.
-Neener.

645
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,451
-This is tricky.
-Lollipop. Soap.

646
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,819
Soap.

647
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,322
HER TONGUE KEEPS FLICKING OUT
AT THE WRONG SIGNAL

648
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,157
FULL MELTDOWN

649
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,093
-What's up with her tongue?
-Lollipop.

650
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,728
Swap hands.

651
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,963
Soap.

652
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,332
PRACTICALLY
A SOAP HOLE-IN-THE-WALL

653
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,401
-Soap. Lollipop.
-She seems to like soap.

654
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,869
-I can see her tongue so well.
-Lollipop.

655
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,437
And that's a wrap.

656
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,407
-I've done a count of my own.
-Are you okay?

657
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,008
She licked the soap
more than the lollipop.

658
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,977
Dang, this is difficult.

659
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,311
-Really?
-She's had a lot of soap.

660
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,047
It tastes like the detergent bar
I tried as a kid.

661
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,315
Why did you try that?

662
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,618
Never bit into Cucumber Soap
to see if it'd taste like cucumber?

663
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:40,585
-What?
-Never?

664
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,854
-Goodness. You wondered that as a kid?
-Sure.

665
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,390
I'll show you how it's done.

666
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,459
Witness my power of concentration.

667
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,194
The comedian Cho Sae-ho that I know

668
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,129
-wouldn't half-ass this.
-I won't get it wrong.

669
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,764
-It's a cakewalk.
-He'd chew up the soap.

670
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,865
Nonsense. How could I?

671
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,200
The Sae-ho I know…

672
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,602
-Come on. I couldn't do that.
-…will take a huge bite.

673
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,237
Ready.

674
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,307
Set. Go.

675
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,241
Lollipop.

676
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,143
Lollipop. Lollipop.

677
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,311
Swap hands.

678
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,080
Soap. Soap. Soap.

679
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,949
Lollipop. Soap.

680
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,784
Lollipop. Lollipop.

681
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,152
Soap.

682
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,053
Soap.

683
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,788
Lollipop.

684
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,391
Lollipop. Lollipop. Lollipop.

685
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,926
Lollipop. Soap.

686
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,563
BITES IT

687
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,598
HE REALLY BIT INTO IT

688
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,333
Swap hands.

689
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,235
-Lollipop. Lollipop.
-He almost chewed it. He bit it.

690
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,504
Lollipop. Lollipop. Lollipop.

691
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,206
Soap. Soap.

692
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,106
Lollipop.

693
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,042
Lollipop. Soap.

694
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,977
BITING SOAP?
THAT'S NOTHING FOR HIM

695
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,813
SHOW HOST IS ALMOST HAVING
FITS OF LAUGHTER

696
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,748
Soap. Lollipop.

697
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,417
Soap. Lollipop.

698
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,819
Lollipop. Lollipop.

699
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,854
Lollipop.

700
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,989
Lollipop. Soap.

701
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,257
-This is rough.
-Soap.

702
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,226
-Soap. Soap.
-He said soap!

703
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,994
-Swap hands.
-I'm tearing up.

704
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,829
Lollipop. Soap.

705
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,398
Time's up.

706
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,835
-You two were neck and neck.
-He actually bit the soap.

707
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,737
You need some confidence.

708
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,706
-He did bite into the soap.
-No kidding.

709
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,407
-You can see the mark.
-The scent…

710
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,675
BITE MARK LEFT WITH CONFIDENCE

711
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,212
-How's this, Sook?
-You can bonk me here. I won't mind.

712
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,447
Now, Sook. Focus.

713
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,848
-I'll do that.
-The game's simple.

714
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,550
-I have to lick the lollipop…
-Exactly.

715
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,851
-…and smell this.
-That's it.

716
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,221
-Not interested in eating soap, are you?
-No, I wouldn't call myself human then.

717
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,357
Ready. Set.

718
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,958
-Go.
-Lollipop.

719
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,027
Lollipop. Lollipop.

720
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,562
-She's doing well.
-Lollipop. Soap.

721
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,498
Lollipop. Lollipop. Soap.

722
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,433
Soap. Soap.

723
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,269
Lollipop. Soap.

724
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,436
-She's good.
-Swap hands.

725
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,273
-She's doing so well.
-Man, she's grooving, all right.

726
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,141
Lollipop. Lollipop.

727
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,143
Soap. Lollipop.

728
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,378
Lollipop.

729
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,247
-Lollipop. Lollipop. Soap.
-Dang.

730
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,649
Swap hands.

731
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,651
PERFECT PARTNERSHIP

732
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,120
Soap. Lollipop.

733
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,123
-Lollipop. Soap.
-She's going to get it mixed up soon.

734
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,892
BACK TO HYPER-FOCUS MODE!

735
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,227
Lollipop.

736
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,461
Soap.

737
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,364
Soap. Lollipop. Swap hands.

738
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,600
-She's on a roll.
-Lollipop.

739
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,501
-Soap.
-Her time is up.

740
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,202
Man, she's done an excellent job.

741
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,637
She was like a master.

742
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,272
-She was amazing.
-I got in the zone.

743
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,541
-My goodness.
-This team did great.

744
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,410
-Let's keep this up.
-That was the best so far.

745
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,911
-Amazing concentration.
-Let's go.

746
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,647
-Please sit a bit closer.
-Here. Lollipop.

747
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:23,882
LET'S RUN A DRILL

748
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,750
Sniff. Lollipop. Sniff.

749
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,819
Sniff. Lollipop. Sniff. Okay.

750
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,821
-You have this bond.
-You bet we do.

751
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,390
-We've worked together for years.
-Right.

752
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,391
Now, ready.

753
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,760
-Set.
-Make it rough for them.

754
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:36,661
Go.

755
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,662
Lollipop.

756
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,331
Lollipop. Soap.

757
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,999
Lollipop. Soap.

758
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,033
Lollipop. Swap hands.

759
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,402
Soap.

760
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,637
Swap hands.

761
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,205
Lollipop.

762
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,974
Soap. Soap.

763
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,142
AS EXPECTED,
THEIR TEAMWORK IS FANTASTIC!

764
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,044
Soap. Swap hands.

765
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,146
-We're doing so well.
-Soap-pop.

766
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,316
-We're doing so well.
-Soap-pop.

767
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,417
WHAT WAS THAT?

768
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,785
-I meant lollipop.
-Hey.

769
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,754
Lollipop. Lollipop.

770
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,955
Soap. Soap.

771
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,191
Soap. Soap.

772
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,492
IS HE PERHAPS AN AI?

773
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,528
HIS RESPONSE IS IMMEDIATE
AND MATCHES THE COMMAND EXACTLY

774
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,630
Lollipop.

775
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,199
Soap. Soap. Lollipop.

776
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,234
Lollipop. Lollipop.

777
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,869
BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER

778
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:18,970
I'm sorry.

779
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,506
-I'm so sorry.
-They're a team, and that's on Sook.

780
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,208
Lollipop. Lollipop.

781
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,243
Soap-pop. Soap.

782
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,145
Soap. Lollipop.

783
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,581
EVEN A TACTICAL ATTACK DOESN'T
THROW THEM OFF THEIR GAME

784
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,616
That's it.

785
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,585
This team's good.

786
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,953
-That was pretty good.
-All right.

787
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,554
-Goodness.
-I was hyper-focused.

788
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,523
THE SCENT OF SOAP
LINGERS AFTERWARDS

789
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,624
This game's fun.

790
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,527
I'll now announce the results.

791
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,429
The winners of the Lollipop-Soap Game

792
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,765
are Sook and Woo-jae.

793
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,501
-All right, Woo-jae. We made it.
-We're safe.

794
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,004
You did pretty well. So we'll be okay.

795
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:53,905
Now, the losers.

796
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,507
-I'm sure second place is ours.
-Woo-young.

797
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,841
-Jin-kyung and Woo-young.
-No way.

798
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,144
-It's Hye-seon and Sae-ho.
-I didn't see that coming!

799
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,445
Jin-kyung did well, you see.

800
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,113
Hye-seon had a meltdown later in the game.

801
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,550
That's true. She licked the soap
far more than the lollipop.

802
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,086
That concludes all the games
prepared for today.

803
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,654
ALL GAMES COMPLETED!

804
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,356
Now,

805
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:15,293
we have prepared a delicious meal
for those of you going to Paradise.

806
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,462
Please enjoy it in a beautiful villa.

807
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,763
WHO WILL BE GOING TO PARADISE?

808
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,332
But I must remind you

809
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,269
that one couple will be going to Inferno.

810
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,473
-That will be the last-place cast member…
-Just one person, right?

811
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,409
…and the cast member
selected by the Love Kibitzers' votes.

812
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,977
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE
IF YOU'RE SELECTED

813
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,346
Now, I'll announce the ranks first.

814
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,249
Let's find out
the glorious winner of the day.

815
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,753
This person must've been desperate
to avoid being paired up.

816
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,088
It's Sook!

817
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,256
FINAL WINNER, SOOK

818
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,291
I'm the winner?

819
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,426
-You ranked first in total points.
-And how much were they?

820
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,028
She won 230 points in total.

821
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,896
-The first game secured your victory.
-It sure did.

822
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,099
-Right, you won 100 points in that one.
-That's right.

823
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,167
CONGRATULATIONS
ON REMAINING SINGLE

824
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,068
Good luck.

825
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,703
-Thanks.
-Next is the runner-up.

826
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,206
-This person secured 200 points.
-Sae-ho's getting ready.

827
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,007
-It's Sae-ho.
-Thank you.

828
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,542
RUNNER-UP, SAE-HO

829
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,044
Let's move on to third place.

830
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,345
Congrats, Woo-young.

831
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,947
THIRD PLACE, WOO-YOUNG

832
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,483
We have three people left.

833
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,385
Woo-jae, Hye-seon, and Jin-kyung,

834
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,920
you are the remaining trio.

835
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,589
I'll announce fifth place first.

836
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:18,890
Fifth place goes to Hye-seon.

837
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:19,824
FIFTH PLACE, HYE-SEON

838
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,259
She survived.

839
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,560
Yes, I made it.

840
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,529
Where does that leave me?

841
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,231
You're either in fourth or sixth place.

842
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:30,068
-So one of them placed dead last?
-It'll be either one of you.

843
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,204
The one headed to Inferno is…

844
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,573
Jin-kyung.

845
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,574
PFFT

846
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,976
Oh, dear.

847
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,480
She must've wanted to find love badly.

848
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,784
I couldn't take the guys seriously.

849
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,287
They had so many aspects

850
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,755
that shattered my hopes for romance.

851
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:55,126
I just can't wait to return to Hong Kong.

852
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,531
I just can't comprehend Korean culture.

853
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,234
I thought you ran THE KIMCHI.

854
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,402
HER MULTIVERSE IS FAILING!

855
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,105
Your brand is famous
for making excellent kimchi.

856
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,941
It seems I had trouble

857
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,743
adjusting to this new environment--

858
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,411
I hear it's perfect for the Korean palate.

859
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,147
It seems all the votes have been counted.

860
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,716
One of you received zero votes.

861
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,119
Everyone seems to agree
that this person doesn't suit Jin-kyung.

862
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,755
Congratulations, Sae-ho.

863
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,859
SAE-HO SECURES HIS TICKET
TO PARADISE!

864
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,029
HE'S ALMOST GLOATING NOW…

865
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,364
-Lighten up.
-Congrats.

866
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,167
-Come on, lighten up.
-How could he be so inconsiderate?

867
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,069
-Now, now. Let's lighten up.
-That's just rude.

868
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,537
I actually want to go.

869
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,605
You wanna go to Inferno?

870
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,540
I MEANT…

871
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,309
MY HOME…

872
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,611
For your information,

873
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,480
the person voted
as Jin-kyung's partner to Inferno

874
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,384
received 80% of the votes.

875
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,385
A whopping 80%?

876
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,687
-It's a lot.
-Yes, 80%.

877
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,922
The crew must've seen them
as a match made in heaven.

878
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,192
-That means most of the crew here, right?
-Exactly.

879
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,126
Soap.

880
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,428
COULD IT BE WOO-YOUNG,

881
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,597
HER OFF-AND-ON HUSBAND
FROM THE PAST LIFE?

882
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,632
-Swap hands. Go on.
-Did you hear him?

883
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,033
What are you chewing?

884
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,335
Bread.

885
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,136
COULD IT BE WOO-JAE?

886
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,738
THEIR ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS ANGLE
ISN'T GREAT,

887
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,806
BUT THEY HAVE CHEMISTRY

888
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,941
Love Kibitzers cast their votes

889
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,744
for the one they want to see
on a date with Jin-kyung.

890
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,614
I'll now announce the initials
of the person who won the votes.

891
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,319
Hey, our initials are almost the same.

892
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,555
Congratulations.

893
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,123
Mr. JWJ.

894
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,124
THAT'S JOO WOO-JAE

895
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,626
-It's not you.
-Am I safe?

896
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:36,995
Am I safe?

897
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,329
CACKLES

898
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,466
-Does that mean Woo-jae's her partner?
-Yeah, you're free.

899
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,469
WHAT A SHAME!

900
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,871
We're divorced anyway.

901
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,475
-Come on, let's have them sit close by.
-We'll give them some space.

902
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,644
-At least a couple came out of this.
-That's right.

903
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,714
-Congrats, you two.
-Look at Woo-jae's face. Look at him.

904
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,783
We have our final couple.

905
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,885
I hope their romance
becomes the real thing.

906
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,188
Hello, my name is Yuk Jun-seo.

907
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,858
Do you like wonton noodles?

908
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,626
No, my stomach gets upset
whenever I have them.

909
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,561
THEIR BACK-AND-FORTH
IS SO EXCITING, RIGHT?

910
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,463
Can we then relax by ourselves?

911
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,700
You should know that their date
will be live streamed for you.

912
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,903
-That sounds super fun.
-You went to such extreme lengths?

913
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,105
-Can we enjoy the show over a meal?
-That must be the case.

914
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,274
Anyhow, it's gotten dark.
Can they manage up on the hill?

915
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,411
I should mention that the place
is lit up beautifully at nighttime.

916
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,280
Why didn't you tell us sooner?
If we had known…

917
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,017
Had I known, I'd have done
whatever it took to be a couple.

918
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,253
-Tell me about it!
-I'd actually move in with her.

919
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,324
We prepared a little something.
Please wear this.

920
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,391
TRENDIEST ITEMS FOR THE PAIR

921
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,829
Korean dating shows are so amusing.

922
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,031
He's my mom's least favorite.

923
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,433
My mom doesn't like you either!

924
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,934
You can call her and ask right now.

925
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,803
-Kiss the girl.
-Kiss the girl.

926
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,638
-Kiss the girl.
-Enough of that.

927
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,473
AFTER A PERIOD OF DENYING
THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST…

928
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,041
I guess I was showing interest.

929
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,710
I think he's smitten with me.

930
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,079
THEY CAN'T HELP
BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR FEELINGS

931
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,882
AND NOW…

932
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,551
-So they're peanuts?
-I get it now.

933
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,952
It's quite nice.

934
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,253
They look good together.

935
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,688
I'm two billion won in debt.

936
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,123
Applause, please!

937
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,492
I'm hoping to hear great news!

938
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,095
-They look so good together.
-They look like a set now.

939
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,629
WE'LL ROOT FOR YOU TWO!

940
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,400
BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS
LIGHT UP THE FIELD

941
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,634
LIKE STARS IN THE NIGHT SKY

942
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,702
-Jin-kyung.
-Yeah?

943
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,204
PRE-DATE CHAT OVER COFFEE

944
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,639
I thought I should be up-front with you

945
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,775
before we get into anything.

946
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,613
I'm not sure if you heard me earlier,
but I have some debts.

947
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,949
I'm not bringing it up
to ask for your help.

948
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,752
Still, I thought you should know this.

949
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,889
My debt amounts to two billion won…

950
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,260
I thought the right thing to do
was to come clean before our date.

951
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,095
I also have two sons and one daughter.

952
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,097
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

953
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,832
I'll come clean too.

954
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,335
I have one daughter.

955
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,339
SOMEHOW,
THIS FACT ISN'T SO SHOCKING

956
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,974
That took a weight off my chest.

957
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,378
CANDOR BRINGS THE COUPLE CLOSER

958
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,615
I assume you've heard
of my ex's name earlier.

959
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,616
It's Joo Yun-fat.

960
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,151
-Joo Yun-fat?
-Yeah.

961
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,320
SWIG

962
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,555
He must've been an amazing guy.

963
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,792
He was always so busy.

964
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,493
-That can leave you lonely.
-Yeah.

965
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,562
HER LIFE'S STORY IS
FINALLY REVEALED

966
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,264
Work keeps me busy too.

967
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,032
NODS

968
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,600
NODS BACK

969
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,668
Your ex and I share last names.

970
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,874
SLURP

971
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,747
MAYBE THEY'RE FEELING SHY?

972
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:47,718
THE PAIR MERELY KEEPS ON
DRINKING COFFEE

973
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,987
They say every meeting is fateful.

974
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,722
I hope you'll enjoy the date.

975
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,191
If you say so.

976
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,192
Shall we, then?

977
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,628
Let's roll.

978
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,502
What's wrong?

979
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,838
You asked me out on a date.

980
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,340
Who, me?

981
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,541
THAT JERK…

982
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,642
Did you then think…

983
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,811
-I got it now. Let's go.
-…I'd spend time alone?

984
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,979
After you.

985
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,380
Must you keep joking around like this?

986
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,616
-I didn't mean--
-Come on, I've had enough.

987
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,585
NEVER-ENDING
CHILDISH LOVERS' QUARREL

988
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,420
I know everything, okay?

989
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,755
All those secret requests
to the crew for a shot with me…

990
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:25,756
On my life's savings,

991
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,259
-I never tried any of that.
-I know about the bribes too.

992
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,828
You're going way too far
to hide your feelings from me.

993
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,730
It's about time you gave up.

994
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,798
Let's get going now.

995
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,000
It's not funny, okay?

996
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:40,538
WHILE THESE TWO ARE HITTING OFF…

997
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,378
THE BEAUTIFUL PARADISE

998
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,480
WELCOMES THE NIGHTFALL

999
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,517
THREE SINGLES ARRIVE IN PARADISE

1000
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,718
They outdid themselves again.

1001
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,720
-Is something special here?
-It looks so fancy.

1002
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,522
Please come in.
Gosh, something smells nice.

1003
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,091
-Hot damn. That's pizza.
-I smell sauce.

1004
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,125
A spicy one.

1005
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,329
COZY AND COMFORTABLE SPACE

1006
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,999
-Gosh, it's lovely here.
-This is amazing.

1007
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,834
The air is so fresh here.

1008
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,869
-You've been here before?
-The facility's excellent.

1009
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,871
TRENDY INTERIOR DESIGN
ADDS A ROMANTIC TOUCH

1010
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,307
It'd be perfect for a couple's vacation.

1011
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,845
Look at this feast.
Hurry and cut up the pork cutlet.

1012
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,148
DELICIOUS FOOD IS ALSO PREPARED
TO RELIEVE YOUR HUNGER

1013
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,484
HERE'S YOUR SEAT
FOR THE INFERNO SHOW!

1014
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,320
Gosh, we've got the front row seats.
This is our own movie room.

1015
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,189
THIS SHOULD BE FUN

1016
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,691
ALL SET TO WATCH
THE LIVE STREAMED DATE

1017
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,092
This is so hilarious, isn't it?

1018
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,828
-How pretty.
-That's beautiful.

1019
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,330
The lights are dazzling.

1020
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,132
INFERNO IS LIT UP
WITH BRIGHT LIGHTS

1021
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,701
WHAT KIND OF DATE
WILL WE SEE TONIGHT?

1022
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,969
Excuse me.

1023
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,939
If someone jumps out at the current speed,
would they get hurt?

1024
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,175
-Come on, Woo-jae.
-Yes?

1025
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,544
Please, I've had enough
of your little jokes.

1026
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,012
You're hilarious.

1027
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,347
INFATUATION WILL MAKE YOU GIGGLE

1028
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,281
You think I'm joking?

1029
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,584
How long has it been
since you visited a place like this?

1030
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,419
I was here just last night
with another woman.

1031
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,921
That kind of joke is getting old.

1032
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,057
-You should just leave.
-Then…

1033
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,759
SUDDENLY ATTEMPTS TO RUN AWAY

1034
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,394
Get off now.

1035
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,762
Right this instant.

1036
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,265
Let's pick up some speed, please.

1037
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,666
-Get off right now.
-See here.

1038
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,401
-You're being contradictory.
-Get off already.

1039
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,036
Why can't you jump out anyway?

1040
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,772
If you can't leave me,
why do you keep making jokes?

1041
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,508
-I was just about to, but you--
-If you don't like me, get off now.

1042
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,410
It's going way too fast to do that.

1043
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,578
HE COULD DIE, JIN-KYUNG

1044
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,614
You can't even leave my side.

1045
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,649
How long are you going to
play hard to get?

1046
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,484
YOUR HEART IS AN ENIGMA

1047
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,052
BUT I WON'T GIVE UP JUST YET

1048
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,054
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU

1049
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:40,091
-By the way--
-Korea has many beautiful spots too.

1050
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,392
To be honest,

1051
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,528
I feel more offended
because this is a proper dating spot.

1052
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,531
Just how long do I have to humor you?

1053
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,901
My goodness. Would you look at that?

1054
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,570
IT IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AT NIGHT

1055
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,574
IT'S AS IF THE STARS
FOUND THEIR HOME ON EARTH

1056
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,810
Goodness. What's that?

1057
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,646
WHAT DID THE COUPLE FIND
AT THE FIRST DATING SPOT?

1058
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,582
-Hello.
-My goodness.

1059
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,584
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU

1060
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,653
-Can you say anything other than that?
-Hi.

1061
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,820
Hey there.

1062
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,788
Hi.

1063
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,390
-Hello.
-Your attention please.

1064
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:18,462
Your first mission is to take a selfie
with the parrot and the alpaca.

1065
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,898
Hey, Woo-jae. Go and take it.

1066
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,300
-You've got this.
-Hello!

1067
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,235
NOTICING JIN-KYUNG'S UNEASE,

1068
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,469
WOO-JAE STEPS UP

1069
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,271
Just act nonchalant, Jin-kyung.

1070
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,873
-Let it flap its wings or whatever.
-Hello!

1071
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,007
Let's take that selfie.

1072
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:36,047
APRIL 8TH, 2025
OUR FIRST DATE

1073
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,650
Look, the alpaca's adorable.

1074
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,420
HERE COMES
THE NEXT HEADLINER OF THE NIGHT

1075
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,587
So cute.

1076
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,756
-Can I feel its fur?
-Sure. Please pet it like this.

1077
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,959
-Hi. Aren't you a cutie?
-Hello. Gosh, your fur is so soft.

1078
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,830
THANKS TO THE CUTE ANIMALS,

1079
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,732
THEY COMPLETED
THE FIRST MISSION EASILY

1080
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,234
This way. There you go. Come on.

1081
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,570
So, how do you like me as the alpha male?

1082
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,873
SPEECHLESS

1083
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,342
What is he even saying?

1084
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,210
Am I manly enough for you?

1085
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,945
THE SLEAZY LINE RUINED
HIS HALF-BAKED CHARACTER

1086
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,247
Jeez. I can't even.

1087
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,482
Now, the couple's challenge.

1088
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,452
There are so many challenges
that couples must participate in.

1089
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,987
This is the Four-Cut Challenge.

1090
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,756
FORM ALPHABETS L, O, V, AND E
WITH YOUR PARTNER

1091
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:24,428
THE KEY POINT IS FOR THE COUPLE
TO FORM EACH LETTER

1092
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,330
OF THE WORD "LOVE"

1093
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,902
THEN, YOU'LL GET
A BEAUTIFUL SHOT LIKE THIS

1094
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,904
-They have a task?
-The couple's photo challenge.

1095
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,140
The one where they form
the word "Love" together, I think.

1096
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,877
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS?

1097
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,979
Do you have to sigh so deeply?

1098
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,647
You think I'm dying to do this?

1099
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,783
I didn't do that because of you.

1100
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,986
I merely breathe in and out deeply
to take in the fresh air.

1101
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,887
You're unbelievable.

1102
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,724
They're both hating it. I don't think
there's any affection between them.

1103
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,193
Why are they standing there, anyway?

1104
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,196
Their body language screams,
"We're arguing," doesn't it?

1105
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,564
SHE'S SPOT ON

1106
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,032
I mean, look at them.

1107
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,402
It looks like
the queen bee of a high school

1108
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,438
has a kid cornered,
demanding that he give her his money.

1109
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,874
And Woo-jae is the victim
who was just minding his business.

1110
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,777
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE DATE,
WE HAVE THIS FEAST HERE!

1111
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,278
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOD

1112
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,714
-Thank you for the food.
-We'll enjoy it.

1113
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,749
BIG BITE

1114
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,418
NOM

1115
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,585
It's good.

1116
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,888
-It's amazing.
-Let's have a toast with the coffee.

1117
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,055
Yeah, let's do that.

1118
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,358
-Guys, good work today.
-You too, Sae-ho.

1119
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,759
-Let's rest up now.
-Sounds great.

1120
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,295
The coffee's great.

1121
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,030
-I love the aroma.
-The coffee's excellent.

1122
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,800
It's really good.

1123
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,502
WHY BOTHER WITH DATES WHEN YOU
CAN NETFLIX AND ENJOY COFFEE?

1124
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,704
Alphabets L, O, V, and E?

1125
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,810
TO FORM AN "L," ONE OF THEM
MUST LIE ON THE GROUND

1126
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,078
Hey, can you do the push-up pose?

1127
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,114
-Why don't you do it?
-What?

1128
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,782
Do it yourself!

1129
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,951
IT SEEMS…
THIS IS A PROPER HELL FOR THEM

1130
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,353
Seriously, how on earth
are you going to manage in this world?

1131
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,622
She says she can't do the push-up pose.

1132
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,291
Don't guys usually do that?

1133
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,228
That should be settled
between the two of you.

1134
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,397
How will you survive, Woo-jae?

1135
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,699
Is the push-up pose too much for you?

1136
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,000
-Must I do that myself?
-Fine.

1137
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,535
I'll do that.

1138
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,939
Can't we watch Single's Inferno instead?

1139
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:15,973
Good idea.

1140
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,709
-Must we keep this on?
-Tteokbokki.

1141
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,744
Having to watch them
feels like punishment.

1142
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,646
I'd much rather watch
Single's Inferno too.

1143
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,181
Stand there facing this direction.

1144
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,951
DON'T BE ALARMED, WE'RE ADDING
ROMANTIC TUNES TO SET THE MOOD

1145
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,119
-What the heck?
-With my hands here…

1146
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,754
Why is he in a push-up pose?

1147
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,022
Get it right, okay?

1148
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,924
I can't do this again.

1149
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,026
Three, two, one.

1150
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,930
"L" MARKS THE START
OF THEIR LOVING RELATIONSHIP

1151
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,032
They're doing
all the typical stuff couples do.

1152
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,401
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ALPHABET

1153
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,970
Forming an "O" is a challenge.

1154
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,507
-You have to jump, you see.
-So that challenge

1155
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,275
isn't about taking simple four photos.

1156
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,144
Three, two, one.

1157
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,113
WOO-JAE'S
GENTLE AND SWEET LESSON

1158
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,781
TIME FOR A REALITY CHECK

1159
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,849
We can't do this.

1160
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,218
My thighs are out of order.

1161
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,987
Still, let's do this.

1162
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,355
STILL, THEY TRY AGAIN

1163
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,291
Kick your legs to the front
as you jump, okay?

1164
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,692
Three, two, one.

1165
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:10,895
AN "O" MARKS THE MILESTONE

1166
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,496
OF OVERCOMING
THEIR FIRST TRIAL TOGETHER

1167
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,831
Let's do the V.

1168
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,798
Get it right, okay?

1169
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,034
Three, two, one.

1170
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,170
Let's try again.

1171
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,405
SOMETHING'S OFF

1172
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,840
Three, two, one.

1173
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,746
-With this, we can only get a Y.
-No way.

1174
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,148
Let's cut some corners.

1175
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,816
Those watching us

1176
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,652
-aren't particularly invested.
-I do know

1177
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,954
-that this is something of a filler.
-It's the same

1178
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,990
for both us and the crew here.

1179
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,327
You told me your mother
doesn't like me, remember?

1180
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,696
But I like her all the same.

1181
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,131
What?

1182
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,866
Come on, not like that.

1183
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,067
CRACKS UP

1184
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,936
-What's up with you?
-No, wait.

1185
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,471
-Don't make it all weird.
-I didn't mean it like that.

1186
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,840
Why would you bring up
my mother in the first place?

1187
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,542
-I meant that I think of her fondly.
-Hey, you.

1188
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,611
-My mom is in love with my dad.
-I can do that, can't I?

1189
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,146
Of course I know that.

1190
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,248
The point is
that you told me she disliked me.

1191
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:07,051
I was lying back then
when I said my mom didn't like you.

1192
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,322
I wasn't lying, though.

1193
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,159
Are they arguing or what?
Is this a proper date?

1194
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,695
-We're not making a Y.
-Got it.

1195
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,729
-Our goal's a V.
-Sure.

1196
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,665
SHE'S BOUND TO
TILT HER HEAD ONLY

1197
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,701
Three, two, one.

1198
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,070
Three, two, one.

1199
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:26,971
WITHOUT WARNING

1200
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,707
WOO-JAE'S INITIATIVE CREATES
A PERFECT "V"

1201
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,342
LOL

1202
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,210
We got the perfect shot, didn't we?

1203
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,746
Yeah, it's perfect. Good job.

1204
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,715
THE LAST ALPHABET, "E"

1205
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,782
You can sit down, Jin-kyung.

1206
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,452
-I can't sit down because of my skirt.
-Just sit down on the floor.

1207
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,487
What's more,
I can't ruin the sponsored item.

1208
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,255
In that case…

1209
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,624
You can do this pose.

1210
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,563
HEH

1211
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,831
If you ask me,

1212
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,367
this episode will put you
in my mom's bad books.

1213
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,402
LOL

1214
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,603
Can we call your mother

1215
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,739
and ask her if she likes me or not?

1216
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,307
She'll obviously say she likes you.

1217
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,443
My clothes are sponsored items too,
but I'll sit on the ground anyhow.

1218
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,350
THE FINAL "E"
THEY BARELY FORMED TOGETHER

1219
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,419
They don't look close at all.

1220
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,187
They look like a long-standing couple

1221
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,256
who lost their spark altogether.

1222
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,791
But they'd know each other inside out.

1223
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,226
That's typical for long-term couples.

1224
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,161
-Are we done?
-Yeah, we're done.

1225
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,498
-Finally. I'm so tired.
-I'm not even curious about the clips.

1226
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,433
STILL, WE HAVE TO SEE THEM

1227
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,584
LET OUR LOVE LAST FOREVER

1228
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,621
-This amazing sight is wasted on you.
-I can't wait to go home.

1229
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,891
THIRD MISSION
HEART-RACING DATE

1230
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,459
What's this?

1231
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,894
WHAT'S THIS "HEART-RACING DATE"?

1232
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,062
What the…

1233
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,331
THEY FINALLY WENT TOO FAR…

1234
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,302
ONE WOMAN IS GETTING WARMED UP,
WAITING FOR THE COUPLE

1235
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,304
DOESN'T SHE LOOK FAMILIAR?

1236
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,706
I thought Hye-seon left for home.

1237
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,575
Welcome to Heart-Racing Date!

1238
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,878
Gosh, Hye-seon stayed behind!

1239
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,480
AFTER MAKING
THE BOLD DECLARATION

1240
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,948
NOT TO REMAIN IN THE BUBBLES,

1241
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,884
SHE FOUND A WAY TO LEVERAGE
HER EXCEPTIONAL STRENGTH

1242
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,453
NAMELY, BECOMING A TRAINER

1243
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,887
SPECIALIZING
IN TRAMPOLINE WORKOUT

1244
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:25,923
Come on in!

1245
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,293
FINAL LEG OF THE JOURNEY
HEART-RACING JUMPING DATE

1246
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,098
THESE TWO CAN'T CURSE ON CAMERA

1247
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:38,035
-Seriously, guys.
-Come on! May your love burn forever more.

1248
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,371
Can't we please go home now?

1249
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,840
SHE'S STILL FULL OF ENERGY

1250
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,343
What has trampoline
got to do with romantic dates?

1251
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,678
WHY IS JIN-KYUNG
COMING IN ALONE?

1252
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,379
Where did your man go?

1253
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,347
WHERE'S HER DATE?

1254
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,548
Hey, you little punk!

1255
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,751
Where did you run off to?

1256
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,954
-Joo Woo-jae!
-Where has he disappeared to?

1257
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,823
GOTCHA

1258
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,992
So this is the "Heart-Racing Date."

1259
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,894
Oh, so it's the grand finale.

1260
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,963
I wondered what they meant
by "heart-racing."

1261
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,767
-This should get your heart racing.
-For real, too.

1262
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,469
That will get your heart pumping.

1263
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,973
Get up on the trampoline!

1264
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,242
LET'S DO THIS, GUYS

1265
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,410
SUPER-JAZZED
TO TRAIN HER FIRST-EVER CLIENTS

1266
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,881
Let's get your heart pumping.
Welcome to Heart-Racing Date!

1267
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,751
-We're watching Netflix's Screwballs live.
-Welcome.

1268
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,987
I'm so grateful I didn't get paired up.

1269
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,822
That training puts you through hell.

1270
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,491
I'm getting sudden flashbacks
from that nightmare.

1271
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,059
I was exhausted after that.

1272
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,229
Like I said, what does this
have to do with a couple's date?

1273
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,365
Let's see what gets your hearts
racing the fastest.

1274
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,569
Check if your hearts race this much
when you look at your partner.

1275
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,038
The trampoline trainers
will keep you company.

1276
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,439
Let's do this. Hey!

1277
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,575
HEART-RACING JUMPING DATE BEGINS

1278
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,511
HEY! HO!

1279
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,481
YOUNG COUPLE IN EARLY STAGES OF
LOVE IS BOOSTING HER DRIVE

1280
00:46:58,415 --> 00:46:59,316
Come on!

1281
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,553
You two!

1282
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,857
Here, I love you.

1283
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,258
HOW CAN I MAKE THEM
FALL IN LOVE?

1284
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,894
Turn around and show each other
the heart hands. Go on!

1285
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,830
HESITATING

1286
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,333
SHY EXCHANGE OF HEARTS

1287
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,601
Face each other properly!

1288
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,836
THEY HURRIEDLY FORM
BIGGER HEARTS

1289
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,970
AT HYE-SEON'S ROARING COMMAND

1290
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,006
THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF AFFECTION

1291
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,975
HAVE CERTAINLY GROWN
BOLDER THAN BEFORE

1292
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,376
Hey, four!

1293
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,878
THAT'S A NEW POSE

1294
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,613
Jeez, I remember that!

1295
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,615
-That puts you through a living hell.
-It sure does.

1296
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,983
You can taste blood in your mouth.

1297
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,385
You can even lose control of your bowels.

1298
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,054
Place your hands like this.

1299
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,121
Lower your torso.

1300
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,726
JUMP, EVERYBODY, JUMP!

1301
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,862
May your love bloom!

1302
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,663
May your hearts soar!

1303
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,831
Come on!

1304
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,533
I'm exhausted.

1305
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,335
This is the worst!

1306
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,770
THAT WON'T DO,
LET'S ADD MUSIC AGAIN

1307
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:57,875
THEY'RE TOO SHY
TO LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER

1308
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,211
ON THIS FIRST-EVER
WORKOUT TOGETHER

1309
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,748
-Raise the wind and fly like the gods!
-I wanna go home!

1310
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,049
Please let us go home!

1311
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,818
Again!

1312
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,356
THEY'RE WATCHING A DATING SHOW,
NOT A HORROR MOVIE

1313
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,692
THE UNIQUE,
ONE-OF-A-KIND NIGHTTIME DATE

1314
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,397
THEY EVEN REST
IN A SIMILAR POSE NOW

1315
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,299
Are your hearts beating?

1316
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,434
That's normal for all living people.

1317
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,869
Are they beating harder than usual?

1318
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,405
-So?
-Let me ask you this.

1319
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,408
Why are you forcing
our hearts to work overtime?

1320
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,912
-Exercise brings up your heart rate.
-But you're forcing it to happen.

1321
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,113
It's a natural progression.

1322
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,881
-Face your partner…
-Excuse me.

1323
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,082
Who's that on screen?

1324
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,688
The banner says, "Half-ass a session,
and you're dead meat."

1325
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,856
All right, then.

1326
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,157
Please face each other.

1327
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,393
Gaze into your partner's eyes.

1328
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,295
Hold hands.

1329
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,131
Now, place your feet apart.
Remember the proper pose for a squat?

1330
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,599
You do squats regularly, don't you?

1331
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,668
Look into each other's eyes
as you do them.

1332
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,069
One, two.

1333
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,571
THEY'RE BEING ASKED
TO DO SO MUCH

1334
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,374
Let your love grow stronger!
Don't let the hands go!

1335
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,376
Let's do the squats. One, two…

1336
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,879
HERE WE GO…

1337
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,981
…five. You're missing the beats!

1338
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,351
MS. TRAINER GETS RIGHT UP CLOSE

1339
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,119
Keep your eyes level.

1340
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,221
HERE'S IN-YOUR-FACE
COACHING SERVICE

1341
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,990
TO BRING THE COUPLE CLOSER

1342
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,258
Keep your spine neutral!

1343
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,494
ISN'T THIS TIRING, WOO-JAE?

1344
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,999
NO, NOT WHEN
I'M HOLDING YOUR HANDS

1345
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,736
WITH THE RIGHT JAM,
IT LOOKS LIKE COUPLE'S PARADISE

1346
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,672
BUT WITHOUT IT,
IT'S THE COUPLE'S LIVING HELL

1347
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,774
What is this mess?

1348
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,445
-Thank goodness we avoided that.
-I feel so blessed right now.

1349
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,613
I'm so happy.

1350
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,284
What did you find so appealing about me?

1351
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,153
Oh, no. I shouldn't let
my feelings show just yet.

1352
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,356
THRILL FROM THE INITIAL MEETING
WAS AS SWEET AS CANDY

1353
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,060
BUT LOVE CAN SOUR
AND TASTE LIKE SOAP SOMETIMES

1354
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,329
You'll be going back to the studio
for your new album, right?

1355
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,732
-You have a shoot tomorrow, don't you?
-Good luck!

1356
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,935
GLORIOUS SINGLES NAVIGATE
THEIR LIVES TO FIND HAPPINESS

1357
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,037
Next, let yourself go and go crazy!

1358
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,372
Are you ready?

1359
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,807
Are you ready to embrace love?

1360
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,342
-Sure!
-Answer me.

1361
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,244
Ready. Go!

1362
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,179

DOESN'T MAKE

1366
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,152
YOUR HEART RACE ANYMORE,
CONTACT HER

1367
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,787
SHE'LL GET YOUR HEART POUNDING

1368
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,022
LIKE WHEN YOU HAD
YOUR FIRST KISS

1369
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,657
YOU MAY ENTER
ETERNAL REST, THOUGH…

This year marks Sook's 30th year
in the showbiz industry.

1373
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,804
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

1374

00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,319
AMAZING SET OF GUESTS

1381
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,821
THEY GET CARRIED AWAY…

1382
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,189
-That's incorrect.
-Dang it!

1383
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,925
…OR GROW SHAMELESS

1384
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,693
