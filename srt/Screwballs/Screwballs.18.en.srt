1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,537
A LUSH, GREEN SUMMER DAY IN JULY

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,506
ALWAYS FILLS YOU UP WITH HOPE

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,976
LET'S RETURN TO 1995,
THE YEAR JUST AS FULL OF HOPE

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,950
My heart grew so heavy

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,920
DON'T TELL US YOU DRESSED UP
AS SEO TAIJI

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,490
HOW DISRESPECTFUL IS THIS?

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,058
I apologize.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,029
TODAY'S DRESS CODE: REPLY 1995

9
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,865
WHAT ON EARTH?

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,566
SHAKY AND SKINNY LEGS

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,635
Who's he, though?

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,837
Can you show us your thing?

13
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,106
WHO EXACTLY IS
WOO-JAE PORTRAYING?

14
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,108
If the thought

15
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,010
That you're all alone

16
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,312
-Turn around
-Lee Jae-hoon from Cool, right?

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,414
I like it.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,882
LEE JAE-HOON WOULD BE CONFUSED

19
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,818
COOL AND SEO TAIJI
REIGNED THE CHART BACK THEN

20
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,654
LET'S GO WATCH THE TV SHOW,
K-POP TOP 10

21
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,089
-I'm exhausted.
-Hey, Jae-hoon.

22
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,791
-Hey, guys!
-Shoot, what on earth?

23
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,526
Here's my sword.

24
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,727
Here!

25
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,795
ICON OF INNOCENCE

26
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,296
-Go play somewhere else.
-Sae-ho.

27
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,799
For a little kid, he sure is ripped.

28
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,333
-Come on, Sae-ho!
-Gosh!

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,036
Doesn't this kid look like
he'd love ladies a bit too much?

30
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,404
Woo-jae…

31
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,506
Tell us a bit about your looks of the day.

32
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,476
When the crew told me
that today's theme would be 1995…

33
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,877
-Is that you back in 1995?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,779
-I was actually in kindergarten then.
-Really?

35
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,349
"Nobody for Deungchon-dong?
Then we're rolling."

36
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,684
"Nobody for Deungchon-dong?"

37
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,686
-Excuse me.
-"Then we're rolling."

38
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,354
Could you give us a minute?

39
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,623
The crew told me to join you.

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,559
-They clearly told me to, okay?
-Lee Young-ja?

41
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,828
-Can we see it again?
-You're her, right?

42
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,130
Please do the impression again.
One, two, three, four.

43
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,366
"Nobody for Deungchon-dong?
Then we're rolling."

44
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,568
It's been forever.

45
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,403
-Totally.
-Beep-beep, honk-honk

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,138
-Beep-beep, honk-honk
-Beep-beep, honk-honk

47
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,706
YOUR MUSCLES STILL REMEMBER
THE MOVES

48
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,174
-I'm so tired.
-Beep-beep, honk-honk

49
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,476
Why is the intro so draining today?

50
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,543
Just a second.

51
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,145
Aren't you the one

52
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,280
-who was late for Sun-hui's wedding?
-You're right.

53
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,615
-Yeah, I was.
-It's him.

54
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,951
APRIL 2025 VS. FEBRUARY 2024

55
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,353
WOO-YOUNG AND WOO-JAE
PROMISED TO PERFORM "MY HOUSE"

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,855
AS USUAL AT A WRITER'S WEDDING

57
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,556
BUT WOO-YOUNG'S
OTHER ENGAGEMENT RAN LATE

58
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,359
…Woo-young is getting delayed
because of the traffic jam.

59
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,462
In the meantime,
Woo-jae offered to perform alone.

60
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,065
Please take videos if you can.

61
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,100
If Woo-jae does mess up,

62
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,735
please share that part online.

63
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,804
-I'd appreciate it.
-Excuse me?

64
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,240
-If it happens, that is. It's fun.
-I see.

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,642
WOO-JAE IN
HIS ANIME MALE LEAD ERA

66
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,410
HAD AN IMPROMPTU
SOLO PERFORMANCE

67
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,880
WOO-YOUNG ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER

68
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,548
AND DID HIS BEST
FOR THE NEWLYWEDS…

69
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

70
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,418
APOLOGIZING FOR THE NTH TIME

71
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,053
ON THE SHOOT THE DAY AFTER
THE WEDDING

72
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,655
I'm sorry for being late, Sun-hui.

73
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,323
She won't get to have any of that.

74
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,825
I'm so sorry… Why?

75
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,027
Because she's not here.
She's on her honeymoon.

76
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,095
AND SHE'S RIGHT

77
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,596
She won't get to eat any of that.

78
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,765
But she's my top priority today.

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,568
TURNS HER BACK ON HIM

80
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,038
Sun-hui, I'm so sorry
I didn't get there in time.

81
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,407
Turns out I timed my apology
way too early this time.

82
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,643
-Oh, no. Sun-hui.
-Come back home

83
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,478
I'll treat you to a meal later.

84
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,114
So, the dress code for today's shoot is…

85
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,282
Please tell us.

86
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,651
Today's theme is "Reply 1995."

87
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,586
Can you kick us off, Sae-ho?

88
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,987
Let's revisit 1995.

89
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,990
I was in seventh grade,

90
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,126
and I was a big fan of Seo Taiji and Boys.

91
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,427
That's why

92
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,864
I recreated his look when he promoted
his song, "Come Back Home."

93
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,501
The song "Come Back Home"
had the whole country

94
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,670
-in deep shock.
-Come back home

95
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,005
The music and the dance
were so groundbreaking.

96
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,273
-Exactly.
-They had us stunned.

97
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,009
The short dance moves
for the intro were sensational.

98
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,312
One, two, three. Get in there.

99
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,647
One member would pass through
the arm hoop like this.

100
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,182
-I still recall the moves.
-Me too.

101
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,652
I'm dressed up
as the God of trust fund babies.

102
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,154
He was the original pretty boy.

103
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,223
-Cool's Lee Jae-hoon.
-He was indeed a pretty boy.

104
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,826
I still remember the details
of how he wore his suit.

105
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,062
-The collars were laid over the lapels.
-That's right.

106
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,396
You could see them clearly.

107
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,465
-That's how it was in 1995.
-Back in 1995,

108
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,168
I took part in a skit
in the SBS show, Our Happy Saturday.

109
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,571
"Nobody stopping here?
Then we're rolling." That line blew up.

110
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,340
-What a legend.
-It gave her instant success.

111
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,609
Some might not know
this side of Jin-kyung's career,

112
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,010
-especially the young.
-But not me.

113
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,312
-A-list actors made guest appearances…
-Sure.

114
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,647
-…for an interview with her.
-Right.

115
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,817
While I was doing all that,
Woo-young here was in kindergarten.

116
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,884
How old were you?

117
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,720
I was six years old.

118
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,854
-My gosh.
-I know.

119
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,422
-So there's a huge age gap.
-Right.

120
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,825
Says much about my young soul, right?

121
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,494
I have fun with these guys no problem.

122
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,162
We're basically like peers, aren't we?

123
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,798
Sometimes you seem more immature than me.

124
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,334
SHE'S AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE

125
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,869
WHERE YOU GET EXCITED
ABOUT BUBBLES

126
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,704
I should ask for your understanding first.

127
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,341
I've had slight health issues recently…
That's my fault, of course.

128
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,245
My lymph nodes up here got inflamed,
so I had surgery.

129
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,313
-For real?
-For sure.

130
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,048
-So I might not--
-Surgery, huh?

131
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,816
I can walk just about fine,

132
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,552
but I can't take a direct hit here.

133
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,354
-A running competition is also--
-Hold on.

134
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,757
-You should be careful.
-We're all professionals, right?

135
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,259
So what's with the excuses?
They'd edit them anyway.

136
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,761
-I only--
-Why should the viewers care?

137
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,763
We're all out of sorts, aren't we?

138
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,231
I'm a wreck myself.

139
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,899
-I need to poop.
-Here's my suggestion.

140
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,000
ARE YOU AN AMATEUR OR WHAT?

141
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,468
WE'RE ALL PROFESSIONALS,
AREN'T WE?

142
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,770
A SUDDEN PITY PARTY

143
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,471
You don't seem to believe me,

144
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,573
so I'll show it to you for five minutes.

145
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,142
I meant the surgery scar.

146
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,543
-Don't talk him out of it.
-I won't.

147
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,212
And blow our precious second chance
Netflix gave us?

148
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,981
I'm just so upset you won't believe me.

149
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,016
-Would you believe me…
-It was your fault like you said.

150
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,685
…if I showed you my surgery scar?

151
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,019
-Let's see it.
-Come here, Jin-kyung.

152
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,487
-Come here, Jin-kyung.
-All right.

153
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,656
-Wait, what?
-I meant it.

154
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,659
YOU'RE WATCHING SCREWBALLS,
THE REFINED VARIETY SHOW

155
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,162
-He has a huge bandage on his thigh.
-So I hear.

156
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,663
It had bloodstains too.

157
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,532
I hear physical activities are off-limits.

158
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,167
That's why…

159
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,568
we're parting ways with Sae-ho.

160
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,769
What?

161
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,705
-"Parting ways"? You're firing me?
-Good.

162
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,341
What are you thinking?
You think I'd leave alone?

163
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,643
-A key trait of our show…
-And?

164
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,345
-…is physical activities.
-Is that right?

165
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:49,148
Then, I'll do my part
by delivering top-grade banter today.

166
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,584
Jin-kyung can play all the games
that Sae-ho can't today.

167
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,187
IGNORES HIM

168
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,490
I actually have a request to make of you.

169
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,326
To tell you the truth,
this episode happens to mark

170
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,462
-the beginning of our show's new season.
-What?

171
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,896
-What do you mean?
-Really?

172
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,231
FOR REAL?

173
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,966
Here's to hoping the show will soar again.

174
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,635
Does that mean we've secured
an order for the second season?

175
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,705
-We survived, then.
-We just need to do our best as usual?

176
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,974
-Understood.
-All right.

177
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,143
-I'll leave the show in your good hands.
-Applause!

178
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,277
PLEASE KEEP SUPPORTING US

179
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,645
Let's greet the viewers again.

180
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,214
-Okay. Thank you.
-Seriously? A bow?

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,548
Thank you.

182
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,783
Please excuse me.

183
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,551
I can't go down lower than this.

184
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,854
Where's our angler, anyway?

185
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,956
-Right, one of your costars is missing.
-Where is… Yeah.

186
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,292
She's currently shooting
an episode of Same Bed, Different Dreams.

187
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,527
So she wasn't available?

188
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,795
ARE WE REPLACING HER?

189
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,431
We scheduled a shoot
when Sook couldn't join you…

190
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,666
-Her absence is notable, by the way.
-…for a reason.

191
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,169
-I'll tell you today's theme first.
-Let's hear it.

192
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,039
It's "Celebration
of the 30th Year in Sook's Career."

193
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,742
-So we got here early to prepare for it?
-That's right.

194
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,245
I sort of caught on, you see.

195
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,514
She debuted in 1995.

196
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,182
-Isn't that right?
-It is.

197
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,551
We celebrated
Jin-kyung's 30th anniversary on Beat Coin.

198
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,919
-We sure did.
-Right.

199
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,087
Has it been two years already?

200
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,589
We should also note that July 6th…

201
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,657
-It's her birthday.
-Yeah?

202
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,226
It happens to be Sook's birthday, yes.

203
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,963
You must complete certain tasks
before Sook joins us.

204
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,299
We're going to prepare a surprise for her.

205
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:18,371
Namely, "Roped-In Special Envoys
for Sook's 30th Anniversary."

206
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,639
"Special envoys"?

207
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,442
Sook will be joining us

208
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,343
around 7:00 p.m.

209
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,847
Before then, please recruit special guests

210
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,451
to celebrate Sook's 30th anniversary
with us right on this very spot

211
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,718
and go meet them.

212
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,554
We have to meet them too?
To do what, exactly?

213
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,089
You'll shoot a video of them
congratulating Sook

214
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,692
and carry out a group mission.

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,961
If you successfully complete the mission,

216
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,498
we'll give you funds you can use
to prepare for the celebration.

217
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,899
What about our guests?

218
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,769
Do they shoot a video,
tackle the mission, and leave?

219
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,305
-That's how Korean variety shows are.
-I have a suggestion.

220
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,141
-Who is it?
-Their name will surely amaze anyone.

221
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,710
-We have high hopes for you, Sae-ho.
-We sure do.

222
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,846
I still remember the 900 guests
at your wedding.

223
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,882
-Sae-ho, do us a solid here.
-Hey.

224
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,950
How's G-Dragon?

225
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,252
Unfortunately, he happens to be on a tour.

226
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,320
He's in Japan.

227
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,888
-We could get there, though.
-Jin-kyung.

228
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,190
If he's okay with it,
we can land at Haneda Airport in Tokyo

229
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,658
in 2 hours 30 minutes.

230
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,726
He's having a concert,

231
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,562
so it'd be almost 11:00 p.m.
by the time he's finished.

232
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,264
-We can't wait for so long.
-That's true.

233
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,199
It'd help to have a global star, right?

234
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,400
For instance, Jennie.

235
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,969
-Wow.
-My gosh.

236
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,437
-How does it sound?
-You got her number?

237
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,372
-Can I ask her?
-You sound so confident, though.

238
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,140
Are we sure we can host her?

239
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,244
SHE TOOK OUT HER PHONE!

240
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,116
Why are you putting your phone away
after asking us if we'd like to have her?

241
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,352
I was only checking
if you'd be okay with her coming here.

242
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,920
GOES OVER THE CONTACT LIST

243
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,622
Okay. How's Jae-seok?

244
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,857
IMAGE SOURCE: ANTENNA
JAE-SEOK?!

245
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,759
Don't bother Jae-seok.

246
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,694
He's a busy guy.

247
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,597
I'll make a call first.
I wonder how you'd feel about this person.

248
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,698
Is it Jennie?

249
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,102
-Shall I, then?
-But you just told me not to bother him.

250
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,638
-She's securing her airtime.
-Let's bother him.

251
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,006
JAE-SEOK'S FAVORITES ARE ANXIOUS

252
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,374
-I'm hitting the button.
-She did it.

253
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,441
Fine, then.

254
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,745
THIS PERSON WAS FAKE YU JAE-SEOK

255
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,580
Wouldn't he be super busy on Sundays?

256
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,049
-I think it's his day off.
-Hey, Jin-kyung.

257
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,617
HE PICKED UP!

258
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,952
-Jae-seok.
-What's up?

259
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,020
How are you?

260
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,087
I'm good.

261
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,823
Where… If you don't mind me asking,
where are you at the moment?

262
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,093
-Why do you ask?
-Just because.

263
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,996
I always want to know
everything about you.

264
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,299
I get it. You're on camera, aren't you?

265
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,200
CRACKING UP

266
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,502
One breath can tip him off.

267
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,537
-Hi, Jae-seok.
-Hello!

268
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,806
-This is Woo-jae.
-Hello, this is Woo-young.

269
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,141
Oh, you're shooting Screwballs.

270
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,976
-That's right.
-Yeah, we're doing Screwballs.

271
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,546
We'd like to see you for a minute
and ask for your advice.

272
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,515
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

273
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,950
-I'm afraid…
-We're listening.

274
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,451
…I'm with my family at the moment.

275
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,619
Oh, really?

276
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,987
OH, WE GET IT

277
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,889
Where exactly are you?

278
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,190
PFT

279
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm in Gangwon-do.

280
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,293
My gosh, that sounds lovely.

281
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,494
Trains can take us there, no?

282
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,330
Sure, it's lovely in Gangwon-do.

283
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,800
Whereabouts in Gangwon-do again?
Is it near Cheorwon?

284
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:01,934
-But guys.
-Wonju?

285
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,569
You can't come this far.

286
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,504
I'll be returning to Seoul soon.

287
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,708
BY THE TIME THEY GET THERE,
HE'LL BE RETURNING TO SEOUL

288
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,076
LET'S LAUGH IT OFF

289
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,646
-Since we got to talking…
-What is it?

290
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,749
Woo-jae's having an issue, you know.
He's in a bit of a scandal.

291
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,017
Really?

292
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,385
-Please tell us.
-What's it about?

293
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,953
He's acting like a big shot singer.

294
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,021
HIS COVER WENT VIRAL

295
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,857
-I'll sort him out, Jae-seok.
-I've never acted that way.

296
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,092
He seemed that way to me too.

297
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,294
I'll talk sense into him, Jae-seok.

298
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,362
All right, Jin-kyung.

299
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,330
-Give him an earful.
-Sure, count on me.

300
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,200
-Make sure to get the point across to him.
-I will do that.

301
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,868
When's your ETA for Nonhyeon-dong?

302
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,070
-Nonhyeon-dong?
-Yeah.

303
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
I can't say for sure.

304
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,607
But your call is making me feel like

305
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,442
I'll have to take lots of detours.

306
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,912
-I'll call you again, Jae-seok.
-All right.

307
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,748
-Goodbye.
-Have a great time!

308
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,216
THANK YOU, MR. YU JAE-SEOK

309
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,218
Shall I try calling this guy?

310
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,953
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

311
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,988
Who is it? He's a fine choice.

312
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,390
It's Lee Soo-hyuk.

313
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,392
-He's more than fine.
-Would he be available?

314
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,926
If he says he has time for us,

315
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,194
we can go to him, right?

316
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,730
Yeah. We have some time until 7:00 p.m.

317
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,432
Would he… Here goes nothing.

318
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,503
CALLING SOO-HYUK

319
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,570
CALL CUT OFF

320
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,173
What on earth? What's wrong with my phone?

321
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,808
Give me a second. I think it's my phone.

322
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,210
THE SECOND-HAND EMBARRASSMENT
IS KILLING THE VIEWERS TOO

323
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,445
TRIES CALLING SOO-HYUK AGAIN

324
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,380
-Hello? Hi, Sae-ho.
-Hey, Soo-hyuk.

325
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,715
I think my phone glitched.

326
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,917
I was in a recording booth,
and I needed a minute to get out.

327
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,519
So that's why you declined the call.

328
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,020
-That's why.
-You're recording something?

329
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,256
Yeah, I was recording
some ADR lines for a film.

330
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,424
Oh, I get it.

331
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,658
I love your voice.

332
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,926
Where's the studio?

333
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,428
It's near Yangjae-dong.

334
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,296
-It's quite close.
-Is that right?

335
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,364
Why do you wanna know?

336
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,765
Oh, it's just…

337
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,500
we're filming an episode of Screwballs.

338
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,569
If it's okay with you,

339
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,771
I'd like to swing by
and introduce you to my friends.

340
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,339
Can you spare me a minute?

341
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,774
-If you're--
-So you're saying

342
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,911
you want to swing by to introduce me
to your friends during a Screwballs shoot?

343
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,345
They say good company…

344
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,081
-They can give you a good time.
-Yeah.

345
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,148
CHUCKLES

346
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,117
The thing is,

347
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,586
today's a special day
for one of my castmates, Sook.

348
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,988
-I'm listening.
-It's her 30th anniversary soon.

349
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,057
-Oh, I see.
-So we're preparing a surprise for her

350
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,959
by going to see a real star--

351
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,627
Then you should see a star, not me.

352
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,530
You're the star. Come on, Mr. Lee.

353
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,165
Anyhow, could we come to you

354
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,603
and film a short clip of you
celebrating Sook's career?

355
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,338
Sorry, they want me back in the studio.

356
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,073
So suddenly? I didn't hear anything.

357
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,310
Anyhow, if it's okay with you,
could we join you there?

358
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,247
MAY WE COME SEE YOU?

359
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,315
Sure, okay.

360
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,317
Would you like snacks?
How about some yogurt?

361
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,352
-Where are you now?
-We're near Hakdong Station.

362
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,121
-All right, then.
-Okay. See you.

363
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,989
Thanks for reaching out. Good luck, guys.

364
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,457
BARELY MANAGES
TO GET MR. LEE ON BOARD

365
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,825
See you soon.

366
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,861
Isn't his voice amazing, Jin-kyung?

367
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,263
-You bet it is.
-He's got such a soothing voice.

368
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,232
-Oh, I think I have someone.
-Who is it?

369
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,800
How's Chimchakman?

370
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,135
Sounds amazing.

371
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,171
We've been talking just earlier, actually.

372
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,706
He said he was near Gangnam Station.

373
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,407
-Hello?
-Hey, man.

374
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,309
-Hey yourself.
-What are you doing?

375
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,278
My family and I are visiting
the Kyobo Book Center.

376
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,647
-What a lovely, happy family.
-Does that mean

377
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,250
you have Sso-yeong and your wife with you?

378
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,317
That's right.

379
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,319
-I'm actually filming Screwballs.
-I see.

380
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,521
Could you please spare us

381
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,489
-just a minute--
-You wanna swing by? Go ahead.

382
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,225
Seriously? You're so straightforward.

383
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,494
Woo-jae has some pocket money
for Sso-yeong.

384
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,662
You bet I do.

385
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,865
Where were you again?
Was it the Kyobo Book Center?

386
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,267
Not exactly, but we're nearby.

387
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,903
I'll call you again when we get there.

388
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,805
-All right. Thank you.
-Thank you so much!

389
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,872
Thank you!

390
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,574
SEE YOU SOON

391
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,811
My friends are straight shooters.

392
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,746
They never nitpick.

393
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,982
-You can make calls on the road too.
-Right, let's hit the road.

394
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,484
-We don't have much time.
-Let's hop on.

395
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,785
-All right.
-Okay. Let's go.

396
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,853
LET'S GO MEET CHIMCHAKMAN

397
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,023
DISPATCHING ENVOYS
FOR SOOK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY

398
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,558
Man, look at that minibus!

399
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,760
My gosh, "Sook's 30th Anniversary?"

400
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,295
-How cute.
-I'm shook.

401
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,197
Can you take a photo of us?

402
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,432
And we'll be riding this for a full day.

403
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,067
Three, two, one.

404
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,304
SOOK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY?
I'M SHOOK

405
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,107
NO MORE PASSENGERS?
THEN WE'RE ROLLING

406
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,412
-Can't you think of anyone to call?
-My closest friends are my bandmates.

407
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,813
-How about Jun-ho?
-How's Taec-yeon?

408
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,615
-Try calling Jun-ho.
-He has a shoot too,

409
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,850
but I'll try calling him.

410
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,051
-All right.
-Okay.

411
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,118
Just a second.

412
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,087
CALLING JUN-HO

413
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,889
Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to…

414
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,325
HE MUST BE BUSY

415
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,328
-I'll try calling TWICE.
-TWICE?

416
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,998
Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to…

417
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,934
-Just how have you led your life so far?
-This says so much about it.

418
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,837
Try to make it a habit
of treating your friends to a meal.

419
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,506
Here's another suggestion.
DAY6 is having a concert today,

420
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,075
but you never know, right?

421
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,610
They might still be available.

422
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,711
SOMEONE WOULD ANSWER,
RIGHT?

423
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,146
-Who are you calling?
-Young-hyun.

424
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,448
-I mean Young K from DAY6.
-Oh, him.

425
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,083
-He's nice.
-I'm tight with him.

426
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,352
-Hi, Woo-young.
-Hey, Young-hyun.

427
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,421
-Hello.
-You have a concert today, don't you?

428
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,557
I'm shooting Screwballs now, Young-hyun.

429
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,826
I have Jin-kyung, Sae-ho,
and Woo-jae here with me.

430
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,427
-Hello!
-Hi, Young-hyun.

431
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,862
-Hello.
-Hey, Young-hyun.

432
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,864
-I miss you all.
-I miss you too.

433
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,134
-We could come see you.
-Please do.

434
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,370
-Even now?
-Sure.

435
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,838
-Young-hyun.
-We can be on our way.

436
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,641
Young-hyun, when do you start the show?
Around 7:00 p.m.?

437
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,042
-Was it 5:00 p.m.?
-At 5:00 p.m.

438
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,244
At 5:00 p.m.? In that case…

439
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,545
-It won't work.
-What's up?

440
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,216
-Hi, Young K. This is Sae-ho.
-Oh, hi.

441
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,585
I think Woo-young called you
without thinking things through.

442
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,453
Yeah, he probably did.

443
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,423
I wish you all the best
with your concert this evening.

444
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,227
If you need a guest musician,
please reach out to Chonam Zone.

445
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,830
-Don't be so brazen.
-We're such a huge fan of DAY6, you see.

446
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:32,898
I'M HERE TOO

447
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:33,966
That's enough, Sae-ho.

448
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,834
-What's the problem?
-Why bring up Chonam Zone?

449
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,436
-Young-hyun.
-Hey, I'm listening.

450
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,504
Good luck with the concert!

451
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,406
-Good luck, Young-hyun!
-We wish you all the best!

452
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,473
Good luck!

453
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,210
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY
FUNDS BEFORE THEY MEET SOOK?

454
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,046
What the heck?

455
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,113
What have I…

456
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,181
Goodness.

457
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,483
IMPROMPTU GUESTS
AND THE TEAM DO THEIR BEST

458
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,551
FOR THE FUND UNTIL SUNSET

459
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,287
-What's this?
-Good work, Sook.

460
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,323
-Hey, you're here.
-Good work with the shoot.

461
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,390
SOOK JOINS THEM

462
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,559
SOOK'S OUTFIT MAKES THEM GIGGLE

463
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,760
-I'm so tired.
-Sook.

464
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,362
Good work today.

465
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,730
-Thank you.
-Good work.

466
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,099
We know you had a shoot today.

467
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,934
So the four of us did ours by ourselves.

468
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,637
What's your concept anyway?
Are you going for "A Day in Savanna"?

469
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,505
So your character for the day is…

470
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,375
What's with the questions?
Isn't the answer so obvious?

471
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,443
We've got multiple options.

472
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,045
-Multiple?
-She's portraying Shim Hyun-sub.

473
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,180
ANSWER WILL BE REVEALED SOON

474
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,681
Bambaya.

475
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,017
By the way,

476
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,385
where are we?

477
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,122
What's this place? I see a familiar name.

478
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,924
-What?
-Oh, it's that place.

479
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,026
The production company of our show.

480
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,094
-Director Park's.
-Right.

481
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,161
PRODUCTION COMPANY OFFICE?

482
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,397
It's huge.

483
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,499
-No way he's a small business owner.
-He doesn't qualify.

484
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,567
What's up with this?

485
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,768
WHY IS IT SO SPACIOUS HERE?

486
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,504
A WELCOMING SIGHT OF THE POSTER

487
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,539
AND THE FRIENDLY PROPS

488
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,311
THERE ARE SHOTS FROM THE SHOW
WE'VE ALL SEEN BEFORE…

489
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,147
AND SIGNS CONGRATULATING
SOOK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY

490
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,049
WELCOME TO THE HUMBLE OFFICE
OF THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

491
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,419
Everyone, here comes Mr. Shim,
the star of "A Day in Savanna."

492
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,721
Bambaya!

493
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,822
ENTERING THE OFFICE

494
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,191
What a heartwarming sight!

495
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,428
-Come on. I'm not portraying Hyun-sub.
-Who are you portraying, then?

496
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,596
Can't you tell?

497
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,131
My gut tells me Shim Hyun-sub.

498
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,466
A sales representative of a mop company?

499
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
Of course not.

500
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,735
Look. What comes to your mind?

501
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,404
Think hard about 1995.

502
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,738
LET'S GET THE RIGHT ANSWER

503
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,607
That member from Roo'Ra?

504
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,674
Three, four.

505
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,712
CORRECT! SOOK IS DRESSED UP
AS CHAE RI-NA FROM ROO'RA

506
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,447
PHOTO SOURCE: CHAE RI-NA HERSELF

507
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
You're Chae Ri-na

508
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,351
-and not some random cheerleader?
-What cheerleader?

509
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,419
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH DAD JOKES!

510
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,220
I have one question.

511
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,557
You gave us the impression
you only ran a small-scale business,

512
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,060
but the office here says otherwise.
It's mind-blowing.

513
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,796
-Yeah, what was all that?
-I think we can even do a shoot here.

514
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,465
We only use this one, single room.

515
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,866
So not the other office areas?

516
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:48,934
Of course not.

517
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,636
-You mean you only rent this room?
-Exactly.

518
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,104
-Are you for real?
-Sure.

519
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,340
He must be telling the truth.
Look at those ponies we rode and stuff.

520
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,443
All right, then.

521
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,511
Does that mean you edit our show here?

522
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,946
Sure. Please look around.

523
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,448
-Our producers work here.
-Seems that way.

524
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,982
Why do you have
that nasty scene pulled up?

525
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,784
Yeah, that's a shocking scene.

526
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,019
-Goodness.
-What on earth?

527
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,253
So this is where you work.

528
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,856
As you can see from the signs,
we're celebrating your 30th anniversary.

529
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,991
-Congrats!
-My gosh.

530
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,461
Every small ornament here
is centered around you, Sook.

531
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,795
This is incredible.

532
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,697
How did you know
it was my 30th anniversary?

533
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,732
-It's not exactly a secret.
-Come on.

534
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,035
-It'd be more shocking if we didn't know.
-Is that right?

535
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,370
Is that a special cake for me?

536
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,072
Why don't you turn it around?

537
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,575
It features a few key moments
of your career, Sook.

538
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,811
A SPECIAL CAKE DECORATED WITH
A FEW HIGHLIGHTS FROM HER CAREER

539
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,680
That's me wearing
that fried chicken costume.

540
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,715
I see myself dressed
as Auntie Omakase and everything.

541
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,119
The bratty girl character
was the one I performed back in 2002.

542
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,286
This one's from Screwballs.

543
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,654
That one's Nanda Kim.

544
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,491
My gosh. This is me as a member of Unnies.

545
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,558
SOOK IN HER UNNIES ERA

546
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,893
Look, Jin-kyung.

547
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,028
-This is from those days, Jin-kyung.
-I see it.

548
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,931
Do you actually own the items
laid on top like the Birkin?

549
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,000
-She must have them.
-Don't forget the Chanel.

550
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,236
I don't own any of them,
so I'd love to have one.

551
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,605
My goodness. Thank you so much.

552
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,040
All right. So we celebrated
her big moment together.

553
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,376
Is that all? No blowing out the candles?

554
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,679
I'm afraid we used all our funds
on custom-ordering the cake.

555
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,148
WE CAN'T EVEN PAY FOR CANDLES

556
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,350
I guess you are a small business owner.

557
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,953
Do you remember
when you first launched your career?

558
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,288
I meant the exact date.

559
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,157
I took part
in the open recruitment in 1994.

560
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:22,594
I believe I first started to work
officially in January 1995.

561
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,329
And 30 years have passed so far.

562
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,167
-Full 30 years.
-But I haven't accomplished all that much.

563
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,234
-Come on.
-That's nonsense.

564
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,403
-You've done so much.
-You merely didn't get as many chances.

565
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,906
I didn't do much over the 30 years,
and it's rather embarrassing.

566
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,741
Seriously though, don't think that way.

567
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,276
You appeared on 120 variety shows.

568
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,845
THE LIST OF COUNTLESS SHOWS
SOOK APPEARED IN

569
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,614
Let's say 30 years passed by
much quicker than I thought they would.

570
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,018
When we celebrated Jin-kyung's milestone,
I thought she was so amazing.

571
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:51,056
During the time the episodes
of today's shoot are released,

572
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,758
your birthday comes up.

573
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,226
Right, July 6th.

574
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,430
-Happy birthday to you
-It's not my birthday yet.

575
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,868
-Our dearest Sook
-Our dearest Sook

576
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,439
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

577
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,241
Thank you.

578
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,977
We're celebrating Sook's 30th anniversary
and her 50th birthday.

579
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,879
Surely, this can't be the end of it.

580
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,081
It's enough for me.
I'm more than satisfied.

581
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,083
Even so, it's not a proper celebration…

582
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,251
-Without a meal, no.
-Hear, hear.

583
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,886
-We should have a nice meal, right?
-Sure.

584
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,187
-You're hungry, Jin-kyung?
-Yeah.

585
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,922
We've prepared a menu.

586
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,257
My gosh.

587
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,326
-I'll read the main dishes.
-Gosh, so many.

588
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,927
Bowls of rice are complimentary.

589
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,029
"Assorted raw fish. Braised short ribs."

590
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,065
"Cockle bibimbap.
Boiled pork and pig's trotter."

591
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,101
"Steak. Seaweed soup. Pasta. Pizza.
Fried chicken. Sweet-and-sour pork."

592
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,203
SO MANY OPTIONS!

593
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,571
You're giving us all of these?

594
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,973
That's a feast.

595
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,941
Did we set the time limit at one minute?

596
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,109
-Oh, dear.
-What time limit?

597
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,545
-What?
-Why is there a time limit?

598
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,381
-We have one minute to do what?
-We'll be playing a game

599
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,184
as a gesture of celebrating your birthday.

600
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,386
Remember Sook's comment from earlier?

601
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,587
-She asked for candles.
-Right.

602
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,856
And she was right to ask for some
since it's her birthday soon.

603
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,659
You'll each be asked
to blow out three candles.

604
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,827
-Okay.
-So…

605
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,563
much like the Loyalty Game,
all of you must finish your task

606
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,164
-under the one-minute time limit.
-Got it.

607
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,634
-We only have to blow out the candles?
-Of course.

608
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,701
That's a cakewalk.

609
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,370
Then, we'll supply you with the food.

610
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,106
There has to be a caveat of some sort.

611
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,641
YOU BET WE DO

612
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,544
Sook is undeniably the star of the show.

613
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,646
-What?
-Sure.

614
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:27,085
THE STAR OF THE CAST AND CREW
OF SCREWBALLS, KIM SOOK

615
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,656
Sook is undeniably the star of the show.

616
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,757
-What?
-Sure.

617
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,259
To celebrate
our tight relationship with the star,

618
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,094
-you'll wear tights…
-Unbelievable.

619
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,431
…to play "Blow Out Candles
for the Birthday Party Feast."

620
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,167
-I can't believe this.
-That doesn't make any sense.

621
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,236
My birthday and stuff were only excuses.

622
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,505
-Can we hear the impression?
-They never meant any of that.

623
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,974
-"Star chosen by the stars! Star King."
-I remember that one.

624
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,178
"Okay. All the top celebrities are here.
Let's meet the star chosen by the stars."

625
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,946
"This is Star King!"

626
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,014
NATION'S BELOVED MC IS HERE

627
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,183
Ho-dong would say.
"Let's talk about our guests today."

628
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,818
"We have the Jegi King today."

629
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,255
"Please show him your support
with applause and loud cheer!"

630
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,858
-"Can you introduce yourself?"
-Hey, Sae-ho.

631
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,827
-I think that's blood on your pants.
-I'm bleeding.

632
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,896
HE GOT WORKED UP

633
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,798
How many can we choose? Two?

634
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,666
We'll order generous portions
of the two dishes.

635
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,201
I think it will be a breeze.

636
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,671
-Yeah, we can make it work.
-Right? I thought so too.

637
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,440
It will be a piece of cake.

638
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,009
The candles are far away.
So that's how it is.

639
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,310
We're to stand here?

640
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,112
I don't think I can blow them out
even without the tights.

641
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,347
Yeah, she's right.

642
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,414
FURTHER THAN THEY EXPECTED

643
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,249
I don't think we can manage it
at this distance.

644
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,351
You'll go first, right?

645
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,552
I thought you would.

646
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,520
-Kick us off. Don't quibble.
-All right, then.

647
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,523
-The tights are barely noticeable.
-Wait.

648
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,325
-You're wearing them, aren't you?
-Of course.

649
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,393
What are you implying?

650
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,861
OOPS, SORRY

651
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,029
YOU'RE ROCKING THE LOOK

652
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,164
-How rude.
-But he's wearing them so well.

653
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,367
It looks like he received Ulthera shots.

654
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,835
The tights made his skin go taut.

655
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,969
-See what I mean?
-I'm ready.

656
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,037
Ready.

657
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,772
Set.

658
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,174
-Go.
-Please, Sae-ho.

659
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,242
-My gosh!
-That's it.

660
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,578
-My gosh!
-That's it.

661
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:01,913
-My gosh!
-That's it.

662
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,014
One more time.

663
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,683
-Let's roll!
-Go, Sae-ho!

664
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,585
One more!

665
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,189
Aim your breath.

666
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,324
Is it that difficult?

667
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,392
-Okay!
-It's done!

668
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,893
-Tell us the time.
-I feel dizzy.

669
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,461
-How long did he take?
-Fifteen seconds.

670
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,463
-I feel so faint.
-All right.

671
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,198
-We're all set.
-Good job.

672
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,967
-Oh, wait. No.
-But we're good.

673
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,202
Take all three out in under five seconds.
Then we're good.

674
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,004
You're a singer, for crying out loud.

675
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,572
-No, I'm not.
-Use your good lungs.

676
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,508
-So you're not a singer?
-Come off it!

677
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,276
But I thought you were one
after all this time.

678
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,878
MASTER OF LIVE PERFORMANCES

679
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,314
WE'RE HOPING TO SEE YOU SHOW OFF
YOUR SPECIAL TALENT HERE

680
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,450
-I can't see so well.
-Guys.

681
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,252
-Sook.
-It's incredible.

682
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,686
-He looks like a fetus.
-My gosh.

683
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,921
A fetus, I tell you.

684
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,022
He's turned into a fetus.

685
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,391
He's turned into a fetus.

686
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,293
I can't see properly.

687
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,361
TURNED INTO A 9-MONTH FETUS

688
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,796
He looks like a fetus, seriously.

689
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,497
If it's not too much to ask,

690
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,833
could you do a dance
to one of 2PM's songs?

691
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,568
Listen to my heartbeat

692
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,303
It's waiting for you

693
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,871
A FETUS WITH EXCEPTIONAL TALENT

694
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,706
-Wait, but--
-How is his face so small?

695
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,309
I didn't realize it, but the tights
do make you look younger.

696
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,377
UNEXPECTED BONUS

697
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,379
By the time this episode is released,

698
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,948
I may be promoting my new album.

699
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,684
Let's see you try it first. Go on.

700
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,752
Take a deep breath.

701
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,987
It's reaching here now.

702
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,522
Aim a bit lower.

703
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,724
Okay. This should take them out.

704
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,026
See my demonstration.

705
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,494
Suck in a deep lungful of air

706
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,796
and exhale forcefully.

707
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,731
Okay. This requires concentration.

708
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,799
THE DETERMINED FETUS

709
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,835
I want the assorted raw fish
and the cockle bibimbap.

710
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,636
WOO-YOUNG HAS SO MANY CRAVINGS

711
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,205
AND I'LL HAVE THEM ALL

712
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,673
Ready.

713
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,075
Set. Go.

714
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,377
My gosh!

715
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,713
My gosh!

716
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,381
-Okay!
-Goodness.

717
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,151
ACCUMULATED SECONDS

718
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,486
-Okay!
-Goodness.

719
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,553
Gosh, he only took a second.

720
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,621
No, three seconds.

721
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,556
Great job, buddy.

722
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,392
-How did you manage that?
-Okay, we're sailing smoothly.

723
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,695
-Keep the momentum going, Woo-jae.
-All right.

724
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,163
EVEN HIS BACK SEEMS DETERMINED

725
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,465
-Okay, we can do this.
-Help me, Sook.

726
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,133
-Sure, we can.
-We only need to focus.

727
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,435
Let's do some practice.

728
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,070
Take a deep breath.

729
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,005
TUTORS THE WEAKEST LINK
WHILE WOO-JAE MAKES PREPARATION

730
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,407
WHY IS IT TAKING HIM SO LONG

731
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,010
TO WEAR THOSE TIGHTS?

732
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,246
COVERS HIS FACE AS IF
HE'S FEELING SHY

733
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,914
-Take your hand away.
-Take it off.

734
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,282
-Come on.
-Mister.

735
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,416
-Mister?
-Three, two, one.

736
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,452
Move your hand, sir.

737
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:22,988
-Mister?
-Three, two, one.

738
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,055
Move your hand, sir.

739
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,790
A BIG GAPING HOLE

740
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,894
You've seen it, so there.
He tore the tights while wearing them.

741
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,262
It couldn't be helped.

742
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,997
-It's a good comedy.
-It wasn't his fault.

743
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,331
I tore them while putting them on.

744
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,966
They got snagged on his teeth.

745
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,035
If you fault him for that,
I'm giving you a yellow card.

746
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,837
-It's funny.
-It's a personal attack.

747
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,905
Get him a new pair.

748
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,507
YOUR TRICK WON'T WORK,
GIVE IT UP

749
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,643
But seriously, he sure is something else.

750
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,678
The tights merely got snagged, that's all.

751
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,080
That was hilarious.

752
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,949
Is this supposed to be mine? Wait.

753
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,517
Where's mine? I lost it while laughing.

754
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,618
PUTS ON NEW TIGHTS

755
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,654
Try to pull them down a bit more.
It'd be too tight here.

756
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,056
GOODNESS

757
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,225
-Here it is.
-He looks the worst.

758
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,861
-Gosh, it's hilarious.
-You have to finish all three in one go.

759
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,195
WOW!

760
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,231
You've been gaining popularity
with "To Reach You."

761
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,465
Wait. I feel bad.

762
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,067
-I don't think…
-I can't seem to…

763
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,368
You look so fresh. Hey, watch it.

764
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,003
I'm trying to pull it down further.

765
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,173
I don't get how your upper lip
is pressed upward.

766
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,542
I'm going to take a look at the photo
if I feel poorly at night.

767
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,812
-It's funny.
-It's a personal attack.

768
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,080
SAE-HO, GET WELL SOON

769
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,481
Exhale with full force like earlier.

770
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,783
Don't make many attempts.

771
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,284
-So hilarious.
-Focus is the key.

772
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,652
Crouch down lower.

773
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,720
Okay, he's ready.

774
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,155
-Ready.
-Finish it in one go.

775
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,222
Set.

776
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,059
-Go.
-Don't pull me back too hard.

777
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,126
GO!

778
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,695
Sorry.

779
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,864
HE'S DONE IT IN ONE GO!

780
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,666
ACCUMULATED SECONDS

781
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,901
NOPE

782
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,402
-Okay.
-He's done it.

783
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,737
-How are you so good?
-Tell us the time.

784
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,505
He's done a good job
of putting on the tights.

785
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,007
-A couple of seconds?
-What's our time?

786
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,075
In total, 24 seconds.

787
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,611
-He's done well with the tights.
-The time seems to fly by.

788
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,579
-Are you sure this is a new one?
-I'm sure.

789
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,814
-I still wonder.
-Let me help.

790
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,149
WE'LL HELP YOU

791
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,217
It's not working.

792
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,419
Pull it down just a bit further.

793
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,389
UHM

794
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,558
-Just a second.
-I can't move my lips.

795
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,394
-Her lash fell off.
-You can't move your lips?

796
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,462
Okay, we're good.

797
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,865
Suppose we went outside in that state
and ran into little children.

798
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,601
I bet they'll see us in their nightmares.

799
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,104
Sook.

800
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,473
-I'm sorry, Sook.
-You should open your mouth wider.

801
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,009
Give it your all as you push out air.

802
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,977
GOOD-MANNERED PHOTOGRAPHER
TAKES A DAMAGING PHOTO

803
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,746
Sorry. I'll only enjoy that by myself.

804
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,148
What's his deal? What's this anyway?

805
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,085
Let me remind you that we're celebrating
the 30th anniversary of Sook's career.

806
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,588
-This dedication helped her make it.
-Let me pull the tights a bit.

807
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,722
-We're all set!
-Ready.

808
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,524
Focus, Sook.

809
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,192
Take a deep breath.

810
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,394
And now,

811
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,263
we'll see how the comedian
with 30 years under her belt--

812
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,431
-Don't stall!
-Hurry up!

813
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,532
What's wrong with you?

814
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,900
I was holding my breath.

815
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,502
Ready.

816
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,569
-Set.
-Show them, Sook!

817
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,171
Go!

818
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,673
You've got one down.

819
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,107
Okay.

820
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,175
Aim lower.

821
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,910
-Go lower.
-Pick up the pace.

822
00:27:58,977 --> 00:27:59,978
-Inhale.
-Lower.

823
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,746
One more time.

824
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,749
-Keep going. You did it.
-Okay!

825
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,952
SUCCESSFULLY BLEW OUT
THE CANDLES!

826
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,821
-Tell us the time.
-Thirty-six seconds.

827
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,389
Okay, that leaves Jin-kyung
with 24 seconds.

828
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,224
Twenty-four seconds?
We still have enough time.

829
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,292
We do.

830
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,094
-I took them out pretty quickly.
-That you did.

831
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,663
-We could say you've already won.
-We're handing the game on a platter.

832
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,765
-That's for sure.
-Finish it in under ten seconds.

833
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,100
What happened?

834
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,303
Were you so awful at this game
when you tried it, my dear crew?

835
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,839
Cultivate your skills, okay?

836
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,874
Practice more.

837
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,576
WOO-JAE FORGOT ONE DETAIL
AS HE BRAGGED HERE

838
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,880
If you were to run simulations,
hone your skills before all that.

839
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:36,948
Just a minute.

840
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,516
Turn off the cameras.

841
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,884
LET'S PROTECT HER RIGHTS

842
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,486
-Give us a second.
-She looks familiar.

843
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,554
PHOTOGRAPHER HITS AGAIN

844
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,888
Hey, you. Don't you dare.

845
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,690
Doesn't she look like Park Seung-dae?

846
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,992
-Good. You're all set.
-She does look familiar somehow.

847
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,095
I still think she looks like Seung-dae.

848
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,162
Hurry up.

849
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,230
YOU CAN'T MISS THIS

850
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,232
HIDES THE PHONE AWAY

851
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,134
JIN-KYUNG…

852
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,838
PLEASE FINISH THE GAME
IN UNDER 24 SECONDS

853
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,905
Let's see you try it.

854
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,407
-Take his phone.
-It's a game of strength.

855
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,008
The game requires fortitude as well.

856
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,543
Don't exhale like this.

857
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,611
INSTEAD, DO THIS

858
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,446
You've got to blow it out like this.

859
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,685
Are you sure we can air that?

860
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,386
She looks awful.

861
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,889
Jin-kyung used to be a model, you know.

862
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,860
We've seen Sook take on the game,
and she's a veteran comedian of 30 years.

863
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,828
The next player
has 32 years under her belt.

864
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,263
With 32 years of experience…

865
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,232
You have to be ready to go this far
to last for so long.

866
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,533
I know it's not the point,

867
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,502
but you look god-awful.

868
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,872
All right.

869
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,473
-Ready.
-Do you have a death wish?

870
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,575
As for Jin-kyung,

871
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,778
she debuted as a supermodel in 1993.

872
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,346
Let's just have it done already!

873
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,948
Wouldn't it be better for you
to wear sunglasses?

874
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,218
I'm sorry.

875
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,754
I mean, she looks way too bad here.

876
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,690
LET'S DOLL HER UP A BIT

877
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,392
That's better. Ready.

878
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,061
-You look like an over-ripe cucumber.
-We're counting on you.

879
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,329
Please help us out.

880
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,931
-Set.
-Take a deep breath.

881
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,766
-Play the game in your mind.
-Do your best for us.

882
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,834
YOU MUST STAY ON YOUR TOES

883
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,769
-Go!
-Jin-kyung!

884
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,674
-You have to aim lower.
-Give it more force.

885
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,609
You have to give it more energy.

886
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,646
-You can do this!
-Just a bit more!

887
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,747
Yeah, shake your head.

888
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,515
That's not it.

889
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,017
Take in more air.

890
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,785
Lower your torso more.

891
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,821
-Take in as much air as possible.
-Go lower.

892
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,658
-Come on, Jin-kyung.
-Expel the air to the front. Go!

893
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,893
-Wait. Her spit…
-You've got this.

894
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,195
Wait. Her spit…

895
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,830
OH, DEAR

896
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,731
You've got this.

897
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,433
Can we use our spit?

898
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,501
WOO-JAE'S TRYING TO HELP

899
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,702
You can do it.

900
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,204
-Please, Jin-kyung.
-You're almost there.

901
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,638
-Just a bit more.
-Come on.

902
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,073
GIVES UP

903
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,641
BUT THE 32-YEAR VETERAN

904
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,210
DOESN'T GIVE UP SO EASILY

905
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,378
-Jin-kyung.
-Where's her breath going?

906
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,446
Try it again.

907
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,781
Go on.

908
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,616
Geez. She's spitting.

909
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,619
She's spitting more than letting out air.

910
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,688
THIS ISN'T GOING TO FLY

911
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,956
We should wipe the desk.

912
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,158
We need to maintain
our players' physical condition,

913
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,726
so let's wrap it up here.

914
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,295
Your total time has already passed
1 minute 33 seconds.

915
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,797
THAT'S WAY PAST
THE 1-MINUTE GOAL

916
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,332
How time flies, am I right?

917
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,600
Can't we please have another go?

918
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,001
-I'm dizzy.
-Good work, Jin-kyung.

919
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,003
-I don't think she can play again.
-Take it off.

920
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,839
-It was the funniest thing I've ever seen.
-Go sit down. I felt dizzy too.

921
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,708
Take a seat here.

922
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,243
How about we play again
with the four of us?

923
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,911
JIN-KYUNG IS ICONIC
IN HER OWN WAY

924
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,779
ALL THANKS TO HER HARD WORK
OF 32 YEARS

925
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,716
-Jin-kyung can't manage it.
-I don't think she could either

926
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,184
even if she tried it until Chuseok.

927
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,320
-I'll give the four of you 30 seconds.
-Thirty seconds?

928
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,423
Jin-kyung, we keep a foldable bed
for when we have to crash here

929
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,858
-for an all-nighter.
-You do?

930
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,926
-Wanna lie down?
-Yeah.

931
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,060
-Goodness.
-Good idea.

932
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,697
I didn't know this game could be
this harmful to our health.

933
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,765
REST WELL, DEAR PATIENT

934
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,066
Make it quick, Woo-young.

935
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,635
-I'll kick us off.
-What should I do?

936
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,137
-I think you should close us out.
-Okay, I'll do that.

937
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,739
Take two seconds, Woo-young.

938
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,007
I'll take another two.

939
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,341
-You get three seconds, Sae-ho.
-Okay.

940
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,476
Give me ten seconds at least.

941
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,279
-We'll spare you 23 seconds.
-Okay.

942
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,114
-Okay.
-Get those tights ready.

943
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,382
-Okay. Let's roll.
-Looking good.

944
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,449
Ready.

945
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,184
HUNGRY WOO-YOUNG FOCUSES
HIS ENERGY

946
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,687
Set. Go.

947
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,088
GAME BEGINS

948
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,826
-He's done it.
-Okay.

949
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:09,961
-3 seconds?
-No, 4.93 seconds.

950
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,462
Really? He took longer than we hoped for.

951
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,764
-I did better earlier.
-Yeah.

952
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,633
-You still did well.
-You have to go lower.

953
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,169
Do some soul-searching.
Finish it in under four seconds, okay?

954
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,604
Understood, sir.

955
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,905
-That was a mess.
-I'm sorry.

956
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,573
Your record was 2 to 3 seconds last week.

957
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,208
-What the heck is 4.93 seconds?
-I'm sorry.

958
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,743
Shall I send you packing?

959
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,679
The 4.93-second record
isn't acceptable at all.

960
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,914
Go stand before the wall
and blow on it 4,000 times.

961
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,417
INTENSIVE TRAINING

962
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,152
Let's roll. We can do this.

963
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,453
-Ready.
-Let's get this done!

964
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,088
Set.

965
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,990
Go.

966
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,227
-Okay.
-He's done it.

967
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,097
His aim is very sharp
like he's shooting a gun.

968
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,565
In total, 8.91 seconds.

969
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,300
Your breath went out like a bullet.

970
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,069
-I'll do my best.
-So then,

971
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,005
-you have to pinpoint your breath.
-That's right.

972
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,573
-Like a sniper.
-This is great.

973
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,709
It almost felt like
we had a sniper with us.

974
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,077
All right.

975
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,812
Sae-ho, you've crossed the line.

976
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,080
Do you mean health-wise?

977
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,214
Geez, man.

978
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,282
HEH

979
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,416
Ready.

980
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,086
Set. Go.

981
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,188
HERE GOES!

982
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,622
What is he even doing?

983
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,690
What on earth?

984
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,627
THE CANDLES WON'T EVEN FLICKER

985
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,366
WHAT IS THIS?

986
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,134
-What's gotten into you?
-What the heck?

987
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,435
Aim lower.

988
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,805
HE'S DONE FINE SO FAR

989
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,577
BARELY MANAGED
TO BLOW THE CANDLES OUT

990
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,445
How long did it take?

991
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,613
WHAT THE HECK?

992
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,148
What was all that about?

993
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,216
Seriously.

994
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,984
-That's Jin-kyung's place.
-What happened?

995
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,386
-Scoot over.
-You wanna lie down?

996
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,123
I'M SO LIGHT-HEADED

997
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,491
So that was your goal?

998
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,793
-He bombed the game to do that!
-Totally!

999
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,194
That's not true.

1000
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,163
Tell us the time.

1001
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,265
In total, 25 seconds.

1002
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,801
-What?
-What on earth are you playing at?

1003
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,236
Twenty-five seconds, seriously?

1004
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,971
There's not enough room here!

1005
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,573
-You threw us under the bus for laughs.
-Not at all. Geez, my head.

1006
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,075
You did fine earlier.

1007
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,710
It's cramped as is.

1008
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,811
But you're staying put?

1009
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,413
HUDDLED TOGETHER ON
THE CRAMPED BED

1010
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,415
Dang it. My face.

1011
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,152
What's your problem, you two?
Seriously, come on!

1012
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,720
We genuinely have migraines.

1013
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:16,788
WE'RE PATIENTS, OKAY?

1014
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,990
-Can we get it started?
-It's all set.

1015
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,224
All right. Let's do it.

1016
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,193
Sook, squat down a bit. There you go.

1017
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,261
-Ready.
-Okay.

1018
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,897
-Ready.
-This is our last shot.

1019
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,099
-Set.
-Give it your all.

1020
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,233
-Do it.
-Go.

1021
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,702
Go, Sook, go. Blow harder.

1022
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,004
It's the last one.

1023
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,643
ALL CANDLES ARE OUT!

1024
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,480
Geez. Be gentle!

1025
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,981
My lymphatic nodes!

1026
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,083
-Not all three can fit here.
-Oh, no. Ma'am.

1027
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,585
Wait, ma'am.

1028
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,320
DON'T FUSS, LET ME LIE HERE TOO

1029
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,290
Wait, you might hurt his surgery scar.

1030
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,458
AT LEAST YOU LOOK CLOSE

1031
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,226
-I'm worn out.
-The three of us can't fit…

1032
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,494
I'm exhausted!

1033
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,798
THE ORIGINAL OCCUPANT
IS KICKED OUT

1034
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,667
-I'm drained!
-You're getting up?

1035
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,836
Yeah, you took enough rest. Go.

1036
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,072
You're booting her out
because she's had her time?

1037
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,941
That took more than 30 seconds.

1038
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,309
TOTAL TIME: 31.62 SECONDS

1039
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,877
-What?
-It's your fault, Sae-ho.

1040
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,445
-Why, you…
-I'm sorry.

1041
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,881
You bombed it
to do that bit about lying down.

1042
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,050
No, I didn't do that on purpose.

1043
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,019
PRINCIPLED COMEDIAN

1044
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,821
-Let's take Sae-ho out.
-Yeah.

1045
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,390
-Let us try again, the three of us.
-Yeah.

1046
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,025
Give us 20 seconds.

1047
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,328
I want to lie down.
Come and step on my back for me.

1048
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,729
Step on your back? Got it.

1049
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,097
I'm a good masseur, Jin-kyung.

1050
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,565
-Twenty seconds for the trio?
-Yeah.

1051
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,868
-It's not a bad deal, is it?
-My gosh.

1052
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:37,935
Ouch.

1053
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,303
You know it's a good deal.

1054
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,607
-We've spent enough energy, so.
-You're right. Okay, then.

1055
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,809
-I'll give you 20 seconds.
-Okay. Twenty seconds.

1056
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,611
Shall I go first to see
if we're hopeless or not?

1057
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,379
-Yeah, you can go ahead.
-Okay.

1058
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,947
Gosh, you're really good.

1059
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,116
-Can you hold… Shall I, then?
-How did you get so good?

1060
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,518
-Sure.
-I'm a great masseur.

1061
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,686
Don't mind these guys here.

1062
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,089
Why are they here, exactly?

1063
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,625
SAE-HO'S BEAUTY SALON

1064
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,859
IT'S HEAVENLY HERE

1065
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,361
Don't you mind the locks?

1066
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,096
We have a new cast member here.

1067
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,264
Here's a new guest.

1068
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,166
A NEWCOMER

1069
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,400
Are you crying?

1070
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,537
Don't cry.

1071
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,272
I'm hungry.

1072
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,873
CAN YOU TELL

1073
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,342
IF THESE ARE MY TEAR STREAKS
OR MY WIGS?

1074
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,945
Finish it off with a long puff of air.

1075
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,880
-Ready.
-You've got this.

1076
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,449
Set. Go.

1077
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,686
LUNGFULS OF AIR

1078
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,488
Make it a long one, Sook.

1079
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,857
Come on.

1080
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,425
It's over. Let's not bother, Woo-young.

1081
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,895
Good luck, Sook.
Congrats on the 30th anniversary.

1082
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,330
Take your time.

1083
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,832
Keep going, Sook. Knock yourself out.

1084
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,900
There you go.

1085
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,405
Excuse me. I have a new client coming in.

1086
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,940
Come this way, ma'am.

1087
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,209
-Ma'am, I have a new client.
-Got it.

1088
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,579
NEXT CLIENT, PLEASE COME ON IN

1089
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,114
My gosh. Are you a soccer player?

1090
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,217
IS THAT AN AFFIRMATIVE
OR A GRUNT?

1091
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,552
This may be painful,
but please keep still.

1092
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,454
-How long will it continue?
-Please exhale.

1093
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,891
TAKE A LONG BREATH OUT, MA'AM

1094
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,094
This is an amazing massage salon.

1095
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,162
THE MARK OF SATISFACTION

1096
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,330
It's super satisfying.

1097
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,731
-You have knots here.
-He's so good.

1098
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,666
-You should try this too, Director.
-Come along.

1099
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,968
This will give you a total glow up.

1100
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,303
I'll give you a five-second massage.
Cut us some slack.

1101
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,105
That's not necessary.
Let's try it like this.

1102
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,108
-Since it's Sook's 30th anniversary…
-And?

1103
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,410
…work as a group
to blow out candles in a second.

1104
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,612
I doubt we can.

1105
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,946
-How many seconds?
-Just one.

1106
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,448
-Come again?
-One second.

1107
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,515
-One second?
-Yeah.

1108
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,784
Inhale, and that's one second.

1109
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,852
THERE GOES THE TRICKSTER

1110
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,454
How's two seconds?

1111
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,788
-That's acceptable.
-Okay.

1112
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,257
-Let's do this.
-That will work.

1113
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,525
RETURNED TO
THE ORIGINAL POSITION

1114
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,961
BLOW OUT ALL THE CANDLES
AS A GROUP IN 2 SECONDS

1115
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,164
THIS IS THEIR FINAL SHOT

1116
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:51,302
IF THEY FAIL AGAIN,

1117
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,673
THEY'LL ONLY GET PLAIN RICE
ON THEIR TABLE

1118
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,508
Goodness.

1119
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,477
-We're all set.
-I'll aim lower.

1120
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,978
-Got it?
-Sure.

1121
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,046
-Two seconds?
-That's right.

1122
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,614
WHAT A STRANGE SIGHT

1123
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,715
Ready.

1124
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:06,984
Set.

1125
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,253
EVERYONE TAKES A DEEP BREATH
IN SUCCESSION

1126
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,321
Sorry, guys. But--

1127
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,390
What now?
We were literally holding our breath.

1128
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,759
My chest hurts.

1129
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,460
-It was such a--
-We were holding our breath!

1130
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,928
Gosh, my chest.

1131
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,397
I took in too much air.

1132
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,000
We sucked in deep lungfuls of air, okay?

1133
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,068
I apologize.

1134
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,636
-We took in large lungfuls, okay?
-Let's roll.

1135
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,704
Let's try it right away.

1136
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,673
-Okay. Let's go.
-I can't see anything.

1137
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,908
Here goes. Ready.

1138
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,410
Set.

1139
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,744
WE MUST HOLD A FEAST

1140
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,579
FOR SOOK'S BIG DAY

1141
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,647
Go.

1142
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,584
IF WE WORK TOGETHER,

1143
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,820
WE CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING

1144
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,627
THEY'RE OUT

1145
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,695
-Okay!
-We did it, right?

1146
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,929
-It's done.
-I'm sure of it.

1147
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,599
DID THEY SUCCEED?

1148
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,269
-You took two seconds.
-Two seconds!

1149
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,870
-We did it!
-It's a success!

1150
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,372
You did it.

1151
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,974
HOORAY

1152
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,677
-That was insane.
-Putting all our efforts together did it.

1153
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,446
We worked together, Sook.

1154
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,949
Let's go for pig's trotter
and cockle bibimbap.

1155
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,584
-And seaweed soup?
-I want braised short ribs.

1156
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,019
How many can we choose?

1157
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,120
Up to five dishes.

1158
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,588
Five? Then I want assorted raw fish.

1159
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,425
WE'RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH
THEIR LUDICROUS TRICKS BY NOW

1160
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,760
-You can choose three.
-Okay!

1161
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,496
YOU MAY CHOOSE THREE
BECAUSE YOU WORKED SO HARD

1162
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,133
AFTER THE CHAOTIC GAME

1163
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,369
-My gosh. Look at all this food.
-At any rate,

1164
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,939
it's lovely to have dinner together
to celebrate Sook's birthday.

1165
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,607
CONGRATULATIONS IN ADVANCE

1166
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,642
-Thank you for the food!
-I'm so happy.

1167
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,244
I'll give you your present in July.

1168
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,713
There's no need. The way I see it,
the whole evening was a gift.

1169
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,781
Okay, then.

1170
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,217
THAT JERK…

1171
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,284
Please enjoy the food.

1172
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,053
-Thank you!
-We'll enjoy them.

1173
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,389
Look at all this feast.

1174
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,790
THEY WON THE BRAISED PORK,

1175
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,725
PIG'S TROTTER, AND COCKLE
BIBIMBAP BY WORKING TOGETHER

1176
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,993
They all look so good.

1177
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,561
Shall we, then?

1178
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,263
-Thanks for the food!
-Take the first bite, Sook.

1179
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,334
YUM

1180
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,635
It's good. Don't overdo it.

1181
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,470
-Come on, dude.
-It's so good.

1182
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,006
EXTRA BIT OF KINDNESS
FOR THE 30TH-ANNIVERSARY GIRL

1183
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,542
-One more thing.
-What is it?

1184
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,178
One of our writers, Ms. Choi Eun-yeong,
has been collaborating with Sook

1185
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,080
for a very long time,

1186
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,815
and she brought home-cooked seaweed soup.

1187
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,117
-You can enjoy it as a bonus.
-Seriously?

1188
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,352
-My gosh!
-Thank you!

1189
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,686
You didn't have to.

1190
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,054
Is this pot yours, Eun-yeong?

1191
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,490
HOW TOUCHING IS THIS?

1192
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,592
My gosh. Thank you, Eun-yeong.

1193
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,563
I can't believe our head writer
cooked a potful of seaweed soup.

1194
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,064
My gosh, Eun-yeong.

1195
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,467
-You're a real one, Eun-yeong.
-We're so touched.

1196
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,169
I'm so moved.

1197
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,204
I'm not sure
if it's well-seasoned, though.

1198
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,706
-When did she do all this?
-If we complain, we're the baddies.

1199
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,942
THE SOUP WILL PROBABLY
TASTE BEST

1200
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,812
Don't you have a birthday party
planned with your family?

1201
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,046
I don't, no.

1202
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,883
I dropped birthday celebrations
sometime ago.

1203
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,951
Why is that?

1204
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,889
When I was still young,
I had a birthday party at a karaoke.

1205
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,925
That was the last one I had, actually.

1206
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,726
What? The last one?

1207
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,595
I invited all my friends.

1208
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,796
I ended up having a crowd

1209
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:09,066
because my friends invited their friends,
and they in turn invited theirs.

1210
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,534
Honestly, there were so many.

1211
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,036
We booked a room…

1212
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,771
-Man, it's good.
-…and we hung out.

1213
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,006
You could go outside and dance, you see.

1214
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,275
-I don't drink, right?
-Yeah.

1215
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,911
In the end,
I was the only one left in the room.

1216
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,246
But it was your birthday.

1217
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,248
I was the only one
who didn't get drunk and go wild.

1218
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,517
That's when I decided
to give up on such parties.

1219
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,552
The soup is amazing.

1220
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,921
My appetite increases
whenever I'm with you.

1221
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,690
That's good to hear.

1222
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,525
We kept it a secret from you, Sook,

1223
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,895
but your costars prepared
a little something for you during the day.

1224
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,029
Are we playing it so soon?

1225
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,465
This might be a good time
to show it to you.

1226
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,168
Hello.

1227
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,103
-Did he come by earlier?
-This is Chimchakman, Sook.

1228
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,207
3 HOURS AGO

1229
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,410
THE FIERY JOURNEY OF
THE ROPED-IN SPECIAL ENVOYS

1230
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,678
You got me confused!

1231
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,880
I could've succeeded.

1232
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,181
-What was it again?
-You failed!

1233
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,682
FAILED

1234
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,384
HE'S FAR FROM CHILL,
UNLIKE HIS NICKNAME

1235
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,187
-I admire your energy.
-I'm usually not this energetic.

1236
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,321
A DIE-HARD GAMER

1237
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,789
AND…

1238
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,827
AN UNEXPECTED GAME COMMANDER

1239
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,230
HIS STRATEGIES WORK ALL THE TIME

1240
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,266
You failed!

1241
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,333
AND YET…

1242
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,770
SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE
GOING WRONG

1243
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,838
Heuningkai.

1244
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,043
-You've got something under your nail?
-Looks that way, right?

1245
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,914
HE'S FITTING IN NO PROBLEM
LIKE HE BELONGED HERE

1246
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,852
You could come join us as a guest later.
We'll prepare a wonderful day for you.

1247
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:35,986
I can join you even now.

1248
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,121
Are you serious?

1249
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,356
But you must have other engagements.

1250
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,927
-Did you really mean what you said?
-He always means what he says.

1251
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,162
-Gosh, Young-hyun.
-Hey, he's here.

1252
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,230
Young-hyun!

1253
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,098
-You really came.
-What's going on?

1254
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,235
-I wanted to congratulate you in person.
-I can't believe what's happening.

1255
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,303
A WONDROUS DAY FOR SOOK

1256
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,705
That's how much Sook means
to her colleagues.

1257
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,974
So many people are eager
to celebrate your milestone, Sook.

1258
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,309
-In fact, there are three.
-Yeah.

1259
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,047
