1
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,907
ROLLING WAVES INVITE YOU TO
THE CITY OF ROMANCE AND PASSION

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,379
THE 2ND LARGEST CITY IN KOREA

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,082
CAST AND CREW OF SCREWBALLS
VISIT BUSAN

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,053
Oh, dear. Goodness.

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,590
ONE FUSSY SMALL BUSINESS OWNER
FROM THE FISH MARKET

6
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:24,824
WALKS DOWN THE STAIRS

7
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,829
Oh, my. Welcome.

8
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,165
Get cheap fresh fish at my stall.
Come this way.

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,700
Welcome.

10
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,568
FRESH FISH COMING YOUR WAY

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,204
Come along. I'll throw in
sea pineapple and sea cucumber.

12
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,306
I've got freebies lined up.

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,741
It's so nice to see you here.

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,044
Jagalchi Market ladies
are Busan's mascots!

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,147
How come there's so little traffic
around Busan Station?

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,048
Jeez.

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,316
Who's that?

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,887
Look, a delinquent is coming our way.

19
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,723
He doesn't look so well.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,857
SWAYING TO THE BEAT

21
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,927
We don't have kids like that
here in Busan.

22
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,596
What's up with him?

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,598
How about some raw fish?

24
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,069
What is he doing?
What's going on with his joints?

25
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,670
Look, your parents are here.

26
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,073
-They're here to see you.
-Well…

27
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,075
Wasn't it embarrassing
to do that in front of them?

28
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,843
I didn't expect it to be so mortifying.

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,878
I honestly didn't think it'd be this bad.

30
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,747
I shielded my eyes desperately.

31
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,949
I couldn't have made it through
without averting my gaze.

32
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:23,883
Your father looked away.

33
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,285
-Ms. Jagalchi!
-Oh, my!

34
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,120
-You're a true Busan lady today.
-You bet.

35
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,656
-My goodness.
-That's 480,000 won per minute.

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:34,160
HERE COMES A MAN WHO IDOLIZED
JANG WOO-YOUNG, BUSAN'S SON

37
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,929
Who's that?

38
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,530
THUMP, THUMP

39
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,965
What's wrong with him?

40
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,066
LOL

41
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,869
Here comes another delinquent.
Are we in for a delinquent special?

42
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,971
Why do all our boys look so off?

43
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,207
Jeez, he's so annoying!

44
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,442
When have I ever walked like that?

45
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,112
I don't get what he's doing with his head.

46
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,246
You might sprain your neck.

47
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,382
-He's got you nailed down.
-Unbelievable.

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,752
Still, I'm so touched.

49
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,088
I never imagined you'd dress up as me.

50
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,392
That's enough.
We have a full day ahead of us.

51
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,560
Don't exhaust yourself.

52
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,630
Good morning.

53
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,399
I'm Woo Hyang-u from 2PM.
Just as my name, I'm ready to turn right.

54
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,135
IMMACULATE PRECISION

55
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,971
Who's that?

56
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,840
-Oh, I know. You're MC Dingdong.
-Dang, you startled me.

57
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,976
You're MC Dingdong, right?

58
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,044
But why would he need the red carpet?

59
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,746
Why is the carpet so short?

60
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,948
That's way too short, no?

61
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,183
SWISH

62
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,885
Did you carry that all the way from Seoul?

63
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,020
STUBBY

64
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,355
I don't get it. What's this about?

65
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,024
Walk over the carpet. Go on.

66
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,827
I got my inspiration from
the Busan International Film Festival.

67
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:41,961
-I see.
-Hold on.

68
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,196
-Incoming.
-A rider's coming.

69
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,297
WELCOME

70
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,832
SPEEDING BY

71
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,568
THIS REQUIRES EXTRA WORK

72
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,036
I need to roll this up.

73
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,605
I'm looking forward
to seeing Jin-kyung today.

74
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,806
She's wearing a penalty costume, right?

75
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,441
-Yeah, she is.
-Right.

76
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,710
The person who places at the bottom

77
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,513
will have to wear a costume
as outlandish as prosthetic makeup…

78
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,749
Her final balance stood at zero.

79
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,950
JIN-KYUNG PLACED LAST

80
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,652
-You won't be disappointed.
-Really?

81
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,955
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?

82
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,824
Jeez, that's so scary!

83
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,826
WAS CHUCKY FROM THIS REGION?

84
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,595
-That's chilling.
-I'm terrified.

85
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,331
-Hold on, let me see.
-Gosh, what a sight.

86
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,633
Why don't you come work for me?
You seem to be handy with knives.

87
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,135
Am I right?

88
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,872
-Wait, I don't like this.
-The costume is supposed to be a penalty.

89
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,174
-She just looks cool.
-That makes it meaningless.

90
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,609
-I agree.
-She looks so good.

91
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,912
Today's dress code is Busan.
What does Chucky have to do with the city?

92
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,048
-I meant to dress up as Busan soju.
-Oh, I see.

93
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:39,185
But Sae-ho suggested that I spice it up
and dress up as Chucky.

94
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,421
-I see.
-But you look so trendy.

95
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,522
We call it a penalty,

96
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,525
but our picking the costume
seems to defeat its purpose.

97
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,261
Look, he's recreated
Woo-young's look perfectly.

98
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,529
But people in Busan…

99
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,233
She's finally catching up.

100
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,135
I bet he thought long and hard
whether to dress up as Sook or me.

101
00:03:56,202 --> 00:04:00,139
He looks so shabby
because his legs are so skinny.

102
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,008
-I know him inside and out, right?
-Yeah.

103
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,244
-That's his look of self-satisfaction.
-I see that.

104
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,511
If you ask me…

105
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,614
-Stop it, will you?
-…that's his best look so far.

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,514
SELF-ABSORBED

107
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,951
Judging by how he's messing around,
he'll collapse by sundown.

108
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,954
Let's get changed now
before we dive into the city.

109
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,656
-Today--
-That's enough for the intro.

110
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,925
-Do we have a uniform--
-You'd better behave, Woo-young.

111
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,560
-Me? Why?
-Your mother is here.

112
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,262
-Your parents are here.
-Right.

113
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,131
-Why don't we greet her together?
-Sure. Hello, ma'am.

114
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,165
FLURRY OF ACTIVITY

115
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,834
-Oh, my.
-Let me greet her properly.

116
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,637
-Hey, go lay out the carpet before her.
-We should invite her here.

117
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,438
-Don't overdo it.
-Take it to her.

118
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,308
THE RED CARPET
IS FINALLY BEING PUT TO GOOD USE

119
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,478
-Let's give her a big hand!
-Hello, ma'am.

120
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,947
NO A-LIST ACTOR IS AS IMPORTANT
AS THIS ESTEEMED GUEST

121
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,315
Thank you for welcoming her.

122
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,984
-We've only heard her voice so far.
-That's right.

123
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,786
-Allow me to greet you properly.
-Oh, my.

124
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,890
GREETINGS FROM HER SON'S CLONE

125
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,259
Ma'am, what do you think?
Does he look like Woo-young?

126
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,296
-He looks much better.
-Goodness.

127
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,065
Isn't it customary for the parents

128
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,200
to give their kid's friends
some pocket money?

129
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,170
THIS IS WHY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL
IN CHOOSING YOUR FRIENDS

130
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,905
AN INVALUABLE GESTURE
OF GOODWILL

131
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,174
I'm sure she'll have something ready.

132
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,077
-Gosh, we're in Busan!
-All right!

133
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,147
I hear Woo-young barely slept
from working on his new album.

134
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,048
Really?

135
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,216
Did you wait
until the last minute or what?

136
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,053
You're finally working
after spending days and nights drinking?

137
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,088
Stop it. It's all a misunderstanding.

138
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,056
A FLOOD OF ACCUSATIONS

139
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,224
Jin-kyung called me out of the blue
two days ago.

140
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,859
She said we should go to Busan early

141
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,195
so we can enjoy drinks here.

142
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,230
Hey, when did I ever say that?

143
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,000
-No wonder you're glowing today.
-She sure loves her booze.

144
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,202
-Did you have fun?
-I didn't phrase it like that.

145
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,771
I only suggested that we get here early
to prepare for the shoot.

146
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,306
What are you talking about?

147
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,742
BECAUSE OF HER SUPPOSED
PREP WORK…

148
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,710
Excuse me.

149
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,678
Oh, dear. My heart.

150
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,013
You look terrifying.

151
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,881
…SHE HAD HANGOVER SOUP
FOR BREAKFAST

152
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,483
You really should
quit drinking, Jin-kyung.

153
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,585
-I'm serious.
-Hear me out.

154
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,454
-I didn't come here to drink.
-Okay.

155
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,856
My plan was to get here early
to make preparations.

156
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,559
-Even the dog doesn't buy that.
-It's barking in protest.

157
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,595
-That dog knows a lie when it hears it.
-Oh, come on.

158
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,464
As expected from Busan's own.

159
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,433
This is the first out-of-town shoot
of Screwballs.

160
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,835
FINALLY READING THE SCRIPT

161
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,003
We're in Busan,
the second largest city in Korea.

162
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,172
-Busan!
-That's Busan for you!

163
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,440
-It's Busan, all right!
-Yeah!

164
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,276
MEET SPRING EARLY
IN THIS SOUTHERN CITY

165
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,614
ENJOY THE CALMING EFFECT
OF THE OCEAN

166
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,084
IN THIS HOMELY YET GRAND CITY

167
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,155
ALONG WITH ITS DELICIOUS CUISINE

168
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,492
THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE IN KOREA

169
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,564
-Sook and Woo-young are from Busan.
-Yeah.

170
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,900
-This must hit differently for you.
-My goodness.

171
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,301
Where exactly are you from?

172
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,404
I was born in Paik Hospital.

173
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,606
-Is that right?
-That's a university hospital.

174
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,408
He's also more or less from Busan.

175
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,309
-I'm a quasi-Busanian.
-He's from the area.

176
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,112
Technically, I'm from Changwon,
but I've been here enough times.

177
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,148
Busan kids look down Changwon kids.

178
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,649
-What, us?
-They see you as bumpkins

179
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,018
-from the backwater.
-I thought we looked down on Busan kids.

180
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,254
-Again, welcome to Busan…
-It's fine.

181
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,822
-…the second largest city in Korea.
-Right.

182
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,691
We chose a heartwarming theme for today.

183
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,627
-Great, we even have nice weather today.
-Right.

184
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,229
Today's theme is "Besties Trip in Busan."

185
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,098
-"Besties Trip"?
-Isn't it heartening?

186
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,966
Today may be therapeutic.

187
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,302
Starting from a foodie tour,

188
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,371
we'll visit all the famous tourist sites.

189
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,406
-Prepare yourselves for a great trip.
-That sounds lovely.

190
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,608
First things first,

191
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,709
let's have puffer fish soup.

192
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,877
-Puffer fish soup?
-That's a great idea.

193
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,913
You must have it when you're in Busan.

194
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,147
Codfish stew too.

195
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,583
-Don't forget wheat noodles.
-Those are great too.

196
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,084
You're not from Busan, actually.

197
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,187
So why are you playing the know-it-all?

198
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,588
-Who do you mean?
-Him.

199
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,823
DON'T PUSH YOURSELF FORWARD

200
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,424
-Are you picking a fight this early?
-Earlier…

201
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,895
I mean, we have a full day ahead of us.
Why would she provoke me this early?

202
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,065
Who made you the expert on Busan?

203
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,366
Don't play the know-it-all.

204
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,501
STAY IN YOUR LANE, MR. CHANGWON

205
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,936
Jin-kyung found her angle for the day.

206
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,039
I've reviewed our show
over the last couple of weeks,

207
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,440
and I've come to wonder

208
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,211
if I was treating Jin-kyung poorly
even for the sake of good banter.

209
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,579
Took you long enough.

210
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,647
-I'm not lying.
-You only realized that?

211
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,783
-Come on, at least I realized that.
-You're just…

212
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,851
Unbelievable.

213
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,320
-Sure, you're so mature.
-Let me share my resolve.

214
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,155
He's my mom's least favorite.

215
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,291
My mom doesn't like you either!

216
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,494
Let me remind you
that this is your first Besties Trip.

217
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,130
We hope that the day's journey
will strengthen your bond.

218
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,867
-Let's hit the road for the foodie tour.
-I'm so thrilled.

219
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,002
-We have a chartered vehicle.
-Oh, really?

220
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,137
WILL THEIR TRIP GO SMOOTHLY?

221
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,273
-How's your YouTube channel going?
-Well…

222
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,274
Is it doing numbers?

223
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,043
-The video we shot together did all right.
-What?

224
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,212
-We should give his channel a boost.
-We should.

225
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,781
-I'm taking it easy.
-Is your subscriber count about 200K?

226
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,783
-About 100K.
-Oh, yeah? You'll gain more soon.

227
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,652
-You're all set if you've hit 100K.
-I know.

228
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,921
That milestone is the biggest challenge.

229
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:42,989
I might take a while.

230
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,293
Woo-jae said he might take a while.

231
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,861
-I might take a while.
-Look at him.

232
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,164
-Must you walk like that?
-When did I ever… I can't even.

233
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,100
THE STAR YOUTUBER WITH
1.26M SUBSCRIBERS ON A STRUT

234
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,735
On one hand, the whole look is touching,

235
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,737
and on the other, it's pitiful.

236
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,907
Is that minibus our ride? That's neat.

237
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,477
SWOOSH

238
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,847
-Goodness. Thank you.
-Is the camera catching this?

239
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,315
Thank you.

240
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,683
Take that away.

241
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,084
Move away.

242
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:13,953
Hurry.

243
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,854
My apologies.

244
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,455
HE'LL BE CARRYING THAT
THE WHOLE DAY

245
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,824
I want hotteok with seed filling.

246
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,761
I'd love to visit
Woo-young's favorite joints too.

247
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,232
I think I had too much
pork and rice soup this morning.

248
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,633
-Are you okay?
-My stomach is growling…

249
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,734
I mean, it's churning.

250
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,102
THE SOUP GAVE HER A STOMACHACHE

251
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,170
Did you eat it alone?

252
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,707
Shall I ask the crew
to get some digestive medicine?

253
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,176
-No, that isn't the issue.
-Oh, really?

254
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,645
-I need to go to the bathroom.
-I see.

255
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,681
YET ANOTHER CAST MEMBER
RECEIVING A CALL OF NATURE

256
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,617
AFTER A LONG RIDE
THROUGH THE FRIENDLY DOWNTOWN…

257
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,285
Where in Busan are we?

258
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,088
What a lovely day.

259
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,324
-You know where we are, don't you?
-Sure.

260
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,260
Watch out.

261
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,897
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

262
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,599
-Hello.
-Welcome. Oh, my gosh!

263
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,833
Hello.

264
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,002
-You're all so welcoming.
-We appreciate it.

265
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,704
THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SHOPPERS
GREET THE CAST WARMLY

266
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,372
Gosh, it's nice to meet you.

267
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,842
This is a traditional market
in the heart of Busan.

268
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,378
Along with Gukje Market
and Jagalchi Market,

269
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,281
Bupyeong Kkangtong Market
is one of Busan's three major markets.

270
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,551
The market earned its nickname
after the Korean War

271
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:23,255
when US troops' canned field rations
were traded here in large quantities.

272
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,125
Being here really makes it feel
like we're in Busan.

273
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,228
-We should get some spicy glass noodles.
-Of course.

274
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,566
Oh, wow. Guys, look here.

275
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,568
I love these flat dumplings.

276
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,603
-They're Daegu's specialty.
-Is that right?

277
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,604
They're selling it right here.

278
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,307
-Those look great too.
-Oh, he's selling them.

279
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,942
-I see them.
-Don't brush them off

280
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,210
right before the dumpling joint.

281
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,112
MY BAD, BUSAN'S FLAT DUMPLINGS
ARE JUST AS AMAZING

282
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,513
-Hello.
-Here in this alley…

283
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,149
-It's bustling with energy.
-Yeah, that phrase comes to mind.

284
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

285
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,485
Jeez, man.

286
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,087
-Hello.
-The market is really full of energy.

287
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,624
What the heck? Don't confuse us!

288
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,527
THIS SHOPKEEPER LOOKS FAMILIAR…

289
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,828
Oh, my, dear!

290
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,830
-Look here.
-You look perfect.

291
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,733
This joint has amazing pancakes.

292
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,902
Oh, man. She's fitting right in.

293
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,203
THE PERFECT FIT
FOR THE KKANGTONG MARKET

294
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,271
BUPYEONG KKANGTONG MARKET

295
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,741
So, what exactly are we having today?
Didn't you say we'd see right away?

296
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,210
BESTIES TRIP IN BUSAN

297
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,081
Since today's theme is Besties Trip,
we chose Busan in particular

298
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,617
as two of you have fond memories here.

299
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
I feel like I could eat a horse now.

300
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,887
The indigestion is getting to me.

301
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,389
-Can I take a bathroom break?
-There's one nearby.

302
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,224
-Take your time.
-Wow, Sae-ho.

303
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,027
AND SO, JIN-KYUNG LEFT
TO TEND TO HER BUSINESS

304
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,566
SHE IS TAKING SO LONG

305
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,135
Don't you think
she deserves an earful for this?

306
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,539
Jin-kyung has a face to save.

307
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,441
What would happen to her image
if she got scolded over nature's call?

308
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,477
-She's back.
-I'm famished.

309
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,247
WAIT AND SEE THE RIPPLE EFFECT

310
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,750
-Starting now,
-They must've prepared a game.

311
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,919
you'll be given free time to go outside.

312
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,523
Buy the food you'd like to try
and bring it back to this room.

313
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,960
We prepared 100,000 won for you.

314
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,361
POCKET MONEY OF 100,000 WON

315
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,496
Do we only get 100,000 won?

316
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,166
That's more than enough
for us to have our fill here.

317
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,936
Please buy enough food
for all five of you to share

318
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,637
and return to this room.

319
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,940
Are we going to move as a group or what?

320
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,007
-Let's split up.
-Okay.

321
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,542
I'll hit Kkangtong Granny's Diner.

322
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,679
WHAT SNACKS WILL THESE IMMATURE
PEOPLE CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES?

323
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,681
Two hotteok with seed filling

324
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,183
-and three with fried eggs, please.
-Sure thing.

325
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,952
-The fried eggs go into the hotteok?
-Yeah.

326
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,221
This is the only place
where you can try this treat.

327
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,156
That's unique.

328
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,291
-Did you invent the menu yourself?
-Yes.

329
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:43,028
-Will you also put in the usual filling?
-Yes.

330
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,397
-I meant the sugary stuff.
-The fried egg is added on top of that.

331
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,399
Oh, wow. That sounds amazing.

332
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,970
TAKE THE GOLDEN-BROWN HOTTEOK

333
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,438
-Do the eggs go inside them?
-Yes.

334
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,940
CUT THEM IN HALF

335
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,008
ADD A FRIED EGG IN EACH

336
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,977
-Oh, wow. How does that work?
-Oh, my.

337
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,779
SALIVATING

338
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,281
Ketchup?

339
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,416
That's insane.

340
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,887
-What's the powder you're sprinkling?
-It's grated Parmesan.

341
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,588
-Parmesan cheese?
-Yes.

342
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,324
-This must be one of a kind.
-I invented it myself.

343
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,260
I bet you'd love it, Woo-jae.

344
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,928
It's right up my alley.

345
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,930
That's just crazy.

346
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,433
KKANGTONG MARKET'S
FRIED PORK RIB

347
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,703
So basically, you fry pork ribs

348
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,340
just like fried chicken, correct?

349
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,076
Wow, spicy glass noodles.

350
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,379
-It's my first time trying this.
-Really?

351
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,849
-It's light but delightful.
-Yeah? I'm dying to try it.

352
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,783
It's not strong.

353
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,355
TTEOKBOKKI

354
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,525
Those fried tofu pockets
might be what I'm looking for.

355
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,361
I want the guys to try these.

356
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,833
Could you recommend the best combo?

357
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,901
Pair the dumplings with seasoned calamari.

358
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,369
-That sounds amazing.
-We'll take that.

359
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,374
-Man, my mouth is watering.
-You must try these fried tofu pockets.

360
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,243
What's taking Woo-jae
and Jin-kyung so long?

361
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,445
I have a feeling they might be
eating something by themselves.

362
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,314
-Oh, that could be it.
-Dang it.

363
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,249
We shouldn't have paired up
those sneaky guys.

364
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,617
You're right about that.

365
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,987
Why don't we have this portion
since we have another?

366
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,890
Doesn't that defeat
the purpose of this Besties Trip?

367
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,291
It's written in huge letters behind us.

368
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,459
We could just take it down.

369
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,560
I really want to try this.

370
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,462
We should eat it warm.
What's taking them so long?

371
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,100
JIN-KYUNG AND WOO-JAE
FINALLY RETURN

372
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,369
-Have your chopsticks ready.
-Go on.

373
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,605
We need one more here.
You can have this.

374
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,073
A FEAST IS PREPARED

375
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,107
We're having a lavish meal.

376
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,310
Let's continue with the Besties Trip.

377
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,814
Can you give us a rundown
on the food you bought?

378
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,516
-I bought fried tofu pockets.
-Fried tofu pockets?

379
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,785
It's a must
if you're visiting Kkangtong Market.

380
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,188
It comes with the fish cake,
rice cake, and soup.

381
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:54,593
Sae-ho and I bought flat dumplings,
raw squid salad, seasoned calamari,

382
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,995
spicy glass noodles,

383
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,164
-and assorted fish cakes.
-A fish cake set.

384
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,735
Jin-kyung and I bought tteokbokki,

385
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,705
hotteok with seed filling,
and hotteok fried eggs.

386
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,973
You got the seed one too?

387
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,509
That over there is the fried pork ribs.

388
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,711
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah.

389
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,679
It looks amazing.

390
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,282
-It's really good.
-So you've tried it?

391
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,117
No, that's what the customers said.

392
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,786
-You ate some, no doubt.
-No doubt.

393
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,489
I'm just repeating
what the customers said.

394
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,257
Shall we dig in?

395
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,294
-Of course not. Just a minute.
-I knew it.

396
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,561
We should've taken a bite earlier.

397
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,030
Woo-jae.

398
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,331
WHAT WAS SHE IMPLYING?

399
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,869
If you think about it,
we might not get to eat later.

400
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,471
-We'll have some money to spare.
-Should we get this?

401
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,941
-How's the sweet rice punch? Let's get it.
-Rice punch sounds nice.

402
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,943
Oh, that's amazing.

403
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,110
YUM

404
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,745
It's authentic garlic sauce.

405
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,047
It's good.

406
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,548
This is awesome.

407
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,716
HE ATE

408
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,784
AND ATE

409
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,485
AND ATE SOME MORE

410
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,255
You really are something.

411
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,591
THEY HAD A FULL-COURSE MEAL

412
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,461
My appetite grows stronger
whenever I'm out here like this.

413
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,462
When you're at a market?

414
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,663
No, the shoot for Screwballs.

415
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,366
THEY THEN RETURNED, HOPING THEIR
MISBEHAVIOR WOULD GO UNNOTICED

416
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,401
CHUCKY AND MR. SMOKY-EYES
ARE FULL

417
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,337
-How silly of you.
-It's okay. You can tell us.

418
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,771
No, I didn't eat anything.

419
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,774
Which is better, the seasoned one
or the unseasoned one?

420
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,743
We got them half in half,
but the unseasoned one is better.

421
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,111
-Oh, yeah?
-Wait.

422
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,347
NO LUCK IN COMMITTING
A PERFECT CRIME

423
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,282
What did you like best
out of these four dishes?

424
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,616
The fried pork ribs.

425
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,819
THEY WERE GOOD…

426
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,589
I'll come clean. I'll tell you the truth.

427
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,292
I honestly didn't want to eat anything.

428
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,362
I had no intent to eat anything,

429
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,930
but Woo-jae insisted.

430
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,932
You know how devious he can be.

431
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,600
He tempted me.

432
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,502
-How is this Besties Trip?
-I did feel hungry,

433
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,904
but I don't approve
of a sneaky guy like him.

434
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,341
With these two paired up,
we'll have endless drama.

435
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,978
If I may be frank
about Jin-kyung's current state,

436
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,447
I'm sure she's ready
to push out everything she ate.

437
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,915
-She ate that much?
-I'm not joking.

438
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,517
You'll still do your best, won't you?

439
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,552
-Of course she will.
-Of course.

440
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,453
Jin-kyung.

441
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,255
Can I take another bathroom break?

442
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,992
-Do you mean that?
-I'm serious. That's how much she ate.

443
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,795
What sort of Besties Trip is this?

444
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,898
You know what?
Let's talk about this while we're at it.

445
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,868
You had me go out to buy all this food

446
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,970
-even as I was wearing a tux.
-Tell them!

447
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,706
-And you're denying me the food?
-Go get them!

448
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,409
-I haven't given the instructions yet.
-You didn't? Guys, let's wait.

449
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,844
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT

450
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,314
You know what? If we have to play a game,
we can just win and enjoy the food.

451
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,250
The game for your lunch is called…

452
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,319
Exclusion Challenge.

453
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,721
"Exclusion Challenge"?

454
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,389
-"Exclusion Challenge"?
-What are we excluding?

455
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,660
I'll present a category for each question.

456
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,898
You will name one item in that category
except the ones that meet my condition.

457
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,200
For instance,
"Name a boy band excepting 2PM."

458
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,203
-Then each of you will name a boy band.
-Oh, got it.

459
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,704
It can't get easier than this.

460
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,275
You will put one food on the line
in each round.

461
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,911
If you win the game,
you can eat it right away.

462
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,647
-We have to stay on our toes.
-From what we saw in the last shoot,

463
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,582
your teamwork has improved immensely.

464
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,616
You got it wrong.

465
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,418
-We've always been a great team.
-Oh, I see.

466
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,420
Considering how great
your teamwork has been,

467
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,189
please answer in a back-and-forth cycle.

468
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,424
-Go easy on us, okay?
-Come on!

469
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,226
Look here, Director.

470
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,395
Let's not do that.

471
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,596
Let's give it a go first.

472
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,932
Just cooperate with him, will you?

473
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,934
THE CHUCKY LADY
IS BEING STRANGELY COOPERATIVE

474
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,403
-You've got to be kidding me!
-Do as he asks.

475
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,672
Go ahead and take a dump already!

476
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,974
I'll take up your offer.
Why not add another cycle?

477
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,677
Oh, no. I don't think these two
are going to do their best.

478
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,347
It won't do to waste the food
in case you fail, right?

479
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,916
-Please come in, Director Kwon.
-There they go again!

480
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,585
Come on, Director Kwon!

481
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,520
A FAMILIAR FACE JOINS THEM

482
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,188
No wonder he got a haircut.

483
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,523
WELL-GROOMED LIGHTING DIRECTOR

484
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,058
-Just a second.
-Yes?

485
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,660
Didn't you used to run a pancake joint?

486
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,596
AREN'T YOU THIS MAN?

487
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,331
Oh, no.

488
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,599
He's not me.

489
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,736
-How strange. You two look alike.
-You look familiar.

490
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,472
What are you going to bet
in the first round?

491
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,274
-Let's bet tteokbokki.
-Let's do that.

492
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,542
It's good, but--

493
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,078
Can you choose something less spicy?
It's my first meal of the day.

494
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,547
-Tteokbokki it is.
-Something bland, please.

495
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,948
-Tteokbokki…
-But…

496
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,017
I want to upset your stomach
with the fried pork ribs.

497
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,319
I know I'm being irksome,
but please don't pick tteokbokki.

498
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,321
Please help me soothe my stomach first.

499
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,223
I came from afar
on an empty stomach this morning.

500
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,025
Let's give his stomach hell with this.

501
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,860
-We'll go with tteokbokki.
-All right, then.

502
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,996
TEARS

503
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,064
I'm going to do my best here.
You know how I am

504
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,599
-when we play games.
-Hey, Jin-kyung.

505
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,434
-Don't fall asleep.
-Here we go.

506
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,003
I'm here to work. I'll stay awake.

507
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,237
AFFECTED BY FOOD COMA

508
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,973
Let's start with Woo-jae.
Here's your first question.

509
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,011
Give me a name of a pop group
except English-based ones.

510
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,315
NON-ENGLISH-BASED
POP GROUP NAMES?

511
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,184
…except English-based ones.

512
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,419
You timed out.

513
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,422
-Hey! Why didn't you answer?
-Dang it!

514
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,325
Sobangcha, Girls' Generation, Three Peers…

515
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,594
-The list goes on and on.
-Unbelievable.

516
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,596
I honestly didn't fumble this on purpose.

517
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,398
-My brain froze.
-I can't believe you.

518
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,333
But you're our expert on K-pop.

519
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,769
I'm dressed as a 2PM member, right?
All I could think of was 2PM.

520
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,204
-I mean…
-Come on.

521
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,104
Let's rearrange your bangs.

522
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,940
Maybe that'll help you
come to your senses.

523
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,075
Wow, I can finally see the world properly.

524
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,745
-Hey! I've been missing out on all this!
-Aren't you handsome!

525
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,048
-Do I give this to Director Kwon?
-Yes, please do that.

526
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,482
Oh, no, I wanted that.

527
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,252
I don't want to start it off.
It's trickier than I thought.

528
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,787
I'll take your place.

529
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,255
LET'S TRY AGAIN
WITH THE NEW LINEUP

530
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,724
-Director Kwon, how is it?
-I bet it tastes great.

531
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,593
-Isn't it amazing?
-It's delicious.

532
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,496
How annoying.
You've become a bigger tease, Director.

533
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,733
WE PREDICT
HE'LL HAVE A FEAST TODAY

534
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,604
Busan's tteokbokki is distinctive.
We only use rice-based tteok in Busan.

535
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,405
We don't use thin ones.

536
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,808
-That makes it amazing.
-We don't favor sticky wheat-based ones,

537
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,910
so Busan's tteokbokki is rice-based.

538
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,712
Can we see a slice of the tteok, please?

539
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,114
My gosh.

540
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,250
That's from a thick rice-based tteok.

541
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,284
It tastes amazing.

542
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,754
-Let's continue.
-Which dish will you bet this time?

543
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,689
How about we bet
and win the flat dumplings?

544
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,091
I've got a good feeling about this.

545
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,092
The flat dumplings?

546
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,761
Or the glass noodles.
They're going to get soggy.

547
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,697
-That's a good point.
-We only have to bet one portion, right?

548
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,966
-We have two portions.
-You can bet one of them.

549
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,768
-Let's bet one, then.
-This one here

550
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,703
-has become a mush.
-He's right.

551
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,605
Why don't we take a bite
to see how mushy it is?

552
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,208
-All right. It's the only way to be sure.
-We can, can't we?

553
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,175
Put your chopsticks down.

554
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,878
-What's going on here?
-We want to check if this is edible.

555
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,912
THAT DIDN'T WORK…

556
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,483
For this question,
I'll count down the seconds faster.

557
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,386
Let me make a prediction here.

558
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,687
I won't have to answer.

559
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,124
-These two will fail to respond.
-Here goes.

560
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,559
-We can relax.
-We won't need to answer.

561
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,197
Here we go. Name a country
except two-syllable ones.

562
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,499
-Italy.
-Canada.

563
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,067
-Ecuador.
-Austria.

564
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,469
You timed out!

565
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,839
-Are you serious? Come on, Chucky.
-Why, you little…

566
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,142
Were you thinking of hitting me with this?

567
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,777
What happened, Chucky?

568
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,379
I didn't have an answer ready
because of what Woo-jae said.

569
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,014
You could've said Korea!

570
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,949
Why did you assure me
we wouldn't have to answer?

571
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,185
At least I did my part, didn't I?

572
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,553
DUMBSTRUCK

573
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,089
-Why didn't you improvise?
-I wasn't even thinking, okay?

574
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,557
-Can we count Jin-kyung out?
-Come out.

575
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,193
-She's too full to be motivated.
-Tell me about it.

576
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,496
Think about it, Jin-kyung.
Can we ever be 100% sure of anything?

577
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,933
-You should've stayed on your toes.
-You shouldn't have said that, then.

578
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,702
I'm sorry. I'll be alert and ready.

579
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,171
-I'm really sorry.
-Give us the same question one more time.

580
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,605
-Let's do that.
-Let's have a do-over.

581
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,941
-Please give us the same question.
-Let's do this.

582
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,209
-The same one?
-Yes, please.

583
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,911
-You want the same one?
-Let's do that

584
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,680
just one more time
so we can all save face.

585
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,982
-All right, then.
-We won't change the lineup.

586
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,720
The three-second time limit
isn't good for my heart, you know.

587
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,656
Name a country except five-syllable ones.

588
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,857
Soviet Union.

589
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,292
Australia.

590
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,460
Canada.

591
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,362
New York.

592
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,262
-Wrong!
-No, the US.

593
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,298
-New York.
-Wrong!

594
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,499
No, the US.

595
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,502
-Did you hear him? New York?
-This is getting so tiresome.

596
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,703
You're unbelievable.

597
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,971
Come on!

598
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
-What was that?
-Hey!

599
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,540
You want a good beating?

600
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,878
CRITICISM FLOODING IN

601
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,713
What were your answers?

602
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,648
Mine was the Soviet Union.

603
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,086
-The Soviet Union was dissolved, okay?
-Ages ago at that.

604
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,688
That's like ancient history.

605
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,057
A BARRAGE OF CRITICISM

606
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,393
-Does it not count?
-Seriously though,

607
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,228
the ban on five-syllable ones
made me fixate on them.

608
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,729
I know, how interesting.

609
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,698
All I could think of
were five-syllable names.

610
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,968
I hear human minds
tend to get fixated on restrictions.

611
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,303
Another spicy dish? What a bummer.

612
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,838
ANYWAY, THE SPICY GLASS NOODLES
ARE LOST

613
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,375
From what I recall,
there's not much that goes into the dish.

614
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,510
It consists of mostly noodles.

615
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,211
-She's right.
-Some vendors add

616
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,046
spring onion and pickled radish.

617
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,282
Back in the day,
it didn't have the red spicy sauce.

618
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,551
When food was scarce,

619
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:43,021
people whipped up the noodles
and wolfed down their meals.

620
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,390
What does it taste like?
Is it sweet-and-sour?

621
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,458
It's incredible.

622
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,462
-Let's bet this next. It's gone soggy.
-We have another bowl of glass noodles.

623
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,997
We've got another serving of this.

624
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,933
-We could bet one of them.
-That's a good idea.

625
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,868
The fried tofu pockets? Understood.

626
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,737
Let's change up the lineup.

627
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,307
-It's tough for the first and the fourth.
-You should go first, Jin-kyung.

628
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,043
No, we can't get started, then.
Come over here, Woo-young.

629
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,613
You really must think so little of me.

630
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,382
LOL

631
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,983
-"We can't even get started."
-Seriously.

632
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,919
-She needs some time to think.
-It hurts.

633
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,820
Here we go.

634
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,155
-Just a second. We've got this, okay?
-Yeah.

635
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,157
-Just do your part.
-Yeah? Got it.

636
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,892
ROUND 3: FRIED TOFU POCKETS

637
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,527
Give me a brand except four-syllable ones.

638
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,229
Haitai.

639
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,697
-Nongshim.
-Jambangee.

640
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,833
-Binggrae.
-Shinsaegae.

641
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,367
-Daewoo.
-Otoki.

642
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,802
-Dongsuh Foods Corp.
-Wrong!

643
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,804
-That's a four-syllable brand.
-Oh, shoot!

644
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,174
We were so close to winning.

645
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,743
WILL THEY BE ABLE
TO EAT ANYTHING TODAY?

646
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,911
I only had one answer ready.

647
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,013
-We made it pretty far, though.
-Just one.

648
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,349
Okay, let's forget that this happened.

649
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,686
Give Director Kwon the fried tofu pockets.

650
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,221
I should've just said Dongsuh.

651
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,856
-What are you doing?
-This is a pocket too.

652
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,190
Don't try to fool us.

653
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,959
Way to go.

654
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,927
Great work, bro!

655
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,698
-We almost had it.
-You're right about that.

656
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,500
Try the fried tofu pockets, Director Kwon.

657
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,468
ANOTHER DELICACY FROM BUSAN,
FRIED TOFU POCKETS

658
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,070
SLURP

659
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,238
HAPPY

660
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,640
He's such a tease. Come on, Director Kwon!

661
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,710
-Can you try one in one big bite?
-Take one out in this bowl

662
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,446
and add about four spoonfuls of the soup
to keep it moist.

663
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,114
-Just pour it.
-Right, do that.

664
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,549
-Is that right?
-Go ahead.

665
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,518
-Then, open up the pocket.
-It must be so warm.

666
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,786
-Open it up?
-Yeah. Use your chopsticks.

667
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,755
-Yes, ma'am.
-It'll be heavenly.

668
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,025
The delicious seasoning inside
will spread to the soup.

669
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,960
At this rate,
you'll end up taking it from him.

670
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,162
Let it spread, okay?

671
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,899
-Give it a stir with your chopsticks.
-Shall I turn it upside down?

672
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,267
Try the soup again.

673
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,735
It will taste different.

674
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,404
PRO TIP: STIR A POPPED POCKET
AND DRINK THE SOUP FIRST

675
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,672
-It's better, right?
-Yeah.

676
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,140
-The seasoning…
-It's perfect, isn't it?

677
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,277
Now, you can wolf down the noodles.

678
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,313
All right. You can go back
to your game now.

679
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,181
HEH

680
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,584
I appreciate your tip.

681
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,287
I'll enjoy this.
Let's enjoy this fabulous dish!

682
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,788
He's ticking me off.

683
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,390
Eat with gusto.

684
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,828
-Let's succeed and get the dumplings.
-Let's do this.

685
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,064
-Okay, we're getting those dumplings.
-The flat dumplings.

686
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,933
-The flat dumplings? All right.
-All right.

687
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,668
I'll flatten you this time.

688
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,537
ROUND 4, FLAT DUMPLINGS
AND SEASONED CALAMARI

689
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,407
Give me an idiom
except ones that mention animals.

690
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,344
-Come on, do it.
-Just say whatever.

691
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,479
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

692
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,014
A fool is wise in his own eyes.

693
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,616
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

694
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,618
Even if a tiger…

695
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,121
WEEPS

696
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,856
Even if a tiger…

697
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,262
Are you kidding me?

698
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,998
Why is this so difficult?

699
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,535
What I had in mind was, "Treat others
the way you want to be treated."

700
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,571
That's no excuse
for calling out for a tiger.

701
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,240
WHAT A HEADACHE

702
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,809
Our minds just keep going blank.

703
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,877
It's as if our minds are trapped.

704
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,379
Look at this generous portion.

705
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,047
DIRECTOR KWON IS HAVING
HIS FILL TODAY

706
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,582
Shall we bet the glass noodles?

707
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,351
-Let's do that.
-All right.

708
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,152
What a shame.

709
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,521
We're faced with an unexpected setback.

710
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,257
-Were we always this bad?
-Our apologies, Netflix.

711
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,859
I'll give you an easy one this time.

712
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,029
-If that's the case, let's bet fried pork.
-Yeah, let's do that.

713
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,999
-No, Sae-ho. Don't.
-If it's easy, we should gamble.

714
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,268
I mean, if we're likely to win,
we can bet whatever.

715
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,304
That's why I'm going for the tastiest one.

716
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,572
We get everything with one win.

717
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,707
-No, we only get that one dish.
-Sae-ho's right.

718
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,310
Those bangs must be
messing up your mind badly.

719
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,181
-Hang on. So if we win…
-We can win or lose one dish at a time.

720
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,917
If we win, we get one dish?

721
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,085
Yeah.

722
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,921
-Is that how it works?
-Yeah.

723
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,591
I guess your eyesight
impacts your hearing.

724
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,492
His sight is the issue?

725
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,661
That was my challenge
during the promotion of "Heartbeat."

726
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,995
I couldn't communicate with others.

727
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,164
-Do the bangs make you zone out?
-Exactly!

728
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,165
I got it now.

729
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,733
How about the rice cake sticks?

730
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,001
-I want that.
-Bet something else?

731
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,470
-What should we choose next?
-I think we'll get to eat it.

732
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,738
Let's swap our seats, then.

733
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,473
Oh, no. I don't want that spot.

734
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,908
-I'll take Sae-ho's place.
-Okay.

735
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,077
You come sit here.
Go take his spot, Sae-ho.

736
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,579
But guys, if we lose this…

737
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,149
-That's enough. We're going big.
-He promised us an easy question.

738
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,218
I've tried all other dishes
except for the fried pork.

739
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,953
It wasn't around back in my day.

740
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,188
-Here's an easy question.
-Focus!

741
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,256
It will be easy.

742
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,892
I can say so with certainty
because you've already done it.

743
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,093
ROUND 5, FRIED PORK RIB

744
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,428
Give me an idiom
except ones that mention animals.

745
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,265
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

746
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,300
-Sook, your turn.
-A fool is wise in his own eyes.

747
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,835
-Woo-young.
-Where there's smoke, there's fire.

748
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,670
-Woo-jae.
-When the cat is away…

749
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,771
Wrong!

750
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,707
-Oh, that's an animal.
-Hey!

751
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,244
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

752
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,613
What's wrong with you, Woo-jae?

753
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,450
A TRAITOR WHO COST THEM
THE FRIED PORK

754
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,119
-Put in some effort, okay?
-I seriously didn't mean--

755
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,387
The others should eat too.

756
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,023
-That was difficult. Give us another shot.
-Hey, take a seat.

757
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,158
EVERYONE, SETTLE DOWN
AND TAKE A SEAT

758
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,729
These guys named my top three choices.
What was I supposed to do?

759
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,531
Two heads are better than one.
God helps those who help themselves.

760
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,301
If you're so knowledgeable,
why did you call a tiger earlier?

761
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,236
REMEMBER, WE'RE HERE
TO CELEBRATE YOUR FRIENDSHIP

762
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,004
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Let's face it.

763
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,372
Even if we came up with five idioms…

764
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,174
-We can't think of more than that.
-No way.

765
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,543
-These guys are right.
-This is way too difficult.

766
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,379
Why do so many Korean sayings
feature animals?

767
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,381
So we're giving up the pork?

768
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,917
-Hold on. Give us one more shot!
-This doesn't work that way.

769
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,652
-Wait!
-This is so improper.

770
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,187
Thank you. Goodness.

771
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,522
-Stick to the rules.
-Wait, Director.

772
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,658
How proper
was your long bathroom break, then?

773
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,127
SNORT

774
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,262
Give us one more chance. Just one more.

775
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,231
We won't ask for more.

776
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,701
All right.
I get how badly you want to try that.

777
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,470
-Please…
-It's our last shot. Don't beg for more.

778
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,074
We've practically begged
for another chance, and if anyone fails…

779
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,909
The pressure is insane.

780
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,444
-Don't worry. You've got this.
-That'll be it then.

781
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,446
You need to keep it up, Woo-jae.

782
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,314
That's the critical point right there.

783
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,249
Here we go.

784
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,417
ROUND 5, ONE FINAL SHOT

785
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,620
Name a celebrity of the opposite sex

786
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,222
who you think you might have a shot with
except for your Screwballs castmates.

787
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:52,991
WHAT?

788
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,193
How could you ask such a thing
to a married guy?

789
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,063
-What do you think you're playing at?
-No, rein it in.

790
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,532
HAHAHA

791
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,867
-Song Eun-i. My answer is Eun-i.
-All right.

792
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,902
-Gu Bon-seung.
-Okay.

793
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,438
THEY BLURTED OUT RANDOM NAMES
TO WIN THE FRIED PORK

794
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,008
AND ALL THEIR ANSWERS
WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE OFFENSE

795
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,009
Jang Do-youn.

796
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,210
NO WAY, BUT OKAY

797
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,812
WE'RE CUTTING YOU SOME SLACK
OUT OF PITY

798
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,948
Seriously, though.
I only got married last year!

799
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,083
IF NOT FOR THAT QUESTION,
YOU COULD NEVER EAT ANYTHING

800
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,019
-So you two aren't joining us?
-Oh, man…

801
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,453
-My gosh.
-Let me take a bite.

802
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,391
MY LOVE, FRIED PORK RIBS

803
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,993
Goodness, this is great. It's amazing.

804
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,295
Are you serious?

805
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,630
It's good, isn't it?

806
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,233
-It's delicious.
-Are you enjoying it?

807
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,234
Yeah, it's great.

808
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,436
So was the hotteok with seed filling.

809
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,738
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

810
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,308
That's enough, Jin-kyung.

811
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,576
HEH

812
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:45,710
A BITE FOR WOO-JAE

813
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,813
Out of 44 years of my life,

814
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,448
I've never tried anything like this.

815
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,416
It's so good.

816
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,117
It's so good.

817
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,486
-Let's bet this.
-No, the fried tofu pockets.

818
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,721
The fried tofu pockets?

819
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,056
-Tofu pockets?
-It's still warm.

820
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,391
-Shall we, then?
-Let's lose the idioms.

821
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,426
Here goes.

822
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,795
Name a snack except imported ones.

823
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,597
Twisted donut.

824
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,999
Rice cakes.

825
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,000
Tteokbokki.

826
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,435
Rice puffs.

827
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,870
I've been meaning to say that!

828
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,605
I've been meaning to say that!

829
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,675
Go sit somewhere else!

830
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,911
-Seriously, that was mine.
-Don't blame me.

831
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,647
When he said the one I'd been thinking of,

832
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,849
my mind went blank.

833
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,018
Here's what I'll do from now on.

834
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,821
If I fail to answer,
I'll yell, "I meant to say that!"

835
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,256
-Jin-kyung.
-I'll do the same.

836
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,792
The options are endless. Injeolmi,
yakgwa, cinnamon punch, rice punch…

837
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,995
You could've named anything here
like hotteok.

838
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,930
WHAT ARE THESE
IF NOT KOREAN SNACKS?

839
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,031
-Tteokbokki.
-Fried tofu pocket.

840
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,233
I was so set on using
rice puffs as my answer,

841
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,203
but he just took it from me.
That can drive anyone mad.

842
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,005
You want to go first, Jin-kyung?

843
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,707
-Yeah, you should go first.
-Let's do that.

844
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,942
LET'S PREVENT A BLAME GAME

845
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,277
Let's try that again.

846
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,781
-Businesses operate on their own accord.
-How shameless.

847
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,117
Let's give Jin-kyung
a chance to save face.

848
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,052
-You segued into it so smoothly.
-Just one more time.

849
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,189
What others said about you was all true.

850
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,926
-You're a gentleman.
-He sure is one.

851
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,128
Is that the same thing?

852
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,830
YOU ARE NOT GETTING THAT DO-OVER

853
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,234
-What are you going to bet this time?
-We had plenty of food.

854
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,103
-We'll bet the glass noodles.
-This? Okay, the noodles.

855
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,005
We'll start from Jin-kyung this time.

856
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,440
ROUND 7, SPICY GLASS NOODLES

857
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,609
Name an instant noodle brand
except three-syllable ones.

858
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,813
-Except three-syllable ones?
-You've got to be kidding me!

859
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,516
Except three-syllable ones? Got it.
Chapagetti.

860
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,450
Ansung Noodle Soup.

861
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,518
Shin Ramyun Black.

862
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,420
Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup.

863
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,489
Did you really have to say that?

864
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,292
-How could you?
-Are you for real?

865
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,729
-Why would you say that?
-So you're blaming me too?

866
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,830
THERE'S THE BLAME GAME AGAIN

867
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,734
You should at least have
three answers ready.

868
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,803
The others mentioned all of them.
Chapagetti…

869
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,438
Chapagetti… Could I have said Jjajaroni?

870
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,273
SPICY GLASS NOODLES ARE LOST

871
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,808
This really is so challenging.

872
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,509
-Let's bet the fish cakes.
-You know what?

873
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,179
I don't think we'll get to eat anymore.

874
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,247
-Let's bet fish cakes.
-The fish cakes.

875
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,682
The assorted fish cakes, right?

876
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,118
But the hotteok…
Having watched how they were made,

877
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,320
I can tell you how amazing they are.

878
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,922
-They cut it open.
-Okay.

879
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,992
It's like the LASIK surgery
where our cornea is cut open.

880
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,028
Then they get the fried eggs
that they prepared.

881
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,329
Then, she adds it to the cake.

882
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,831
-You following me?
-We should really try that.

883
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,233
And then a variety of seasonings
goes on the fried egg,

884
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,937
topped off with grated cheese.
Then, they close it back up.

885
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,605
-Let us have that.
-Without the quiz.

886
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,173
-Without the quiz?
-Yeah.

887
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,675
WHAT? CAN'T WE DO THAT?

888
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,577
-I think we went too far.
-Did we?

889
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,413
NO HARM IN TRYING, RIGHT?

890
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,814
Here's your question.

891
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,949
Let's do this.

892
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,219
-Name a movie except ones in Korean.
-Damn it!

893
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,587
Jaws.

894
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,288
Jaws 2.

895
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,190
-Batman.
-Iron Man.

896
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,191
Iron Man 2.

897
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,259
Superman.

898
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,193
Batman 2.

899
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,262
Batman 3.

900
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,297
Catwoman. That works, right?

901
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,232
You've got it.

902
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,402
CELEBRATION IS IN ORDER

903
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,438
OH, YEAH!

904
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,141
THEY PULLED THROUGH
BY RELYING ON SEQUELS…

905
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,876
But the Batman series is indeed a trilogy.

906
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,744
-It is.
-Yeah.

907
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,846
What did we bet this time?
Was it the hotteok?

908
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,515
-Oh, right.
-We did bet these.

909
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,682
These, right?

910
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,618
-Yeah.
-Sure.

911
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,219
Yes, you're right.

912
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,922
Wait, wasn't it the assorted fish cakes?
It was the fish cake set!

913
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,390
Take the fish cakes. Jeez.

914
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,958
You can never trust those liars.

915
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,094
What a shame. We almost had him.

916
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,431
It's just that we had a lot of fish cakes
earlier back at the market.

917
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,599
We were so close. We almost had him.

918
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,369
How is the fish cake so good
even when it's gone cold, Sook?

919
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,072
MM… YOU'RE RIGHT

920
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,840
-I'm so bummed about the noodles.
-Look.

921
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,009
The ones made with white fish
are the best.

922
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,611
I prefer the classic fish cakes

923
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,480
compared to the ones with fillings.

924
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,881
Not that you care.

925
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,117
-The ones made with white fish?
-I'm too full to have another bite.

926
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,185
SHOOTS DAGGERS

927
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,654
-You're so annoying.
-We did wonder what took you so long.

928
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,255
They took their sweet time.

929
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:55,259
I ran over to get the food here
before it went cold just for you guys.

930
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,428
Sae-ho and I waited an hour for you two.

931
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,996
Be careful about who you befriend.

932
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,465
I really had no plots in mind.

933
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,201
But hanging around with a sneaky guy
has turned me into a sneaky person.

934
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,869
We only ate a little.

935
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,338
See for yourselves later.
You'll be surprised.

936
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,640
WE BEG YOUR PARDON?

937
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,908
We only have one menu left.

938
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,410
-Which is it?
-Those over there.

939
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,511
-No.
-We have the rice cake sticks.

940
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,780
-Are we including those too?
-And hotteok.

941
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,816
-Shall we bet hotteok?
-All right. Let's go for it.

942
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,319
We have to eat these.
We must win this time.

943
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,122
If we don't, I'll drop by the market
before going back to Seoul tomorrow.

944
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,023
-Are you ready?
-Yes!

945
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,291
-Here goes.
-Fire away.

946
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,293
ROUND 9, HOTTEOK

947
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,497
Name a profession
except three-syllable ones.

948
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,632
-I can't think of any.
-Comedian.

949
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,800
Renovator.

950
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,069
Sweets vendor.

951
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,871
-Wrong.
-That's three syllables.

952
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,205
-Oh, you're right.
-Dude.

953
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,108
Singer, actor… Comedian was mentioned.

954
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,011
If you had to go in that direction,
why not a rice punch vendor?

955
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,980
-Was that your only choice?
-Of all the things to say.

956
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,915
I mean, you could've said something else.

957
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,050
Kkangtong Market is famous
for its treats, so…

958
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,986
Sweets vendor.

959
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,087
TELEPATHY ATTEMPT

960
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,221
Excuse me?

961
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,122
Let's have a do-over.

962
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,960
LOL

963
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,128
Let's do this.

964
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,897
You have four hotteok, right?

965
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,131
You can keep one behind.

966
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,766
-Let us keep two.
-Just one.

967
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,569
-You can't whisper into getting your way.
-He's giving us two.

968
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,738
-Leave two behind.
-In that case,

969
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,139
take these two.

970
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,042
TWO HOTTEOK GO TO DIRECTOR KWON

971
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,578
ONE MORE HOTTEOK IS CONFISCATED

972
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,880
You've become heartless.

973
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:24,849
Let's do this.

974
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,851
Yeah, let's not fool around anymore.

975
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,085
It's not like we have much left.

976
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,321
-We haven't been fooling around.
-Have you been fooling around?

977
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,256
Yeah, but I'll straighten my act now.

978
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,025
-Do you want to eat those?
-Yeah, I apologize.

979
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,426
They were really good.

980
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,461
So you tried them already?

981
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:38,896
Yeah.

982
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,966
How much did you eat? Seriously.

983
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,734
-The fried pork--
-I'll come clean.

984
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,369
We had everything
like we were at a buffet.

985
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,405
You're no friends of ours.

986
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,508
We're no expert to begin with,
and those two are sabotaging us.

987
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,143
Come on, I'm giving my all here.

988
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,378
-I'll do my best this time.
-I'm really trying.

989
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,713
Hit us with your question.

990
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,681
Here goes.

991
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,518
Name a Korean drama series
except five-syllable ones.

992
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,587
Sandglass.

993
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,288
-Temptation of Wife.
-Wrong!

994
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,392
DID YOU LOVE THE REVENGE STORY
OF THE LADY WITH THE DRAWN MOLE?

995
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,561
WHY DID I JUST SAY THAT?

996
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,829
Darn it!

997
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,166
THIS GUY IS FRUSTRATED TOO

998
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,735
You managed to name one
with exactly five-syllables.

999
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,271
You could've said The Trauma Code
or When Life Gives You Tangerine.

1000
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,206
You had plenty of options.

1001
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,107
I KNOW, OKAY?

1002
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,175
Star in My Heart.

1003
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:25,977
That's five syllables, no?

1004
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,313
What was that? Can't you count?

1005
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,982
FLABBERGASTED

1006
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,918
-Star in My Heart. Four syllables.
-Star in My Heart.

1007
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,087
IT'S OKAY, KEEP IT UP, MY SON!

1008
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,723
I'll give you a choice.
If you want the hotteok really badly,

1009
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,358
you can give us the rice cake sticks.

1010
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,326
-Okay, we'll give you those.
-Yeah, take those.

1011
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,828
I wonder what they taste like.

1012
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,029
What will you bet this time?

1013
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,465
-We only have one hotteok left.
-Hotteok.

1014
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,267
-Don't forget this.
-We have the rice punch.

1015
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:50,701
ROUND 11, RICE PUNCH

1016
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,104
Name a Korean drama series
except three-syllable ones.

1017
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,438
The Final Match.

1018
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,773
-Temptation of Wife.
-All In.

1019
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,074
The Trauma Code.

1020
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,309
My Love from the Star.

1021
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,211
Star in My Heart.

1022
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,280
-Don't Dare to Dream.
-When Life Gives You Tangerines.

1023
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,614
Casi…

1024
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,949
Casi…

1025
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,617
How dare you!

1026
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,952
Wait, I'm not done yet.

1027
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,657
How will you turn that around?
What do you have in mind?

1028
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,958
Let's hear it.

1029
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,693
TEARS

1030
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,362
My mind went black at the end.

1031
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,699
You must be full.

1032
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,167
Did you down that bottle in one go?

1033
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,468
HEHE DONE EATING

1034
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,369
You startled me.

1035
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,470
ONLY ONE HOTTEOK REMAINS

1036
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,838
I have a request to make.

1037
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,774
-Let's just get it over with.
-All right.

1038
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,675
Having watched…

1039
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,978
THEY ALL HAVE BEEN DYING TO TRY
THE HOTTEOK WITH FRIED EGG

1040
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,346
-Let us have that.
-Without the quiz.

1041
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,316
Since this will be the final round,
I want to change my seat.

1042
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,718
-I can't handle the pressure.
-All right. Let's switch.

1043
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,353
-Come here.
-Are you up for this?

1044
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,188
I don't mind the switch,

1045
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,856
-but it's equally rough here.
-It sure is.

1046
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,060
Hearing the others say what you have
in mind can really shake you up.

1047
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,929
-I find it too demanding here.
-Okay, then.

1048
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,131
Are you sure about this?
We were doing fine.

1049
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,566
This spot is equally tough.

1050
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,368
-Fire away.
-All right.

1051
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,469
Let's turn this around!

1052
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,403
Here goes.

1053
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,771
FINAL ROUND,
HOTTEOK WITH FRIED EGG

1054
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,908
Name a pop group or a band
except the five-syllable ones.

1055
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,143
-A group or a band?
-Sechskies.

1056
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,211
BIBI.

1057
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,546
-Fin.K.L.
-BIGBANG.

1058
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:09,613
LE SSERAFIM.

1059
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,116
ChoNam Zone.

1060
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,984
-Green Zone.
-Baby VOX.

1061
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,786
-Hy-five.
-Enjoy your hotteok.

1062
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,754
SUCCESS

1063
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,422
Who are Hy-five, by the way?

1064
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,491
They're a virtual band.

1065
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,560
You thought of a virtual band?
Kudos to you, dude.

1066
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,261
A VIRTUAL BAND CREATED BY HY

1067
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,529
THAT DEBUTED
IN SEPTEMBER 19, 2021

1068
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,331
IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE WOO-JAE KNEW THEM,

1069
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,399
BUT HIS ANSWER STILL COUNTS

1070
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,935
My gosh. Look at this.

1071
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,671
-It has the egg and the seed fillings.
-They're all mixed up.

1072
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,808
THEY FINALLY GET A TASTE
OF THE HOTTEOK WITH FRIED EGG

1073
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,580
THEY'RE SHARING IT
EVEN THOUGH THEY ONLY HAVE ONE

1074
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,417
It's not a typical hotteok,
but I can't call it a toast either.

1075
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,453
-Gosh, it's so good.
-My goodness.

1076
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,523
It's like a toast but also hotteok.

1077
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,658
-It's gone cold, but it's good.
-It tastes like a burger too.

1078
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,894
If it tastes this good when it's cold,

1079
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,029
it'd be amazing when it's piping hot.

1080
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,500
I'm at a loss for words.
The hotteok is just amazing.

1081
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,635
Thanks to your efforts,

1082
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,038
we were able to explore
the charms of Bupyeong Kkangtong Market.

1083
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,908
For the next leg of our journey,
we'll split into two teams.

1084
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,944
Your first option is trekking.

1085
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,880
-I'm not good at trekking.
-Hold on.

1086
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,047
I'm no trekker.

1087
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,683
Your second option is riding.

1088
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,619
-That's better.
-Just a second.

1089
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:25,956
-That might include something extreme.
-Yeah, it's not a car ride.

1090
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,092
There's no extreme sports venue in Busan.

1091
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,594
It could be a surprisingly simple one.

1092
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,464
We might be asked to find the love
of our lives and ride into the sunset.

1093
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,365
Oh, wow.

1094
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,167
Wait, I'm a married man. Stop it.

1095
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,835
You were intrigued, weren't you?

1096
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,240
I was reminded of the good old times
with my wife, that's all.

1097
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,408
You're smooth.

1098
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,011
It's time to make a decision.
Let's decide by a show of hands.

1099
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,179
Trekking or riding?

1100
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,048
-Who wants to ride?
-Those who do, raise your hands.

1101
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,683
Those who want to trek, raise your hands.

1102
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,385
2 FOR TREKKING, 2 FOR RIDING

1103
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,286
What about you?

1104
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,188
I'll go with riding… Wait, darn it.

1105
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,457
The other side will only offer
a roller coaster ride to hell.

1106
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,692
HAHAHA

1107
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,195
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR

1108
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,163
Let's hear Woo-young's decision.
Three, two, one.

1109
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,531
-Riding.
-Riding, it is.

1110
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,633
Let's depart for the next segment.

1111
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,001
TREKKERS - RIDERS

1112
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,636
There might be more to it
than just trekking.

1113
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,674
Dongpirang and Haeparang Trails
do start from this spot.

1114
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,708
WHAT MISSIONS AWAIT THEM?

1115
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,314
How many hints did you get?

1116
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,549
-What?
-You've got nothing?

1117
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,219
AN INCREDIBLE HEIGHT

1118
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,687
Here's one going your way.

1119
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:33,324
THE CAST MEMBERS SEEM
TO BE FACED WITH A DIFFICULTY

1120
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,227
We were supposed to work together!

1121
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,261
ZIP LINE COURSE'S SECRET

1122
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,199
