1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs.

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,472
It's going to be
Team Teto versus Team Egen.

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,941
You're going to play team games.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,342
-We need one more person.
-We're one man short.

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,844
Hello.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,612
THE ORIGINAL TETO LADY, CHO HYE-LYUN

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,014
Congrats

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,148
on coming back.

9
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,616
HER TETO CONGRATULATIONS ARE MIND-BLOWING

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,485
TEAM TETO WITH COMEDIANS

11
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,686
Follow me, guys.

12
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,454
-Are we playing games?
-Yes.

13
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,689
MEANWHILE, TEAM EGEN ISN'T ALL SURE

14
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,624
Woo-jae, we can do it.

15
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,027
A humiliating penalty
awaits the losing team.

16
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,762
VERY WORRIED

17
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,096
THE FIRST GAME IS A PILLOW FIGHT

18
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,499
-Stay still.
-No. You can do it.

19
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,367
Jin-kyung will fall on her own.

20
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,703
POW

21
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,804
WHERE DID HIS DETERMINATION GO?

22
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,938
SWINGS IN THE AIR

23
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,075
SECOND WIN AFTER THE BEATING

24
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,143
Sae-ho!

25
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,812
Why am I…

26
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,880
THIRD WIN AFTER THE BEATING

27
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,715
Sae-ho won three times.

28
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,316
I'm so jealous! I want to win too.

29
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,719
GAME OVER WITHOUT GETTING TO HIT AT ALL

30
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,922
-The first game's winner is Team Teto.
-Teto.

31
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,157
WILL HE GET TO SAVE FACE?

32
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,827
The pillow fight was
to show off your Teto level,

33
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,963
and now, it's time
to show off your Egen level.

34
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,365
Yes, to be fair.

35
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,535
We've prepared a game
that requires delicacy and focus.

36
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,438
It's called Spot the Difference.

37
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,841
You'll be given a theme
for a short role play.

38
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,510
Act based on the given theme

39
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,212
and stop at a certain point.

40
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,148
The other team will take time to observe.

41
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,683
-Oh, make changes.
-Then, you'll change positions

42
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,418
or props.

43
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,921
After that, the other team will need

44
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,423
to correctly guess five differences.

45
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,524
-Gosh.
-It might be hard.

46
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,861
-Yes, hard.
-Can we change facial expressions?

47
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,665
-The viewers will have to notice.
-So, it has to be evident.

48
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,599
-That's right.
-Okay.

49
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,967
-We can do it.
-Obvious differences.

50
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,870
Here's the first situation.

51
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,538
You're two teams of three

52
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,307
with mixed genders, right?

53
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,509
Thus, I believe this can be done.

54
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,212
It's a situation where one spots
the other's cheating.

55
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,148
-Please discuss with your teammates…
-Separately.

56
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,683
-…away from the other team.
-Okay.

57
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,585
Who wants to be the cheater?

58
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,954
-You should do it.
-Me?

59
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,489
-I'll be your lover.
-Okay.

60
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,523
LOVER, CHEATER

61
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,591
TEAM EGEN ONLY DECIDES ON ROLES

62
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,959
-How about we do this?
-What?

63
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,328
"Hey, do you have a girlfriend?"

64
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,097
-"Of course I don't."
-"Same here."

65
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,766
"I've mustered up my courage
to tell you how I feel."

66
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,968
"Is it our first day together?"

67
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,002
And we'll…

68
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,037
This is funny.

69
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,739
CHUCKLES

70
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,975
They're way too enthusiastic.

71
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,944
-After all…
-Maybe they're just chit-chatting.

72
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,680
…they're comedians.
They automatically start a meeting.

73
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,251
It's like they're talking
to catch up with each other.

74
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,019
Do we improvise?

75
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,421
-Us?
-Let's just improvise.

76
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,057
Okay, hiding and…

77
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,692
He's watching us.

78
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,629
-What are you looking at?
-What are you looking at?

79
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,998
Maybe it's because you're comedians,

80
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,900
but I see you have a meeting
for something like this.

81
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,368
-Of course.
-It's a must.

82
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,435
Automatically, at that.

83
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,471
-Like a comedian's room.
-We need a plot.

84
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,574
Can we check the props?

85
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,209
-Sure.
-Right.

86
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,244
THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE COMEDY FIELD

87
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,247
IS 85 YEARS ALL TOGETHER

88
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,650
-It'd be too obvious.
-Too obvious.

89
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,285
THEY EVEN CHECK THE PROPS

90
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,853
-That will do.
-Okay. Let's go.

91
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,288
All good.

92
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,156
We're good now.

93
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,558
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

94
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,792
SPOT THE DIFFERENCE BEGINS NOW

95
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,929
For your information, it's up to you

96
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,598
to decide on a still scene.

97
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,867
Oh, do we say stop
in the middle of acting?

98
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,769
-That's right.
-Oh.

99
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,338
Do we go first? Or do they…

100
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,674
-Let's start with Team Teto.
-Okay.

101
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,409
Memorize.

102
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,443
Let's memorize a person each.

103
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,814
MY MAN'S WOMAN
PREVIOUSLY

104
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,284
SAE-HO AND HYE-LYUN MET AT A DANCE CLUB

105
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,588
AND STARTED A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

106
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,855
Hello.

107
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,857
Hello.

108
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,559
BUT LATELY, SAE-HO BEGAN

109
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,328
TO HAVE FEELINGS
HE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE

110
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,430
MISTRESS, KIM SOOK

111
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,665
CHEATER, CHO SAE-HO

112
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,802
SAE-HO'S GIRLFRIEND, CHO HYE-LYUN

113
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,471
Everyone, the play begins now.

114
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,839
HOW WILL THIS CRAZY LOVE STORY END?

115
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,374
Come on. It's okay.

116
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,875
-What is it?
-No one's here.

117
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,144
-Come on in.
-No.

118
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,646
-Sook.
-I shouldn't be at your place.

119
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,747
Stand there.

120
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,482
What are you doing?

121
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,086
-Really…
-Geez. What are you doing?

122
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,891
It's already been 50 days

123
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,593
since we started dating.

124
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,529
-Sae-ho, this is too soon.
-What is he, a gambler?

125
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,200
We started dating just recently.

126
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,104
With Sook every day

127
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,439
CHUCKLES

128
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,908
I like you so much.

129
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,177
-Sook.
-What?

130
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,346
THIS IS EXCITING

131
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,614
-Sook.
-What?

132
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,182
It's just

133
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,418
us in this house.

134
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,821
How about a kiss?

135
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,692
What do you say? We're alone here.

136
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,594
What is this, a proposal?

137
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:55,995
Sook.

138
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,898
-I like you.
-Me too.

139
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,767
What are you doing?

140
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,402
Oh, my.

141
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,537
What are you doing?

142
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,039
SAE-HO'S LOVER SUDDENLY SHOWS UP

143
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,573
SWINGS

144
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,142
-What is this?
-Who is she?

145
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,011
-What is it?
-M-Mom!

146
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,646
-I'm your mom?
-Mom.

147
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,114
Say hello, Sook. This is my mom.

148
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,150
-Mom.
-Oh, hello.

149
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,918
-Your mom?
-Mom…

150
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,286
-Who is it?
-Ow.

151
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,387
OW

152
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,622
Mom, you said…

153
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,157
-Who is she?
-…you'd go meet your friend.

154
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,491
Mom, say hello. She's…

155
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,895
SECOND PUNISHMENT

156
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,962
-Who is she?
-Ma'am.

157
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,464
-Say hello, Sook.
-Who is she?

158
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,665
He's a piece of trash.

159
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,069
I wouldn't say much
if you cheated with someone prettier.

160
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,937
But she's worse than me!

161
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,172
Watch what you say.

162
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,207
-What?
-She doesn't deserve to hear that from--

163
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,809
SLAP IN THE FACE

164
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,177
Are you out of your mind?

165
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,611
Are you that bad-sighted?

166
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,314
-Well…
-Each day with you was--

167
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,050
Ma'am!

168
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,586
-When will they stop?
-What the heck?

169
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,554
Why do you not say stop?

170
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,688
-Say stop.
-You should.

171
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,989
Stop the scene.

172
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,324
-You should.
-That's your job.

173
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,592
Oh, we have to do it.

174
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,894
-We thought they should.
-But I'd like

175
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,062
to keep watching this.

176
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,831
-Kiss.
-What about her do you like?

177
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,500
I can't wait to watch how this goes.

178
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,569
-Just what about her?
-Stop!

179
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,870
Can't you keep acting?

180
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,038
This is all.

181
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,172
Then, stay still.

182
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,507
-You need to stay still.
-Right.

183
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,908
-Stop.
-Okay.

184
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,377
-Stop.
-You came up with the skit,

185
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,878
but you don't know the rules at all.

186
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,414
All right, you have a minute.

187
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,482
GIVEN A MINUTE TO OBSERVE

188
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:28,321
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL SCENE

189
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,822
LET'S SEE

190
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,427
THE CHEATER FACING HIS MOM

191
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,530
THE THREE OF THEM TANGLED UP
LIKE THEIR RELATIONSHIP

192
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,499
You see, I have

193
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,101
that function in my brain.

194
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,636
CLICK

195
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,904
I can see a scene in my mind.

196
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,874
-I've memorized it already.
-Oh, really?

197
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,275
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY

198
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,910
Okay, I'm good too.

199
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,781
-Time's up.
-Time's up.

200
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,516
-No.
-Do we cover our eyes?

201
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,017
Put the blindfolds on.

202
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,752
Music, please.

203
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,987
THEY BEGIN CHANGING THE SCENE

204
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,425
SINGS

205
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,494
Isn't this the most unfortunate song
in our country?

206
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,062
What do you mean?

207
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,631
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes.

208
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,832
HE CAN'T HEAR

209
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,268
This is the most unfortunate song
in our country.

210
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,438
Why? It's played at the end
of each Screwballs episode.

211
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,106
-You're right.
-You have to wait.

212
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,340
WHILE TEAM EGEN LISTENS TO MUSIC

213
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,376
Wait. One, two, three…

214
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,611
TEAM TETO IS CHECKING FOR THE LAST TIME

215
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,213
-Okay.
-We're done.

216
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,581
THEY'RE DONE MAKING DIFFERENCES

217
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,216
All right, it's over.

218
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,185
Please take off the blindfolds.

219
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,086
-Okay.
-Ready.

220
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,155
Set, go.

221
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,190
Their poses have changed.

222
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,058
Sae-ho's arms were on her shoulders.

223
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,194
-That's not it.
-That didn't change.

224
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,361
PUTTING HIS HANDS BACK UP

225
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,863
-That's not it.
-What the…

226
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,067
HERE'S TEAM TETO'S PICTURE

227
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,405
TRY TO FIND THE DIFFERENCES AS WELL

228
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,674
-That's not it.
-I see

229
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,209
Sae-ho's hairstyle has changed.

230
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,477
He's wearing a different wig.

231
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,711
His wig got changed.

232
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,147
THAT'S CORRECT

233
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,817
And this. It was orange.

234
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,320
-It was like this.
-Nice.

235
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,888
-It was orange.
-Jin-kyung.

236
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:13,559
SHE GOT THE DIFFICULT ONE RIGHT

237
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,596
And the rose was facing the other way.

238
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,997
It's facing this way now.

239
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,265
No, this one isn't it.

240
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,900
It's the same.

241
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,168
No, it was invisible.

242
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,672
THE ROSE HASN'T CHANGED

243
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,674
I don't see any changes.

244
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,775
Sae-ho's wig.

245
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,744
-One, two.
-Right? The wig.

246
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,045
THEY'VE FOUND 2 DIFFERENCES SO FAR

247
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,881
-Who was in charge of Hye-lyun?
-The clothes are the same.

248
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,449
-Hye-lyun.
-Me.

249
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:43,956
THEY TAKE A LOOK AT HYE-LYUN THIS TIME

250
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,259
This thing is stuck in here.

251
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,627
-It wasn't.
-Okay.

252
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,995
-It wasn't.
-That makes it two.

253
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,264
I'll take this out…

254
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,331
DURING THE MEETING

255
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,599
…and stick it in here.

256
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,535
-Nice.
-Good.

257
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,003
They wouldn't notice.

258
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,271
IT WAS THEIR WINNING MOVE

259
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,006
This thing is stuck in here. It wasn't.

260
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,941
-Okay.
-It wasn't.

261
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,409
-That makes it two.
-Three.

262
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,244
-Oh, three.
-Four?

263
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,679
-Is that four?
-Yes.

264
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,948
Hye-lyun got a beard.

265
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,082
PFFT

266
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,385
-No?
-Time's over.

267
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,253
-We got three right.
-Three.

268
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,255
You got three right. Make a guess.

269
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,957
-All right.
-Oh, there were two of these.

270
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,425
There were two gloves.

271
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,460
-You missed that.
-You missed it.

272
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,895
THEY TOOK ONE GLOVE

273
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,565
AND HID IT UNDER THE BLANKET

274
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,601
THEY MISSED THE GLOVE

275
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,802
I only checked the members.

276
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,103
I only checked the members too.

277
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,472
Okay, accepted.

278
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,907
OKAY, ACCEPTED

279
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,409
You're fast to accept.

280
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,311
What's the last one?

281
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,378
The last one is…

282
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,746
WHAT'S THE LAST DIFFERENCE?

283
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,715
The plants were like this…

284
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,784
-Dang.
-…but we changed the order.

285
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,553
-So, that's how you're gonna be. Okay.
-Okay.

286
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,755
-We made obvious differences.
-It was obvious.

287
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,924
-Let's make it impossible to guess.
-I was clueless.

288
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,628
I'll make sure
the three of them can't figure it out

289
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,330
even if they try out for four years.

290
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,366
Come on. Don't play too hard.

291
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,702
Anyway, you guys got three right.

292
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,769
-Okay.
-Okay.

293
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,505
COME ON

294
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,342
Let's do this about the background.

295
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,676
THEY BEGIN DISCUSSING RIGHT AWAY

296
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,513
All right. The background for our scene

297
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,883
will be from here to there.

298
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,453
-Gosh.
-Are you going to change the books?

299
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,520
Don't change the books.

300
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,189
-That's…
-That'd be too hard.

301
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,191
Who's the one that changed the plants?

302
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,360
Plants are acceptable, jackass!

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,997
Joo Woo-jae, where are your honorifics?
I was born in 1970.

304
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,598
Right, she was born in 1970.

305
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,899
I joined college in '89.

306
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,802
Stop lying. I know you're in your 30s.

307
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,271
Okay, then. We won't touch any books.

308
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,906
-Not the books.
-Okay.

309
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,842
-Don't touch any books.
-Not the books.

310
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,110
THEY AGREE NOT TO MESS WITH THE BOOKS

311
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,646
REDISCUSSING THEIR PLAN

312
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,317
-What do we do with the last?
-Well…

313
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,188
Or how about we just…

314
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,357
DO JUST WHAT?

315
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,093
GRINS

316
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,862
Instead…

317
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,430
THEY KIND OF LIKE IT

318
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,331
Okay.

319
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,933
WHAT COULD THE STRATEGY BE?

320
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,103
MY GIRLFRIEND'S MANSTRESS FALLS FOR ME

321
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,508
A WOMAN AND A MAN HAPPENED TO MEET
ON A HOT DATING TV SHOW

322
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,177
But what can I do? She attracts me.

323
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,079
This guy is head over heels for me.

324
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,381
Geez, I'm supposed to hide these feelings.

325
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,451
I love you.

326
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,919
THEY BECAME LOVERS IN NO TIME

327
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,554
HOWEVER

328
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,489
He's my mom's least favorite.

329
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,091
My mom doesn't like you either!

330
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,259
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WASN'T SMOOTH SAILING

331
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,861
-What is it?
-Why?

332
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,899
IS THE ONE MORE IN LOVE
AT A DISADVANTAGE?

333
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,500
THE ANXIOUS WOO-JAE FOLLOWS HER

334
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,438
IN DISGUISE AS A WOMAN

335
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,374
MY GIRLFRIEND'S MANSTRESS FALLS FOR ME

336
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,442
This is exciting.

337
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,845
THE TWO OF THEM IN A SWEET MOMENT

338
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,081
SOME SORT OF SURPRISED SOUND EFFECT

339
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,085
MANSTRESS, JANG WOO-YOUNG

340
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,286
Is it another cheating story?

341
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,254
STARES WITH TENDER EYES

342
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,090
Shush.

343
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,391
DON'T SAY A THING, CUTIE-PIE

344
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,859
Like a character straight out of a comic.

345
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,828
Is this a silent show?

346
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,963
-They aren't talking.
-Why not?

347
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,031
YES, IT'S SILENT THEATER

348
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,533
HE EXPRESSES HIS FEELINGS
THROUGH ACTIONS, NOT WORDS

349
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,669
DARLING, YOU'RE
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A FLOWER

350
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,937
TOUCHED

351
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,805
BABE, HOW SWEET OF YOU

352
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,708
AND THEY'RE BEING SECRETLY WATCHED
BY A WOMAN

353
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,145
I MEAN… A MAN

354
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,250
HE MAKES SURE HE'S COVERED AND HIDDEN

355
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,052
He's that close,
and they're still clueless?

356
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,789
THIS IS ALLOWED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSE

357
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,390
THEY STILL HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

358
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,593
SHE OPENS HER MOUTH

359
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,194
Oh, it's not for himself.

360
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,430
A SIP FOR YOU, AND A SIP FOR ME

361
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,966
I guess they're in a coffee shop

362
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,667
and he's at the next table.

363
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,902
OVERFLOWING LOVE

364
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,836
Aren't they each

365
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,872
supposed to order a drink?

366
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,674
ORDERING 1 DRINK AND GETTING LOVEY-DOVEY

367
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,943
IS THE WORST

368
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,946
MEANWHILE, THIS MAN IS FEELING BETRAYED

369
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,083
HE COLLECTS EVIDENCE

370
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,786
HOW DARE YOU CHEAT ON ME?

371
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,956
THE TWO OF THEM ARE STARTLED
AFTER SPOTTING SOMETHING

372
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,926
HAVE THEY NOTICED HIM?

373
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,762
HE SPOTS WOO-JAE

374
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,531
AND APPROACHES HIM
AS IF HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND

375
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,465
FLUSTERED

376
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,566
When will they stop?

377
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,969
WHO IS THAT WOMAN?

378
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,405
-Are they falling in love?
-Are the two guys dating?

379
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,507
Stop.

380
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,142
-Stop?
-Stop?

381
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,878
What the…
I don't understand this story itself.

382
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,446
What is this?

383
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,082
So, he dumps Jin-kyung over Woo-jae?

384
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,684
-All right.
-It's mysterious.

385
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,352
Let me explain the situation first.

386
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,420
What is it?

387
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,522
I'm a man.

388
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,293
I dressed up as a woman
to catch my girlfriend cheating.

389
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,864
Woo-young mistakes me for a woman
and falls in love with me.

390
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,032
WHAT THE, SHE'S SO PRETTY

391
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,099
Right away.

392
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,435
But you didn't get anything,

393
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,204
so just watch.

394
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,972
-That's all?
-I'll memorize Woo-young.

395
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,141
-Please observe them for a minute.
-I'll memorize him.

396
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,579
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL SCENE

397
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:12,518
THE MAN DISGUISED AS A WOMAN
HAS QUITE A LOT OF PROPS

398
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,120
I must say they all look eccentric.

399
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,722
NEXT TO HIM IS THE MANSTRESS
WHO FALLS IN LOVE EASILY

400
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,823
They're not ordinary.

401
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,726
THEIR LOOKS ARE UNFORGETTABLE

402
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,394
GROWLS

403
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,929
Jin-kyung is wearing quite a lot.

404
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,898
She has a lot.

405
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,233
She's got a lot on her.

406
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,068
SHE'S JUST AS OVERLY DRESSED

407
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,136
A ROSE GIFT TIGHTLY IN HER HANDS

408
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,407
I memorize a scene like taking a picture.

409
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,375
And this picture memory…

410
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,776
Hey, I said that earlier.

411
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,944
Oh, you did?

412
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,012
THEY'RE IMPRESSIVELY ALIKE

413
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,080
Good. I'm done.

414
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,381
Okay, all done.

415
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,315
Me too.

416
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,717
Don't make slight changes.

417
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,818
OBSERVATION TIME IS OVER

418
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,052
-We'll put them on.
-Okay.

419
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,387
Ready.

420
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,788
Set, go.

421
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,857
THEY START CHANGING STUFF
FOR THREE MINUTES

422
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,192
Or how about this?

423
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,260
Just like that.

424
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,261
CRACKS UP

425
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,629
Right.

426
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,130
-Let's give them an easy one.
-Right.

427
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,432
They can never figure this out.
There's no way.

428
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,735
You're so clever.

429
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,305
Let's make it impossible to guess.

430
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,239
THESE EGEN PEOPLE ARE FULL OF SPITE

431
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,241
We're ready.

432
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,809
All right, time's up.

433
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,079
What's with them?

434
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,449
TA-DA

435
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,851
-This is too easy.
-What the?

436
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,787
-Start making guesses.
-His pose changed.

437
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,389
-Hey, I…
-Gosh.

438
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,559
TEAM EGEN'S PICTURES

439
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,096
TRY TO FIND THE DIFFERENCES AS WELL

440
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,632
-This is way too obvious.
-Her legs.

441
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,900
She's crossing her legs the other way.

442
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,902
Her legs

443
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,537
and her gloves.

444
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,472
I saw them earlier.

445
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,508
-Right, the gloves.
-The gloves were changed.

446
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,511
THE COLORS OF HER GLOVES GOT SWITCHED

447
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,212
They can never figure this out.
There's no way.

448
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,615
HE SAID THEY'D BE CLUELESS

449
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,083
And the gloves.

450
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,484
I saw them earlier.

451
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,686
HER EYES WAVER

452
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,721
Yes, the gloves.
The earrings didn't change.

453
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,222
She didn't wear any on this side earlier.

454
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,994
SHE WASN'T WEARING ANY ON THIS SIDE

455
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:02,962
BUT NOW, SHE'S WEARING ONE

456
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,963
-She wasn't.
-Is that right?

457
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,632
-That makes it three.
-This…

458
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,001
-Earring… Wait.
-There was one earlier.

459
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,235
And her gloves changed.

460
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,270
This one was here.

461
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,605
-Right.
-This one was here, and her legs…

462
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,240
-Her legs switched.
-What's wrong with this leg?

463
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,576
Her legs were like this earlier.

464
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,078
-Like this.
-And he…

465
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
With him, they're practically giving us

466
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,614
-the answer.
-What's their intention with him?

467
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,816
-There might be one with Woo-jae.
-Unexpectedly…

468
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,884
Wait. He's grinning.

469
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,220
-Right, he's grinning now.
-His lips are different.

470
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,923
No, it's the same.

471
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
-He's grinning.
-It's the same.

472
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,994
Maybe it's not the one.

473
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,230
-Like this…
-I assumed they'd change

474
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,932
the time of the clock here.

475
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,833
But they didn't.

476
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,235
CLOCK REMAINS THE SAME

477
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,205
THEY JUST NEED TO FIND ONE

478
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,840
Was the water bottle here?

479
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,041
-Yes.
-It was here.

480
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:49,942
SO IS THE WATER BOTTLE

481
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,344
-What…
-Time's over.

482
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,413
First, Woo-young's pose changed.

483
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,982
-Obviously.
-Jin-kyung's gloves.

484
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,550
Her earrings.

485
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,085
And her legs.

486
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,588
She was crossing her right leg like him.

487
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,889
But she switched her legs.

488
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,790
Right, she did.

489
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,993
Because we crossed our legs
in the same direction…

490
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,929
You're so clever.

491
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,064
HIS TRICKS DIDN'T WORK

492
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:12,965
How many did we get right?

493
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,133
-Five.
-You got four right.

494
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,701
-Four. We're missing one.
-His lips didn't change?

495
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,302
-No.
-The last one is

496
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,938
something very detailed.

497
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,974
-It's a big change.
-Is it?

498
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,642
-The last one?
-Yes.

499
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,744
-Is it?
-Sae-ho could've

500
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,280
noticed it real quick.

501
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,949
Woo-jae, please redo what was changed.

502
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,253
-Gosh.
-Are you kidding me?

503
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,521
Oh, that?

504
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,357
HIS LEG HEMS GOT UNFOLDED

505
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,426
-We wouldn't have noticed this.
-I didn't know.

506
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,494
-This is fun. Can we do it again?
-It's fun.

507
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,529
You want to?

508
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,097
-Let's do one more.
-All right.

509
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,399
We'll go with a story
about a beach pick-up.

510
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,101
-A pick-up at a beach.
-Yes.

511
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,236
The background story is a beach pick-up.

512
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,540
You can make decisions this time.

513
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,076
Go with something drastic.

514
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,446
THEY'RE EAGER TO WIN
AFTER THE PREVIOUS DEFEAT

515
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,880
With this, we…

516
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,950
Oh, that's nice.

517
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,119
WHISPERS

518
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,954
They might be clueless about this one.

519
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,156
DISCUSSIONS ARE OVER

520
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,558
We'll go now.

521
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,826
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

522
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,163
SUPER SHORT PLAY
SOMETHING HAPPENED AT THE BEACH

523
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,467
UNDER THE WARM SUNLIGHT,

524
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,304
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ENJOYS HER RELAXING TIME

525
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,872
What a nice beach.

526
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,373
How nice.

527
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,377
I hear there are
many pretty women here today.

528
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,647
SOUND EFFECTS FOR FALLING IN LOVE

529
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,485
HE SPOTS A HOTTIE ENJOYING TANNING

530
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,987
HE NERVOUSLY TALKS TO HER

531
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:46,258
Excuse me. If you have time, would you
like to enjoy surfing there with me?

532
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,828
SHE SLOWLY TAKES OFF HER HAT

533
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,796
I know…

534
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,531
SCREAMS

535
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,434
This is just wrong!

536
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,469
-What do you think you're doing?
-Let's surf.

537
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,670
You freaked me out!

538
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,239
You shouldn't do this.

539
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,907
That's just rude!

540
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,775
-Let's surf.
-You freaked me out.

541
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,577
-Let's enjoy surfing together.
-This is enough.

542
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,312
-Geez.
-What in the…

543
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,481
Unbelievable! She freaked me out.

544
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,216
-Wait.
-What in the…

545
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,885
HOLD ON

546
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,855
HE FINDS HOPE AGAIN

547
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,756
What is it?

548
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,258
Gosh, she really freaked me out.

549
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,127
If you don't mind,
will you enjoy surfing with…

550
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,130
SCREAMS

551
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,533
THAT'S SATISFYING

552
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,470
THE END OF THE MAN
WHO WAS CONSTANTLY RUDE

553
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,206
WHAT A SATISFYING STORYLINE

554
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,174
-Stop.
-Stop?

555
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,009
-Stop.
-All right.

556
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,877
-Please begin observing.
-Goodness.

557
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,612
No changes in the background, right?

558
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,813
-Not the background.
-Right.

559
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,048
NO CHANGES IN THE BACKGROUND

560
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,952
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL SCENE

561
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,922
Look at how dirty Sook plays.

562
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:50,822
WHAT DID SHE DO?

563
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,157
Look at what she did.

564
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,159
What a dirty trick.

565
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,195
SMALL PROPS THAT HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH A BEACH

566
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:01,800
A HOT GIRL SEATED AT EASE ON A MAT

567
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:09,708
ANOTHER HOT GIRL CARRYING A TUBE
AND A WATER BOTTLE

568
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,777
Okay, I memorized everything.

569
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,113
We won't change anything
in the background.

570
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,915
-Not the background.
-Okay.

571
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,618
-We'll make changes only in the props.
-Okay.

572
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,320
Time's up.

573
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,221
OBSERVATION TIME IS UP

574
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,923
-All right.
-All right, begin.

575
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,491
THEY BEGIN MAKING CHANGES

576
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,727
AS SOON AS THEY BEGIN,

577
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,829
SOOK FLIPS THE MAT

578
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,599
THIS GUY TAKES OFF HIS SOCKS

579
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,501
Look at how dirty Sook plays.

580
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,436
TO MEET HER EXPECTATIONS,

581
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,373
SOOK CHANGES THE BRUSH TO A BIGGER ONE

582
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,674
AND THE SECRET MOVE UP THEIR SLEEVE

583
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,209
They might be clueless about this.

584
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,147
DEFLATING THE TUBE

585
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,682
TEAM TETO'S DIFFERENCES ARE COMPLETE

586
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,851
THE LAST ONE WILL BE REVEALED LATER

587
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,419
All right, time's up.

588
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,388
-You have a minute.
-Okay.

589
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,190
Ready, go.

590
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,525
It was changed.

591
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,560
I found one.

592
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,429
ALREADY?

593
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,100
Her arm wasn't touching this before.

594
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,735
No, that's not it.

595
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,970
-It's because my pose changed.
-Oh, your pose.

596
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,972
I thought I found something big.

597
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,873
IT WAS JUST A WRONG GUESS

598
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,709
Not the legs. Nothing changed there.

599
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,280
It's better to tell them
if it's a wrong guess.

600
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,682
Huh? Then, nothing changed.

601
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,487
The water is the same.

602
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,222
-She filled the bottle.
-No, it's the same.

603
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,623
I say so when it's a wrong guess.

604
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,327
SHE'S LIKE AN OPEN BOOK

605
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,462
You might end up telling them everything

606
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,664
at this rate.

607
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,499
Nothing about you changed, right?

608
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,100
Well, I can't tell you.

609
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,069
THAT, I CAN'T TELL YOU

610
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,972
It's deflated.

611
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,007
It's deflated.

612
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,443
It's deflated.

613
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,544
-Okay.
-One.

614
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,979
HER EXPRESSION GIVES IT ALL AWAY

615
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,015
WHILE WOO-JAE IS FOCUSED ON HYE-LYUN

616
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,885
The mat and the brush got changed.

617
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,054
-What? Yes, the brush.
-They changed the brush.

618
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,455
They changed the mat too.

619
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,557
-Oh.
-Its pattern is different.

620
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,260
STARES

621
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,162
Was he wearing socks?

622
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,730
I didn't check him at all.

623
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,398
SAE-HO'S BARE FEET CAPTURE HIS ATTENTION

624
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,467
-He wasn't barefoot.
-The mat, the brush.

625
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,803
Find something about Sae-ho.

626
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,638
-Time's over.
-The socks.

627
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,374
The socks.

628
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,477
-I don't think he was barefoot.
-He took them off.

629
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,346
-Barefoot.
-The tube, the socks.

630
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,847
Also, the brush.

631
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:29,948
The size is different.

632
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,882
The mat's pattern is different.

633
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,950
THEY GOT FOUR RIGHT

634
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,919
THEY JUST NEED TO FIND ONE MORE

635
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,687
-All right.
-And the hat.

636
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,524
THE HAT?

637
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,693
The hat…

638
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,795
It's the same. It didn't change.

639
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:45,931
-Done?
-All right.

640
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,466
-It's over.
-All right, it's over.

641
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,734
-Thank goodness.
-What did you find?

642
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,935
IT'S FINISHED WITH ONE STILL MISSING

643
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,603
-This tube is deflated.
-How did you find out?

644
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,938
-Correct.
-Yes.

645
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,939
-And?
-The socks.

646
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,374
I wasn't wearing any from the start.

647
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,842
-Yes, you were.
-I was?

648
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,310
Yes.

649
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,478
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS GUY?

650
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,946
-What the?
-What a con artist.

651
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,781
-What are you doing?
-That stunned me too.

652
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,384
-I took them off.
-And you say that now?

653
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,285
You're not supposed to lie.

654
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,687
Lying isn't allowed in this game.

655
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,857
-The other one is…
-You couldn't find it.

656
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,725
It was Hye-lyun's idea,
and you couldn't find it.

657
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,494
-Take a guess.
-Wait.

658
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,395
Could it be this?

659
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,096
-You're right.
-Right.

660
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:18,997
-No.
-No.

661
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,232
Did you shorten it?

662
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,033
It was like this earlier

663
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,269
-and I loosened it.
-Right.

664
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,272
THE HAT TIE IS LOOSE NOW

665
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,241
-This one's hard.
-How did you notice the tube?

666
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,644
Originally, you were holding it easily

667
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,379
-with one hand.
-Because with less air…

668
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,214
-But she was struggling.
-…I can't hold it with one hand.

669
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,382
It sags.

670
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,851
I assumed this was

671
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,354
-because they deflated it.
-I thought you wouldn't notice it.

672
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,022
FOUND THE ANSWER WITH HIS EGEN POWERS

673
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,023
Thanks.

674
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,691
-I didn't think…
-Throw it out, please.

675
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,026
You got four right.

676
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,094
You're good.

677
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,061
IT'S TEAM EGEN'S TURN

678
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,464
Things to change.

679
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,865
WOO-JAE GATHERS HIS TEAMMATES

680
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,168
I got an idea earlier there.

681
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,469
Jin-kyung, the props…

682
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,337
SMIRKS

683
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,907
-You know what I mean?
-Okay.

684
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,775
Let's go!

685
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,810
Right.

686
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,480
We're going to make it very Egen.
Look forward to it.

687
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,684
All right, I'm done with my outfit.

688
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,019
-What on earth?
-Come on.

689
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,154
-Don't do this.
-What?

690
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,523
-What? This is my outfit.
-Fine.

691
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,092
-Knock it off.
-This is wrong.

692
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,361
This is way too Egen.

693
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,698
-Right, I'm Egen.
-Egen.

694
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,833
We're Egen, so what?

695
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,234
-We're Team Egen.
-Take a few out.

696
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,269
-Goodness.
-How dirty.

697
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,871
Let's hurry.

698
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,973
And he says he's Teto.

699
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,909
A man with a puke attitude.

700
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,611
HIS ATTITUDE SURE IS THE ISSUE

701
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,246
-All right.
-We won't play shamelessly.

702
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,249
-Okay, got it.
-We won't change any of this part.

703
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,852
Even if we do,

704
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,987
-we'll change something noticeable.
-Right.

705
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,391
SUPER SHORT PLAY
SOMETHING HAPPENED AT THE BEACH 2

706
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,060
Come and take a look.

707
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,495
SHE'S BUSY GETTING BY EACH DAY

708
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,863
Come and take a look.

709
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,632
THEY SAY LOVE IS A LUXURY,
BUT SHE DREAMS OF SWEET ROMANCE

710
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,834
-Gosh.
-Come and take a look.

711
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,169
I like this one.

712
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,938
MAKE ME YOUR HONORARY FIREFIGHTER
HERO 1, JANG WOO-YOUNG

713
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,206
WHY DO YOU CRY ALL THE TIME?

714
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,342
YOU MAKE ME WANT TO PROTECT YOU
HERO 2, JOO WOO-JAE

715
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,978
Come and take a look.

716
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,782
THEY APPROACH HER
AS THEY CHECK ON EACH OTHER

717
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,951
Are they thieves or what?

718
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,154
IT FEELS SOMEWHAT LIKE A BACK ALLEY

719
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,923
Come and take a look.

720
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,992
-I like it.
-How much is it?

721
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,095
-How much?
-Excuse me. Do you have a boyfriend?

722
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,563
-How much?
-Excuse me.

723
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,231
-Is it 3,000 won?
-Excuse me.

724
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,900
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Is it 3,000 won?

725
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:35,967
Do you live alone?

726
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,903
-It's too expensive.
-Are you a fisherman?

727
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,272
DESPITE THEIR PERSISTENT FLIRTING

728
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,172
She wouldn't answer.

729
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,407
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

730
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,675
-Hey.
-Hey.

731
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:44,676
-Hey!
-Hey.

732
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,244
-Hey!
-Hey!

733
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,679
-Hey.
-Hey.

734
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,081
SINGING

735
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,249
Stop.

736
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,984
-Stop?
-So, this is it.

737
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,819
It's my favorite kind of comedy.

738
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,255
THE COMEDIANS ARE VERY SATISFIED

739
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,090
You have one minute.

740
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,458
THEY BEGIN OBSERVING

741
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,127
TAKING A SLOW LOOK AT THE PROPS FIRST

742
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,863
-How do I…
-My knee hurts. This is bad.

743
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,531
What do I do? I'm screwed.

744
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,267
I know. I'm screwed too.

745
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,902
Geez, what do I do?

746
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,203
-My knee…
-One of us better change.

747
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,239
Gosh, my knee hurts badly. This is bad.

748
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,974
-You must have a bad back.
-Hold on.

749
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,142
Their poses might change.

750
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,443
They said
they wouldn't change any of these.

751
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,278
-Well…
-They said it'd be the members.

752
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,246
One, two.

753
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,249
THANKS TO THE EGEN VIBE,
THEY HAVE A LOT TO MEMORIZE

754
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,484
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL SCENE

755
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,886
Three, four. Okay.

756
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,121
-I memorized Jin-kyung's.
-She's wearing a lot.

757
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,523
-The necklaces and…
-I memorized hers.

758
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,624
One, two.

759
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,226
Okay. I'm sharp-sighted.

760
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,995
I got them all. It's good.

761
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,332
This is in. There. Here.

762
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,135
HERO 1 HAS
AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE SENSE OF FASHION

763
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,470
It's in here.

764
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,038
In here. The toes are…

765
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,207
I wondered where my socks were.
They're here.

766
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,109
TA-DA

767
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,978
This… What is this?

768
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,079
Okay. Good.

769
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,180
I'm good now.

770
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,649
Done.

771
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,284
-All done.
-All done.

772
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,186
You have three minutes. Ready, go.

773
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,354
THREE MINUTES TO MAKE CHANGES

774
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,056
We'll win this time for sure.

775
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,559
We've decided to be very Egen
about this game.

776
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,460
TEAM EGEN WAS UNUSUALLY CONFIDENT

777
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,261
How about this?

778
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,596
This can be a dirty trick, no?

779
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,865
I guess it's acceptable.

780
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,168
HOW WOULD A DIRTY TRICK
BE DIFFERENT FROM AN ACCEPTABLE ONE?

781
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,104
-Time's up?
-You have one minute.

782
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,772
Ready, go.

783
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,906
THEY BEGIN GUESSING

784
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,876
HERE'S TEAM EGEN'S PICTURES

785
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:29,014
DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCES?

786
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,849
Her necktie is different.

787
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,752
-It's the same tie.
-Is it?

788
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,453
-Don't tell her anything.
-This changed.

789
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,122
The sticks in her hands got changed.

790
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,858
-The magic wands.
-The necklace.

791
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,626
Is it the same?

792
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,094
THE MAGIC WANDS AND THE NECKLACE?

793
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,296
-Woo-young…
-The gloves are the same.

794
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,165
I don't see any changes in him.

795
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,368
TIME IS TICKING, AND HE SEEMS THE SAME TOO

796
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,204
-Hold on.
-What can be different?

797
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,806
TEAM TETO BECOMES ANXIOUS

798
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,941
Where did the ring go?
He was wearing one here.

799
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,410
A ring is missing.

800
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,045
What are you saying?
All the rings are here.

801
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,014
Wear some here too. Why wouldn't you?

802
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,584
He's just picking a fight.

803
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,319
I think her necktie is different.

804
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,255
She says it's the same.

805
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,756
What she says no is a no.

806
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,892
Then… You guys couldn't find any?

807
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,959
TIME'S OVER

808
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,394
Nice.

809
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,596
-I think the necklace…
-I got this right.

810
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,699
-Do we make guesses now?
-Yes, your final guesses.

811
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:21,766
These things got switched.

812
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,034
-The wands.
-The wands

813
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,803
-are in different directions.
-Right.

814
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,404
Their locations changed, you say?

815
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,406
No, the wands

816
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,575
-got switched.
-The wands got switched.

817
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,343
-You mean, their locations?
-Yes.

818
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,079
-And?
-Next.

819
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,148
-Next. He tucked his shirt in.
-Woo-young tucked his shirt in.

820
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,316
-Yes.
-He tucked it in.

821
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,218
You are making things up.

822
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,886
-And?
-It's in.

823
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,689
And this thing wasn't red.

824
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,691
-It was red.
-It was red.

825
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,626
-And?
-Oh, he changed…

826
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,894
And this changed.

827
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,232
-He's wearing it backward.
-Backward.

828
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,700
HE'S WEARING THE HEADGEAR BACKWARD

829
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,168
-That's it.
-There.

830
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,069
-Okay.
-That's all.

831
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,271
Of all your guesses…

832
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,076
IF TEAM TETO GETS MORE THAN FOUR RIGHT,
THEY WILL WIN THE GAME

833
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:06,711
LET'S SEE

834
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,779
The wands.

835
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,147
THEY GOT THE WANDS RIGHT

836
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,115
Woo-young's headgear.

837
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,282
THEY GOT THE HEADGEAR RIGHT

838
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,283
The end.

839
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,618
-What…
-That's all.

840
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,819
-Really?
-His shirt is tucked in.

841
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,287
WE ONLY GOT TWO RIGHT?

842
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,690
First off, Jin-kyung's headband

843
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,725
was originally like this.

844
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,694
We had it backward.

845
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,629
-Okay.
-Gosh. That one is hard.

846
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,164
And this box was originally closed.

847
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,099
-Oh, right.
-The box…

848
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,135
Oh, we saw this… Goodness.

849
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,904
-You may think this is a dirty trick…
-Dang.

850
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,206
but her necklace…

851
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,841
Yes, it's different.

852
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,510
-Right.
-She turned it.

853
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,911
There was a heart pendant.

854
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,014
THE PENDANT WAS IN THE FRONT

855
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,784
SHE TURNED THE NECKLACE

856
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,684
AND HID THE PENDANT

857
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,586
Right, her necklace was different.

858
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,791
-So, you got two out of five right.
-Two.

859
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,794
With all the correct guesses combined…

860
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,995
-We win, right?
-Us?

861
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,664
Team Egen is the winner.

862
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,733
TEAM EGEN WINS SPOT THE DIFFERENCE

863
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,802
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

864
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,803
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

865
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,172
-Hey.
-Because of the distractions…

866
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,940
SINGING

867
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,742
AN ENCORE TO CELEBRATE THEIR VICTORY

868
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,111
They distracted us with the props.

869
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,146
-It was confusing.
-Right.

870
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,615
-That was…
-Hye-lyun, you…

871
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,151
It'd be way too cheap
if we left one out of all these.

872
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,620
Let's bring damn many props.

873
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,589
HE MAY NOT PLAY DIRTY,
BUT HE'S EGEN FOR SURE

874
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:28,459
TEAM TETO WON THE TETO GAME
TEAM EGEN WON THE EGEN GAME

875
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,729
All right, it's time for the last game.

876
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,031
The score now is one to one.

877
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,432
-Gosh.
-We have a chance.

878
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,902
While you have a tie score, the last game…

879
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,971
You put a lot in.

880
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,172
-What is it?
-Water?

881
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,041
-It's not little.
-Is there something inside?

882
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,542
HEAVY

883
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,443
Is it water?

884
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,878
WATER BALLOONS = SOMEONE WILL GET WET

885
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,447
Are you okay?
You have a live radio show after this.

886
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,715
-I'm good.
-I knew it.

887
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,218
I can deal with wet underwear.

888
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,553
EGEN PEOPLE CAN NEVER BE THIS CAREFREE

889
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,621
You're so cool about it.

890
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,389
-She is.
-It's a radio show with cameras.

891
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,557
-Let them see me.
-Cameras will be on.

892
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,728
You've played a game
about Teto and Egen each.

893
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,931
This time, you'll play
a game that's very fair and neutral.

894
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,734
It requires Teto people's bold initiative

895
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,837
and Egen people's careful timing ability.

896
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,206
You'll need a balance of these abilities

897
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,608
to play this Te-Gen game.

898
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,042
-Te-Gen? What's that?
-"Te-Gen."

899
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,411
The game is called Water Balloon Timing.

900
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,146
-Water Balloon Timing?
-Water Balloon Timing?

901
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,481
Let me explain the rules.

902
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,683
-You'll see some chairs behind you.
-Yes.

903
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,519
You'll be seated there with a blindfold
and a sandpaper hair band on.

904
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,389
As soon as the game starts,
a water balloon will swing

905
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,524
front and back from the ceiling.

906
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:38,529
As you're seated,
you'll stand up when you think

907
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,965
the water balloon won't be above you.

908
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:44,702
And at some point, someone will cause
the water balloon to pop.

909
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,539
We'll count how many times
you stood up to that point.

910
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,241
THEY MUST STAND UP MORE TO WIN THE GAME

911
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,743
Oh, that means

912
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,711
this isn't a penalty, but a game.

913
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,712
-Yes.
-That's right.

914
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,948
HMM…

915
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,116
There's an innate penalty.

916
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,385
-The losing team will all get wet.
-Yes.

917
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,552
-We have to win.
-Right.

918
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,254
-And we'll win.
-We just have to win.

919
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,423
-Can we simulate… Let's sit down first.
-All right.

920
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,492
It's pretty short.

921
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,194
-Sae-ho, imagine this is attached.
-It'll swing.

922
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,196
It will be stretched down like this.

923
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,364
-Then…
-Back and forth.

924
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,433
-Then…
-As it swings, we should…

925
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,568
-Do we stand up?
-We stand up during the game.

926
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,304
-You stand up.
-Look.

927
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,472
It's better to sit
in the middle or at the back

928
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,674
because you can see.

929
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,876
-You'll be wearing a blindfold.
-A blindfold.

930
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,679
PLEASE DON'T ACT LIKE YOU KNOW

931
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,480
-But the thing is…
-Jin-kyung, come here.

932
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,481
-Honestly speaking…
-Come.

933
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,217
Don't you think
it's way too disadvantageous for us?

934
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,321
Come to think of it,
this team's average height is crazy.

935
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,288
A HEART-THROBBING HEIGHT DIFFERENCE

936
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,990
-Sit with your legs open.
-This much?

937
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,258
Right.

938
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,326
That's far-fetched.

939
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,760
I'm still taller than you.

940
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,030
Sae-ho, don't come close.

941
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:46,998
Open them more.

942
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,132
-Talk from there.
-Let me see.

943
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,067
-No.
-This much is…

944
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,134
Talk from there.

945
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,036
-Punk, this much is…
-Talk from there.

946
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,806
-I said talk from there!
-I'm still taller?

947
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:55,974
Still?

948
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,508
-How tall are you?
-I'm 188 cm tall.

949
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,878
Do you have any idea how insulted I feel
because of the pants you gave me?

950
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,381
These are too short for me.

951
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,816
-Try them on.
-Let me.

952
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,318
What is this?

953
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,786
BUT SADLY ENOUGH,

954
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,388
THEY WERE TOO LONG FOR SAE-HO

955
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,123
They're short for you, but for him…

956
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,491
You know I lowered them a little
to make it funnier.

957
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,892
Goodness.

958
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,562
WHOEVER HAS LONGER LEGS THAN MINE,
PLEASE LEAVE

959
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,531
AND THEY ALL LEFT

960
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,300
Which order do you prefer?

961
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,203
The tallest ones should sit
in the front and back.

962
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,405
-I'm probably the tallest.
-I am.

963
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,573
-He is.
-How tall are you?

964
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,640
I'm 168 cm tall.

965
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,376
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

966
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,810
-He is.
-For real?

967
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:33,878
-Yes.
-You measured it?

968
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:34,879
-What about you?
-I'm 160 cm tall.

969
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,014
SMIRKS

970
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,549
THEY'RE DONE WITH THE ORDER

971
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,151
Okay, I'm the shortest.

972
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,754
-Team Teto will go first.
-Let's do this.

973
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,456
Hye-lyun is quite tensed up.

974
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,626
When you stand up, don't bend your back.

975
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,694
Ready.

976
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,431
A WATER BALLOON IS ABOVE THEIR HEADS

977
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,066
Set.

978
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,034
IF THEY GRAZE IT, IT WILL POP

979
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,603
GO!

980
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,537
Let's go.

981
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,842
-What the… Who is it?
-What on earth?

982
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,778
WOO-JAE'S PERFECT SWING

983
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,981
SHE HEAD-BUTTED IT RIGHT AWAY

984
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,683
CRACKING UP

985
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,653
THAT WAS SUCH A TETO HEADER

986
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,054
What the heck?

987
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,690
What happened?

988
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,359
I stood up just once.

989
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,394
-Who is it?
-I didn't stand up.

990
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,363
I pushed the balloon,

991
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,965
and I was waiting for it to come back.

992
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,935
But a head suddenly appeared in its way.

993
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,170
It hid the balloon.

994
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,972
You know what's so cute about her?
She told Sook,

995
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,408
"Let's go," and then, she popped it.

996
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,709
DID I?

997
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,677
Let's go.

998
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,045
POPS

999
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,549
A MOCKING DUO

1000
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,150
You have one point so far.

1001
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,752
-Let's do better.
-I know.

1002
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,053
Sae-ho might do well.

1003
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,755
I was checking the timing.

1004
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,657
None of you did well.

1005
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,158
Let's not stand up at first.

1006
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,660
-Okay, at first.
-Let it swing.

1007
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,528
-A few times.
-Let's wait and see.

1008
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,830
-That will tire Woo-jae out.
-Okay.

1009
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,264
"Tire Woo-jae out."

1010
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,165
Let's go.

1011
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,100
THEY WILL TIRE ME OUT?

1012
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,034
Ready.

1013
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,068
WILL THEY DO BETTER THIS TIME?

1014
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,470
-Let's go.
-Good luck.

1015
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,370
Listen carefully.

1016
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,139
START!

1017
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,507
It's moving.

1018
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,843
PRICKING UP THEIR EARS

1019
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,512
Is it moving?

1020
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,013
-Has it come?
-What the?

1021
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,914
Why don't I feel anything?

1022
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,349
-Is it not coming?
-What is it?

1023
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,320
WOO-JAE IS PLAYING A TRICK
AGAINST THEIR PLAN

1024
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,621
Should I try standing up?

1025
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,089
Throw it.

1026
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,657
I stood up.

1027
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,960
-It's coming.
-Stand up.

1028
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,194
-What?
-I think we can go now.

1029
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,296
Hold on.

1030
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,297
-Let me…
-The sound.

1031
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,666
SHE BARELY AVOIDS IT

1032
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,401
Sook, don't bend your back.

1033
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,803
You'll continue until it pops.

1034
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,574
-Where is it?
-Okay.

1035
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,343
-Sook, don't bend your back.
-We're doing well.

1036
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,745
-Six.
-Sae-ho is doing well.

1037
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,980
THEY'RE DOING WELL BIT BY BIT

1038
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,681
-Where is it?
-Aren't you getting up?

1039
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,456
A SECOND HEADER IN A ROW

1040
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,493
Hold on. Where was it?

1041
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,328
-Me again?
-Hye-lyun.

1042
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,763
-What on earth?
-Can you see?

1043
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,898
I popped it again?

1044
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,000
-Why do I keep popping it?
-I must say

1045
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,835
it was 100% accurate.

1046
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,603
Sook. I'm so sorry,

1047
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,771
but why didn't you get up?

1048
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,706
-Why didn't you?
-I meant to.

1049
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,974
But I didn't hear any sound.

1050
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,378
You guys said you wouldn't move
at first for five seconds,

1051
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,479
so I held it for five seconds.

1052
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,080
HE PLAYED SMART TOO

1053
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,415
No wonder I didn't sense it moving.

1054
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,516
No wonder why I didn't…

1055
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,951
How many did they do this time?

1056
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,419
-They did 13 times.
-Okay, 13.

1057
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,520
THEY MANAGED TO DO 13

1058
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,191
TEAM TETO GOT THE HANG OF IT
DURING ROUND TWO

1059
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:36,227
So, it was right
to test the waters at first.

1060
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,629
But I'm the only one who pops it.
Why don't we change seats?

1061
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,565
-I will… Switch with me.
-Switch.

1062
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,499
THEY SWITCH SEATS

1063
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,870
Hye-lyun, Woo-jae does
what he wants anyway, so this time,

1064
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,238
-let's follow our senses.
-Okay.

1065
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,906
-Okay.
-Let's do this.

1066
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,007
Ready.

1067
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,576
TEAM TETO'S LAST ROUND

1068
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,545
SO FAR, THEY MANAGED TO DO 13

1069
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,747
HOW MANY MORE WILL THEY GET TO DO?

1070
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,815
Ready.

1071
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,353
Wow.

1072
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,456
-Wow.
-I think it's coming. I feel the wind.

1073
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,160
CRACKING UP

1074
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,294
-What the?
-What happened?

1075
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,431
HAT TRICK

1076
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,432
You popped it again?

1077
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,567
I think it's coming. I feel the wind.

1078
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,135
SHE STOOD UP AT THE PERFECT TIMING

1079
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,274
SHE'S THE HEADER MASTER

1080
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,344
IT'D BE HARD
EVEN WITHOUT ONE'S EYES COVERED

1081
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,180
HER HEADERS ARE SO ACCURATE

1082
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,016
ONE-TRICK HEADER STRIKER

1083
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,884
-This makes no sense!
-What is it?

1084
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,753
How did she…

1085
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,521
I only stood up once!

1086
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,090
So why?

1087
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,658
How did this happen?

1088
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,126
I'm so envious.

1089
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,094
NOT SURE IF SHE'S LUCKY OR NOT

1090
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,095
What's your problem?

1091
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,730
-Hye-lyun.
-I've never popped it at all.

1092
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,732
You're dominating all the time
we have for the show.

1093
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,634
I'm so jealous of her.

1094
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,570
-No, I…
-You had to let us pop it at least once.

1095
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,571
You popped it all three times.

1096
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,206
I'm so dry and clean.

1097
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,441
-Let's change seats.
-The game is over!

1098
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,609
We did all three rounds.

1099
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,510
-We did three rounds.
-It's over.

1100
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,911
-That's all we get?
-It's over.

1101
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,213
Can't we do five rounds?

1102
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,814
You popped it all three times.

1103
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,151
HYE-LYUN SCORED THREE GOALS
IN THREE ROUNDS

1104
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,153
It's Team Egen's turn.

1105
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,188
Can we stand up twice at a time?

1106
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,323
-You can.
-Of course.

1107
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,091
It doesn't matter. You can't see anyway.

1108
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,593
We can stand up at the same time.

1109
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,761
-Of course.
-That's okay too.

1110
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,896
-If you can meet the timing.
-You guys

1111
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,499
-might take 0.2 seconds to pop one.
-Here we go.

1112
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,401
-Ready.
-Let's do this.

1113
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,736
-Jin-kyung, we can do it.
-Let's go.

1114
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,038
-Set.
-Let's go. Please.

1115
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,373
IT BEGINS

1116
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,550
TEAM EGEN DILIGENTLY MEETS THE TIMING

1117
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,851
They're so good.

1118
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,720
How are they doing it?

1119
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:44,855
They're so good.

1120
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,657
Oh, my goodness.

1121
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,861
LAUGH OUT LOUD

1122
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,666
A PROMISING HEADER PLAYER
THREATENS HYE-LYUN

1123
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,136
You guys did well, though.

1124
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,338
You stood up many times.

1125
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,406
They're so good at avoiding it.

1126
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,543
From next time, please make the games

1127
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,346
a little harder

1128
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,082
because my senses told me where it was.

1129
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,684
-Really?
-My five senses could tell.

1130
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,719
-I couldn't tell.
-So, this is

1131
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,854
-actually meaningless.
-I was clueless.

1132
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,656
Hey, don't make it too obvious.

1133
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,324
Was it obvious?

1134
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,126
-I don't know. They just know.
-Okay.

1135
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,027
I'll do it quietly this time.

1136
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,428
Ready.

1137
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,330
THE SECOND ROUND BEGINS

1138
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,968
HE'S TRYING TO PLAY SMART

1139
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:38,042
TEAM EGEN QUICKLY TAKES THIS CHANCE

1140
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,310
-Nice.
-They're so good.

1141
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,845
Oh, my.

1142
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,314
MOVING LIKE THEY'RE POSSESSED

1143
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,284
WILL THIS BE TEAM EGEN'S VICTORY?

1144
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,987
Hold on. Stop.

1145
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,589
-I got it.
-What?

1146
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,558
Every time Sae-ho moves,
those legs touch her.

1147
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,729
-Hey, what's with you?
-Hey.

1148
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,264
What is wrong with you?

1149
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,100
-No wonder.
-You need to mind your actions.

1150
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,001
Let's go again.

1151
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,337
That was no good. Go again.

1152
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,338
Good luck.

1153
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,739
Ready.

1154
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,408
THEIR SECOND ROUND BEGINS AGAIN

1155
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,779
Geez.

1156
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,980
Oh, my.

1157
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:16,881
POPS

1158
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,884
HE SAID HE COULD TELL THE BALLOON WAS

1159
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,420
HE DID SENSE IT PASSING BY

1160
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,590
My five senses could tell.

1161
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,325
So, this is actually meaningless.

1162
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,997
We were going way ahead,

1163
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,266
so I thought it'd be
the right timing to pop.

1164
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,034
I did it only because I knew.

1165
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,036
Geez, he's so annoying.

1166
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:40,871
I was feeling hot.

1167
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,373
Stop acting up and sit down.

1168
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,274
Yes, sir.

1169
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,275
YES, SIR

1170
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,610
Can they change seats
and have Jin-kyung sit in the front?

1171
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:47,912
-Right.
-Why?

1172
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,313
-We're doing well already.
-Come on.

1173
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,415
-You won't get wet.
-No, thanks.

1174
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,550
Woo-jae's doing well.

1175
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,185
This is your last round.

1176
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,021
THEY'VE DONE 15 SO FAR

1177
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:58,789
Ready.

1178
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,324
TEAM TETO DID 16

1179
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,360
ONLY IF THEY STAND UP TWICE,

1180
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,763
THEY CAN WIN THIS GAME

1181
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:07,932
Set.

1182
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,735
Set.

1183
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,172
HOW WILL TEAM EGEN'S FATE TURN OUT TO BE?

1184
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,150
Now!

1185
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:29,987
THEY'VE OBTAINED TWO POINTS

1186
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,922
That was perfect.

1187
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,290
THEY TAKE THE WIN
WITH HIS FANTASTIC HEADER

1188
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,892
WOO-JAE IS THE BEST

1189
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,028
JIN-KYUNG PASSED THE BALL

1190
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,498
AND HE MADE A PERFECT FINISH

1191
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,734
TEAM EGEN IS THE WINNER

1192
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,271
It was fun, right? Right?

1193
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,773
-It was fun.
-Totally.

1194
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,609
That last move was awesome.

1195
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,410
-Was it once?
-Yes.

1196
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,012
-That was satisfying.
-There.

1197
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,413
RANKING
CHO HYE-LYUN: THREE GOALS

1198
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,984
The final winner is Team Egen.

1199
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,022
Team Teto will get a water slap
as a losing penalty.

1200
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,591
Hye-lyun has a radio show to join,
so I'll take hers too.

1201
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,193
I'll take it on her behalf.

1202
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,528
I'll take it on my behalf.

1203
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,398
No, it's a visual radio show.

1204
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,767
Let's have her choose.

1205
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:17,902
-Right, choose one.
-Okay.

1206
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,504
Choose one from the other team.

1207
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,506
-Woo-jae.
-Sure thing.

1208
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,275
Thanks for the great opinion.

1209
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:25,910
EVERYONE'S EXCITED EXCEPT ONE

1210
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,211
Nice!

1211
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,046
Geez, you're so annoying.

1212
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,315
Since Hye-lyun is our guest today,

1213
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,650
let's have her give Woo-jae
a refreshing water slap.

1214
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,118
SHE'LL GIVE HIM A WATER SLAP HERSELF

1215
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,520
LOST FOR WORDS

1216
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,989
-Could you say a word in five seconds?
-Well…

1217
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,525
Thank you so much for having me today.

1218
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,660
I'll mark the end by giving him…

1219
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,628
-This isn't the rule.
-…a water slap.

1220
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:45,963
Or why have a script

1221
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,364
in the first place?

1222
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,766
-Come on.
-Lovely!

1223
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,068
Take off the blindfold.

1224
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,670
Take it off to make it dramatic.

1225
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,471
-It's going to be refreshing.
-Right.

1226
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,006
Woo-jae really…

1227
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,008
Estrogen… What was that? Edo guy?

1228
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,210
-E… Egen.
-Egen guy.

1229
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,612
Good luck, Egen guy.

1230
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,913
I wish you the best.

1231
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,653
-Good work.
-How refreshing.

1232
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,055
Thank you.

1233
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,323
TEA-BAGGING

1234
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,924
-You need to get going.
-Okay.

1235
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,259
-Bye.
-Thanks.

1236
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,595
-Thanks for today.
-Take care.

1237
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,495
That was so fun.

1238
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,396
THANKS FOR THE LAUGHS HYE-LYUN

1239
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,998
-I'll take it first.
-I'll do hers.

1240
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,068
Can I splash water right on her face?

1241
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,402
-Do it.
-Go like this.

1242
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,604
Lift the bucket like this.

1243
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,372
Like Hye-lyun did.

1244
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,373
No, not that.

1245
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,541
-On my face.
-Like…

1246
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,742
-Geez.
-Oops.

1247
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,278
HE'S SO CUNNING

1248
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,379
Since this is a penalty…

1249
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,681
Splash it nice and clean on my face.

1250
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,717
I'm sorry, Sook.

1251
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,226
That was well-done.

1252
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,162
-Those darn balloons.
-Nice.

1253
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,297
Did it get into your nose?

1254
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,331
Can I do Sae-ho's?

1255
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,133
-I'll go.
-Okay.

1256
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,068

00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,971
He's good at this.

1258
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:01,972
-Well…
-My nose…

1259
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,507
I'm sorry, Sook.

1260
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,908
It got into my nose.

1261
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,611
ADDING SOME MORE

1262
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,649

THEY AVOID THE BALLOON BY A CLOSE CALL

1292
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,082
They're so good.

1293
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,151
Why wouldn't anyone pop it?

1294
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,186
