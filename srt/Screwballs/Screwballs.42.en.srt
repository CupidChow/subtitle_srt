1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,837
THE LEADING FIGURE

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,872
IN THE K-POP INDUSTRY

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,008
JYP ENTERTAINMENT

4
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,145
IN ORDER TO DISCOVER
COUNTLESS STARS IN THE FUTURE

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,280
THERE WAS A LEGENDARY IDOL

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,751
WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR JYP
TO BUILD A NEW COMPANY BUILDING

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,056
YOU'RE GOING TO
COME FIND ME AGAIN

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,191
AND I'LL BE BACK THEN!

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,761
But wait…

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,462
Look.

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,331
Listen.

12
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,933
You should've chosen a weekend
to film this.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,835
There are people at work today.

14
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,938
"I'll Be Back" is actually
a really cool song.

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,640
But there was this one time

16
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,343
we prepared this costume
for an end-of-the-year awards ceremony.

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,846
It was the darkest period of our career,

18
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,083
and Screwballs insisted
that I wear that particular one.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,619
I thought I'd never have to
wear something like this again.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,687
Thank you.

21
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,291
Geez. Why is this so tight?

22
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,662
You don't wear
skinny jeans like this these days.

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,998
PEEKING IN

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,800
Come in, Woo-jae. Come in already.

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,903
Come in, Woo-jae.
I don't want to be here by myself.

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,572
Please come in.
I really can't be here by myself.

27
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,344
It's almost as if he's wearing a cast.

28
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,713
I have to walk carefully.

29
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,049
This was custom-made.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,818
This was really hand-made.

31
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,953
I was so surprised.

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,621
I wondered if it really was custom-made.

33
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,857
I thought it looked awesome,
but this turned out to be tape.

34
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,861
I lacquered the boots
all day yesterday on the roof,

35
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,296
but they fell off as soon as I wore them.

36
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,733
So I bought aluminum foil
from a store out front and wrapped them.

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,968
I had no choice.

38
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,504
How much was the total cost?

39
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,605
It was 200 won.

40
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,006
COST-EFFECTIVE COSTUME

41
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,074
This much.

42
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,610
Wait, I have to add 3,000 won
since I bought the aluminum foil.

43
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,945
So it was 3,200 won.

44
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,613
Which member are you?

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,381
I'm the main vocalist.

46
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,217
-Oh, Jun. K?
-Yeah, Jun. K.

47
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,284
MAIN VOCALIST JUN. K

48
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,924
A PERSON FROM SPACE
APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE

49
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:05,992
We're 2PM.

50
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,060
Hello.

51
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,629
I'm trying out for Hwang Chan-sung

52
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,065
on the original musical,
2PM's I'll Be Back.

53
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,201
-You're trying out for Hwang Chan-sung?
-Yes.

54
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,437
Does anyone agree
that I should take on that role?

55
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,205
Thank you. Then, I will start.

56
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,176
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE SHOWS OFF HIS TALENT

57
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,513
Here he is.

58
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,614
This is exciting.

59
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,783
Can you close up your shirt a bit?

60
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,553
It's making me feel very uncomfortable.

61
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,789
DOESN'T CARE AT ALL!

62
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,291
Why are you practicing this?

63
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,859
Doesn't it really feel like

64
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,729
we're all here to try out
for the original musical, 2PM?

65
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,464
Did you stick patches today?

66
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,567
THE NEXT CONTESTANT ENTERS

67
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,135
Let me introduce

68
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,704
Jeong Won-kwan from the group Sobangcha!

69
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,773
SOBANGCHA'S JEONG WON-KWAN!

70
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,110
WE'RE ALWAYS BAFFLED

71
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,246
BUT SHE REALLY BAFFLED US
WITH HER LOOK TODAY

72
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,683
CONTROLLED MOVES!

73
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,884
As I see the spinning lights

74
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,153
-What is this?
-He lacquered them.

75
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,254
He lacquered them.

76
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,789
-What do I do?
-It keeps falling off.

77
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,457
Look at this mess.

78
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,227
-I should've invested more money.
-But it looks nice like that.

79
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,197
-I wish I had spent 10,000 won more.
-Gosh.

80
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,531
If I spent 10,000 won more…

81
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,733
I only spent 3,200 won to save 10,000 won.

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,834
THE TRAGIC END OF THE CHEAPSKATE

83
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,870
Isn't this really that costume?

84
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,072
This one was really custom-made.

85
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,840
-It isn't the costume from that day?
-No.

86
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,409
-Move your legs.
-My legs?

87
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,212
What kind of show is this?

88
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,913
He's sweeping the floor.

89
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,916
WHILE THE CHEAPSKATE
CLEANS THE FLAKES…

90
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,117
What the heck?

91
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,854
-My gosh.
-You scared me!

92
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,425
APPEARING WITH A GREAT PHYSIQUE

93
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,994
Geez, who is that supposed to be?

94
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,629
I thought you were actually naked.

95
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,631
-That's Rain's song.
-What are you doing?

96
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,366
Why are you singing that?

97
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,834
That's Rain's song.

98
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,604
-Why would you sing "Rainism"?
-It's Rain's song, not 2PM's.

99
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,273
-That isn't 2PM's song?
-Ours is "I'll Be Back."

100
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,242
That's Rain's song.

101
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,210
-You come to our studio
-Isn't it 2PM's song?

102
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,379
-and sing someone else's song?
-Isn't it 2PM's song?

103
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,382
-Last night, I started hating you
-That's Rain's song.

104
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,717
WHATEVER SONG THEY'RE SINGING,

105
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,118
THESE TWO
ARE ALL ABOUT SOBANGCHA

106
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,021
AND THIS GUY IS BUSY SWEEPING

107
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,290
ABSOLUTE CHAOS - EVERYONE
IS DOING THEIR OWN THING

108
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,591
Did you give her the wrong info?

109
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,127
Why is she singing "Rainism"?

110
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,697
That's not how you do it.

111
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,132
It's "I'll be back."

112
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,804
She really tried hard
to dance to the music, but it was wrong.

113
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,909
Show us the original.

114
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,078
What?

115
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,615
-That's how you do it.
-I see.

116
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,452
IT'S RUDE
BUT STRANGELY ADDICTIVE

117
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,055
They paid a lot to use this song.

118
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,059
Wow! It's really bright in here.

119
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,162
Take it off. It's really bright.

120
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,697
-It's so bright.
-This is so embarrassing.

121
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,732
SHE CAME TO HER SENSES
WHEN SHE TOOK THEM OFF

122
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
It's so embarrassing.

123
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,468
-You're just now embarrassed?
-Yeah.

124
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,536
When I'm wearing them,

125
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,971
-I don't care what I do.
-Yeah.

126
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,439
I don't care at all.

127
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,107
But when I take them off, I can't do it.

128
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,643
-My eyes met with theirs.
-I know, right?

129
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,645
It's so embarrassing.

130
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,580
You can do it now, right?

131
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,618
You know, Woo-jae kind of looks the part.

132
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,686
-Yeah.
-But…

133
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,655
The rest of us don't look so great.

134
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,758
So for the original musical
2PM's "I'll Be Back,"

135
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,194
these guys passed
the first round of auditions,

136
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,562
and we're held off for now.

137
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,863
THEY'RE HELD OFF

138
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,165
-I think I failed.
-An original musical?

139
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,433
I failed.

140
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,268
Can you all stand together?

141
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,536
TAKING A COMMEMORATIVE PHOTO

142
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,904
HUDDLING UP

143
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,707
PROTECTORS OF THE EARTH

144
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,377
Gosh, you guys look brutal.

145
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,680
Doesn't she look so strong?

146
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,315
Doesn't she?

147
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,383
You know…

148
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,617
STRONG

149
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,554
She looks like steel.

150
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,956
She's like a metal human being.

151
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,459
-Is that me?
-Yeah, it's you.

152
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,961
The place where you're standing is--

153
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,598
That's right.
You're in JYP's dance rehearsal studio.

154
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,666
I can't believe it.

155
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,568
It has been a long time since you visited.

156
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,304
From my show, Saeho's Relay,

157
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,373
I came here to interview Woo-young.

158
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,708
2PM has their own studio here.

159
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,511
TWICE and Stray Kids
have their own studios too.

160
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,913
This room is called
the Michael Jackson Room.

161
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,384
They're named after great artists,
so we can be inspired by them.

162
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,919
They named two rooms
after our group and TWICE.

163
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,956
-They became singers who inspire others.
-Yes.

164
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,625
Today's dress code

165
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,595
is the costume
from the song "I'll Be Back" by 2PM,

166
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,164
the K-pop group that represents Korea.

167
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,501
Can you each tell us
who you're supposed to be?

168
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,568
I'm…

169
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,737
-Who are you?
-Jun. K.

170
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,005
-You too?
-I'm Jun. K.

171
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,073
Why are you Jun. K?

172
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,475
The rest of them wore revealing clothes.

173
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,910
-It's the same reason as you.
-Yes.

174
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,279
As I told you before,
I'm supposed to be Chan-sung.

175
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,983
I've recreated Chan-sung's
slicked-back hairstyle.

176
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,684
-Who are you?
-I'm Taec-yeon.

177
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,752
Really?

178
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,254
And what about you?

179
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,389
I'm me from back then.

180
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,893
Why did you make Chan-sung
wear vests back then?

181
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,729
-Did he have the best body?
-I think he looked best in a vest.

182
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,130
LAUGHING

183
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,466
IT WAS MY FAULT FOR ASKING

184
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,903
Do you know how popular
2PM's "I'll Be Back" was?

185
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,172
At each network's end-of-the-year show,

186
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,041
2PM had to perform
because they all wanted them.

187
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,943
Since they couldn't use the same concept,

188
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,013
they had to perform "I'll Be Back"
in various concepts.

189
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,315
-That's how this was born.
-That's why.

190
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,083
We launched into the universe.

191
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,188
So what all of this means
is that today's star is Woo-young, right?

192
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,824
The legendary K-pop idol of 18 years,

193
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,025
2PM's main dancer.

194
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,093
His charisma explodes on stage,

195
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,762
and he's a genius
when it comes to his profession.

196
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,531
Off the stage, he's a true screwball.

197
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,733
The star of today's
Deconstruction Show is Woo-young.

198
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,536
JANG WOO-YOUNG'S
DECONSTRUCTION SHOW

199
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,339
Do any of you have anything in particular

200
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,542
about Woo-young that you want to dig into?

201
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,177
Is that how it's going to be?

202
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,580
-Anything you want to know?
-Woo-young's girlfriend.

203
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,216
Again?

204
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,851
-Then--
-Woo-young's salary

205
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,619
since he's an executive.

206
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,887
His royalties.

207
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,290
I'm not doing so great

208
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,792
in all of those things though.

209
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,927
I'm struggling, guys.

210
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
GO EASY ON ME

211
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:20,166
I wonder what the real
Jang Woo-young is like.

212
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,803
The serious Woo-young at his company.
Is that the real him?

213
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,739
Or is the guy who talks nonsense
the real him?

214
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,308
-I want to know.
-"The guy who talks nonsense."

215
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,177
-You see--
-I know he's younger than you,

216
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,279
but how could you say
that he talks nonsense?

217
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,882
-How could you say that?
-I just meant…

218
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,450
We've worked together for years.

219
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,352
-Just say he says stupid things.
-Stupid things.

220
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,419
Stupid things.

221
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,188
-From nonsense to stupid things.
-Yeah.

222
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,124
We were curious about something too.

223
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,561
Recently, Woo-young became
one of the main hosts

224
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,931
of the KBS dating show called
Mind the Noona Gap.

225
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,500
CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING
A MAIN HOST OF A DATING SHOW

226
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,203
It's all thanks to you guys.

227
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,505
I read that article.
You badmouthed Jin-kyung and me.

228
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,507
Isn't that right?

229
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,909
You did do that.

230
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,976
WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED?

231
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,645
-It's a misunderstanding.
-You talked behind our backs.

232
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,413
Why do you go around saying stupid things?

233
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,651
-Why do you say stupid things?
-Stupid things and nonsense.

234
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,786
I saw the whole press conference
for the production.

235
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,121
Did you see him badmouthing us?

236
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,557
-During the press conference,
-You saw the whole thing?

237
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,458
-he got a question.
-Do you have a lot of time?

238
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:24,030
The question was, "It seems like you are
on a lot of shows with older women."

239
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,732
"Between Jin-kyung and
Sook from Screwballs

240
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,937
and Han Hye-jin and Hwang Woo-seulhye,
who do you like more?"

241
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,173
What did you say to that question,
Woo-young?

242
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,474
You see…

243
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,776
-Speak freely.
-Be clear.

244
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,477
-One, two, three.
-Go ahead.

245
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,046
I said that it wasn't you two.

246
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,481
Hear me out.

247
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,250
-Gosh.
-Hear me out.

248
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,384
-Hear me out.
-You're honestly…

249
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,452
Let's step out.

250
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,853
-Hang on.
-Let's go, ladies.

251
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,921
Let's go.

252
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,556
-Where's the glitter remover?
-I'll treat you to a meal.

253
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,059
-I'll treat you to a meal.
-Let's go. Forget about it.

254
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,193
-I'll buy you a meal.
-Hey.

255
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,596
-You seem shocked.
-We dressed up like this for you.

256
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,231
-I woke up at three this morning for this.
-Is it such a big deal?

257
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,334
I think I would have replied the same too.

258
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,401
-What?
-What?

259
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,703
-Listen to him.
-Get over here.

260
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,071
Sweep the floor.

261
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,039
Move. Move out of the way.

262
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107
THE BROOM APPEARS

263
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,675
-Come on.
-Geez.

264
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,876
HE STILL LISTENS TO
THE OLDER WOMEN WELL

265
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,513
Kim Sook and Hong Jin-kyung
or Han Hye-jin and Hwang Woo-seulhye?

266
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,015
One, two, three.

267
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,316
SIGH

268
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,718
You sighed?

269
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,520
-You're at a press conference…
-Think carefully.

270
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,022
…for our show and you're sighing?

271
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,194
Sook and Jin-kyung may hear
about this press conference and summon me.

272
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,763
I may never be able to work
in this industry.

273
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,099
-Of course, it's…
-Is it Hye-jin and Woo-seulhye?

274
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,600
Of course. Yes.

275
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,637
Let me ask you again,
since I have it written here.

276
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,206
Han Hye-jin and Hwang Woo-seulhye
or Kim Sook and Hong Jin-kyung?

277
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,507
One, two, three.

278
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,442
Of course, it's Sook and Jin-kyung.

279
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,877
Han Hye-jin and Hwang Woo-seulhye.

280
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,346
Ask Sae-ho.

281
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,081
I'm married,
so please leave me out of this.

282
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,583
THEIR FRIENDSHIP IS SO FLEETING

283
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,787
It has been 18 years
since Woo-young joined JYP.

284
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,155
-It's been a long time.
-In an open call…

285
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,858
-It has been a long time.
-…where 5,000 people applied to JYP…

286
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,726
-First place.
-…he came in first.

287
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,696
-Really?
-He was one of the first to join JYP.

288
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,831
-He did?
-He's something else.

289
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,135
You must have many fond memories
in JYP's dance rehearsal studio.

290
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,104
Can you tell us any stories
that you can remember?

291
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,740
The dance rehearsal studio

292
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,108
was like home to us.

293
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,044
We ate and slept here.

294
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,379
Even though we had our own place,

295
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,449
we worked so hard
to come up with our choreography here.

296
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,384
We wanted to practice as much as we could.

297
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,786
The dance rehearsal studio

298
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,554
was really like home to us.

299
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,022
So tell us a story.

300
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,058
What are you thinking?

301
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,259
Is it something funny?

302
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,860
No, it's nothing funny.

303
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,196
How can the communication be this bad?

304
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,298
He's so annoying!

305
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,033
-He asked for a story.
-It's like home!

306
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,535
-Tell us a story.
-Hey!

307
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,372
-Did you see any ghosts here?
-Yeah, a story like that.

308
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,074
-Oh, that kind of story?
-Yeah.

309
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,042
-Anything with the members?
-When you were practicing,

310
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,511
you say to each other,
"Do better!" or "How dare you?"

311
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,346
-Did you fight like that?
-Didn't you fight?

312
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,050
Or did you ever get locked in here
for five days?

313
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,019
Don't you have stories like that?

314
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,156
I met J. Y. Park for the first time
at our dance rehearsal studio.

315
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,891
MET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME
AT THE STUDIO!

316
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,026
Now, that's a story.

317
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,696
I didn't see him during the audition
or even after I got accepted.

318
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,698
Then, one day, he came to the HQ

319
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,533
after finishing his business in the US.

320
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,738
We didn't expect to see him at all,
so we were just sitting like this.

321
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,172
Then, someone walked in,

322
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,274
and it was someone very big.

323
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,609
I didn't know it was J. Y.

324
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,010
Were his arms down here?

325
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,913
-He has long arms.
-He does have long arms.

326
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,217
I had never seen someone like him
in my whole life.

327
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,318
What did he look like?

328
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,385
He was just…

329
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,453
Like this.

330
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,956
Like this.

331
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,023
ALMOST LIKE HIS SON

332
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,091
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

333
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,826
-Of course.
-His arms are down here.

334
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,927
His neck sticks out too.

335
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,395
He said, "Hi, guys."

336
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,799
-He walked like that. He has a groove.
-Yeah, he does.

337
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,867
"Hi, guys."

338
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,934
GREAT IMITATION LOL

339
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,369
-I know what you mean.
-You know, right?

340
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,838
-I was so surprised at that moment.
-Right.

341
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,240
I was sitting like this,
and thought, "What?"

342
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,110
He wasn't a trainee.
He definitely didn't look like one.

343
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,546
-He had an aura.
-He looked like he had debuted already.

344
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,782
You see, he didn't walk in

345
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,817
and act like someone important,

346
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,153
but he just greeted us

347
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,222
and casually acknowledged
that I was Woo-young.

348
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,625
Then, he just walked away.

349
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,928
-I can remember that so clearly even now.
-Right.

350
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,663
-That was the first time you met?
-Yeah.

351
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,832
You didn't know
that you'd be 2PM then, did you?

352
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,900
I didn't.

353
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,936
FROM A BOY FROM BUSAN
WHO LOVED DANCING

354
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,071
TO THE FIRST WINNER
OF JYP'S AUDITION!

355
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,973
2PM DEBUT COUNTDOWN,
J. Y. PARK SAYS,

356
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,241
"WILL CHANGE THE DEFINITION
OF BOY BAND"

357
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,078
JANG WOO-YOUNG REMAINS
THE MAIN DANCER OF 2PM UNTIL NOW

358
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,914
I was a fan.

359
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,981
-2PM's fan?
-I was

360
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,583
-a huge fan of 2PM.
-Really?

361
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,618
I liked them from when they debuted.

362
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,688
I was serving in the military
when "Again and Again"

363
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,291
and "I Hate You" came out,

364
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,092
so I listened to those songs all day

365
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,095
and danced to them in my mind.

366
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,064
That's why I know all of their songs.

367
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,166
-You know all of their dances too.
-I do.

368
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,103
Woo-young said this in an interview,

369
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,907
"Screwballs is like my second 2PM."

370
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,242
That's right. I saw that.

371
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,577
-I saw that interview.
-I meant that.

372
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,212
They're really like family.

373
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,047
It's just as I said.

374
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:12,484
I don't happily greet
the members of Screwballs when I see them.

375
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,088
-It'd be different if we weren't close.
-You feel comfortable.

376
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,556
My social skills would kick in,

377
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,059
and I would greet them
and ask how they're doing.

378
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,827
-You need to greet us better though.
-Yeah.

379
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,662
Then, I won't greet you at all.

380
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,930
You're so bad at greeting us.

381
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,066
I'd say, "Hey." That's about it.

382
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,569
-I ought to teach him a lesson.
-He is so rude.

383
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,404
He looks at us like we're crap.

384
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,474
So we created this episode
based on what Woo-young said

385
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,078
about Screwballs
being the second 2PM to him.

386
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,913
This makes me nervous.

387
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,315
Starting now, the Screwballs' members

388
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,050
won't be the second 2PM,

389
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,719
but they'll try to be the actual 2PM.

390
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,757
-We have five members, don't we?
-Yes.

391
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,425
And Screwballs is available

392
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,828
-at five o'clock on Sundays.
-Yes.

393
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,062
So we decided to call you

394
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,130
5PM.

395
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,198
-5PM is perfect.
-Okay.

396
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,699
-5PM.
-That's nice.

397
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,067
-I like it.
-5PM.

398
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,403
Woo-young, the second 2PM is also nice,

399
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,306
but how do you feel about
being in a group called 2PM with them?

400
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,442
Well, I think it will be

401
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,111
a very

402
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,080
long and hard road, but I guess…

403
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,882
Do they have to dance?

404
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,717
-Are you confident about dancing, Sook?
-Yes.

405
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,220
DO YOU EVEN HAVE TO ASK?

406
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,056
-That's so annoying.
-I was a Sobangcha fan since I was little.

407
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,860
I can't do the dances of other groups,
but I can do 2PM's dances.

408
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,330
So let me

409
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,034
-reveal the mission for 5PM.
-Darn it.

410
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,170
CHANGING THE SETTING

411
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,007
Geez. What are you doing?

412
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,909
Are you done shooting for today?

413
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,111
What has gotten into you?

414
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,579
Can't beat good habits.

415
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,250
What? He barely did four.

416
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,484
Habits are scary.

417
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,253
IT'S AMAZING
HE COULD EVEN DO FOUR

418
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,421
PLAYING THE VIDEO

419
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,189
-A video?
-I know this video.

420
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
What is this?

421
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,560
That's our main performance
for "I'll Be Back"

422
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,462
when our album came out.

423
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,596
It's live.

424
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,867
REPLACED THE VIDEO WITH A MUSIC
TRACK DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES

425
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,569
THE MASSIVE FAN REACTS

426
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,105
-We'll watch up to here.
-Okay.

427
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,241
-Gosh, you're so cool.
-Thank you for the video.

428
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,776
-You're cool.
-I want to keep watching it.

429
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,780
I have seen
all of 2PM's videos on YouTube.

430
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,849
-You're a real fan.
-That's incredible.

431
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,086
Looking back at those videos,
I realize just how amazing they were.

432
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,655
-Now that I watch them again, I know.
-We aren't amazing.

433
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,723
-Incredible.
-I realize it now.

434
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,024
-Keep going.
-Sure thing.

435
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,026
When you watch those videos,

436
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,361
they sing live as they dance.

437
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,596
You guys keep moving around while dancing,

438
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,298
-but you sing live so well.
-It was live.

439
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,366
Yes.

440
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,334
He's an incredible guy.

441
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,336
You don't get it
because of what he does here.

442
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,804
-Really?
-Thanks.

443
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,106
-He's something else.
-Woo-young.

444
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,974
That was high praise by Woo-jae.

445
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,810
I saw all of 2PM performances
from a long time ago, Jin-kyung.

446
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,012
-He's for real.
-Woo-jae.

447
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,747
-He's for real.
-I'm so thankful.

448
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,217
So you just watched the performance

449
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,818
of 2PM's "I'll Be Back."

450
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,720
You have now become 5PM.

451
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,556
With the real 2PM's Woo-young
as your leader,

452
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,426
you must complete
the performance of "I'll Be Back."

453
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,594
-What?
-What?

454
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,031
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW,
IT IS A VERY HARD DANCE

455
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,067
From start to finish?

456
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,802
That won't be possible.

457
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,003
When do we have until?

458
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,238
-Next year?
-No.

459
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,640
-Until when?
-The whole season.

460
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,442
You'll practice for about
an hour and a half.

461
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,743
-An hour and a half?
-Our goal

462
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,679
is to get a short-form video
that's about 30 seconds to a minute long.

463
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,148
You know,

464
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,617
I think we will be wasting our time.

465
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,385
You'll get nothing of substance.

466
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,087
Let's just shoot something else.

467
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,155
Also--

468
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,590
-That time will just disappear.
-Yeah.

469
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,360
SHE CAN'T DO IT

470
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,763
You have to be more forceful, Sae-ho.

471
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,698
You see, I can do it, but…

472
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,766
What is he saying?

473
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,002
-But she can't do it.
-What is he saying?

474
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,537
He's saying he can do it, but you can't.

475
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,172
Why is he looking at me?

476
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,176
IT'S A POSSIBILITY

477
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,379
KOREA'S LEGENDARY IDOL!

478
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,382
HE'S 2PM'S MAIN DANCER

479
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,885
AND HE ALSO PRODUCES MUSIC

480
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,587
WITH THE EXPERIENCE

481
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,223
OF A WHOPPING 18 YEARS
AS A K-POP IDOL

482
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,161
CAN HE TRANSFORM
THIS RAGTAG GROUP

483
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,564
INTO 5PM?

484
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,666
-Why don't we have Woo-young show us?
-Yeah, show us.

485
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,569
-Let's have him go first.
-I'll watch and decide if I can do it.

486
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,473
When we actually see it,
we'll know how difficult it is.

487
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,943
-In my personal opinion--
-We were members of a girl group too.

488
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,011
-I memorized all the dance moves.
-I mean, Jin-kyung and I.

489
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,480
I think they're going to do it.

490
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,648
-Show us.
-What are the basic moves?

491
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,684
First of all, I'll do the original dance.

492
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,052
HERE'S THE DANCE
THAT 5PM HAS TO LEARN

493
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,092
-The dance isn't hard, you know.
-That's not too hard.

494
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,163
The dance isn't hard.

495
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,366
It's easy.

496
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,337
HERE WE GO!

497
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,273
Wow.

498
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,010
WATCH CAREFULLY, THIS IS 2PM

499
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,949
Bam, bam, bam.

500
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,518
-Up to here?
-It's easy.

501
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,620
-It isn't easy at all.
-Okay.

502
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,021
Let me make it simple.

503
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,758
There's a reason why
"I'll Be Back" looks easy but isn't easy.

504
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,393
Do you remember the rabbit dance

505
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,761
-from your generation?
-Yeah.

506
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,397
-I know how to do that.
-You can't do the rabbit dance.

507
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,266
-It's the shuffle.
-It's different.

508
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,068
Before you explain it to us,
show us all those moves.

509
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,703
Yeah, show us the rabbit dance first.

510
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,771
Isn't it the rabbit dance?

511
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,839
-No.
-Looks like it.

512
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,509
Think of it this way.
The rabbit dance's bounce goes downwards.

513
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,944
This one goes upwards.

514
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,512
SHUFFLE DANCE
THE BOUNCE GOES UPWARDS

515
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,449
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHUFFLE DANCE
IN "I'LL BE BACK"

516
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,618
YOU BOUNCE UPWARDS

517
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,786
That's not hard.

518
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,854
-Try it.
-You bounce up.

519
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,656
Isn't this such a simple move?

520
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,723
-Really?
-Yeah.

521
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,192
Watch.

522
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,294
-The rabbit dance.
-Watch.

523
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,395
The rabbit dance.

524
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,462
You can't even do that.

525
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,730
-Rabbit dance.
-Now, "I'll Be Back."

526
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,998
-Rabbit dance.
-Now, "I'll Be Back."

527
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,166
-Yeah.
-The shuffle dance.

528
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,541
-You broke down.
-Geez.

529
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,809
You broke down.

530
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,911
Your head even knows that it's different.

531
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,413
-This is the shuffle.
-Yeah.

532
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,480
That's it.

533
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,916
You have to look up and pull your legs in.

534
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:18,984
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

535
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,686
LOOK UP AND PULL MY LEGS IN?

536
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,024
SHE'S ABOUT TO ASCEND TO HEAVEN

537
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,694
-This won't work.
-We're screwed.

538
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,563
By the way, on the first day
of practicing for Unnies,

539
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,498
-you did the up, down move.
-Wait. No.

540
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,733
I quit.

541
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,902
ABOUT TO ESCAPE

542
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,203
J. Y. hates this.

543
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,138
JYP? No, I quit.

544
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,374
Hey, that's right.

545
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,943
I didn't even pee in this direction
way back when.

546
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,013
-This is crazy. Why is this so hard?
-Let's watch it again.

547
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,049
-Show us how, but clearly and slowly.
-Yeah.

548
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,117
-All right.
-Okay.

549
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,986
You pull and then step.

550
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,053
-Step.
-Yes.

551
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,888
-Pull, step.
-Pull, step.

552
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,990
-Yeah.
-Step.

553
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,292
-Step, step, step.
-Step, step.

554
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,894
-Step, step, step.
-Step, step.

555
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,596
HOWEVER

556
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,865
ONE STUDENT CAN'T EVEN LEARN
FROM A PERFECT LESSON

557
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,100
CRYING

558
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,401
-Look at my right leg.
-You're doing better.

559
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,069
-Pull, step, pull, step.
-Pull, step.

560
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,137
LAUGHING

561
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,673
-Pull, step, pull, step.
-Pull, step, pull, step.

562
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,608
LAUGHING

563
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,243
I envy you.

564
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,678
I TOLD YOU THIS WOULDN'T WORK

565
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,513
-I'm not good either.
-Step.

566
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,949
-But I envy her. She's funny.
-No, step.

567
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,918
Can't you just let me stay as 2PM?

568
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,588
-There's something wrong with 5PM.
-Pull, step, pull, step.

569
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,456
How do you acquire such talent?

570
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,393
Can't you just do a prank on me too?

571
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,028
I did what you told me to do.

572
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,830
Can you check out this person too?

573
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,465
What are you, a chicken?

574
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,968
A chicken? Come on, that's so harsh.

575
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,571
SHE DOES LOOK LIKE A CHICKEN
GOING AFTER ITS FEED

576
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,140
She looks like a chicken.

577
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,042
Look at her hands.

578
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,210
What are you doing with your hands?

579
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,412
HER MYSTERIOUS FINGERS

580
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,680
Come on, Sook.

581
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,716
HER MIND AND BODY
MOVE SEPARATELY

582
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,784
Look.

583
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,586
-It's so hard.
-Sook, your leg

584
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,121
-looks so cute.
-Okay.

585
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,723
-But after you lift it…
-Okay.

586
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,924
…you pull it out like this.

587
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,493
UNDER WOO-YOUNG'S LEADERSHIP,
THEY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MOVE

588
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,761
Hands go to the back. That's it.

589
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,196
You don't go forward though.

590
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,264
THEY'RE STILL LOST

591
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,200
I CAN'T DO IT

592
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,268
Let me try too.

593
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,703
Go like this

594
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,870
and move it to the back.

595
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,939
SAE-HO GOT TIRED OF TEACHING,
SO HE JOINED THE ADVANCED GROUP

596
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,075
Let's just sit back here.

597
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,142
SOME FINALLY RAN AWAY

598
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,044
I don't think I can do this.

599
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,380
-I can't do the shuffle.
-It's so hard.

600
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,148
Let's just try that dance.

601
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,216
-Go.
-I want to try.

602
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,918
SOOK AND JIN-KYUNG
JOIN THE ADVANCED GROUP TOO

603
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,619
Why are they moving so fast?

604
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:36,988
Okay.

605
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:44,429
THE SIGNATURE TOP POSE DANCE
THAT CLOSES OUT THE INTRO

606
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,164
Ready, go.

607
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,602
TURNS ON HIS REAL JOB MODE

608
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,205
-Yes.
-I got it.

609
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,272
Again. Go.

610
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,808
DID JIN-KYUNG
GET IT IMMEDIATELY?

611
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,113
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU GOT IT?

612
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,814
-Okay.
-I saw it as clear as day.

613
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,015
She said, "I got it."

614
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,819
I saw it as clear as day.

615
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,221
THAT JERK

616
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,456
She said it herself that she got it.

617
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,859
TAUNTING HER

618
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,627
-Isn't that right? Is that wrong?
-I saw it.

619
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,830
EVEN SHE THINKS IT'S FUNNY

620
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,232
-That's right.
-Do it again.

621
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,834
Okay. Got it.

622
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,236
I, JIN-KYUNG,
CANNOT GIVE UP LIKE THIS

623
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,303
That's it.

624
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,772
-Ready, go.
-You're fast.

625
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,974
I'LL REPEAT IT UNTIL I GET IT!

626
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,242
-That's it!
-I got it.

627
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,810
Ready, go.

628
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:32,911
You got it.

629
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,613
She got it.

630
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,516
-Wait, we may be able to pull it off.
-Ready, go.

631
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,153
WE WERE IN A GIRL GROUP

632
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,220
You're in good shape today.

633
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,622
-We got it.
-We got the hang of it.

634
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,756
Try this one then.

635
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:45,824
-What?
-Look.

636
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,993
It's the part that goes,
"You promised me."

637
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,861
-That's the part.
-Okay.

638
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,264
-Isn't it this?
-Yeah.

639
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,331
WOO-JAE DOES IT EASILY

640
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,466
We can do this.

641
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,701
-We can do this.
-That's too easy.

642
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,309
SOOK, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT!

643
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,579
JIN-KYUNG, WE LOOK PERFECT!

644
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,981
IN AWE

645
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,249
Wasn't that right?

646
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,651
You know what's scary about them?

647
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,553
They can actually do it,

648
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,188
but they do it so strangely.

649
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,789
THE REASON WHY
SOMEONE WITH ZERO SKILLS

650
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,857
BUT HIGH CONFIDENCE IS DANGEROUS

651
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,560
They can do it.
It's not that they can't do it.

652
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,496
-Good job, Jin-kyung.
-You can't return from where they went.

653
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,597
Let's learn from the top.

654
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,665
Okay. Let's try.

655
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,133
-Here are the main moves.
-Okay.

656
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,602
During the verse "You promised me,"
you stick your hip out.

657
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,837
-The right side.
-Okay.

658
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,506
-Stretch this arm out to the back. Yeah.
-Stretch it out.

659
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,442
Come up.

660
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,080
That's it. And then,
stick your bottom out again.

661
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,216
Stick it out, and then snatch with this.

662
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,784
EVEN THOUGH
THEY'RE A BIT CLUMSY,

663
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,452
THEY LEARN THE DANCE
WITH SINCERITY

664
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,120
TRYING HARD

665
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,356
SERIOUS

666
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,824
-Let's try one at a time.
-Okay.

667
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,059
STARTING NOW,
YOU WILL SEE THE DANCE

668
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,427
TRANSFORM IN A VARIETY OF WAYS

669
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,395
You promised me

670
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,232
CUTE, CUTE

671
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,100
HOW AM I DOING?

672
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,035
-Pass.
-Go to the back.

673
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,004
-Jin-kyung, your turn.
-All right. Ready, go.

674
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,739
You promised me

675
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,942
LET'S GO, LET'S GO

676
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,545
THE INSANE PULL AND PUSH

677
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,613
-Nailed it, right?
-Wait.

678
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,680
-I did it.
-Wait.

679
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,782
-This is good enough for me to pass.
-Okay.

680
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,684
-Okay.
-You promised me

681
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,454
One, two, three, four.

682
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,889
You promised me

683
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,458
One, two, three, four.

684
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,526
LEAVING THE FRAME

685
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,694
-Good job, Sook.
-Wasn't it perfect?

686
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,329
IN AGONY

687
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,198
-You promised me
-You promised me

688
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,734
One, two. One, two, three, four.

689
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,801
We nailed it.

690
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,503
-Let's go with this.
-We got it.

691
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,906
-Woo-young, I'll show you.
-Okay.

692
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,508
You promised me

693
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,077
UNLIKE SOMEONE,
HIS MOVES ARE NEAT

694
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,746
-I got it. My arms were wrong.
-Okay.

695
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,813
Ready, go.

696
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,216
You promised me

697
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,718
-One, two, three, four.
-That's it. We got it.

698
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,320
Isn't that right?

699
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,056
Sook, you know who you remind me of?

700
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,724
My PE teacher.

701
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,193
Sook, your arms don't go like this.

702
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,095
-You have to sweep it up like this.
-Okay.

703
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,464
Chest out, chest out.

704
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,033
And sweep up.

705
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,267
And sweep up.

706
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,502
And sweep up.

707
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,203
She got it!

708
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,439
-You got it. You did it.
-Okay.

709
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,007
I can't climb that wall of talent.

710
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,176
You're so funny.

711
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,246
Did you ask us to do this
because you wanted to see this?

712
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:26,484
HAVE A DRINK SINCE IT'S FUNNY

713
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,955
Also, what's most important is
to not bump into each other.

714
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,626
-You have to move to the side.
-Okay.

715
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,561
THEY HAVE TO
CHANGE POSITIONS NATURALLY

716
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,430
WHILE THEY DO THE SHUFFLE

717
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,433
-Then, where do I go?
-Two people can change spots.

718
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,268
-Okay.
-You and I can switch.

719
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,370
-You can dance in the front.
-After the shuffle?

720
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,638
Then, switch with Sook.

721
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,939
-One, two…
-Three, four.

722
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,007
I'll be back

723
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,475
Two, three.

724
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:55,213
THEY MOVE ACCORDING TO
HOW THEY WERE TAUGHT

725
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,048
HMM…

726
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,084
When you move while you do this,

727
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,019
-you ladies keep moving like this.
-Okay.

728
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,121
-What should we do?
-Use your back leg to go back.

729
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,556
That's right!

730
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,292
THE TWO WOMEN
USED THEIR FRONT LEG

731
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,827
WOO-JAE CAUGHT IT IN ONE GLANCE

732
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,629
-Nice catch.
-The back leg.

733
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,598
You aren't moving forward.
From the direction you're going…

734
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,968
You're doing well, Sook. Yes.

735
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,370
This is unbelievable.

736
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,238
-Don't twist your leg.
-Right.

737
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,473
Your right leg to the right.

738
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,841
That's it, Sook.

739
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,042
To the back.

740
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,610
Go to the side like this too.

741
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,178
Use your back leg. That's it.

742
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,246
SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

743
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,682
SPEECHLESS

744
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,251
What's wrong?

745
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,919
Look to the left.

746
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,721
Stretch your right leg
to the opposite side.

747
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,523
-That's it.
-Now, pull it in.

748
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,591
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT, SOOK

749
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,593
-That's it!
-Now, look to the right.

750
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,828
Now, use your left leg
and pull it in again.

751
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:44,896
That's it.

752
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,332
Watch us one by one.
Woo-young, watch us one by one.

753
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,500
-Yeah, one by one.
-Okay.

754
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,168
-You go, Woo-jae.
-From my place.

755
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,438
-Doesn't the chorus repeat after this?
-Yes.

756
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,807
-You learned practically everything.
-Okay, let's try.

757
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,212
THE ONLY REAL HOPE FOR 5PM

758
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,915
WHAT WILL HIS
"I'LL BE BACK" BE LIKE?

759
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,750
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

760
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:13,158
NO ONE ELSE CAN
LOVE YOU MORE THAN ME

761
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,893
PERFECT STEPS

762
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,864
I go to the back.

763
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,399
CHANGES POSITIONS SMOOTHLY TOO

764
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,635
Looking good. His dance is steady.

765
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,737
It's steady.

766
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,542
EVEN HIS ENDING WAS PERFECT

767
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,378
GOOD JOB, JOO WOO-JAE

768
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,646
-Good job.
-Wow!

769
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,648
I saw them perform about 500 times.

770
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,716
Gosh.

771
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,684
ONE MAN QUIETLY WALKS UP
AND GETS READY

772
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,321
HE'S VERY SERIOUS LOL

773
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,389
Look at his pose.

774
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,028
ACTUALLY, THIS MAN HAS A DREAM

775
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,564
I really want to be a member of 2PM!

776
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,698
Nice.

777
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,933
Focus.

778
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,168
It's "I'll Be Back"!

779
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,873
Go!

780
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,841
HE'S DOING WELL

781
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,743
Wow!

782
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,678
He even did the turn.

783
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,546
-Go! Go!
-Let's go!

784
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,448
Two, three, four.

785
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,922
GOOD JOB!

786
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:18,990
Did I do it?

787
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,258
How did I do?

788
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,659
HE DID WELL,
BUT WHY IS IT FUNNY?

789
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,362
When Sae-ho took off his sunglasses
after he finished,

790
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,497
he had tears in his eyes.

791
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:26,998
I was really focused!

792
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,299
Why did you cry?

793
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,367
Why did you cry?

794
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,269
I was crying while I did it.

795
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,071
-Let's keep this vibe going.
-Let's go.

796
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,139
Wasn't I pretty close?

797
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,540
-You did well.
-Keep it going.

798
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,676
At this rate, we might actually film
the short-form video.

799
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:39,744
Yeah, we have to.

800
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,646
THE BIGGEST HURDLE
TO THE SHORT-FORM VIDEO

801
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,248
We should do a real performance!

802
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,049
As long as Jin-kyung does well…

803
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,218
Three, four, five, six.

804
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,720
-Your legs.
-Stretch out your legs!

805
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,989
One, two, three, four, five, six.

806
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,457
The shuffle, go!

807
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,726
Let's go!

808
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,295
The shuffle, the shuffle, the shuffle. Go!

809
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,531
To the side, to the side.

810
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,132
The shuffle, the shuffle.

811
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,901
To the side, to the side.

812
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,903
-Let's go!
-You got this!

813
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,340
SHE DID IT!

814
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,408
You did well.

815
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,377
-Gosh, Jin-kyung.
-Jin-kyung.

816
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,845
-You were pretty close.
-Why are you so good?

817
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,648
-That was pretty close. I did it!
-It was.

818
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,017
I was counting on you.

819
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,286
What surprised me
was this part in the beginning.

820
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,955
If she felt intimidated,
she couldn't have done it.

821
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,290
But you did it, Jin-kyung.

822
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,959
HER MOVE LANDED
PERFECTLY ON THE BEAT!

823
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,494
FEELING PROUD

824
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,496
Of course, you ended it like this.

825
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,598
FLUTTERING

826
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,767
LAUGHING

827
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,135
The way she landed on the beat was just…

828
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,137
-Awesome, Jin-kyung.
-Let's do this, Sook.

829
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,272
-We're pretty close.
-Yeah, we are.

830
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,407
We were pretty close.

831
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,209
If she can stay on the beat like that,

832
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,944
our short-form video would look okay.

833
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,312
That's right.

834
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:51,683
LAST UP, KIM SOOK

835
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,886
Wow! Don Lee knows how to dance too?

836
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,654
SERIOUS DESPITE THE DISTRACTIONS

837
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:57,722
Chest.

838
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,792
-Four, five, six, seven, eight.
-My PE teacher.

839
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,694
PE Teacher!

840
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,596
One, two. The shuffle, go!

841
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,865
-Good.
-Good.

842
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,168
LAUGHING

843
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,237
-Go!
-The shuffle, go!

844
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,805
-Nice!
-The shuffle, the shuffle.

845
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,206
-Go! Go!
-You're doing good!

846
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,542
-The shuffle, the shuffle.
-Two, three, four. Go!

847
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,148
SHE POSES LIKE
A SUPERSTAR AT THE END

848
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,251
-Okay.
-We did it! It's over!

849
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,719
-We did it. It's over.
-Let's try.

850
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,388
-Let's do it together.
-You can all do this move.

851
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,357
Let's try doing it all together.

852
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,158
Let's try one last time.

853
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,228
-And then, finish filming for today.
-Let's see how we do.

854
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,297
Can you film us individually?

855
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,667
You're being ridiculous.

856
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,803
What? Film you individually?

857
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,372
Film each one of us?

858
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,375
LAUGHING

859
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,644
When would I ever be able to
experience that?

860
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,713
We should invite about 300 fans again.

861
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,249
-This is getting out of hand.
-We got this!

862
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,085
Your faces look like
you regret doing this.

863
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,054
Look at the crew's faces.

864
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,925
THE AUDIENCE MAY
ONLY BE THE CREW

865
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,559
INSTEAD OF FANS

866
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,762
BUT 5PM MEMBERS
APPROACH THIS SINCERELY

867
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,965
I'LL BE BACK THEN

868
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:18,503
NO ONE ELSE CAN LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ME

869
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,842
We go this way, Sook. We go this way.

870
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,378
We did it.

871
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,113
Okay. Going to the left!

872
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,549
Get ready.

873
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,117
Okay. Going in!

874
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,126
LAUGHING

875
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,329
-We were cool.
-I almost ran into you.

876
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,930
-I just have to remember that.
-I avoided you.

877
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,765
-We looked cool. We were all right.
-We were.

878
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,134
-Can we see the video?
-Let's have a look and try again.

879
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,636
We were awesome just now.

880
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,105
I don't like that you guys were awesome.

881
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,107
THEY MONITOR
THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY

882
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,175
AS IF THEY WERE
ON A MUSIC PROGRAM

883
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,242
Like this.

884
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,811
Okay. Going in!

885
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:03,915
What the heck?

886
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,983
What the heck?

887
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,552
Is this what you call experience?

888
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,820
HAHAHA

889
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,254
What is going on?

890
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,857
We can't just sit here like this.
We should go on Sing Again.

891
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,058
WE SHOULD GO ON SING AGAIN

892
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,827
I've fallen in love with myself.

893
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,963
-Let's go.
-Let's try it again.

894
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,565
-Let's film the video.
-Just this.

895
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,632
Can we do it now?

896
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,801
How many minutes was that?

897
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,070
Thirty seconds?
Is it better if it's longer?

898
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,472
No, this is better.

899
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,539
What are you saying?

900
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,009
I just want it up to this one part.

901
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,076
-What part?
-Let's see.

902
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,846
Remember the verse when we did this?

903
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:35,913
We can do it up to that.

904
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,682
Oh, we didn't do that.

905
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:42,954
THE DANCE THEY
WORKED HARD TO LEARN!

906
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,492
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
TO SKIP THAT PART

907
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,027
Then, how about we…

908
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,628
GO STRAIGHT OUT AFTER THE INTRO?

909
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,130
How about we go straight to the verse?

910
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,798
We can cut out the middle part.

911
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,200
-We can do that.
-Yeah, let's do that.

912
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,668
That would be better to make it more fun.

913
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,736
To "You promised me." Okay.

914
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,271
Can you edit it like that right now?

915
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,574
-Director Park.
-He can do it.

916
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,512
THEY USE AN APP
ON THEIR PHONE TO EDIT

917
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,747
When we did "Never"
during the past lives episode,

918
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,717
I thought Sae-ho, Sook,
and Jin-kyung were amazing.

919
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,219
-I get why you were so exhausted.
-Of course.

920
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,754
WHAT?

921
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,222
What are you talking about?

922
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,390
We aren't tired.

923
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,226
Didn't you have fun doing it, Jin-kyung?

924
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,294
Of course.

925
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,729
Were other people tired, then?

926
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,931
Listen while you relax.

927
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:27,999
-Okay
-Okay.

928
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,601
-Let me give you some motivation.
-Okay.

929
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,370
-In a little while--
-Come on.

930
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,704
Come on. Don't.

931
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,339
Is it an end-of-month evaluation?

932
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,375
There will be an end-of-month evaluation.

933
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,576
-Geez.
-You're insane.

934
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,344
What were you all thinking?

935
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,746
Why are you doing this?

936
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,849
Can you explain
what an end-of-month evaluation is?

937
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,884
With that one evaluation,

938
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,388
you may or may not debut as a singer.

939
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,324
You may or may not go home.

940
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,559
Those things are at stake.

941
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,028
Since we decided to do this,

942
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,030
I thought you should get evaluated

943
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,765
and get compliments from others too.

944
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,401
-Can't we just compliment ourselves?
-I thought it would be nice to do that,

945
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,138
so JYP's performance directors
will come here…

946
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,240
Darn it!

947
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,675
They'll come here in a little while.

948
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,910
This is how I honestly feel.

949
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,280
If I can debut after the evaluation,
I'll do it.

950
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,715
EXCUSE ME?

951
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,150
Why should we be evaluated without that?

952
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,284
-He's right.
-Yeah.

953
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,954
We're just hardworking celebrities.

954
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,157
There will be a punishment for the person
who scores the lowest.

955
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,725
They have to go out to the street and…

956
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,626
BURST OUT LAUGHING

957
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,195
LAUGHING

958
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,997
-And do this dance?
-This is insane.

959
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,366
In front of at least five people,

960
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,202
you have to do a solo performance
without any music.

961
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,837
You will also give autographs

962
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,005
to those who watched

963
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,207
and return after you promote Screwballs.

964
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,878
CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH

965
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,779
As long as I don't come in last, right?

966
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,014
To be honest,

967
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,518
Sae-ho, Sook, Jin-kyung,
and I can just close our eyes and do it.

968
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,486
But he should be chosen.

969
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,856
If he's chosen,

970
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,658
he'll have to dance to his own song.

971
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,427
But Woo-young is the leader right now,

972
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,530
so he'll be judged
by a different criterion.

973
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,231
He'll be judged by his team.

974
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,800
If he can't lead his team well,

975
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,235
-he must take responsibility.
-We're confident.

976
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,703
Didn't you see how we were in sync?

977
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,107
If the overall score, which is calculated
by averaging all the members' points,

978
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,609
is less than six points
out of a total of ten points,

979
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,479
he'll get the same punishment
as the person in last place.

980
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,547
As a team?

981
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,850
Even if someone comes in last,
if the team gets less than six points,

982
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,318
Woo-young gets punished, right?

983
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,887
Woo-young and the person in last place
will both get punished.

984
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,289
Let's do that then.

985
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,657
-That's better.
-The two can do it together.

986
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,824
Yeah, that's better.

987
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,959
Okay. I got it.

988
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,194
Doing it alone is embarrassing.

989
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,261
I have a question.

990
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,898
When they conduct
the end-of-the-month evaluation,

991
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,801
is the criteria based on
following the beat and talent or laughter?

992
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,703
Wouldn't they consider
a variety of things?

993
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,638
They may judge you well
if they're drawn to you.

994
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,873
I'm screwed.

995
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,409
-Okay.
-They're too strong.

996
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,345
I'm way too bland compared to them.

997
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,014
-You can't get any flavor from me.
-You are bland.

998
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,717
This one is pretty salty.

999
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,853
And she is super spicy.

1000
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,255
SUPER SPICY

1001
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,790
How can I possibly beat them?

1002
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,660
-Geez. We are screwed.
-All right.

1003
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,463
-We completed editing the song.
-Okay!

1004
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,866
Let's listen to the song
while Woo-young performs solo.

1005
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,101
We can follow along, right?

1006
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,169
-Of course.
-Okay.

1007
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,837
Try listening to it first.

1008
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,939
-You don't have to be good right now.
-Okay.

1009
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,108
-It's important to get used to the rhythm.
-Yes, sir.

1010
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,044
You can't dance too hard right now.

1011
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,413
Do well when we get evaluated.
No need to overdo it now.

1012
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,948
-Okay.
-Play the music.

1013
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,985
THEY START PRACTICING
WITH THE EDITED SONG

1014
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,787
IN THIS MOMENT

1015
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,522
Just picture the performance in your head.

1016
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,590
Remember the timing.

1017
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,026
The beat. Chest.

1018
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,861
Two, two, three, four. Legs.

1019
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,830
WE ARE 5PM

1020
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,932
It's better if you use your hands too.

1021
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,367
IN THE K-POP WORLD

1022
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,035
REGARDLESS OF ONE'S AGE

1023
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,004
IT'S BEST TO LISTEN
TO WHOEVER DOES BEST

1024
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,106
BASED ON THE
YOUNGEST MEMBER'S GUIDANCE,

1025
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,240
THE MEMBERS DO THEIR PART

1026
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,376
To the left. To the right.

1027
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,278
All right. Get ready to go in.

1028
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,445
MUST STAY ON BEAT FOR TOP POSE

1029
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,247
YOU PROMISED ME

1030
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,782
I see. We can't do the top pose.

1031
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,883
Got it.

1032
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,121
You know what?

1033
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,822
HE SEEMS TO WANT
TO DO THE TOP POSE

1034
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,858
Wouldn't it look cooler
if we ended it like this?

1035
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,793
-Up to that then?
-Yeah, let's do it up to that.

1036
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,828
THEN, WHAT ABOUT
"YOU PROMISED ME"?

1037
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,397
Let's try the "You promised me" part.

1038
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,731
No, we didn't promise you.

1039
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,366
-But you did promise me.
-No, we didn't.

1040
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,501
Play it again.

1041
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,669
But we practiced it.

1042
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,203
-Let's hear it one more time.
-Then…

1043
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,674
We'd have to go into it like this.

1044
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,841
-It's too hard.
-Yeah.

1045
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,610
BEFORE THE DANCE
FOR THE PREVIOUS VERSE ENDS

1046
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,879
IT GOES RIGHT INTO
THE NEXT VERSE

1047
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,314
-The beat is awkward.
-The editing…

1048
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,549
IT'S AWKWARD TO
DANCE TO THAT BEAT

1049
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,152
-Then, let's not do this.
-Let's just not do this.

1050
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,219
Wouldn't we look cool

1051
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,487
-if we did it together?
-Yeah.

1052
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,989
Then, let's end with that.

1053
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,891
-That would look cool.
-But we can't do that.

1054
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,759
-Like this?
-But it would look better if we did.

1055
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,928
-Let's do this move and go right into it.
-Yeah, let's do it.

1056
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,697
-We can't. Please.
-Why not?

1057
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,032
Then, let's just omit the hand part.

1058
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,702
-Then--
-Let's just do the dance up to here.

1059
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,070
-That's what I--
-It wouldn't look cool.

1060
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,371
-This looks cool.
-Can you play

1061
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,106
-the music, please?
-Why are we so serious?

1062
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,408
-Look. It goes like this, right?
-Yes.

1063
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,744
Look.

1064
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,812
Play the music, please.

1065
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:09,814
We can do it.

1066
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,016
SOOK K WANTS TO
SHOW THEM HERSELF

1067
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,087
LET'S GO

1068
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,155
Yeah, it works.

1069
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,924
COME ON

1070
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,991
Come over here.

1071
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,059
-Works, right?
-They're annoying.

1072
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,029
-Let's just do this.
-Let's do this move along with that.

1073
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,432
-Okay, let's go like this.
-You can do it with that.

1074
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,668
-We can do all of it.
-Why are you saying it won't work?

1075
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,870
-But you have to promise me something.
-He can't dance.

1076
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,038
Hey, Woo-young.

1077
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,973
-Woo-young, look.
-We can just go right in.

1078
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,775
SOOK, HONG, CHO
TEACH HIM A LESSON

1079
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,077
-We can just go in together.
-Yeah, move forward.

1080
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,179
-Is that so hard?
-Woo-jae, they're so annoying.

1081
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,481
Is it that hard?

1082
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,383
How can you call yourself a leader?

1083
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,450
Look at how we do it.

1084
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,252
-Play the music, please.
-Play the music.

1085
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,488
Why do they keep asking to play the music?

1086
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,890
They demand music like they demand money.

1087
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:53,958
-Ready, go.
-Go.

1088
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,560
You promised me

1089
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,096
WHY IS THIS HARD?

1090
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,399
HE'S SO DUMBFOUNDED
THAT ALL HE CAN DO IS LAUGH

1091
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,603
THE REVOLT OF THE UNDERDOGS

1092
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,472
A NEAT ENDING

1093
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,441
-It works.
-Don't you see that it works?

1094
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,243
Let's do it this way.

1095
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,812
-You lack the basics.
-The three of us did it, didn't we?

1096
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,114
-It works.
-Okay. Woo-jae.

1097
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,717
-He has no rhythm.
-I know.

1098
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,952
If you break up the beat,
you can add all of it.

1099
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,854
The same goes for you too.

1100
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,123
-Yeah.
-I have no words right now.

1101
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,059
-You move along with it.
-That's it.

1102
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,496
Got it?

1103
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,965
Hey, you know how to do this, don't you?

1104
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,634
We learned all of it.

1105
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,470
I hate this so much.

1106
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,071
THE FIRST ESSENTIAL QUALITY
OF A SUPERSTAR DANCE

1107
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,139
IS ALL ABOUT CONFIDENCE

1108
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,207
One, two, three, four.

1109
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,276
I hate you so much!

1110
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,544
THAT ISN'T OUR DANCE

1111
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,813
Go to the front and move to the back.

1112
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,247
Isn't she really hilarious?

1113
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,315
Spin.

1114
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,917
Why is that so hard?

1115
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,819
HEY, YOU CAN DO IT TOO

1116
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,687
-You see--
-She does…

1117
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,922
She does such a good job

1118
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,424
of making the moves
so ridiculously seamless

1119
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,792
that I lost all motivation.

1120
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,427
DUMFOUNDED BUT CONVINCED

1121
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,362
-Let's go with that.
-Okay, let's try it out.

1122
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,364
-Okay.
-Since we're getting evaluated.

1123
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,200
The formation is very important.

1124
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,403
Performance directors
put a lot of emphasis on the formation.

1125
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,004
That's their problem.

1126
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,373
Why do we have to care about that?

1127
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,641
We're struggling as it is.

1128
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,809
We're too busy for that.

1129
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:19,877
THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE

1130
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,246
THEY GET BACK INTO PRACTICING
AFTER A LOT OF CONSIDERATION

1131
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,314
Two, three, four.

1132
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,249
You promised me

1133
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,685
Let's go. Keep going.

1134
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,854
Focus!

1135
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,455
THEY HAD A BRIEF CLASH
OF OPINIONS,

1136
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,123
BUT THEY GOT BACK
TO WORKING TOGETHER

1137
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,191
That's it!

1138
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,926
Go back. Then, go forward.

1139
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,929
That's what you told me

1140
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,731
THEY SEEM LIKE A MISMATCH,
BUT THEY FIT WELL

1141
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,067
ABOUT 30 MINUTES
UNTIL THEIR EVALUATION

1142
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,236
-You promised me
-You promised me

1143
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,303
You said

1144
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,371
Move back.

1145
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,406
We should never change

1146
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,610
You said we were a pair

1147
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,677
Cross from here.

1148
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,745
-Like this?
-Okay.

1149
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,946
Ready, go.

1150
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,248
DO IT EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

1151
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,516
ALL YOU'LL HAVE LEFT
IS THE RESULTS

1152
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,618
-The rhythm when we cross here.
-Yeah.

1153
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,053
-I go over there and come back.
-You did well on the way back.

1154
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,121
The transition is off.

1155
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,556
THOROUGHLY MONITORING THEMSELVES

1156
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,691
You can go in further
next to Woo-jae, Sook.

1157
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,427
There's a whole couch between you two.

1158
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,495
You can get closer.

1159
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:16,734
5 MINUTES TO THEIR EVALUATION,
DOING THEIR FINAL RUN THROUGH

1160
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,038
NOW IS THE TIME
TO MAXIMIZE THEIR TEAMWORK

1161
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,177
THEY WORKED SO HARD FOR
ABOUT 90 MINUTES TO BECOME 5PM

1162
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,814
Back to your place.

1163
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,616
A BIT SHAMELESS, BUT THEY TRY
TO BE 5PM IN A SHORT TIME

1164
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,251
CAN THEY GET A GOOD EVALUATION

1165
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,586
AND BE RECOGNIZED
AS REAL K-POP ARTISTS?

1166
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,054
Sook, go in. Go in.

1167
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,122
That's it.

1168
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,959
JIN-KYUNG'S CAM,
WOO-YOUNG'S CAM,

1169
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,795
WOO-JAE'S CAM, SOOK'S CAM,
SAE-HO'S CAM

1170
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:50,501
THE FULL VIDEO OF EACH MEMBER'S
INDIVIDUAL SHOT IS COMING SOON

1171
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,536
Stay in position.

1172
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,204
YOU MAY NOT WANT IT

1173
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,641
BUT THEIR ENDING POSE SHOT
IS COMING SOON TOO

1174
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,742
Don't smile.

1175
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,516
You can just stay where you are.

1176
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,850
They'll be coming here.

1177
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,319
-Okay.
-You can perform as you did

1178
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,887
for the short-form video just now.

1179
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,088
Do we only have one chance?

1180
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,756
-Just one shot.
-Of course.

1181
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,224
Please be understanding.

1182
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,528
-They're mesmerized by their own video.
-Of course.

1183
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,896
What are we going to do about this?

1184
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,731
I think this is going to blow up.

1185
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,166
Do you think you'll be asked to perform?

1186
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,503
I think there will be
more than a couple of thousand people.

1187
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,773
Isn't it so amazing? How long did it take?
An hour and a half?

1188
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,175
I think we're geniuses.

1189
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,645
You can't have better teamwork than this.

1190
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,413
We'll have to go to Gocheok Sky Dome.

1191
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,248
THE HUMILIATION WILL REACH
GOCHEOK SKY DOME

1192
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:42,419
All right. We have the honor
of having two performance directors

1193
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,121
from none other than JYP.

1194
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,190
Why do we have to honor them?

1195
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,592
-We're all working the same work.
-I wonder…

1196
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,662
You know, we're on the same level.

1197
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,164
-At this rate--
-We're not below them, are we?

1198
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,066
Shall we have them come in?

1199
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,968
-Welcome!
-There he goes.

1200
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,638
WELCOME, SIRS

1201
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:01,705
Your seats are ready.

1202
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:02,906
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1203
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,109
THE DIRECTORS ENTER
TO AN ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME

1204
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,910
-Hello.
-Hello.

1205
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,278
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

1206
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,180
Hello.

1207
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,248
-Hello.
-Hello.

1208
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,650
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1209
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:13,717
HERE ARE YOUR SEATS OF HONOR

1210
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,818
-Have a seat here.
-Hello.

1211
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:15,919
Please have a seat here.

1212
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,956
Geez. Stop being so embarrassing.

1213
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,024
Thank you.

1214
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,325
Thank you for coming.

1215
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,626
The color of your sweater is gorgeous.

1216
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:23,894
HONED HIS FLATTERING SKILLS
FOR TODAY

1217
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,864
-It goes perfectly with this weather.
-Good job.

1218
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,999
Your makeup suits you.

1219
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,802
I love the details of their outfits.

1220
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,904
Hello.

1221
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:36,640
I'm Choi Him-chan,
and I'm a performance director at JYP.

1222
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,942
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1223
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,844
He isn't debuting?

1224
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,148
-He's a director. I had no idea.
-Good job!

1225
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,616
-Good job.
-Please go ahead.

1226
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,386
Hello, my name is Na Tae-hoon,
and I'm also a performance director.

1227
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,355
Gosh, how is that possible?

1228
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:56,193
I think the viewers might want to know
what a performance director does.

1229
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,098
Basically, we're in charge of the artists'
choreography and stage production.

1230
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,400
And when the artists perform,

1231
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,304
we make sure the overall choreography
is as closely aligned as possible.

1232
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,605
-I have a question.
-Yes?

1233
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,941
Did you study dancing then?

1234
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,343
-Yes.
-If it isn't rude to ask,

1235
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,814
can the two of you do the dance
for "I'll Be Back" too?

1236
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,981
That's so rude!

1237
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,184
-You should kneel and apologize.
-Then,

1238
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,785
-can you show us briefly?
-Yeah.

1239
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,120
-Geez.
-With Woo-young.

1240
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,722
Come on, guys. You crossed the line.

1241
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,789
YOU WANT US TO DANCE TO A SONG

1242
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,857
RELEASED 15 YEARS AGO
ON THE SPOT?

1243
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,158
-Just once.
-Come on!

1244
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,960
-Do you want them to deduct points?
-Show us.

1245
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,628
-Can you do it?
-Just once.

1246
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,964
-How can you ask them that?
-They're going to do it.

1247
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,333
WILL THEY SEE THE REAL
"I'LL BE BACK"?

1248
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,202
-It'll be totally different.
-Awesome.

1249
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,870
-This way?
-Yes.

1250
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,071
-Are you joining us?
-Yes.

1251
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,139
Will you please get out of the way?

1252
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,074
-Should I?
-Should we stand in the back?

1253
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,910
-I focus on your body line.
-Are you crazy?

1254
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,513
-Should we look this way?
-No, look that way.

1255
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,949
-Why?
-I'll be looking at your body line.

1256
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,785
The two performance directors will show us
how it's done. Give them a big hand!

1257
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,121
WILL THE DIRECTORS REMEMBER THE
CHOREOGRAPHY TO "I'LL BE BACK"?

1258
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,322
Just the intro.

1259
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,124
They know all of it?

1260
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,626
Wow. They just know it.

1261
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,628
THEY GET INTO THEIR POSES
AS SOON AS THE SONG STARTS

1262
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,199
THEIR CHEST BOUNCES
ARE ON ANOTHER LEVEL

1263
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,168
MOUTH AGAPE

1264
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,003
SMOOTHLY GETTING READY
TO MOVE THEIR FEET

1265
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,639
GO

1266
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,010
THEIR STEPS ARE SO LIGHT
AND REFRESHING

1267
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,846
-Wow.
-They're so cool!

1268
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,449
-Oh, my gosh.
-Wow.

1269
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,418
THE FINISHING TOUCH

1270
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,521
AS IF THEY REHEARSED THE DANCE
MOVE FOR THE ENDING YESTERDAY

1271
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,491
THIS IS THE REAL "I'LL BE BACK"

1272
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,965
You guys were so cool!

1273
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,267
THE DIRECTORS PUT THEM
IN THEIR PLACE

1274
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,202
-Thank you.
-They're totally different.

1275
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,405
-You know what's so annoying?
-They're so different from us.

1276
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,708
Of course, they are totally different
from you guys.

1277
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:52,976
What we did

1278
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,878
was not "I'll Be Back."

1279
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,947
They didn't even rehearse that.

1280
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,149
-You guys just did it, right?
-Yes.

1281
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,484
You guys are awesome.

1282
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,186
THEIR DANCE LEFT
A LASTING IMPRESSION ON THEM

1283
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,721
-Geez.
-Let's not do it.

1284
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:05,956
We can't do it now.

1285
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,959
I think they invited them to mess with us.

1286
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,994
-Are they teaching us a lesson?
-They'll evaluate--

1287
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,130
How long have you been
in this line of work?

1288
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,099
I have been in this work for 25 years.

1289
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,268
-What about you?
-About 20 years.

1290
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,636
-Twenty years?
-Twenty years?

1291
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,805
People like them

1292
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,208
-do the evaluation.
-They do the end-of-month evaluation.

1293
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,509
You know what?

1294
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,644
Our members probably thought

1295
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,146
the directors were younger
than they looked.

1296
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,214
Yeah.

1297
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,951
-I thought they were our level.
-They probably thought these directors

1298
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,186
were part of a group
and dealt with young artists.

1299
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,188
-That's how they approached them at first.
-Yes.

1300
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,256
-Right?
-They're so good.

1301
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,324
-Were you shocked?
-Yes.

1302
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,493
So we asked these men,
who have 25 years of experience, to dance?

1303
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,895
That's what I'm saying!

1304
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,196
That's exactly what I'm saying!

1305
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:49,233
I had no idea. I couldn't understand
why Woo-young got so worked up.

1306
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,535
Tell us to do something. We'll do it.

1307
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,704
She has 30 years of experience,
and I have 25 years of experience.

1308
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,505
-Just tell us.
-Shall we make you laugh?

1309
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,007
-No, it's okay.
-It's fine.

1310
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,809
SORRY FOR BEING COCKY, SIRS

1311
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,811
-But you were really awesome.
-We have to do something.

1312
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,980
I'm so intimidated now though.
How can I do it?

1313
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,649
-Should we dance in sync?
-Yes, please.

1314
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,251
They were so different from us.

1315
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,086
Their pumping was different.

1316
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,122
Gather to the center.

1317
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,991
-What was the order? Remind me.
-Gather.

1318
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,994
-The chest first. One, two, three, four.
-Three, four.

1319
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,462
Try to use your arms too.

1320
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,431
Three, four. The shuffle.

1321
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,567
Go around and come back.

1322
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,369
The shuffle.

1323
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,471
Go around and come back.

1324
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,672
Sirs.

1325
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,007
He's our leader.

1326
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,275
PLEASE FOCUS ON THE LEADER

1327
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,076
-Okay.
-Don't you have to be

1328
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,845
-stricter on him?
-Yes, we will.

1329
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,913
Yes, please do.

1330
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:36,914
PLEASE DO THAT

1331
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,015
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

1332
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,583
LET'S GO, 5PM

1333
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,151
-We got this.
-5PM!

1334
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,154
Here's the music.

1335
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,191
FINALLY, THE TIME FOR
EVALUATION STARTED

1336
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,259
Focus.

1337
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,564
TIME FOR THEM TO POUR OUT
ALL THEY PRACTICED UNTIL NOW

1338
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,500
STARTING THE PUMPING

1339
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:58,902
OH!

1340
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,238
THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY COMPARE
TO THE DIRECTORS

1341
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,273
BUT THEY DO THEIR BEST
TO PUMP THEIR CHEST

1342
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,643
THEY'LL FACE THE PART
THEY STRUGGLED WITH SOON

1343
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,745
THE CRAZY SHUFFLE DANCE

1344
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,280
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST PAIN
FOR THE MEMBERS

1345
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,582
THE STRUGGLES THEY HAD
TRYING TO TEACH THE TWO WOMEN

1346
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:13,650
HOW TO DO THE SHUFFLE

1347
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,286
THEY ENDED UP WANTING TO DISBAND

1348
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,455
JUST BECAUSE OF
THAT SHUFFLE DANCE

1349
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,191
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO
BLEND IN SMOOTHLY

1350
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,826
IN THE REAL PERFORMANCE?

1351
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,630
THE SHUFFLE DANCE BEGINS

1352
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:34,071
THEIR CHANGE IN FORMATION DURING
THE SHUFFLE DANCE LOOKS OKAY

1353
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,808
THANKFULLY,
THE SHUFFLE DANCE WENT WELL

1354
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,776
THE NEXT HURDLE
THE "YOU PROMISED ME" PART

1355
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,881
THEY WERE ON THE BEAT

1356
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,719
THEY'RE CLEARLY GOOD TEST TAKERS

1357
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,522
THEY DANCE PASSIONATELY
AS IF THEY'LL REALLY DEBUT

1358
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,663
THE EVALUATION PERFORMANCE ENDS

1359
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,099
THEY CLAP FIRST

1360
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,600
-Good job, guys.
-Good job.

1361
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,669
-Good job.
-Good job.

1362
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:06,837
-Good job.
-Good job.

1363
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,739
-All right.
-We did better than before.

1364
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,240
-We did our best.
-We did better.

1365
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,776
I think lingering is part of the dance.

1366
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,378
-Geez.
-Gosh.

1367
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,812
That idiot.

1368
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,015
Unbelievable.

1369
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,484
THE LASTING FEELING
FROM THEIR PERFORMANCE

1370
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,120
THE K-POP ASSOCIATION
SHOULD SUE THEM

1371
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,187
I can see his nipples.

1372
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,422
-Geez.
-Come on.

1373
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,557
My goodness.

1374
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:35,499
AFTER THE PASSIONATE PERFORMANCE
COMES THE COLD EVALUATION

1375
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,834
They're very serious right now.

1376
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,770
I guess it's because
they do it all the time.

1377
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,872
Let me practice while they evaluate us.

1378
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,276
Things like this can deduct your points.

1379
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,878
-Really?
-Yeah.

1380
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,746
-It's already over.
-I see.

1381
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,649
-It's like you regret your performance.
-It's just for show.

1382
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,117
They don't like showy displays.

1383
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,285
It shows one's character.

1384
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,020
Are you done evaluating?

1385
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,889
Yes.

1386
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,624
Really? They are very fast, aren't they?

1387
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,225
THE EVALUATION ENDED
A LOT FASTER THAN EXPECTED

1388
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,595
First of all, I really enjoyed
your cool performance.

1389
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:09,466
You seemed very focused
in that short time to cover a lot.

1390
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,537
What stood out to me
more than the choreography

1391
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,238
-was the composition.
-I see.

1392
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,407
-You came up with it yourselves.
-Yes.

1393
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,976
The composition is part of the movement.

1394
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,112
So you have to memorize it in your head,

1395
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,747
but you did that

1396
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,183
-along with the choreography.
-I told you.

1397
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,652
That's what left a good impression on me.

1398
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:29,786
He did see our movements.

1399
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:34,191
Did you see someone
who was particularly good and bad?

1400
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,159
Yes, I could definitely see it.

1401
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,228
-You definitely saw it?
-Yes.

1402
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,329
I see. Definitely.

1403
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,065
I'm sorry, but I have to be objective
when I evaluate.

1404
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,301
The professionals definitely
have an eye for these things.

1405
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,670
Isn't it hard to tell
when we're all together?

1406
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,005
-I could tell very easily.
-Really?

1407
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,607
We thought we would look pretty decent

1408
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,609
-if we followed the beat.
-Yeah.

1409
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,245
So you're saying that
there is quite a huge gap, right?

1410
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,313
Yes, that's right.

1411
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,814
Yeah, since Woo-young is here.

1412
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,750
Yes, you can't ignore that fact.

1413
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,586
Sook, in your case…

1414
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,421
BREATHING IN

1415
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,058
I've met you when you were active
as a member of Unnies.

1416
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,393
-Yeah? Right?
-Yes.

1417
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,628
I knew you looked familiar.

1418
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,030
-Yes.
-Jin-kyung.

1419
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:15,365
-Yeah, we met.
-I remember him.

1420
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,368
You did so well back then.

1421
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,703
But now, you are…

1422
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:21,838
It was disappointing.

1423
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,473
-He had high expectations.
-Yes.

1424
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,275
-I did have expectations for you.
-He had high expectations.

1425
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,343
It was too high.

1426
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,478
I was surprised back then
because you did so well.

1427
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,013
-I was good back then?
-Yes.

1428
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,516
-You did so well.
-You danced almost every day then.

1429
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,352
-It was slightly disappointing.
-Okay.

1430
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,621
-You only had one hour to prepare.
-Yes.

1431
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,257
-As for you, Jin-kyung…
-Yes.

1432
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,025
-You saw her back then too, right?
-Yes.

1433
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,227
-That's right. We were partners.
-Yes.

1434
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,896
Is she still good?

1435
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,197
That's right.

1436
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,533
-Darn it. It's you.
-That's right.

1437
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,600
Were you my partner?

1438
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,068
-Yes.
-What the heck?

1439
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,136
We were partners.

1440
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,772
Gosh. You aged well.

1441
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,275
Hey, you aged well.

1442
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,544
Oh, my. I almost didn't recognize you.

1443
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,412
-He was the best.
-That's right.

1444
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,813
-Was he?
-Yes.

1445
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,782
-He taught us how to dance.
-Right.

1446
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,484
It has been so long.
Has it been ten years?

1447
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,818
-Yes, almost.
-Yeah, ten years.

1448
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,253
So you're acquainted.

1449
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,989
You look cooler now.

1450
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,959
I bet everything I have
on the fact that she doesn't remember you.

1451
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,027
I think you're right.

1452
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,529
I bet everything I have
on her not remembering him.

1453
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,331
-Bet everything?
-Yes, I will.

1454
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,401
-He looked a bit sharp back then.
-That's right.

1455
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,870
-He was sharp.
-But you gained some weight.

1456
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,638
-I gained a lot of weight.
-Right? You did.

1457
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,575
-That's why we didn't recognize him.
-Your hair was black then, wasn't it?

1458
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,076
-Yes.
-I knew it.

1459
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,645
-We remember everything. We were partners.
-Yes, that's right.

1460
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,113
Most people have black hair.

1461
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,650
-His hair is brown now though.
-It must've been black back then.

1462
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,819
-That's right.
-There aren't any brown heads here.

1463
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,188
-No, blonds were trendy then.
-Yeah.

1464
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,958
-He bet everything.
-So how do you evaluate Jin-kyung?

1465
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,962
I think you have gotten even worse
than back then.

1466
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,700
I SEE IT'S POSSIBLE
TO GET WORSE THAN THEN

1467
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,436
To be honest, I don't remember him.

1468
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,305
-Why not?
-She admitted it just like that.

1469
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,274
I don't think we've met before.

1470
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,642
Nice to meet you.

1471
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,445
-What about Woo-young?
-Right.

1472
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:13,850
As for Woo-young, since it's his own song,

1473
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,887
he would get a ten out of ten
if we were judging by individual talent.

1474
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,823
-But I don't know if I should
-By team.

1475
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,159
-judge him individually or by his team.
-Of course, by his team.

1476
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,329
-Firstly, can you judge him individually?
-Individually?

1477
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,631
-Average it out.
-Then,

1478
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,866
let us know when the scores are ready.

1479
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,434
-They're ready.
-It's done.

1480
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,770
-Thank you so much for your time.
-This was fun.

1481
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,373
-Not at all.
-Thank you for the evaluation.

1482
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,642
Give Directors Choi Him-chan
and Na Tae-hoon a round of applause.

1483
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,210
Thank you.

1484
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,311
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1485
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,146
HOPING FOR A BETTER
PERFORMANCE NEXT TIME

1486
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,814
See you next time.

1487
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,383
-See you.
-Bye.

1488
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,753
THEY CAN'T AVOID
THE RESULT OF THE EVALUATION

1489
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,488
Tell us who's in third place.

1490
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:54,090
-Third place is safest on Screwballs.
-Yeah.

1491
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,425
I'll announce the first place.

1492
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,926
It has to be Woo-young.

1493
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,395
-First place.
-It's Woo-young.

1494
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,531
This person got an average of
9.5 out of 10 points.

1495
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:02,599
Jang Woo-young.

1496
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,567
AVERAGE SCORE OF 9.5 POINTS
JANG WOO-YOUNG 1ST PLACE

1497
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,635
-Who is it?
-Woo-young.

1498
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,703
Woo-young…

1499
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,172
-Of course, he's in first place.
-Of course, he is.

1500
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,776
You know, I think we should eradicate
showing off one's connections

1501
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,778
in the entertainment world.

1502
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:18,048
It isn't fun if you win
because of your connections.

1503
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,016
-What are you on about?
-Congrats, Woo-jae. Second place.

1504
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,721
Connections are most important.

1505
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,456
-You need connections.
-Yeah.

1506
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:27,957
That's the only way you can survive.

1507
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:31,861
You got an average score of eight points.

1508
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,864
How could they tell by looking at him?
That's fascinating.

1509
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,400
All right. There are three people left.

1510
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,070
I'm so nervous.

1511
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,405
ONE OF THEM MUST DO A GUERRILLA
PERFORMANCE ON THE STREET

1512
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,541
-Let me announce Sook's result first.
-Me?

1513
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,011
I'll tell you your average score.

1514
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,381
Your average score is 6.5 points.

1515
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,450
-It's higher than I expected.
-She's in third place.

1516
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,784
-You got 6.5 points.
-It's 6.5?

1517
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,720
Next up is Jin-kyung.

1518
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:57,787
ANNOUNCING THE NEXT PERSON

1519
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,090
Wait, why aren't they announcing Sae-ho's?

1520
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,891
Jin-kyung's average score is…

1521
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,695
five points.

1522
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,163
SOOK BEAT JIN-KYUNG

1523
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,331
You're safe, Sook.

1524
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,966
Am I in third place?

1525
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,901
Let me announce Sae-ho's score.

1526
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,370
ONLY SAE-HO'S SCORE IS LEFT

1527
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,004
Sae-ho's average score is…

1528
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:16,906
SAE-HO AND JIN-KYUNG'S FATE
WILL BE SPLIT SOON

1529
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,509
WHO WILL BE THE DANCE MACHINE
IN FRONT OF JYP'S BUILDING?

1530
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,077
Sae-ho's average score is…

1531
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,346
CURRENTLY, JIN-KYUNG'S
AVERAGE SCORE IS 5

1532
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,514
…6.5 points.

1533
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,517
Oh, it's Jin-kyung.

1534
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,153
AS THEIR SCORES ARE ANNOUNCED

1535
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,756
THEY ALL SCATTER

1536
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,325
JIN-KYUNG'S DAY IS TOO ROUGH

1537
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,526
Let's spin.

1538
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,695
AS LONG AS IT ISN'T US

1539
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,397
I'm so happy.

1540
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,967
I thought I danced pretty well.

1541
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,002
-Didn't I dance well?
-Well…

1542
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,203
What's our team's score?

1543
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,505
Let me announce that.

1544
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,374
Woo-young's fate lies in the team's score.

1545
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:52,942
-The total points.
-Yes?

1546
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,546
The two directors gave them
an average score of 7.1 points.

1547
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,649
-He won't go out, right?
-Woo-young is safe too.

1548
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:00,950
I'm going out by myself?

1549
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,586
ONLY JIN-KYUNG IS CHOSEN
FOR THE PUNISHMENT

1550
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,022
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT US

1551
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,991
We're safe. This is great.

1552
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,393
SIGH…

1553
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,063
What is wrong with my fate?
Why is it always me?

1554
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,665
It isn't fate, it's one's talent.

1555
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,300
The score.

1556
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,536
-What a shame.
-Let me ask you something.

1557
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,037
No.

1558
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,440
Ask us what? What is it?

1559
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,507
WHATEVER IT IS, NO

1560
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:25,942
Let's hear him out first.

1561
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,312
How can you say "no"
without even hearing him out?

1562
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,380
It's a no.

1563
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,848
-It's too cold outside.
-Stop.

1564
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,316
-What is it?
-Woo-jae.

1565
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,384
You need to be kinder.

1566
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,819
KINDNESS AND RUDENESS
CAN NEVER MEET

1567
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,687
-I was just checking.
-Okay.

1568
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,122
-Out of loyalty…
-Yeah.

1569
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:43,026
-…would anyone like to join her?
-If someone would join her?

1570
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,394
Since we're a team,

1571
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,296
-he can ask us.
-Let's close our eyes.

1572
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,198
-Do it for real.
-Okay.

1573
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,700
-Then shall we discuss it among ourselves?
-Yes, let's do that.

1574
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,902
We'll genuinely discuss it, Jin-kyung.

1575
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:53,970
Seriously.

1576
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,038
WE'LL DISCUSS IT

1577
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,773
Doing it alone is too predictable.

1578
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,608
Viewers see that all the time.

1579
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,043
Let's make it a touching one.

1580
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,679
It's the holidays, right?
Let's make it touching.

1581
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,746
SHOUTING IN SILENCE

1582
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,216
-Since we're a team--
-Then, let's do this.

1583
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,584
-We came up with a plan.
-No, wait.

1584
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,620
Only one person can go out?
The competition is high.

1585
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,089
-No, anyone can join her.
-Can we all go out?

1586
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,524
We'll close our eyes then.

1587
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,126
-We'll close our eyes.
-Jin-kyung, close your eyes too.

1588
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,561
-Whoever wants to go out…
-Okay.

1589
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,463
-Please quietly raise your hand.
-Okay.

1590
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:21,831
If you would like to

1591
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,400
join Jin-kyung to promote Screwballs

1592
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,936
and show some loyalty to her

1593
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,771
on this cold day,

1594
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,342
please quietly raise your hand.

1595
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,479
RUSTLING

1596
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:39,983
RUSTLING

1597
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,050
Okay.

1598
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,853
Good. You may lower your hand.

1599
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,755
-It isn't fun if too many go out.
-Gosh.

1600
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,090
I did hear some rustling.

1601
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:50,827
-What was the point of the evaluation?
-I heard rustling.

1602
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,563
Who will Jin-kyung go outside with?

1603
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,031
-Here's the result.
-Okay.

1604
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,401
Honestly, I was kind of touched too.

1605
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,737
-I got emotional.
-You were touched.

1606
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,539
You can go by yourself.

1607
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,808
-Right?
-No one's going out, right?

1608
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,343
-No.
-I thought so.

1609
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,411
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

1610
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,680
-The menu is awesome today.
-The food here is good, right?

1611
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,181
Let's go out this way.

1612
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,616
Today's menu is awesome.

1613
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,052
Let's go eat.

1614
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,153
It's better if we eat now.

1615
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,022
It's cold outside, so wear these gloves.

1616
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,089
WEAR THESE GLOVES

1617
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,059
I'LL GET GOING NOW
SEE YOU LATER, JIN-KYUNG

1618
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,727
He says the cafeteria food is good.

1619
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,729
SHE GAVE UP

1620
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,398
I'm sick and tired of them.

1621
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,700
Where should I go?

1622
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,302
COMING BACK?

1623
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,537
-The members wanted to ask something.
-Yes?

1624
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,574
DID THEY FEEL BAD FOR HER?

1625
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,975
Can we take off our mics?

1626
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,445
-Are you serious right now?
-What?

1627
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,480
I KNEW IT

1628
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,217
ONE HOUR LATER

1629
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,886
He never has an appetite.

1630
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,521
Sook, can you get us some water?

1631
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,423
Sook, can you get us some water?

1632
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:55,892
SNORTS

1633
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,027
-Sook, can you get some more geotjeori?
-Yeah.

1634
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,230
Woo-young,

1635
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,765
they keep ordering me around.

1636
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,468
Guys, come on.

1637
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,571
Sook is such a nice girl, you know.

1638
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,373
TOUCHED

1639
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,008
-Then--
-Why are you still here?

1640
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,679
