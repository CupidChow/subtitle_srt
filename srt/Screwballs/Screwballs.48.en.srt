1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:06,806
THAT TIME OF YEAR WHEN IT'S
DANGEROUS TO LEAVE YOUR BLANKET

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,642
WINTER

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,782
YOU'RE FROZEN STIFF FROM THE COLD,
LET THIS TIME BE LIKE A WARM HEATER

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,885
KOREA'S NUMBER 1

5
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,589
PREMIUM WINTER CAMPING

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,995
THE MASTER OF CAMPING
PREPARES FOR HER GUESTS

7
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:34,434
THE MAGICIAN IS WORKING HARD

8
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,469
-Wow!
-Welcome.

9
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,372
-What is this place?
-Welcome.

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,608
-Have a seat.
-You created an omakase out here?

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,476
-Yes, have a seat.
-Wow.

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,046
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,682
THE WARMTH
FROM THE WOOD BURNING STOVE

14
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,785
THE UPGRADED

15
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,888
DREAM HIDEOUT

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
READY FOR LARGE GROUPS

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,993
<i>I switched up the setup this year.</i>

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,429
WELCOME TO SOOKMAKASE

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,164
-Come on in.
-This is insane.

20
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,800
You must all be hungry.

21
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,834
Yes.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,768
No.

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,638
LOST HIS APPETITE
AFTER GETTING SNOWED ON

24
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,973
-Woo-young's here.
-Pardon me.

25
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,109
WOO-YOUNG APPEARS AFTER 3 WEEKS!

26
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,244
-Sit in the middle.
-No, you.

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,415
He got sick on his way back
from finishing his tour overseas, right?

28
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,851
-He has been vomiting a lot.
-I see.

29
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,886
So he has to drop by a clinic.

30
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,421
-Woo-young's here.
-Pardon me.

31
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,124
SICK WOO-YOUNG HAS RECOVERED
AND COME BACK

32
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,392
-Sit in the middle.
-No, you.

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,593
-Sit in the middle.
-No.

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,761
-No, you should.
-Stop it.

35
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,596
She wants to sit next to the stove.

36
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,565
-Really, Jin-kyung?
-Yes.

37
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,366
-Hang on.
-You're way ahead of me.

38
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,669
-By the stove?
-She really is on another level.

39
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,770
What is this place, Sook?

40
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,405
-What?
-It's so nice!

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,339
No, it isn't.

42
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,440
-Is this your tent?
-It's your personal space?

43
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,441
Yes, yes.

44
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,410
-This place is like a restaurant.
-Sook.

45
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,146
-You should just open a restaurant.
-You need to invite me.

46
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,547
That's why you're here today.

47
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,849
THE GUESTS ARE ENTHUSIASTIC

48
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,685
-This is awesome.
-I'll be going for

49
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,286
-an omakase style today.
-Awesome.

50
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,456
Hang on. Tell me
who you guys are dressed up as.

51
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,826
I'm Reporter Joo Dae-gi
who is out in Gapyeong.

52
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:11,097
It's snowing so much that you can't
see anything in Gapyeong right now.

53
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,098
JOO DAE-GI

54
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,867
-The reporter from back in the day.
-Yes.

55
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,135
I'm Reporter Joo Dae-gi.

56
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,970
-How nostalgic.
-I haven't seen snow spray in ages.

57
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,104
PREPARED LOTS TODAY

58
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,206
The characteristic of
Reporter Joo Dae-gi is

59
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,975
that when he is first on air

60
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,943
he says, "I'm Reporter Joo Dae-gi."

61
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,546
But around the fourth time, he says,

62
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,947
"I'm Reporter Joo Dae-gi."

63
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:28,915
Because he's exhausted.

64
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,718
It's snowing so much that
you can't see anything in Gapyeong.

65
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,787
-Back then--
-Do you know what the best comment was?

66
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,756
-What is it?
-"It's obviously snowing."

67
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,092
"Why does the anchorman keep asking?"

68
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,762
There's a video clip of that on YouTube.

69
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,964
Who are you supposed to be, Sook?

70
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,067
I'm supposed to be the old man Scrooge.

71
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,202
NOT A MAGICIAN

72
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,737
-Cheapskate.
-But…

73
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,339
-after he came to his senses.
-I see.

74
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,241
So Scrooge after he turned things around.

75
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,278
Wait, who are you supposed to be,
Woo-young?

76
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,847
-I'm from<i> Home Alone</i>.
-I guessed it as soon as I saw him.

77
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,582
-From <i>Home Alone</i>.
-Oh, <i>Home Alone?</i>

78
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,716
Sae-ho and I are the robbers.

79
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,653
-I am--
-But they're from different storylines.

80
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,722
Jin-kyung and I are the robber duo.

81
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,790
You look like that actor.

82
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,026
That's why our goal for today is

83
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,061
to steal the hearts of our viewers.

84
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,262
That's what we're going for.

85
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,364
How lame.

86
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,799
WE WANT TO STEAL
THE HEARTS OF OUR VIEWERS

87
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,636
This is quite meaningful, you know.

88
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,738
We worked so hard

89
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,674
with the support from so many people.

90
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,642
<i>We get to wrap up the end of year</i>

91
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,644
<i>-together at Sook's place.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

92
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,113
This place is so nice. It is much better

93
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,982
-than I expected.
-For real.

94
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,152
Gosh. I went out of my way
to decorate this place

95
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,386
since you guys were coming.

96
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,323
Then, is it Sook's
<i>Deconstruction Show </i>today?

97
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,925
-That's right.
-Oh, I see.

98
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,194
-My <i>Deconstruction Show?</i>
-Sook's <i>Deconstruction Show.</i>

99
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,696
-Really?
-I see.

100
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,099
The four of us had ours.
Only Sook was left.

101
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,803
<i>She's intimidating on the outside,</i>
<i>but she makes us cry with her kind words.</i>

102
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,606
<i>Always in-demand on variety shows.</i>
<i>The trusted variety show master.</i>

103
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,608
<i>The emotional anchor of Screwballs.</i>

104
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,043
<i>This is Sook's Deconstruction Show.</i>

105
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,213
IS IT FINALLY MY TURN?

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,982
THE OWNER OF THIS PLACE

107
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,550
KIM SOOK'S CHARM WILL BE
DISPLAYED TO THE FULLEST

108
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,885
DECONSTRUCTION SHOW
WITH SOOKMAKASE

109
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,954
Today's menu will be simple.

110
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,525
Only 100 bottles of this olive oil
are sold in Italy.

111
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,495
I'm going to prepare a simple salad.

112
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,896
Where's the proof of that?

113
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,031
It's just marketing.

114
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,733
There's always someone like that. Geez.

115
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,867
Should I beat that jerk up?

116
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,102
Yeah, he needs a beating.

117
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,906
ANYWAY, LET'S EXPERIENCE
THE ELDEST MEMBER'S UNIQUE CHARM TODAY

118
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:39,379
WHILE SOOKMAKASE'S
GOURMET SALAD IS BEING MADE

119
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,147
It's so good.

120
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,217
I shouldn't eat it, should I?

121
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,852
-Of course not.
-You need to be careful.

122
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,420
-He was told to fast.
-Really?

123
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,821
-Fast completely?
-Yes.

124
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,190
Poor thing.

125
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,159
You look gaunt.

126
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,561
His face was already small
but it got smaller.

127
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,363
Do you feel okay though, Woo-young?

128
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,931
Gosh, I feel so bad.

129
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,667
-No, it's okay.
-Tell us what happened.

130
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:01,868
Yes, tell us.

131
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,138
THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOOT,
HE WRAPPED UP HIS SOLO CONCERT IN TOKYO

132
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,739
You see, this is what happened.

133
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,608
I ate at the airport.

134
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,312
The gate was very far,
but I didn't realize that.

135
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,214
-They started announcing my name.
-They were looking for you?

136
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,115
Oh, no.

137
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,850
-I rushed to the gate.
-How nerve-racking.

138
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,653
I had the filming of <i>Screwballs</i> too,

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,756
so I guess I was
feeling nervous about that.

140
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,391
I have to get there as soon as I land.

141
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,327
-I was determined to get there.
-Sure.

142
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,196
So I ran to the gate and got there okay.

143
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,230
But when I boarded,

144
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,766
I felt something
when I tried to get some sleep.

145
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,168
I had sudden indigestion.

146
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,236
I got indigestion at that moment.

147
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,971
You were too worried about that.

148
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,740
You shouldn't feel cold.

149
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,375
-Hold on to this.
-Jin-kyung.

150
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,443
No, I have one.

151
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,713
I realized how precious you are
when you weren't here, Woo-young.

152
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,314
I realized how precious a husband is…

153
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,484
-It made me realize I need a husband.
-Okay.

154
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,485
HE PASSED OUT AFTER VOMITING

155
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,887
WOO-JAE: HOW UNPROFESSIONAL
SOOK: LET'S SAY HE PASSED OUT

156
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,222
THE REALITY OF THEIR CHAT ROOM

157
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,594
My goodness. How could this be?
You guys must have felt my absence.

158
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,696
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Why is your answer like that?

159
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,064
So Woo-young was absent

160
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,533
-for two episodes on Netflix, right?
-That's right.

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,601
No payment either?

162
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,770
-That'll be divided among you four.
-Really?

163
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,572
-Really?
-Woo-hoo!

164
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,007
-That's not right.
-Why are you so happy about that?

165
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,843
-How could you?
-Gosh.

166
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,611
-I'm so thankful.
-I thought it was real.

167
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,446
You look so alive all of a sudden.

168
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,814
Jin-kyung must have thought

169
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,183
-it was real.
-I've never heard you laugh so heartily.

170
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,919
It's so meaningful that
the five of us are here together.

171
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,821
Sae-ho.

172
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,890
Are you drunk? What got into you?

173
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,725
Isn't it true though?

174
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,560
-Well, you see--
-I think I get a bit sentimental

175
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,996
-in the winter.
-Sae-ho is feeling

176
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,031
-a bit emotional.
-Look at this.

177
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,600
SENTIMENTAL SAE-HO

178
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,901
-A bit emotional.
-Look at this.

179
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,069
-What's that?
-Wow!

180
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,871
I caught this cuttlefish myself.

181
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,305
You caught it yourself?

182
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,574
Wow. Is it going in the fish cake soup?

183
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,877
You prepared so much, Sook.

184
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,980
-When did you prepare all this?
-Can't I eat?

185
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,982
-No, you can't.
-Come on.

186
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,950
He keeps wanting to eat when he shouldn't.

187
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,085
He has to fast.

188
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,987
I'll let this cook

189
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,122
to make it delicious for you.

190
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,157
SOOKMAKASE IS ON A ROLL

191
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,591
I can have diarrhea.

192
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,926
What kind of salad is that?

193
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,463
This is made with seasonal fruit.

194
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,332
-Everything is organic in this.
-Sook.

195
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,301
-They're all organic.
-Blueberries.

196
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,069
Yes, blueberries, apples…

197
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,439
-Tomatoes are vegetables.
-…toma--

198
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,473
It isn't a fruit.

199
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,476
Beat him up?

200
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,712
-Should I beat him up?
-Don't be like this on such a happy day.

201
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,382
This is your <i>Deconstruction Show,</i>
but all you're doing is cook, Sook.

202
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,118
This isn't a <i>Deconstruction Show.</i>
It's a slave show.

203
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,820
Can you roast some sweet potatoes?

204
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,789
DESPITE WHAT SHE SAYS

205
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:41,360
HER HANDS KEEP MOVING
FOR THE YOUNGER MEMBERS

206
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,899
SPRINKLING BASIL AND NUTS
AS A FINISHING TOUCH

207
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,067
What is this, Sook?

208
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,502
SOOKMAKASE'S 1ST COURSE
ORGANIC SALAD

209
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,871
-Let's see.
-I prepared a basic salad.

210
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,506
It's such a shame Woo-young can't eat.

211
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,841
-Come on.
-Thank you.

212
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,808
No chopsticks for you.

213
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,410
Why not? Come on.

214
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,146
-You shouldn't eat.
-Come on, Woo-jae.

215
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,981
-Come on.
-They said you shouldn't eat.

216
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,216
Come on.

217
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,751
-Can I take a look?
-Hope you like it.

218
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,353
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

219
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,823
TAKING A PICTURE
BEFORE EATING IS A MUST

220
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,826
SO APPETIZING

221
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,062
Gosh, Sook.

222
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,530
Thanks for everything.

223
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:18,931
Thank you.

224
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,066
TAKING A BIG BITE

225
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,167
What the heck?

226
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,369
THE LIGHT EATER TAKES A BITE TOO

227
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,904
-Is it good?
-What is this?

228
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,739
What? Is it basil?

229
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,475
Sook, this is really good.

230
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,011
If you consider the ingredients,

231
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,247
I should charge you 30,000 won per bowl.

232
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,148
A 30,000 WON PER BOWL SALAD

233
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,350
You're ripping us off.

234
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,851
-What?
-30,000 won?

235
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,253
Considering the ingredients.

236
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,389
-What is this that's like herbal medicine?
-Is it nuts?

237
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,157
Yes, those are nuts.

238
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,792
The nuts smell so good.

239
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,227
What makes this salad

240
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,463
<i>-is the olive oil and nuts.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

241
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,600
<i>It isn't just a regular salad.</i>
<i>It tastes like a gourmet salad.</i>

242
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,302
<i>I gave it some texture.</i>

243
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,238
Tomatoes and the others
have a softer texture,

244
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,806
but the nuts make it fun to chew.

245
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,341
SNIFFING

246
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,509
Wouldn't fruit be okay?

247
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,279
Hey.

248
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,748
All of these things are acidic.

249
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,218
-They're bad for your upset stomach.
-Don't eat it.

250
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,486
JIN-KYUNG STOPS HIM TOO

251
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,620
MMM

252
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,123
HE TRIES TO ACT LIKE HE'S EATING

253
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,724
WHEN YOU'RE FASTING:
WHAT OTHERS EAT LOOK MORE DELICIOUS

254
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,495
Did the doctor really tell you to fast?

255
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,930
He told you not to eat anything at all?

256
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,698
YES…

257
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,136
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

258
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,671
I thought you might get tired…

259
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,705
This is insane.

260
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,273
I'll get diarrhea later.

261
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,275
-In-seok.
-How is this dressing so good?

262
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,377
Woo-young…

263
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,112
can we film you
if you have diarrhea today?

264
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,113
Darn.

265
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,649
What does he mean?

266
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,353
EVEN THE PATIENT WITH ENTERITIS
FELL FOR THE MESMERIZING SALAD

267
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:52,058
You know the omakase that costs
about 300,000 won per person?

268
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,060
This is like an appetizer
from a place like that.

269
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,828
These nuts are so delicious.

270
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,263
Is it good? Do you want some more?

271
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,965
It tastes so fancy.

272
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,367
HE'S ABOUT TO FANCILY
GO TO THE BATHROOM

273
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,174
-He ate all of it.
-He lost his mind.

274
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,342
He must have lost his mind.

275
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,977
-He ate all of it.
-No.

276
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,779
-Why did you do that?
-Promise us, Woo-young.

277
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,081
We get to shoot you having diarrhea.

278
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,282
Here are my conditions.

279
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,384
-I want Jin-kyung to film it.
-Okay.

280
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,754
-Jin-kyung is…
-I can film Woo-young's butt.

281
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,290
-His skin was so milky white.
-Jeez, you're awful.

282
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,993
Jin-kyung is a bathroom expert.

283
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,261
-This is so good.
-Can I

284
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,529
have some more nuts?

285
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,131
I'll have more of this.

286
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,299
-More apples please.
-Apples.

287
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,400
EVEN THE LIGHT EATER WANTS MORE

288
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,369
ME TOO, SOOK

289
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,571
-What about you? You shouldn't be eating!
-Don't eat.

290
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,339
-Just film me having diarrhea.
-What do you…

291
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,208
That would be better.

292
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,577
-What do you want? Persimmons?
-Persimmons.

293
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,312
-Persimmons.
-I need more persistence.

294
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,180
-Here's some more.
-You need that.

295
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,049
-You need persistence, Woo-young.
-Yes.

296
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,853
Producer Park, is it okay
that we just sit here and eat?

297
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,423
It's Sook's <i>Deconstruction Show.</i>
Shouldn't we do something about her?

298
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,458
She was deconstructed that day.

299
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,526
Large shoulders…

300
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,594
My chest gets small.

301
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,962
…medium chest,

302
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,031
and a extra-large waist.

303
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,767
That was so annoyingly funny though.

304
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,002
She tried not to laugh too.

305
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,637
Don't edit that out.

306
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,239
Yeah, don't edit it.

307
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,273
-It's funny.
-Really?

308
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,274
I'm proud of myself.

309
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,942
You have to use it. It's funny.

310
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,377
The gourd bottle is so funny.

311
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,614
I thought having a body
like a gourd bottle was a good thing.

312
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,982
But that wasn't the case.

313
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,952
Anyway, it is written here
that the star for today

314
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,654
is made for winter.

315
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,789
Do you like winter?

316
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,325
-Winter is camping season, right?
-It's her favorite.

317
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,393
It is my favorite season.

318
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,961
-Then, it's a good match.
-Yes.

319
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,863
We informed you that
the dress code was winter.

320
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,634
Do you have any fond memories of winter?

321
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,602
When I think of winter,

322
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,906
all I can think of is
that it's the end of a year.

323
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,342
When I think of winter,
it makes me anticipate another spring.

324
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,477
Why are you laughing?

325
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,945
-Sorry. Let's try again.
-What?

326
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,281
-Was that too sentimental?
-Did you experience

327
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,516
a shift in your mood on your way here?

328
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,617
No, I didn't.

329
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,621
-It's meaningful that we're all here.
-Are you drunk? What got into you?

330
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:06,392
Woo-young, me, and Sook
have that in common.

331
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,961
We are from the southern part
of Gyeongsang-do.

332
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,529
-We're from Gyeongsangnam-do.
-Yes.

333
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,664
It doesn't snow there.

334
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,798
THERE ISN'T MUCH SNOW
IN GYEONGSANG-DO

335
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,367
-It doesn't snow.
-When it snows down there,

336
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,869
we go outside no matter what.

337
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,472
-We all felt that way.
-Because we never get to see it.

338
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,673
So when it snows,

339
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,408
even if it's just a flutter,

340
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,910
we gather that small amount
to play with it.

341
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,746
It even gets mixed with dirt.

342
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,114
-Yeah.
-So

343
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,317
-the snowmen were usually brown.
-That's right.

344
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,520
When I was young,
I used to hear "<i>Chapssaltteok</i>"

345
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,822
-when it snowed.
-Me too.

346
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,858
-I heard that when I was young too.
-I heard that.

347
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,793
-I remember.
-"Buckwheat jelly."

348
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,361
But it was very early in the morning.

349
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,164
The floor was <i>ondol,</i>

350
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,900
so it would get stuck
and turn black from being burned.

351
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,670
The whole family would
cram under the blanket.

352
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,938
It wasn't just one room,

353
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,274
but we gathered in one room to watch TV.

354
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,443
We'd eat tangerines there too.

355
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,146
Also, there was a drama
called <i>The House with a Deep Yard.</i>

356
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,849
My whole family loved
watching that drama together.

357
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,485
We had such a good time back then.

358
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,754
-That sounds so nice.
-Mom, Dad, my younger sibling and I

359
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,623
just shared that one blanket.

360
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,492
-When you think about those days…
-Everyone has memories like that.

361
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,861
This is Sook's strength.

362
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,497
If she didn't provide a place like this,

363
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,566
we wouldn't be sharing
sentimental stories like this.

364
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,901
I feel so at ease here.

365
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,136
-This is such an awesome space.
-It's cozy.

366
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,739
You are so charming, Sook.

367
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,507
-You're so nice.
-It feels so warm.

368
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,342
You're so lovely. I love you.

369
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,413
What the heck are you guys talking about?

370
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,615
Thank you so much, Sook.

371
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,551
It's kind of cold…

372
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,988
WHILE THE OTHERS
WERE BUSY TALKING

373
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:49,395
SHE SLICES
THE WELL-COOKED CUTTLEFISH

374
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,367
AND DROPS THEM
IN THE FISH CAKE SOUP

375
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,707
THE BEST MENU
FOR THE COLD WINTER

376
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,545
HOW CAN IT NOT BE GOOD?

377
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,782
I'll just have explosive diarrhea today.

378
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,852
Such a nice atmosphere.

379
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,787
-This is awesome.
-Today is going to be…

380
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,655
Can I poop before we start?

381
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,790
What's wrong with you?

382
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,024
I might have to poop.

383
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,059
WOO-YOUNG
ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT POOPING

384
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,727
I have to poop right now.

385
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,398
I'm going to clog
all the toilets in Gapyeong today.

386
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,600
HE ISN'T JOKING TODAY

387
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,835
I'm sorry, people of Gapyeong!

388
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,737
-I'm sorry, people of Gapyeong.
-Go for it, man!

389
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,040
PUBLIC SAFETY MESSAGE,
BEWARE OF NOISE AND TURBULENCE

390
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,109
Can I try those sweet potatoes first?

391
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,044
They aren't done yet.

392
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,179
How about half-dried saury?

393
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,780
-Do you want those first?
-Yes.

394
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,350
Okay. I'll serve you
the half-dried saury first.

395
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,852
-Can you eat half-dried saury?
-No.

396
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,187
I can't eat it and I won't.

397
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,088
Really?

398
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,823
Who can't eat half-dried saury?

399
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,625
-I like it.
-I love it.

400
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,026
Why don't you eat it?

401
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,628
It looks fishy.

402
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,196
There are some that aren't fishy.

403
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,031
Typically, they're fishy.

404
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,165
HMPH!

405
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,767
When people say that,
it means they're fishy.

406
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,603
I got these half-dried sauries
from a very popular place.

407
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,804
Give them a try.

408
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:06,906
SOOKMAKASE'S 2ND COURSE
HALF DRIED SAURY

409
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,841
Think of it as eating sashimi.

410
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,376
Have some.

411
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,077
Here.

412
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,379
Try some, Woo-jae.

413
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,315
-Just give it a try, Woo-jae.
-No, thanks.

414
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,083
Let me tell you how to eat it.

415
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,084
Tell us.

416
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,953
People don't know how to eat it.

417
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,890
Many people don't know how to eat it
if it is their first time.

418
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,825
Man, those sauries look amazing.

419
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,260
THE PATIENT CAN DO
NOTHING BUT SALIVATE

420
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,662
This isn't fishy.

421
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,831
-Grab a spring cabbage or Napa cabbage.
-Okay.

422
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,600
-Next…
-Try it.

423
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,501
…place a perilla leaf.

424
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,435
-Perilla leaf?
-Okay.

425
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,536
Place a perilla leaf too?

426
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,704
Try it, Woo-jae.

427
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,007
-Spring cabbage and--
-If it's fishy, hit me.

428
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,409
-Place a cabbage.
-Yes.

429
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,144
-Then, put a perilla leaf on top.
-Yes.

430
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,946
-Place a sheet of laver too.
-Sheet of laver.

431
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,314
That sounds weird.

432
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,648
How come?

433
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,883
SO GOOD!

434
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
Dip that completely in the <i>chogochujang</i>.

435
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:54,987
Front and back.

436
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,056
-Dip it front and back.
-Done.

437
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,757
Okay. Place it on top

438
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,526
-and add a pickled garlic stem.
-Okay.

439
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,760
I don't eat garlic stems.

440
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,195
Should I add garlic?

441
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,163
Do you like garlic?

442
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,164
WOO-JAE WILL ADD GARLIC INSTEAD

443
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,266
This is my first half-dried saury.

444
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,367
Cheers.

445
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,302
-I'm eating it with Sae-ho.
-Okay.

446
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,270
WOO-JAE'S FIRST EVER
HALF-DRIED SAURY

447
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,571
Give it a try.

448
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,772
If it's fishy, hit me.

449
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,676
Gosh, half-dried saury is a bit risky.

450
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,078
EVEN THE PATIENT
STARTS USING HIS CHOPSTICKS

451
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,145
You're going to eat?

452
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,581
-Taste the saury's…
-The half-dried saury smells amazing.

453
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,850
…buttery flavor and chewiness.

454
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,919
Is this going to be okay?

455
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,787
Woo-young, are you going to be okay?

456
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,722
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO BE OKAY?

457
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,124
Man, are you going to be okay?

458
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,126
What are you going to do?

459
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,127
Chew carefully.

460
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,462
Yeah, he should chew carefully.

461
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,030
Don't shove it all in at once.

462
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:38,998
How is it, Woo-jae?

463
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,099
STILL CHEWING

464
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,967
-Cut it in half.
-My work is done if I can feed him this.

465
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,470
HOW IS IT?

466
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,805
Well, I guess I can eat it.

467
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,007
-But…
-Yes?

468
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,744
But it doesn't taste amazing or anything.

469
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,745
You see,

470
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,448
everybody has different preferences,
so it makes sense.

471
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,450
Gosh, I did it.

472
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,152
It's done.

473
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,920
-It's so chewy and delicious.
-It's so good.

474
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,623
Sook, I don't know
if I can say this right now,

475
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,358
but I have to hit you.

476
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,259
-Who?
-You.

477
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,160
Was it fishy?

478
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,094
YES

479
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,463
-It's fishy.
-Stop messing around.

480
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,631
No way.

481
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,233
I've never been wrong

482
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,335
-nor has anyone hit me.
-Gosh, this is good.

483
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,938
But it was less fishy than I had expected.

484
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,540
I'll give you some fish cake instead.

485
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,443
SOOKMAKASE'S 3RD COURSE
FISH CAKE SOUP, FEATURING GIANT WHELK

486
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,678
-Can I get some too?
-Of course, you can.

487
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,746
There's whelk

488
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,681
in my fish cake soup.

489
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,151
SOOK'S FISH CAKE SOUP
EVEN HAS GIANT WHELK

490
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,219
This is insane.

491
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:39,324
This place rivals most <i>omakase</i> spots.

492
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,627
And, to be honest, you can't get

493
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,595
-cuttlefish anywhere.
-This is insane!

494
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,964
-That's the one you caught?
-Yes, I caught it.

495
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,766
-You caught it with your bare fist?
-Yes.

496
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,834
Gosh.

497
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,602
Give it a try.

498
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,337
WOW

499
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,972
Wow. What is this?

500
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,374
THIS LOOKS SO DELICIOUS

501
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,376
Try the cuttlefish.

502
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,179
It tastes completely different
from what you buy at the store.

503
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,414
-Here you go, Sae-ho.
-Yes.

504
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,415
Thank you.

505
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,416
DIPS IN CHOJANG
BEFORE DEVOURING IT

506
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,451
This is incredible.

507
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,086
Wow! The cuttlefish!

508
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,220
Isn't it amazing?

509
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,588
What the heck?

510
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,624
Let me brag about this.
I caught it in Jeju Island.

511
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,960
You can't eat this
with the money you make.

512
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,763
Are you looking down on us?

513
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,264
-What?
-I feel looked down on.

514
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,632
-With what we make?
-You see,

515
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,567
look.

516
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,136
You have to take a boat to Jeju Island.

517
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,271
I've never been looked down on like this.

518
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,407
-We can't eat this with the money we make?
-No.

519
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:33,812
SAE-HO IS OBSESSED
WITH THE CUTTLEFISH

520
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,747
Gosh. The cuttlefish is so good.

521
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,685
REALLY?

522
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,686
WOW

523
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,656
-Wow!
-What the heck?

524
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,226
-Is it good?
-It's so good!

525
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,162
-Is the whelk good?
-What is this?

526
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,497
What is this, Sook?

527
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,665
I'll add some more whelk.

528
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,567
Adding some more whelk.

529
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,536
I'm going to eat everything and get sick.

530
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,339
AND SO, THE LIGHT EATER WOO-JAE

531
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,776
OVEREATS UNLIKE HIS USUAL SELF

532
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:07,846
Look at this, Sook.

533
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,481
What's going on?

534
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,884
The broth is so refreshing.

535
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,352
-Do you want some more?
-Yes.

536
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,653
Can I have one more fish cake?

537
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,788
-What got into you?
-I want more broth.

538
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,924
I'm going to devour everything here.

539
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,226
Yeah, let's eat ourselves to death.

540
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,294
Let's do it.

541
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,062
Listen, guys.

542
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,232
This is only the appetizer.
You can't be like this already.

543
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,735
-Can you give me some more broth?
-Guys,

544
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,270
listen.

545
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,274
WOO-YOUNG WHO WAS
WATCHING THE OTHERS

546
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,343
Then… What's this?

547
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,645
-Some more.
-More fish cake?

548
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,913
-Yes, more fish cake.
-Okay.

549
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,248
GIGGLING

550
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,483
Are you going to be okay?

551
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,519
Can you place something down here?

552
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,022
-Should we get you a diaper?
-Yes.

553
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,058
THE STOMACH-ACHE GUY
NEEDS A PEE PAD

554
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,327
What kind of alcohol do you have, Sook?

555
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,228
Alcohol?

556
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,829
This is perfect for soju.

557
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,064
Today, I will

558
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,066
make you Bokbunja cocktails.

559
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,769
SOOKMAKASE'S 4TH COURSE
BOKBUNJA COCKTAIL

560
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,039
-Okay, let's have a small glass of that.
-Okay.

561
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,107
It'll be like a cocktail.

562
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,244
KIM SOOK POCHA IS OPEN

563
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,545
It's a cocktail.

564
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,316
WHAT WILL THE PERFECT CHEF SOOK'S
BOKBUNJA COCKTAIL BE LIKE?

565
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,850
What is this? Why is there so much?

566
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,620
Half of it is already filled with soda.

567
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,288
Just wait.

568
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,590
FEELING NERVOUS

569
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,291
Don't worry.

570
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,926
STOP COMPLAINING AND JUST WAIT

571
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,062
DRIP

572
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,496
I poured too much in this one.

573
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,298
Quite a lot got poured.

574
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,133
Sae-ho should drink the yellow one.

575
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,035
It has a lot of soju.

576
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,975
Is there a soju glass anywhere?

577
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,109
BELATEDLY TRIES
TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT

578
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,410
-Just pour it in.
-Just do it.

579
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,646
DON'T THINK, JUST GO

580
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,082
Wow. What is this?

581
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,717
LOOKING COOL

582
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,185
I may die if I drink that.

583
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,920
LAUGHING

584
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,421
-I may die.
-What is that?

585
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,190
FEELING GUILTY

586
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
Just try it.

587
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,860
-I'll try it first and let you know.
-Yes.

588
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,128
You seem to be afraid.

589
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,664
Try it with the half-dried saury first.

590
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,466
Why are you scared before you even try it?

591
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,101
She wants to end the shoot today.

592
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,570
There were a lot of beds in there.

593
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,539
SOOK'S HAPHAZARD
BOKBUNJA COCKTAIL IS READY

594
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,842
It's the perfect ratio.

595
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,377
-For Sae-ho.
-The yellow one is his.

596
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,113
-Thank you.
-Sure.

597
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,515
This one only has a little.

598
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,183
Hey, it smells good at least.

599
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,785
It smells like grape juice.

600
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,920
Just drink it like wine.

601
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,622
-Let's make a toast.
-Okay.

602
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,758
-Let's make a toast.
-For…

603
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,761
-For our 2026.
-For our 2026.

604
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,963
Give a speech, Sook.

605
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,531
Please give a speech.

606
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,035
Thank you for visiting
my camping site this year.

607
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,336
I hope

608
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,005
everything you want to
do this year works out.

609
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,407
And don't you get sick.

610
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,343
-All right.
-Okay.

611
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,178
-Here's to <i>Screwballs</i>.
-Here's to <i>Screwballs</i>.

612
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,246
Thank you!

613
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,781
WE'LL BRING BIG LAUGHS
TO OUR AUDIENCE IN 2026

614
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,017
THE PATIENT
WILL NOT DRINK ANY THOUGH

615
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,355
-My goodness! It's so good.
-Gosh.

616
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,424
LET ME TRY TOO

617
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,225
-It's good.
-It's so good.

618
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,362
It's so good.

619
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,731
IT'S BITTER FOR
THE LIGHTWEIGHT WOO-JAE

620
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,534
-The slight carbonation goes well…
-Isn't it good?

621
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,568
…with the alcohol.

622
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,603
It tastes like a fancy rose Champagne.

623
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,805
It's so good.

624
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,573
It is so delicious.

625
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,642
-Sook.
-You're going to be hammered.

626
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,310
The ratio of the soda, soju,

627
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,913
<i>-</i>and Bokbunja is perfect.
-You're going to get hammered.

628
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,047
This place is crazy.

629
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,850
This is so good.
Let me take a picture of it.

630
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,919
Show me the soda, soju, and Bokbunja.

631
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,189
THE PERFECT COMBINATION!

632
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,226
We'll get hammered
if we keep sipping it like this.

633
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,294
Just drink a little.

634
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,762
I might drool while I sleep.

635
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,164
What's next, Sook?

636
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,334
-Next up is…
-She's steaming something.

637
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,470
A WOODEN BOX APPEARS
AT THAT MOMENT

638
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,538
Hey. What is that?

639
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,707
-What is that?
-Lotus leaf rice.

640
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,310
Isn't that lotus leaf rice?

641
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,380
LOTUS LEAF RICE
INFUSED WITH THE AROMA OF CYPRESS

642
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,149
-Did you prepare all of these ingredients?
-Yes, I did.

643
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,617
Who else would prepare it?

644
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,185
You came here to do all this?

645
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:10,555
I came here two days ago to set things up.

646
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,790
You did too much.

647
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,592
-I know.
-It's nothing.

648
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,595
My friends are coming over.
It's only once a year.

649
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,330
But I hope you don't come next year.

650
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,165
BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

651
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,466
JUST KIDDING

652
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,269
-I think she means it.
-I can't guarantee that I won't come.

653
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,606
THE LOTUS LEAF RICE
WILL BE OPENED MOMENTARILY

654
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,875
When do we get to eat the root crops?

655
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,711
Okay. Some of the root crops
are done cooking now.

656
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,747
THE SWEET POTATOES AND POTATOES
ARE ALMOST DONE ROASTING

657
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,048
All I need is salt.

658
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,984
No, not that.

659
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,721
I brought some <i>dongchimi</i> that I made
with the water from Seoraksan Mountain.

660
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,423
THE DONGCHIMI THAT WILL BE PAIRED
WITH THE ROOT CROPS

661
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,057
That's awesome.

662
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,260
But it isn't funny for a variety show.

663
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,661
-What?
-Water from Seoraksan?

664
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,864
Just let it slide.

665
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,667
I made it with
the spring water from a famous mountain.

666
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,603
-Have it with the broth.
-You made this?

667
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,705
HOW COULD I MAKE THAT?

668
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,174
How could I make that?

669
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,443
Yes, I made all of that.

670
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,878
You don't just chop people,
you chop kimchi too.

671
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,280
LAUGHING

672
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,781
I make all of it.

673
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,183
FIBS AND JOKES
FILL THE FUN SOOK CAMP SITE

674
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,718
-When you taste this…
-Wow.

675
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,821
WOW

676
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,389
-Korean radish.
-Man.

677
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,290
Korean radish itself.

678
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,025
That is radical.

679
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,062
Look at that Korean radish.

680
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,664
It's better thinly sliced.

681
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,966
It looks crunchy.

682
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,702
This tastes amazing with root crops.

683
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,838
-Do they pair well?
-Yes.

684
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,073
Gosh, look at this.

685
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,875
Oh, my goodness.

686
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,043
That's amazing.

687
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,045
I MUST TAKE A VIDEO OF THIS

688
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:45,217
JIN-KYUNG'S CAMERA

689
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,856
Put one here, Sook.

690
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,624
It looks so good.

691
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,029
JIN-KYUNG SAMPLES IT FIRST

692
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,197
The master of kimchi.

693
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,632
How is it?

694
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,601
Is it okay?

695
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,436
It's nice to get your approval.

696
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,738
The entrepreneur of a kimchi business

697
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,540
-approved of it.
-Approved of it.

698
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,043
Is it okay for us
to enjoy this kind of luxury?

699
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,313
I couldn't even shoot
the previous episode with you guys.

700
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,816
I came all the way here
but all I'm doing is eating.

701
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,251
-That's right.
-That's right.

702
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,685
That's right, Woo-young.

703
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:21,720
Really?

704
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,456
ABOUT TO CRY

705
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:28,827
That's so good.

706
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,861
YUM

707
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,463
Has the radish fermented enough?

708
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,132
-It's so good.
-This will totally aid your digestion.

709
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,068
THE MEMBERS TASTE IT TOO

710
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,203
WOW

711
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,905
Good radish.

712
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,106
SO DELICIOUS

713
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,975
-It tastes nice and clean.
-Can I have a leaf?

714
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,143
Want the leaf?

715
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,711
This one?

716
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,580
AWESOME!

717
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,583
This is a really, really good <i>dongchimi</i>.

718
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,219
It isn't sour.

719
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,320
This is incredible.

720
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,555
How can it be

721
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,591
just the right amount
of sweet and crunchy?

722
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,426
-Doesn't it taste very fresh too?
-Yes.

723
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,094
It tastes so fresh.

724
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,230
-It tastes fresh.
-It's made with spring water.

725
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,467
You keep saying
it's made with spring water.

726
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,437
That means she just used
water she purchased, right?

727
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,205
-It is.
-I think it's bottled water.

728
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,507
Did you use bottled water?

729
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,277
ALL THEY GET IS SILENCE

730
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,346
When do you feel most refreshed, Sook?

731
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,847
When I'm lying down here

732
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,783
with all the windows open.

733
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,518
-Wouldn't you be cold if you did that?
-No.

734
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,553
-The air is so fresh.
-I see.

735
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,355
<i>It isn't the air you breathe in Seoul.</i>

736
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,523
FRESH AIR THAT YOU
CAN'T BREATHE IN SEOUL

737
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,491
Then, I'd prepare food for myself.

738
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,759
-By yourself?
-Yes.

739
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,394
-But I pack something delicious.
-Okay.

740
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,931
It's nothing fancy though.
I just prepare some side dishes.

741
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:40,832
I prepare a few.

742
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,367
I SEE

743
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,503
Then, I would watch
whatever video I want to watch.

744
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,538
-You just hang out?
-Yes.

745
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,673
I enjoy my time here like that.

746
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,674
How nice.

747
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,477
-Try it with the broth.
-I can't go out.

748
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,412
Try it with the potato
or the sweet potato.

749
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,116
-Come here already.
-I have to try this.

750
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,017
Hurry.

751
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,553
Gosh, root crops with this?
That's going to be amazing.

752
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,090
FIRST, TAKE A SIP
OF THE DONGCHIMI BROTH

753
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,391
Wow!

754
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,760
YOU HAVE TO TRY IT RIGHT NOW,
WOO-YOUNG

755
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,196
-The <i>dongchimi</i> is the best!
-This is amazing!

756
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,198
Wow! This is incredible!

757
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,134
Do you know what
the <i>dongchimi </i>reminds me of?

758
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,103
My parents love <i>dongchimi.</i>

759
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,573
I even thought that it would
be nice if my parents could try this.

760
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,408
How was it when you tried it, Jin-kyung?

761
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,943
-It was so good.
-Really?

762
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,513
-It has a sharp, fizzy freshness to it.
-Yes.

763
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,848
That's the spring water.

764
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,249
-Really?
-Yes, I'm serious.

765
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,551
Spring water from Jirisan.

766
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,053
Didn't you say Seoraksan earlier?

767
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,355
-They're different regions.
-Wait.

768
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,857
She said it was Hallasan.

769
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,159
-Which one is it?
-Was it Seoraksan?

770
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,293
Who are you?

771
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,030
I think you dried
the half-dried saury yourself too.

772
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,632
Yes, I got that from Pohang.

773
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,635
You bought the dried ones, didn't you?

774
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,870
Yes.

775
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,706
IGNORING THE OWNER'S TALL TALES
THEY DIG INTO THE SWEET POTATOES

776
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,741
Let's try the sweet potato first.

777
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,246
You can make <i>dongchimi</i> noodles
with these too.

778
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,214
WOW

779
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,516
Orange sweet potato!

780
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,317
Yum. It's delicious.

781
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,852
That isn't orange sweet potato.

782
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,655
-It isn't? It tastes just like one though.
-No, it isn't.

783
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,290
Is it? Then, eat it thinking it is.

784
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,259
Do you have salt?

785
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,860
Yes, I do. Want some salt?

786
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,595
-I want just a bit.
-Try it with kimchi.

787
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,697
I'm a total foodie.

788
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:19,931
Eat it with the kimchi.

789
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,933
-Then, you won't need salt.
-Really?

790
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,135
-Put it on this?
-Yes.

791
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,505
JOO DAE-GI PUTS THE KIMCHI ON IT
AS RECOMMENDED

792
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,278
MMM

793
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,279
It looks great.

794
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,413
So that's how you eat it.

795
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,148
How is it? Is it not so great?

796
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,783
-So this is how you eat it.
-Yes.

797
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,851
Do you have salt?

798
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,419
WHY THAT JERK

799
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,821
Come on.

800
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,223
You eat the kimchi instead of the salt.

801
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,958
-Should I hit him?
-It'll be too salty.

802
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,560
I want to try it in various ways.

803
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,895
-Should I hit him?
-You haven't hit him yet?

804
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,998
HE GETS THE SALT IN THE END

805
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,803
I love salt.

806
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,871
Me too.

807
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,508
THE REBELLIOUS WOO-JAE
EATS IT WITH SALT

808
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,477
-Want some more?
-I'm going to try the potato.

809
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,913
THE OBEDIENT YOUNGEST MEMBER
TRIES THE RECOMMENDED RECIPE

810
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,453
THE COMBINATION OF ROASTED SWEET POTATO
AND DONGCHIMI IS TO DIE FOR

811
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,388
Isn't it good?

812
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,291
That was an appetizer.
All of those were appetizers.

813
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,193
If those were appetizers…

814
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,428
THE MAIN DISH
HASN'T EVEN BEEN SERVED YET

815
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,696
Can I have that sweet potato?

816
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,064
-Go head.
-Try the potato too.

817
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,399
Don't eat too much of that, guys.

818
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,202
SURPRISINGLY,
WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET

819
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,571
Oh, my gosh. These are

820
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,775
the best sweet potatoes I have had
since last year and this year.

821
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,344
I got tired of sweet potatoes for a while.

822
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,079
There weren't any good sweet potatoes.

823
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,413
You see, when you pair it

824
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,916
with something else, it tastes different.

825
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,184
Gosh, it's so good.

826
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,418
The potatoes…

827
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,821
are good like this,

828
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,991
but they taste amazing
when you pair it with cream cheese.

829
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,194
CREAM CHEESE AND POTATO RECIPE

830
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,365
1. ADD A THICK LAYER OF CREAM CHEESE
ON TOP OF THE POTATO

831
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,001
2. TOP IT WITH CHOPPED CHIVES

832
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:06,337
3. SPRINKLE SOME BLACK PEPPER

833
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,842
Spread the cream cheese on top
and sprinkle black pepper?

834
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,878
I'll add a little maple syrup.

835
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,281
THE FINISHING TOUCH!
ADD SOME MAPLE SYRUP!

836
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,950
<i>That cannot taste bad.</i>
<i>That is definitely going to be good.</i>

837
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,919
You have to sue them
if they say that tastes bad.

838
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,055
-That is definitely going to be good.
-Gosh.

839
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,658
Putting cream cheese
and maple syrup on a potato.

840
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,659
Let's try that.

841
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,427
-Give it a try.
-It's definitely good.

842
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,296
HOW WILL THE COMBINATION TASTE?

843
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,330
Give me a small piece.

844
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,531
Let's all try a bite.

845
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,732
Give it a try.

846
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,902
-Wow. You eat it like this.
-Yeah.

847
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:39,938
Wow!

848
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,507
INCREDIBLE

849
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,175
-Is it really good?
-Sook.

850
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,880
LOOK AT THIS

851
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,153
-Want more?
-Gosh, this is just…

852
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,856
It tastes interesting with the chives.

853
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,225
-It goes so well with cream cheese.
-Yes.

854
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,997
THEY GO SO WELL

855
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,001
DEVOURING IT ON CAMERA

856
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,103
You really know your flavors.

857
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,405
THANKS TO THE FLAVOR MASTER SOOK
THEIR MOUTHS GET PAMPERED

858
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,841
This kind of made me think that

859
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,644
it is an honor to be one of Sook's

860
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,812
close associates.

861
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,913
-For real.
-That's right.

862
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,014
-In so many ways.
-Yes.

863
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,783
If you have someone like
Sook as a close associate…

864
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,452
It's kind of like a privilege.

865
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,519
It is a privilege.

866
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,456
Try setting things up
and doing everything like her.

867
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,423
It is no easy task.

868
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,693
Do you know what's cool about Sook?

869
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,997
It's awesome that she can
find happiness through what she does.

870
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,400
DESPITE HER BUSY SCHEDULE

871
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,869
SHE CAN'T GIVE UP
THE BREAK IN HER DAILY LIFE

872
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,238
This sweet potato is insane!

873
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,640
-Isn't it good?
-I like the potato.

874
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,541
THE HEALTHY HAPPINESS
SHE CARVED OUT FOR HERSELF

875
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,077
Now, I will serve you what I love,

876
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,279
the lotus leaf rice.

877
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,213
THE LOTUS LEAF RICE IS DONE

878
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,053
Let me show you the lotus leaf rice.

879
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,088
WHAT IS THIS?

880
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,156
Do you want to try it?

881
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,492
SOOKMAKASE'S 7TH COURSE
LOTUS LEAF RICE

882
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,494
There's even lotus root in it.

883
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,596
-Wow.
-Wow.

884
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,730
Woo-jae.

885
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,098
I don't really like that.

886
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,068
-The sweet potato is good.
-Wow!

887
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,171
You just eat this on its own.

888
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,473
Have some of this.

889
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,275
You didn't wrap it, did you?

890
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,910
I wrapped it myself.

891
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,011
-For real?
-You did that?

892
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,079
Yes, I added everything.

893
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,147
When?

894
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,049
I put it in the shopping cart.

895
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,151
OH…

896
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,053
I ordered it from a famous place.

897
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,056
Why do you keep on fibbing today?

898
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,657
-Well--
-Where do they sell this?

899
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,125
I keep wanting to brag.

900
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,594
-Wrap it in some <i>gim</i>.
-It's so good.

901
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,829
-You're not having any?
-No.

902
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:45,730
It's good.

903
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,833
It's so chewy and delicious.

904
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,168
Can you give me one?

905
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,836
IT'S REALLY GOOD

906
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,108
-By the way, Sook,
-How did they do this?

907
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,111
-you haven't served the main dish yet?
-No.

908
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,314
-How many are left?
-How special is the main dish?

909
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,916
Today's main dish is…

910
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,984
Wow! What is that?

911
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,285
It's eel.

912
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,120
-Today's main dish is eel.
-Wow.

913
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,892
SOOKMAKASE'S 8TH COURSE
GRILLED EEL

914
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,261
Today is my day!

915
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,863
Today's menu is eel.

916
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,732
-It's eel.
-Bokbunja and eel? Oh, boy.

917
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,535
Bokbunja and eel?
These boys can't handle all that.

918
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,470
I know.

919
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,505
-I don't think anything will happen.
-Why…

920
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,840
Why are you worried about that?

921
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,508
Some ginger can…

922
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,377
-Think more gingerly.
-Yes.

923
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,212
-Ginger.
-You know…

924
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,115
-Woo-young is back.
-Some ginger.

925
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,850
Have some ginger and think gingerly.

926
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,084
IT ALREADY RUBBED OFF ON HIM TOO

927
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,986
For the men…

928
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,688
Why is it for the men?

929
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,189
-What is that?
-Eel extract.

930
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,324
THE SYMBOL OF STRENGTH,
EEL EXTRACT

931
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,326
This is trouble.

932
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,328
I can't have any.
The whole of Gapyeong may shake.

933
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,629
Geez.

934
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,697
DUMBFOUNDED

935
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,232
THE ORIGIN OF THIS PRIDE
IS UNKNOWN

936
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,333
I got some eel extract.

937
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,902
-Did you hear the main writer laugh?
-This one is…

938
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,837
-She laughed so loud.
-…a gift for you guys.

939
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,305
The neighbors may file a report.

940
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,443
They're probably already complaining
because I clogged the toilet.

941
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,713
-Have some when you feel drained.
-Thank you.

942
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,614
Eel extract.

943
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,215
-Eel extract?
-Okay.

944
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,417
Here, Sae-ho.

945
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,718
-Okay. Thanks.
-Sure.

946
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,687
-Thanks.
-You're still a newlywed.

947
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,123
YOU CAN HAVE MINE TOO

948
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,725
I get to have all three? Thanks.

949
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,926
Because he's a newlywed.

950
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,028
I'll take good care of it.

951
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,330
You'll take good care of it?

952
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,398
Shall we sit?

953
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,200
-Please have a seat.
-Why are you standing?

954
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,402
Let me start cooking the eel.

955
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,537
How's she going to do it?

956
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,438
I'll stand and watch.

957
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,673
Sook must have her own recipe.

958
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,009
No, it comes with the sauce.

959
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,178
-Really?
-Yes.

960
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,081
I think anything you eat here tastes good.

961
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,717
Check out the size of this eel.

962
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,387
-Wow.
-There was a restaurant by the ocean.

963
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,658
They usually grill it
while coating it with the sauce.

964
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,194
I remember it being so delicious

965
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,629
when I had it as a kid.

966
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,064
It wasn't fishy at all.

967
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,399
-By the ocean?
-Yeah.

968
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,068
-I'll use spicy sauce on this side…
-Okay.

969
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,004
…and I'll use the basic mild sauce
on this side.

970
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,539
How many do you have?

971
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,308
We have enough to eat until we die.

972
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,509
TAKING ANOTHER ONE OUT

973
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,810
WOW

974
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,045
This is driving me crazy.

975
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,881
I'm getting a signal right now.

976
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,915
Is this…

977
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,150
-Really?
-Hey.

978
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,651
-No.
-I'm in trouble.

979
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,253
Am I going to crumble before this eel?

980
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,388
Gosh, what do I do?

981
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,791
ON THE VERGE OF EXPLOSION

982
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,626
I'll just have explosive diarrhea today.

983
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,328
JUST EMPTY THE MIND
AND THE STOMACH

984
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,798
She's frying it.

985
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:35,900
The color is changing.

986
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,635
Man, it's frying up nicely.

987
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:38,870
WHILE THE EEL
IS BEING FRIED NICELY

988
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,007
-It's already our third Kim Sook Camping…
-Yes.

989
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,242
…including the past life one.

990
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,311
As an extension of Kim Sook Camping
during those times,

991
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,313
you did Outdoor Camping,

992
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,581
you had Awkward Camping,

993
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,416
-and things like that.
-That's right.

994
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,619
This time, we are
going to have Silent Camping.

995
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,553
Silent?

996
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,355
-We have to be silent?
-Silent Camping.

997
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:01,058
It's because Sook doesn't like
people's voices to carry over the fence.

998
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,960
-That's correct.
-Especially men.

999
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,329
Honoring the spirit of her campsite,

1000
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,832
we're going to enjoy
a silent camping time.

1001
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,267
This won't be easy for us.

1002
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,135
It's called Hunting the Bluff.

1003
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,304
-Hunting the Bluff?
-Hunting the Bluff.

1004
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,973
We put a twist to
the dating term "hunting."

1005
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,308
-With bluffing?
-Yes.

1006
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,377
Has anyone been
the object of hunting before?

1007
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,445
-Hunting?
-Hunting?

1008
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,181
-Hunting?
-Hunting?

1009
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,617
I don't have much to do
with this particular topic.

1010
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,387
People can't approach me easily
because of my job.

1011
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,522
-Right. It isn't easy.
-It wasn't easy.

1012
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,124
What about you, Woo-jae?

1013
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,059
This did happen when I was in college.

1014
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,127
It was at the library.

1015
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,461
Did you get a note?

1016
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,765
When I came back from the bathroom,
I'd discover a beverage and a note.

1017
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,600
A BEVERAGE
AND A NOTE ON HIS DESK

1018
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,170
It happened very rarely,
like once or twice.

1019
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,773
-It was when I was very--
-What did that feel like?

1020
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,941
-What?
-How did you feel?

1021
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,776
It was exciting.

1022
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,977
It was exciting.

1023
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,712
-So what is Hunting the Bluff?
-What is it?

1024
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,147
This is what Hunting the Bluff is.

1025
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,749
<i>It is called that because</i>
<i>it's a blind date filled with bluffs.</i>

1026
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,420
As you know, bluffing is just empty words.

1027
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,088
-Simply said, it's lying.
-Yeah.

1028
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,489
-Pathological lying.
-Yes.

1029
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,160
Let's say that you are
in a group blind date,

1030
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,629
and you must continue on
a conversation that isn't truthful.

1031
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,630
Okay.

1032
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,732
If there's even the least bit of truth,

1033
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,901
-do we lose points?
-You'll lose points.

1034
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,704
-Okay.
-You lose one point if it is truthful.

1035
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,339
-Okay.
-You lose a point if you laugh.

1036
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,707
-Okay.
-Those are the rules.

1037
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,841
Even if we laugh?

1038
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,544
So whoever loses the most points

1039
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,881
has to clean up the dishes from the meal

1040
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,150
-that Sook worked hard to make.
-How many have to do it?

1041
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,819
-How many?
-One person.

1042
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,520
Am I playing this too?

1043
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,556
If you're busy, we can exclude you.

1044
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,957
-I'm a bit…
-Sure.

1045
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:40,958
I'm busy right now.

1046
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,393
However,

1047
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,995
if Sook is excluded from this,

1048
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,064
the ratio of men and women is off
to have a blind date,

1049
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,166
so shall we make it a camping club?

1050
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,334
Sure.

1051
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,273
ON A WINTER NIGHT FILLED WITH
THE SMELL OF FIREWOOD

1052
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,976
SOME CAMPERS WHO LOVE A BIT
OF ROMANCE GATHERED TOGETHER

1053
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,611
-Hello.
-Hello.

1054
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,480
-Yes, nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1055
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,447
THE CAMPING CLUB MEMBERS
GREET ONE ANOTHER

1056
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,915
I am 187 cm tall.

1057
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,651
-What?
-I'm 187 cm tall.

1058
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,786
I am 187 cm tall.

1059
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,788
-Gosh.
-She laughed.

1060
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:11,956
-Yes.
-You look tall.

1061
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,090
-Really?
-Yes.

1062
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,593
I'm 187 cm tall and I weigh 58 kg.

1063
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,295
THE FIRST MEMBER
HAS AN IMPRESSIVE PHYSIQUE

1064
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,396
-Nice to meet you.
-I love…

1065
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,765
-I love camping so much.
-I see.

1066
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:24,235
I love meeting people and eating with them

1067
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,070
in the outdoors.

1068
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,471
Do you know

1069
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,206
who Tzuyang is?

1070
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,975
-Of course.
-I am

1071
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,677
a rival of hers.

1072
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,445
-You're a big eater.
-Yes, I eat a lot.

1073
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,513
What's your name?

1074
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,614
-Me?
-Eating?

1075
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,715
HMM

1076
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,849
My name?

1077
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,420
Well, you see…

1078
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,355
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY YOUR OWN NAME?

1079
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,290
-Why can't you say it?
-It's Big Eater.

1080
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,992
-Your last name is Big?
-Yes.

1081
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,728
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH

1082
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,862
-Eater.
-Your name is Eater.

1083
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,030
What's your name?

1084
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,165
-Me?
-Yes.

1085
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,534
-I'm Hong Mi-in.
-What?

1086
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,435
Hong Mi-in.

1087
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,536
-That's your name?
-I see.

1088
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,105
Aren't you Sherry Hong?

1089
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,940
-Sherry Hong?
-I think we met before.

1090
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,175
That's my English name.

1091
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,476
-Your English name.
-I see.

1092
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,111
It's Beau-tee in Korean

1093
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,212
and Sherry in English.

1094
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,881
Did something happen to you though?
You had a lot of hair then.

1095
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,016
I thinned it out.

1096
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,552
-You only thinned out the front?
-Yes.

1097
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,453
You got a perm?

1098
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,188
You see, I like not having hair here.

1099
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,357
-Does it feel nice and cool?
-It feels nice and cool.

1100
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,858
She still has curly hair though.

1101
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,393
It looks like a beard cut.

1102
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,961
WHAT HAPPENED
IN JUST A HALF A YEAR?

1103
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,862
Hello.

1104
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,297
I'm Tom Hardy.

1105
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,499
-Tom Hardy?
-I know.

1106
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,034
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

1107
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,935
I see. You knew.

1108
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,169
THINK SAD THOUGHTS

1109
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,238
How did you get into camping?

1110
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,608
My whole family is a camping family.

1111
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,576
So

1112
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:42,880
since prehistoric times,
my family made it this far

1113
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,749
by hunting and gathering.

1114
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,117
You were hunted, weren't you?

1115
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,018
We got hunted at times
but we hunted as well.

1116
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,220
That's how it has been.

1117
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,488
What did you usually hunt?

1118
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,422
BURSTING OUT LAUGHING

1119
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,393
REMAIN CALM

1120
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,262
SHE TRIES TO CLENCH HER TEETH
AND CLOSE HER EYES

1121
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,331
BUT BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

1122
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,234
-What is that sound?
-You startled me.

1123
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,435
What is that noise?

1124
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,437
-Did you fart or something?
-What is that sound?

1125
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,572
What kind of family is a hunting family?

1126
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,341
We hunt for laughs.

1127
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,744
-I see.
-In my case, I hunt for funny stories…

1128
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,479
-Okay.
-…and turn it into my own story.

1129
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,847
I am Tom Hardy.

1130
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,750
TOM HARDY, LAUGHTER HUNTER
HOBBY: HUNTING FOR FUNNY STORIES

1131
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,185
And what do you do?

1132
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,789
Actually, I run a camping business.

1133
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,525
-I see.
-I run a camp site.

1134
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,028
Currently, I own a lot of mountains

1135
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,930
in Korea

1136
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,166
-to run camp sites.
-I see.

1137
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,400
May I ask your name?

1138
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,502
-My name is Jang San.
-Mr. Jang San?

1139
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,703
Nice name.

1140
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,405
-How old are you?
-Mountain Jang.

1141
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,575
-How old are you?
-I'm 13 years old.

1142
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,744
-You became successful at a young age.
-Yes.

1143
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,012
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH

1144
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,013
Well…

1145
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,015
How old were you
when you bought a mountain?

1146
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,684
I bought a mountain
when I was a scatterbrain.

1147
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,586
ON THE BRINK

1148
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,788
I guess I was about nine years old.
I was a scatterbrain.

1149
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,891
-You can't keep your hands still even now.
-No.

1150
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,560
I'm always a bit scatterbrained.

1151
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,961
JANG SAN, 13 YEARS OLD
SCATTERBRAINED CHILD ENTREPRENEUR

1152
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,429
-So I bought a mountain.
-I am

1153
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,031
good at memorization.

1154
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,132
For example, I'm good at

1155
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,700
-doing math in my head.
-I see.

1156
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:14,538
-Give me something.
-48,298 times 2,232.

1157
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,674
HE IS USING HIS FINGERS
TO DO MATH IN HIS HEAD?

1158
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,175
LOOKING AWAY

1159
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,376
GIGGLING

1160
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,712
CLENCHING HIS TEETH
DO NOT LAUGH

1161
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:22,847
It's 2,485.

1162
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,148
Yes, that's right.

1163
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,149
LOOKING SMUG

1164
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,619
You're good at this too.

1165
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,521
-It isn't division.
-Right.

1166
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,656
-It's multiplication.
-The number got smaller.

1167
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,158
By the way,

1168
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,861
is that dandruff?

1169
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,630
Is that dandruff?

1170
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,599
BURSTING OUT LAUGHING

1171
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,667
TRYING TO STIFLE HER LAUGHTER

1172
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,603
Yes, it's dandruff.

1173
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,438
You have so much skin flakes.

1174
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,939
Can't you receive scalp care?

1175
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,674
-Shall I dust some off?
-The skin flakes…

1176
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,610
THE SKIN FLAKES PRODUCE
PROPORTIONALLY TO THE AMOUNT HE EATS

1177
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,111
I have X-ray vision.

1178
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,046
-That's my ability.
-Really?

1179
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,481
-X-ray vision?
-Yes, X-ray vision.

1180
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,550
IS HE A SUPERHUMAN
WE'VE ONLY HEARD ABOUT?

1181
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,618
Ray-Ban?

1182
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,186
Ray-Ban?

1183
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,690
REMAIN CALM

1184
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,692
SHE IS AT RISK TOO

1185
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,227
Why are you so quiet?

1186
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,464
FORGET WHAT HE SAID

1187
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,598
I have X-ray vision.

1188
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,866
Really?

1189
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,101
LAUGHING IN AMUSEMENT

1190

GIGGLING

1191
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:19,937
Woo-hoo.

1192
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,639
Can you see mine?

1193
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,607
-I can't see it.
-You can't?

1194
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:24,875
-No.
-I said that

1195
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,210
I like hunting.

1196
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,711
-Yes.
-I'm good at hiding.

1197
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:28,879
I can conceal things well.

1198
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,348
You don't have to hide it.

1199
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,819
Who are you? Why are you filming?

1200
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,288
I'm a camera director.

1201
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,589
-You're a camera director?
-Yes.

1202
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,157
What are you filming?

1203
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,493
Look, the eel is done.

1204
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:43,961
WOW!!!

1205
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,430
Spicy, not spicy.

1206
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,032
This looks amazing.

1207
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,100
So this is an anaconda.

1208
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,836
RIGHT, WE AREN'T DONE YET

1209
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:58,342
WHILE THE MEMBERS
WERE TALKING NONSENSE

1210
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,011
SOOK REMAINED FOCUSED
ON THE EELS

1211
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,747
WITH THE AURA OF SOMEONE WHO
DEDICATED 30 YEARS IN GRILLING EEL

1212
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:08,419
CONTINUOUSLY ROTATING THE EEL
WHILE GRILLING

1213
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,887
This looks awesome!

1214
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,056
Look at it. It looks amazing!

1215
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,259
With the Jiri--
No, with the spring water from Seoraksan…

1216
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,598
Come to think of it,
Sook has been bluffing all along.

1217
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,967
HABITUAL BLUFFING

1218
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:23,901
You're right.

1219
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,538
BIG EATER'S FIRST BITE OF EEL

1220
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,007
Ms. Hong Mi-in, try it.

1221
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,942
YUM

1222
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,711
HOW IS IT?

1223
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,845
It doesn't taste good.

1224
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,314
It doesn't taste good? Oh, I see.

1225
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,516
-I'm just bluffing, Sook.
-It isn't good?

1226
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,651
Come on.

1227
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,552
It isn't good?

1228
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,988
You can stop bluffing
while talking about how it tastes.

1229
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,856
-It's good.
-It tastes incredible.

1230
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,924
It melts in your mouth.

1231
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,859
-It's so good.
-Why…

1232
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:49,960
Why does it just melt?

1233
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,395
-It's so good.
-You know,

1234
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,564
-the texture is…
-Yes?

1235
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,767
-What is this?
-…very unique.

1236
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,970
It's soft but also chewy.

1237
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,538
-Isn't it?
-It's like gummies.

1238
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:02,606
Gosh, it's so good.

1239
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,074
-What kind of eel is it?
-Is it

1240
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,777
-the gelatin?
-The wild garlic leaf was grown from

1241
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,712
-spring water of Inwangsan…
-No bluffing.

1242
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,613
I can't?

1243
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,148
Wrap it in this and try it.

1244
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,883
Why do you keep bluffing?

1245
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,218
Take one and wrap the eel in it.

1246
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,955
Take one of these and wrap the eel in it.

1247
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,089
I love wild garlic leaves.

1248
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,025
Wrap it in the wild garlic leaf.

1249
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,328
If you eat wild garlic leaves,

1250
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,196
you're going to live a long life.

1251
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,498
Give it a try.

1252
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,699
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH

1253
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,900
This is so good.

1254
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,568
If you grill eel wrong, it can be fishy.

1255
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,569
Yeah, it can.

1256
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,872
How can it not taste fishy at all?

1257
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,676
IT IS SO GOOD

1258
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,977
Does the eel taste okay?

1259
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,145
This makes no sense.

1260
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,681
I'm so full, but I can't stop eating.

1261
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,383
From which mountain
are the wild garlic leaves from?

1262
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,986
These are grown from
the spring water in Bugaksan.

1263
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,354
Didn't you say it was Inwangsan?

1264
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:52,923
Shall we start bluffing?

1265
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,658
-Who are you?
-What?

1266
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,293
-Shall we start bluffing?
-Who are you?

1267
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,561
<i>Aren't we supposed to bluff?</i>

1268
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:58,462
RESUMING THE BLUFFING

1269
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,064
Which college did you go to?

1270
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,066
-You all went to college, didn't you?
-Yes.

1271
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,234
-Which college?
-Sydney Maritime University.

1272
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,236
SYDNEY MARITIME UNIVERSITY

1273
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,337
Where?

1274
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,541
MINUS 1 POINT EACH

1275
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,945
Sydney Maritime University?
That's a famous school.

1276
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,814
What's your major?

1277
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,682
-<i>Haenyeo</i>.
-You majored in <i>Haenyeo</i>?

1278
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,484
GRADUATE
OF THE ELITE HAENYEO COURSE

1279
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,620
Do you remember your university's anthem?

1280
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,425
UNIVERSITY ANTHEM?

1281
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,828
<i>Sydney Maritime University</i>

1282
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,233
THEIR HEADS BOW NATURALLY

1283
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,402
<i>Majoring in Haenyeo</i>

1284
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,806
<i>We are the kids that swim</i>

1285
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,309
The tune sounds very Asian.

1286
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,543
It's very Asian and--

1287
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,779
How did they come up
with a song like this in Sydney?

1288
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,447
Is it an adapted song?

1289
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:51,682
SHE MUSTERS UP THE COURAGE
TO SING AGAIN

1290
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,352
<i>Sydney Maritime University</i>
<i>Majoring in Haenyeo</i>

1291
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,822
<i>We are the kids that swim</i>

1292
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,090
That's how the song goes.

1293
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,960
<i>Na na na na na na</i>
<i>Raising a nation</i>

1294
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,297
FOR SOME REASON, HE CAN
SING ALONG HER SCHOOL'S ANTHEM

1295
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,634
-The melody does sound very familiar.
-Yes.

1296
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:14,471
Even Sydney is influenced
by Eastern philosophy,

1297
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,240
so there are many Asian aspects.

1298
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,574
ANTHEM IS A HARMONY
OF EAST AND WEST

1299
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,976
Which college did you go to?

1300
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,278
I am about to start--

1301
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,179
You just entered?

1302
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,848
I went to I'm About to Enter University.

1303
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:26,750
So that's how you're taking it.

1304
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,485
A TWIST THAT STUNNED
EVEN THE COMEDY SCHOLAR

1305
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,387
SMIRK

1306
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,288
Which university?

1307
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,423
-Don't try to find out.
-Okay.

1308
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,927
I am cautiously attending school.

1309
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,328
-Why?
-Why?

1310
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,731
What do you mean
by "cautiously attending"?

1311
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,900
You see, I'm attending school
without anybody knowing.

1312
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,234
Did you not pay your tuition?

1313
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,803
-What?
-College tuition?

1314
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,171
Are you auditing classes?

1315
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,807
No, I'm not auditing classes. We just met,

1316
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,376
so I didn't want to
give out too much personal info.

1317
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,779
Are you trying to come up
with something clever while saying that?

1318
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,848
If you give me some time…

1319
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,316
Why do you need more time?

1320
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,351
Didn't you attend Sensual University?

1321
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,286
What?

1322
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,253
Sensual University.

1323
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,454
That's perfect!

1324
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,756
You took a lot of eel extract.

1325
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,625
I don't think I can
make a comeback to that.

1326
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,561
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW LIKES THIS SHOW

1327
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,830
The game has ended.

1328
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,364
-Really?
-Okay.

1329
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,168
JIN-KYUNG, WHO LAUGHED THE MOST,
MUST DO THE DISHES

1330
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,572
-Thanks to you, we ate so well, Sook.
-Let me take some out.

1331
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,472
I know.

1332
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,841
-Is it hot water?
-No, cold water.

1333
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,109
-It'll warm up fast since it's very hot.
-Really?

1334
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,979
ACTUALLY, SOOK DIDN'T
JUST FEED THE MEMBERS

1335
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,648
SHE FED THE WHOLE STAFF

1336
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,586
THE STAFF INSIDE THE TENT

1337
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,521
You're out there, Director.

1338
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:43,360
AND EVEN THE STAFF
OUTSIDE THE TENT

1339
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,532
YES, IT'S ME AGAIN

1340
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,269
THANKS TO SOOK
WHO KEPT FEEDING EVERYONE

1341
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,537
Thank you, Sook.

1342
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,806
THEIR STOMACHS
ARE ABOUT TO BURST

1343
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,442
<i>I think I ate the most.</i>

1344
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,744
<i>All she had was delicious food.</i>
<i>My goodness.</i>

1345
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,679
<i>-I'll do it.</i>
<i>-No, I'll do it.</i>

1346
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,214
<i>I like doing dishes.</i>

1347
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:09,653
JIN-KYUNG FINISHED
DOING THE DISHES AS PUNISHMENT

1348
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,989
ONE HOUR LATER

1349
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,290
Question.

1350
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,058
-Here goes the question.
-Okay.

1351
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,429
"Write all the Japanese members
of the group TWICE."

1352
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,469
CONFIDENTLY
JOTTING DOWN THE ANSWER

1353
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,938
I think a lot of them
will guess correctly.

1354
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,539
Really?

1355
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:30,440
EVERYONE SHOULDN'T
GUESS IT CORRECTLY?

1356
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,876
If I write the answer,
the probability increases,

1357
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,244
so I won't write it.

1358
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,313
Then, write an incorrect answer.

1359
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,348
How many members does TWICE have?

1360
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,984
How could she ask a question like that?

1361
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,786
DOES SHE NOT KNOW?

1362
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,721
Wait. I'm getting nervous.

1363
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:45,923
DO I HAVE TO WRITE
THE CORRECT ANSWER?

1364
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,859
SHOULD I WRITE IT OR SHOULDN'T I?

1365
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,560
Show us the answer at the count of three.

1366
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,062
One, two, three.

1367
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,399
Who is Sawa?

1368
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,301
WHO IS SAWA?

1369
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,102
Why on earth did she write "Sawa"?

1370
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,304
SAWA IS A SURPRISINGLY CREATIVE
WRONG ANSWER

1371
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,505
Who is Sawa?

1372
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,006
Isn't there a member called Sawa?
