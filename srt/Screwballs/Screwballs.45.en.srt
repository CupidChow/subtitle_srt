1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,804
DID SOMEONE PRESS
THE FAST FORWARD BUTTON ON 2025?

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,975
HOW ON EARTH DID WE END UP
ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE CALENDAR AGAIN?

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,178
LONGING FOR WARMTH
AS THE WEATHER GETS COLD

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,747
THAT'S WHY WE CRAVE
STEAMED BUNS, FISH-SHAPED BUNS,

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,182
AND FRIENDSHIPS WE ARE THANKFUL FOR

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:23,056
SCREWBALLS END-OF-YEAR SPECIAL

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,959
We have successfully finished
the Cho Sae-ho Show,

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,896
and now, we will begin the second part
of Sae-ho's Deconstruction Show.

9
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,264
The Cho Sae-ho Show was great.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,332
-You did so well.
-Good job.

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,367
-You were awesome.
-It was a one-man show.

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,802
It went well because you guys

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,404
-were great guests.
-You were the best.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,641
We thought a lot about what kind of show
we should have where Sae-ho's the star

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,877
and this is the conclusion
we have reached.

16
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:47,580
One of the big nicknames that
represent Sae-ho is

17
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,049
-the Serial No-show Guy.
-That's right.

18
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,116
"I don't know them."

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,852
His golden age started with,
"I don't know them so how can I go?"

20
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:57,023
So we planned an event
where Sae-ho's the star,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,992
but true to your nickname,

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,827
-it will be an event…
-Like that?

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,396
…that you can't help but miss.

24
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,532
You're penetrating Sae-ho's core.

25
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,468
It is called Cho Sae-ho's Funeral.

26
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,570
When I got the nickname

27
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,839
-the Serial No-show Guy…
-You guys are bold.

28
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,973
…a while ago…

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,041
It became a meme.

30
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,344
…many people kept asking me to come
and asked me why I didn't come.

31
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,647
Even my parents jokingly said,

32
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,950
"How could you not come
to your own parents' wedding?"

33
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,885
But some of the comments said

34
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,588
-one event that Sae-ho can't attend…
-Somewhere he can't go.

35
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,957
…even though he may want to,

36
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,192
is his own funeral.

37
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,827
I did hear about that.

38
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,564
That's why we came up with this special.

39
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,635
The members can remember
the time they spent with Sae-ho

40
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,606
and offer their respects and prayers
in their own way.

41
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,808
PAYING THEIR RESPECTS TO SAE-HO
WHILE REMEMBERING THEIR TIME TOGETHER

42
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,078
TIME WENT BY AND IT IS NOW THE YEAR 20XX

43
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,215
THERE ARE FUNERAL WREATHS
EXPRESSING CONDOLENCE

44
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,616
AND SAE-HO'S PORTRAIT

45
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,686
LOOKS AS IF HE WERE
STILL ALIVE AND BREATHING

46
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,690
THE FIRST FUNERAL VISITOR
SHOWS UP WEARING BLACK

47
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,127
My goodness.

48
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,262
My goodness. How could this be?

49
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,198
Sae-ho is gone.

50
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,968
Gosh, I am just devastated.

51
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,872
He died laughing at his own joke.

52
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,939
How could that…

53
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,675
-How could he die like that?
-I know.

54
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,244
He was so funny. You made it.

55
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,645
SHADOW AND WOO-JAE COME TO PAY RESPECTS

56
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,713
Gosh, Sook.

57
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,780
Hey. My gosh.

58
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,382
It has been a long time.

59
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,251
-Yes, how have you been?
-Have you been well?

60
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,785
Jin-kyung, did you cry a lot?

61
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,387
Your eyes are red.

62
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,457
-What?
-How is life abroad?

63
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,894
-Life abroad?
-You left Korea 20 years ago now.

64
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,896
After that incident…

65
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,198
We haven't met up since then?

66
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,302
But I met a European guy over there
and we're living happily.

67
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,470
Good.

68
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,305
-But--
-You are very popular.

69
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,740
-So the condolence money…
-Yeah?

70
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,910
I lent the deceased some money
when he was alive.

71
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,311
Can I get it back now?

72
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,579
No, come on.

73
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,480
ME?

74
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,648
Woo-jae.

75
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,616
How could you even say that?

76
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,884
-He's dead.
-Yeah.

77
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,786
But I lent him money.

78
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,955
It was the late Sae-ho's

79
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,091
22nd year anniversary
with his wife this year,

80
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,960
so I prepared 200 won.

81
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
Come on, man.

82
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,263
How could you pay only 200 won?

83
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,464
How could you do that?

84
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,201
Isn't his coffin from Gucci though?

85
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,335
-Whatever.-
-It's Chanel.

86
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,536
Is it Chanel?

87
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,904
His shroud is from Chanel.

88
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,206
His shroud is from Chanel?

89
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,307
Unbelievable.

90
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,742
My gosh, Sae-ho.

91
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,645
Gosh, Sae-ho. How could you leave us?

92
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,747
Sae-ho.

93
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,016
-My goodness.
-How could you leave us like this?

94
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,052
I liked you so much.

95
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,154
My goodness. How could this be?

96
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,622
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE'S ALIVE

97
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,459
My gosh, Sae-ho. How could you die
while laughing at your own joke?

98
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,361
You never know in life.

99
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,231
It was a good death though
because he died while laughing.

100
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,899
Was this the best photo…

101
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,668
Was this the best photo they had of him?

102
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,736
Was it?

103
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,404
What is wrong with this face?

104
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,806
What is this, a mustache?

105
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,873
It was a good death.

106
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,542
Geez, I want to shave that off.

107
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,712
Gosh, Sae-ho. May you rest in peace.

108
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,347
My goodness, Sae-ho.

109
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,715
Gosh, Sae-ho.

110
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,750
We had such happy times together.

111
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,153
Yeah, may you go
where there's Gucci and Chanel.

112
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,221
My gosh.

113
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,559
Sae-ho! See you later!

114
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,261
THE SHADOW IS DEEPLY GRIEVING

115
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,996
Go to the place high up there.

116
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,897
I am bowing to you…

117
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,733
-Why that Shadow…
-…with my whole heart!

118
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,067
HERE'S MY GIANT BOW

119
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,402
-Sae-ho.
-Gosh.

120
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,470
Sae-ho.

121
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,373
Sae-ho, how can I say goodbye to you?

122
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,941
We almost lost another person.

123
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,410
Sae-ho!

124
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,578
Pull it together.

125
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,980
You weren't that close to him.

126
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,081
-Sae-ho!
-Hey.

127
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,217
I don't want to say goodbye to him.

128
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,053
He's acting cute since he's the youngest.

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,755
I won't say goodbye to you, Sae-ho.

130
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,290
Bye. See you!

131
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,292
Goodbye, Sae-ho!

132
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,359
He's good.

133
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,128
I'll see you later!

134
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,529
Sae-ho!

135
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,464
Why is he so good at slapstick comedy?

136
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,233
Geez.

137
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,301
Gosh.

138
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,201
BACK TO BEING DEAD

139
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,204
-Gosh.
-How have you been lately, Woo-jae?

140
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,173
Yeah, how has everyone been doing?

141
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,242
Have you been married
six times now, Woo-young?

142
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,543
-What?
-Even though

143
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,245
he got married six times,

144
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,813
he couldn't beat Jin-kyung.

145
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,481
-How many times was it?
-Eight times.

146
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,419
-Jin-kyung is way ahead of him.
-She took

147
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,521
the lead when we were on the show together

148
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,189
-and got to eight.
-Eight times?

149
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,658
You must have no regrets whatsoever.

150
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,895
So where are his kids,
Cho Ola, Cho Kka, and Cho Kka-chi?

151
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,997
I know. I wonder how they're doing.

152
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,065
They aren't here.

153
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,566
-How is Ttess?
-And Cho Kka?

154
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,634
How's Cho Kka?

155
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,369
-There's a Ttess?
-That's the youngest.

156
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,537
-The youngest?
-That's Ttess.

157
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,406
-Cho Ola is the eldest.
-She's the eldest.

158
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,474
She's the eldest.

159
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,443
I think Cho Kka is the second one.

160
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,878
-Kka is the second child.
-Yes, Kka.

161
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,246
Cho Kka-chi is the third child.

162
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,548
-Kka-chi is?
-That's the third.

163
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,716
Kka-chi is the third.

164
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,850
Cho Ttess is the fourth.

165
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,652
-Ttess is the youngest?
-That's the youngest?

166
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,488
-I forgot about Kka-chi.
-They had a great relationship.

167
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:00,593
You know, Sae-ho used to love meat.

168
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,995
-Why does it taste so good?
-He didn't just love meat.

169
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,365
He loved anything
he could put in his mouth.

170
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,167
I can't just eat this by myself.

171
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,002
I should give him a bite.

172
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,938
Woo-young, hang on.

173
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,005
Geez.

174
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,707
I want to put it in his mouth.

175
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,309
-Don't give it to him.
-Why not?

176
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,377
He's waiting for it.

177
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,444
But Sae-ho…

178
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,512
HMM…

179
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,347
But this is his favorite.

180
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,982
He's waiting for it.

181
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,017
He used to love this though.

182
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,786
Gosh, he can't eat this anymore.

183
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,621
We'll eat it for you.

184
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,590
-These jeons are so good.
-The beef jeon!

185
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,925
-The jeons…
-This is really Sae-ho's favorite.

186
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,026
Do you want some or not?

187
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,094
Sae-ho.

188
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,863
You want some, don't you?

189
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:37,964
NODDING

190
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,099
You must want this so much.

191
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,100
YES

192
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,636
-Do you want some beef jeon?
-Have some.

193
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,338
Of the two, which one do you want?

194
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,406
The beef jeon.

195
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,641
There. He spoke.

196
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,543
THE DECEASED CANNOT SPEAK

197
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,012
-Have some beef jeon.
-Is Sae-ho still alive?

198
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,681
Gosh, Sae-ho used to really love these.

199
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,618
THE PORTRAIT GETS SOME BEEF JEON TOO

200
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,819
Go on. Eat up.

201
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,657
Jin-kyung, the beef jeon so good.

202
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,592
-Why has the portrait changed?
-It's so good.

203
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,662
He has something in his mouth.

204
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,030
SO FREAKY! THE PORTRAIT CHANGED

205
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,065
Geez. What's up with that?

206
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,067
That's bad luck. Oh, my goodness.

207
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,969
There's something on his mouth.

208
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,138
-My goodness.
-Remove it.

209
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,973
-What's up with this?
-Good job.

210
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,275
Did a ghost do it?

211
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,810
MY BEEF JEON…

212
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,445
What's up with this?

213
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,346
Gosh, the beef jeon is so good.

214
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,481
It's so good.

215
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,750
EVERYBODY BUT THE DECEASED CAN EAT

216
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,818
Next time,

217
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,487
when you all leave me,

218
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,322
I'll order the food from here.

219
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,157
Age doesn't matter when it comes to dying.

220
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,725
-That's true.
-Yeah.

221
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,594
Wait, stop filming.

222
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,729
I told you to stop filming!

223
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,398
-What's going on?
-Stop filming.

224
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,766
A VISITOR BARGES IN
DURING THEIR PEACEFUL MEAL

225
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,900
-Sae-ho.
-Wow.

226
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,735
Sae-ho. Oh, no.

227
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,170
What the heck?

228
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,473
WHO ARE YOU?

229
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,574
Hang on.

230
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,944
Who is that?

231
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,879
Excuse me.

232
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,980
It's me, Sae-ho.

233
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,682
Who are you?

234
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,283
It's Emma whom you admired for so long.

235
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,486
ME?

236
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,820
This is so funny.

237
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,389
I heard you married another woman
right after I dumped you.

238
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,724
SO INTERESTING

239
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,859
She's his ex-girlfriend?

240
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,628
-You cried so much because you missed me.
-Wait, maybe his ex-boyfriend?

241
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,963
His ex-girlfriend.

242
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:22,235
Pardon me, but how do you know him?

243
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,803
He used to follow me around.

244
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,172
My name is Emma.

245
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,773
Did you lend him money?

246
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,710
-No, you see…
-Yes?

247
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,278
…Sae-ho used to like me a lot.

248
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,881
-When was this?
-Hang on.

249
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,316
-Sae-ho.
-What do we do?

250
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,318
I know

251
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,020
that my cute face

252
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,388
and my traps…

253
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,990
THESE TRAPEZIUS MUSCLES

254
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,092
PFFT

255
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,760
-Look at her.
-…and my muscular thighs.

256
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,898
SCARED

257
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,001
-It isn't easy, is it?
-She got bigger.

258
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,471
I came in first in a bikini contest.

259
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,805
Yes, that's right.

260
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,342
I just got back
from beating Kim Kardashian.

261
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,511
-Beat her in what?
-Beat her to death, maybe.

262
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,147
Sae-ho, do you remember…

263
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,286
what you told me
at the playground in front of my place.

264
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,754
"Emma,

265
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,888
can I kiss you?"

266
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,956
Oh, my.

267
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,024
WHAT HAS THE PAST ME DONE?

268
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,859
-I can finally give you an answer.
-Look.

269
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,960
Yes.

270
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,228
-No way.
-No way.

271
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,829
You may kiss me.

272
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,599
Portraits don't move.

273
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,969
SOMEONE SAVE THE DECEASED!

274
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,304
-Come on.
-Come on.

275
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,306
It feels like he's alive. Oh, my goodness!

276
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,341
-Come to me, Sae-ho.
-Come on.

277
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,843
PLEASE END THIS SKETCH

278
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,145
-Excuse me.
-This is wrong.

279
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,646
EMERGENCY BELL FOR THE DECEASED

280
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,582
It is rude to do this to the deceased.

281
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,716
Sit down and eat some food.

282
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,084
-Yeah.
-Wait.

283
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,218
I must tell him something.

284
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,987
Okay. Go on.

285
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,355
-But don't touch him.
-Sae-ho.

286
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,024
Oh, boy. Look.

287
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,961
URGENTLY PRESSES
THE DECEASED'S EMERGENCY BELL

288
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,829
Listen, ma'am.

289
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,230
Please don't lay hands on him.

290
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,334
Did Hye-seon's calves
always look like that, Woo-jae?

291
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,736
Wait.

292
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,405
Are the two of you fighting over me?

293
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,344
US? WHY?

294
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,646
I am sick and tired of this.

295
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,047
Fine.

296
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,682
Sae-ho.

297
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,950
SAE-HO'S LADY HAS MADE A FIRM DECISION

298
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,519
May I start a new love?

299
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,288
Blink if it's okay.

300
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,490
OF COURSE

301
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,625
He's blinking many times.

302
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,593
Fine. Congratulations.

303
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,195
From now on,

304
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,530
this is your chance at having Emma.

305
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,733
She's talking about the two of you.

306
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,267
My type is a guy

307
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,136
that is sensitive and feminine.

308
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,471
That's Jang Woo-young.

309
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,972
He's super feminine.

310
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,475
I wonder which guy is

311
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,077
the feminine one?

312
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,214
You tell me, Sae-ho.

313
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,683
All you have to do is blink.

314
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,385
Once means it's Woo-young

315
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,887
and twice means it's Woo-jae.

316
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,789
Which one is it?

317
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,458
-Woo-jae?
-It's Woo-jae.

318
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,927
-Woo-jae?
-He blinked once.

319
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,262
-It was twice.
-Is it Woo-young?

320
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,430
He blinked once more.

321
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,432
-Is it Woo-jae?
-It's Woo-jae.

322
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,534
THE CONNECTION BESTOWED BY THE DECEASED

323
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,902
-It's you, Woo-jae.
-Okay!

324
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,272
-It's Woo-jae.
-I'll give you both a fair chance.

325
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,341
-Isn't this whole thing unfair?
-Yeah.

326
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,609
BUT EMMA INSISTS ON GIVING THEM A CHANCE

327
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,378
All right. Whoever loses

328
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,782
the thigh wrestle with me

329
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,517
gets to have me.

330
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,452
-The person who loses?
-Take Emma!

331
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,055
TIME FOR THE FEMININE MEN
TO SHOW OFF THEIR CHARM

332
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,956
THE THIGH WRESTLE

333
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,794
If your thighs get within
one fist's width of each other,

334
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,095
you lose. Got that?

335
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,564
So if I lose this match,

336
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,965
I get to have Emma?

337
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,300
Don't make me blush!

338
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,803
I think I fractured something.

339
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,237
-Are you okay? You're fine.
-Yes.

340
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,540
-You're fine.
-If I lose, I get to have Emma?

341
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,609
For the first time in my life,
I will stake my life on this match.

342
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,111
Try and have me.

343
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,448
You win if you can
hold out for ten seconds, okay?

344
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,516
-Ready.
-I'll give you 150,000 won, Woo-jae.

345
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,984
Set. Go.

346
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,053
Ten, nine, eight,

347
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,756
six, five,

348
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,357
-four, three…
-Take me!

349
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,159
Stop messing around!

350
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,994
…two, one.

351
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,329
That's it.

352
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,031
Woo-jae, you lose.

353
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,065
SUCH AN OBVIOUS RESULT

354
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,133
Hye-seon wins!

355
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,235
Wait. Woo-young still has to go.

356
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,536
They may both lose.

357
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,971
There's still Woo-young.

358
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,140
Both of them are dying to lose.

359
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,609
But Woo-young has the upper-hand

360
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,578
because she already played a round.

361
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,513
This is your chance too, Woo-young.

362
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,281
You'll never get a chance like this.

363
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,583
The heck?

364
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,685
Sorry. I apologize for the blunder.

365
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,353
Did you do your best?

366
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,255
I put my life on it, Jin-kyung.

367
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,557
You have ten seconds.
Hold out for just ten seconds.

368
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,793
I am determined to get both men.

369
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,128
Here we go.

370
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,264
-Ready.
-Try and beat me. You got this!

371
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,599
Set. Go.

372
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,434
-Ten, nine…
-Wait. Ouch!

373
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,337
-Ten, nine…
-Wait. Ouch!

374
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,404
Wait. Gosh.

375
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,873
Did he lose on purpose?

376
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,708
-He lost on purpose.
-He did it on purpose.

377
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,176
-Do you want me that badly?
-Wait.

378
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,377
He lost on purpose.

379
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,646
Can you call an ambulance for me?

380
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,148
She split his legs wide open.

381
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,649
-Kim Hye-seon wins!
-Hang on.

382
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,050
You may both have me.

383
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,485
Congratulations!

384
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,820
CONGRATS, EMMA'S MEN

385
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:12,158
-Then, since you won…
-I was so shocked.

386
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,659
…you may take both of them.

387
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,727
-Yes.
-Yes.

388
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,696
Close the chapter with Sae-ho

389
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,632
-and live happily with those two.
-Woo-jae.

390
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,935
-Sae-ho used to love soju.
-He really did.

391
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,370
-Yeah.
-He loved it so much.

392
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,739
-I poured a cup full of the soju…
-He worked so hard.

393
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,641
…that you loved so much.

394
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,509
-Gosh.
-Our dear Sae-ho.

395
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,044
May you rest in peace.

396
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,046
OUR DEAR SAE-HO, MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

397
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,582
Did she just slap him?

398
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,884
It sounded like a slap.

399
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,486
It turns out that

400
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,055
Woo-young will be
seeing your ex-girlfriend.

401
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,657
Please have a drink.

402
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,293
We should all offer him a drink.

403
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,661
-We should.
-That way…

404
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,662
TAKE A CUP, EX-GIRLFRIEND

405
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,729
Offer him a drink.

406
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,264
Drink it up. Hang on.

407
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,401
I'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH MY NEW BOYFRIENDS

408
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,437
WAS THAT A BULLET?

409
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,805
Please offer him a drink.

410
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,240
Let's all offer him a drink.

411
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,842
Here, Sae-ho.

412
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,610
Take this.

413
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
ACCEPT MY DRINK TOO

414
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,346
GULP

415
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,849
He drank it since he likes soju.

416
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,883
IT'S WATER

417
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,152
The soju you loved so much…

418
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,320
He brought the whole bottle.

419
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,788
Hey. Hang on.

420
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
May you…

421
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,459
NOT THAT, PLEASE

422
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,728
DRINK IT YOURSELF

423
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,997
But you used to love this.

424
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,099
I was going to wet your whistle.

425
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,267
No? Okay.

426
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,535
THE PORTRAIT HAS CLEAR PREFERENCES

427
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,303
Do you want some yukgaejang?

428
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,439
Yukgaejang?

429
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,940
Hye-seon, pour some on him.

430
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,342
On my face? No, thank you.

431
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,111
HE MUST BE FULL NOW

432
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,246
Hang on.

433
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,616
You don't put things like this
in a coffin.

434
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,084
Oh, my goodness!

435
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,418
That was close!

436
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,053
-Oh, my goodness.
-That's no good.

437
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,155
-Let me take a look.
-What do we do about this?

438
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,024
-Let me take a look.
-Oh, my.

439
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,092
My goodness.

440
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,159
Let's see.

441
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,928
-Take this. That was close.
-Yeah.

442
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,730
That was awfully close.

443
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,164
-That's it. I can go now.
-Here.

444
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,733
Here it is, Jin-kyung.

445
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,800
These should go…

446
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,469
Yes, for the kids.

447
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,871
-This is mine now.
-Yeah.

448
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,607
Sae-ho, thanks for all your hard work.

449
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,845
-Are you enjoying the food?
-It's so good.

450
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,346
It may be a funeral,

451
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,449
but Sae-ho used to say,
"As long as it's funny, it's okay."

452
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,285
So we thought Sae-ho would like it

453
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,221
if you all played games
and enjoyed your time at his funeral.

454
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,958
While Sae-ho was alive,
there was a program

455
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,061
where he made a name for himself
and created countless legendary moments

456
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,131
and established his very first peak era.

457
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,699
The Tazza.

458
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,567
You'll play the legendary Tazza game.

459
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,270
-Let's give it a try.
-How do you play that game?

460
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,838
While you play this game,

461
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,741
I think it'll feel like
the late Sae-ho will be with us.

462
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:43,809
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

463
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,378
-That's the feeling I have.
-Sae-ho was so good at that game.

464
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,281
Each one of you will dress yourselves up,
sit across each other closely,

465
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,352
and play against the portrait
to beat the Tazza.

466
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,055
Sae-ho's ex-girlfriend Hye-seon

467
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,256
will be the judge.

468
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,324
Emma!

469
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,693
What should I do?

470
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,763
Sae-ho left behind some belongings

471
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,633
that he really cherished

472
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,369
-during his lifetime.
-Gosh.

473
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,537
My gosh.

474
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,739
Goodness. What's in that orange box?

475
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,208
WHAT DID SAE-HO LEAVE BEHIND?

476
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,647
The trophy we gave him on Screwballs.

477
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,815
The God of Talk trophy.

478
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,450
-The God of Talk.
-The God of Talk.

479
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,186
The New Star award he really won
at the SBS Entertainment Awards.

480
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,590
He was so unlucky when it came to awards.

481
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,891
Screwballs' poster.

482
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,328
I don't know why, but there's a collection
of Na Tae-joo's poetry.

483
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,896
His book of poems.

484
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,031
-Sae-ho was a poet.
-Show-off.

485
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,932
Next,

486
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,635
a drawing of Sae-ho
that was personally drawn by his wife.

487
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,537
She drew it so well.

488
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,974
Lastly, you could say that
he shared every moment with this.

489
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,609
His car key.

490
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,811
CAR KEY!

491
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,347
-His car key?
-Can we win this in a game?

492
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,316
The funniest person in the Tazza game

493
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,251
will be gifted Sae-ho's belongings.

494
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,021
-He included his car?
-Awesome.

495
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,457
We thought that Sae-ho would
want his beloved friends

496
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,593
to have these belongings.

497
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,129
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

498
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,731
I think you would want
the drawing of Sae-ho

499
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,434
and the Screwballs poster the most.

500
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,935
-What?
-What?

501
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,837
-What?
-What did you say we'd want?

502
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,274
Well, things like car keys
aren't all that important, right?

503
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,509
-No, they don't.
-He's right.

504
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,511
What matters is the car itself.

505
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,945
However, since it's already in there,

506
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,814
you'll get it as a bonus.

507
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,249
Man, I want to win this one.

508
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,051
I'm going to do the best I can.

509
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,621
THE LEGEND OF TAZZA
TRY TO BEAT CHO SAE-HO!

510
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,556
Sae-ho is pretty tough.

511
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,525
It has to be something he doesn't expect.

512
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,293
You look ugly, so it's so funny.

513
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,630
Looks like they're preparing
for the open recruitment for comedians.

514
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,764
Now, let's get started.

515
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,166
THE TAZZA BATTLE BEGINS
WITH SAE-HO IN HEAVEN

516
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,475
SCREWBALLS' MAIN COMEDIAN DUO

517
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,745
SOOK AND SAE-HO!

518
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,083
WHO WILL BE THE ONE TO LAUGH
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM?

519
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,350
Ready,

520
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,053
set, go.

521
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,322
MAKING WEIRD NOISES

522
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,858
CALM

523
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,228
I am cool toned.

524
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,530
OH?

525
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,566
Oh, no. My stomach.

526
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,535
My stomach!

527
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,672
COOL-TONED LADY COMPLAINS
ABOUT A STOMACHACHE

528
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,741
My stomach!

529
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:30,809
Is she giving birth?

530
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,878
Right now?

531
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,847
WHAT IS GOING ON?

532
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,248
Yes, my dear.

533
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,283
Who's this cutie?

534
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,885
Yes, my dear.

535

Who's this cutie?

536
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,789
SHE HAD A SAFE DELIVERY

537
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,857

CHO SAE-HO LOSES

542
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,399
I wasn't expecting that.

543
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,736
That's what she prepared?

544
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,805
I think I'll call this scene,

545
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,207

551
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,755
-Was it good?
-It was very good.

552
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,823

-Are they holding it in?
-They are trying.

617
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,991
-They're holding it in.
-No one laughed.

618
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,293
Woo-young's lips are twitching.

619
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,195
-He's slightly smiling.
-They're twitching.

620
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,030

622
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,500
That's it.

It's the rest of the members' turn now.

624
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,571
You may begin your attack.

625
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,407

-Woo-young.

629
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,650
-Woo-young is attacking first.
-He's going first.

630
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,452
I should dry these.

ARMPIT HAIR IN FULL VIEW

632
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,060
Why is it so curly?

633
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,463
He's straightening it.

634
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,732
FLAT IRON ON HIS ARMPIT HAIR

635
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,467
-That's his armpit hair, right?
-Straight hair.

636
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,203
He is doing that to straighten the hair.

637
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,704
It was curly before.

638
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,272
Sae-ho is keeping it together.

639
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,341
-He's slightly smiling.
-Yes, he is.

640
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,311
-That is okay though.
-Yes, it's like level one.

641
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,713
The next one up is Jin-kyung.

642
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,849
She prepared something down there.

643
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,587
JEON SUNGLASSES

644
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:12,391
What is that on her sunglasses?
Is it beef jeon and meat fritters?

645
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,092
He's in danger of laughing.

646
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,695
She brought another pair of sunglasses.

647
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,165
Boiled pork slice sunglasses?

648
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,200
Boiled pork slice sunglasses.

649
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,235
Sae-ho's laughing.

650
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,437
-Hang on. She has one left.
-There's another one.

651
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,341
Is it pepper jeon sunglasses?

652
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,376
-And perilla leaf jeon!
-Perilla leaf jeon.

653
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:36,481

-It was a success.

663
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,305
THEY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING SAE-HO LAUGH

664
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,441
-They did so well.
-These ones were good.

665
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,109
They were good. They were clearly funny.

666

our final goodbyes to Sae-ho

669
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,287
and get going.

670
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,022
-Hello?
-What the heck?

671
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,757
Eun-woo?

672
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,492
Look, didn't I tell you not to call me?

673
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,294
-I have a new boyfriend now.
-Eun-woo?

674
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,929
Don't call me.

675
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,996
Is his last name Cha?

676
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,097
Hey, Cha Eun-woo.

677
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,833
-Cha Eun-woo?
-You deserted?

678
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,034
Hang on.

679
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,368
Wait for me, hot boy!

680
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,471
JUST LIKE THAT, HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND LEAVES

681
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,572

682
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,175

THANK YOU FOR APPEARING

684
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,946
Emma left just as coolly as she came.

685
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:45,717
You just finished
the touching Tazza game with Sae-ho

686
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:49,187
who is probably
pursuing laughter in heaven too.

687
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,924
We will announce
the final winner at the end.

688
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,393
This is the final segment.

689
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,295
We joked around up until now,

690
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,264
but we will now take a minute

691
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,366
to make a silent tribute to Sae-ho
as we think about

692
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,335
-the time we had together.
-We need that.

693
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,438
At least for this segment,
let's try to be sincere…

694
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:07,973
PFFT

695
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,908
…as we close our eyes briefly

696
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,676
-and make a silent tribute…
-Okay.

697
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,744
…to Sae-ho.

698
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,812
Everyone,

699
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,514
a moment of silence.

700
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,751
TAKING A MOMENT OF SILENCE

701
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,053
Pick a number from one to four.

702
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,355
-Number three.
-Number three?

703
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,923
Oh, dear. It's a dud.

704
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,993
SAE-HO ALWAYS TRIED TO MAKE US DRAW LOTS
WHEN THERE WEREN'T ANY

705
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,730
We're doing good. Very good.

706
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:32,964
-We're doing great.
-Good.

707
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,599
SAE-HO AND I ALWAYS HAD
GOOD COMEDIC CHEMISTRY

708
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,839
OUR DEAR SAE-HO WOULD LOSE A GAME
TO GET A LAUGH OUT OF EVERYONE

709
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,641
He did it on purpose!

710
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,048
ALMOST FRIGHTENINGLY, HE SPARED NO EFFORT
FOR THE SAKE OF LAUGHTER

711
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,850
THEY BRIEFLY REMINISCE
THEIR TIME WITH SAE-HO

712
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,752
Please open your eyes now.

713
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,988
-My goodness.
-What the heck?

714
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,124
What the heck?

715
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,126
-It's a real portrait.
-That's too weird.

716
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,829
A PORTRAIT OF A SMILING SAE-HO IS PLACED

717
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,868
WHERE SAE-HO WAS SITTING

718
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,570
Now,

719
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:16,241
there is a last will
that Sae-ho left behind.

720
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,612
Jin-kyung,

721
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,015
can you read it since Sae-ho
trusted you and relied on you a lot?

722
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,083
Of course.

723
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,256
It's long.

724
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,857
It's Sae-ho's handwriting.

725
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,227
SHE CAREFULLY OPENS SAE-HO'S LAST WILL

726
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,530
"Under the moonlight,

727
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,332
I would like to express the gratitude

728
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,469
that I've kept in my heart
for a very long time."

729
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,439
"To the world
that embraced my quiet self."

730
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,408
"To my family
that introduced me to the world."

731
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,278
"To the friends
who hung out with me in this world

732
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,513
and laughed and cried with me."

733
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,651
"And the people around me who
shared laughter and tears with me."

734
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,154
"I want to sincerely thank you,
and because of you, I was happy."

735
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:08,193
"And I will always cherish those memories
while I rest in peace."

736
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,596
"Looking back, I regret not saying
thank you when I was grateful,

737
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,632
sorry when I should have apologized,

738
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,535
and saying more often that I love you
when I had the chance."

739
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,839
"Our awesome Screwballs members."

740
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,242
"Sook, Jin-kyung, Woo-jae, and Woo-young."

741
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,512
"I was truly happy to be able
to have such a good time with you."

742
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,117
"Especially Jin-kyung, thank you so much."

743
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,555
"When I was struggling and exhausted
with how pathetic I looked in the mirror,

744
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,893
you made me shine more than anyone."

745
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,367
"Do you remember the text message
you sent me not long after we first met?"

746
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,303
"'Sae-ho, what's up? Let's hang out.'"

747
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,477
"There must have been so many
more awesome people around you,

748
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,613
so why did she ask to hang out with me?"

749
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,481
"With those questions and with gratitude,

750
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,984
I cautiously asked you the day we met,

751
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,287
'Why did you ask to see me, Jin-kyung?'"

752
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,789
"That's when you said,

753
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,459
'You are a celebrity that
I want to see more than anyone.'"

754
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,028
YOU ARE THE CELEBRITY
THAT I WANT TO SEE MORE THAN ANYONE

755
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,564
"As my self-esteem was at rock-bottom,

756
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,766
I came home that day and cried a little."

757
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,671
"There is someone who
actually acknowledges me."

758
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,642
"Though I may not be
the brightest star in the world,

759
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,644
I was a bright star too."

760
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,481
"And so, I vowed to pick myself up
and keep going."

761
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,884
"Everything you said to me until now,

762
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,686
'Sae-ho, I think you're the funniest.'"

763
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,922
"'You're the best. You're awesome.'"

764
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,391
"'You're going to be more successful.'"

765
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,594
"'Anyone who gets to be with you
must be so happy.'"

766
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,697
-"'What's wrong with Woo-jae?'"
-What?

767
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,100
"'I'm so happy that
you're a good friend of mine.'"

768
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
Why did he add that?

769
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,739
I know. Why did he include that?

770
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,640
-Why did he do that?
-I didn't say that.

771
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,277
-It has nothing to do with the rest.
-You didn't add that, did you?

772
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,079
"Ever word--"

773
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,015
LAUGHING

774
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,884
It isn't "Ever word." It's "Every word."

775
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,822
"Every word you said

776
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,658
gave me so much strength
and I was so thankful."

777
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,461
"You have such a huge presence
in who I am today."

778
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,562
"And Jin-kyung,

779
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,799
don't try to deal with your struggles
on your own and please let me know."

780
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,901
"When you were having a hard time,

781
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,671
I felt disappointed because
I thought, 'She has such a good friend,

782
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,306
why isn't she sharing the load?'"

783
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,912
"Although I am the one leaving you now…

784
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,184
and if it's okay with you,

785
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,653
please take care of my wife
whom I'm leaving behind."

786
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,854
Gosh.

787
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,564
"Producer In-seok, Eun-young,
and the Screwballs crew."

788
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,333
"Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun."

789
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,770
"Give my spot to Nam Chang-hee."

790
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,040
"Chang-hee has really
hit his stride lately."

791
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,811
"Thank you, thank you,
and thank you so much."

792
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,713
"I am so sad
that this is our last goodbye,

793
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,084
but I'll rest with a bright smile,
so don't worry about me."

794
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,521
"May I rest in peace."

795
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,659
"Very nice to meet you."

796
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,360
"Thank you very much."

797
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,671
My goodness, Jin-kyung.

798
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,243
Why did he write such a sad letter?

799
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,979
On a variety show…

800
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,186
When we asked him to write it,
he seemed to have written it sincerely.

801
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,456
May I ask how you feel
after reading his letter?

802
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,962
We're on a variety show, right?

803
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,534
But that portrait is too…

804
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,404
Seeing him there like that…

805
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,442
It felt like a letter he wrote
before he really left us.

806
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,813
And I also realized this is
how Sae-ho must have felt all along.

807
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,883
I should show more love to him
and treat him better.

808
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,952
I didn't realize how precious it was
to have him by my side,

809
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,122
but I was reminded of how happy I was

810
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,924
to have him by my side.

811
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,562
All right. As Jin-kyung said,

812
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,465
we prepared this segment
into a variety show situation.

813
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,033
Are you okay, Woo-jae?

814
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,135
Why are you laughing?

815
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,370
-Hey.
-Hey!

816
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,673
-Someone died. How can you laugh?
-What's wrong with you?

817
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,341
Oh, come on.

818
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,444
-Is he crying?
-Why is he so heartless?

819
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,214
Hey, what's up with you too, Woo-young?

820
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,082
WHAT'S UP WITH WOO-YOUNG?

821
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,718
-Geez.
-They're such lunatics.

822
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,086
You lunatics.

823
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,389
ARE THEY REALLY SCREWBALLS?

824
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,058
Before Woo-jae and Woo-young
get any sadder…

825
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,493
SOBS

826
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,661
…let us now

827
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:13,765
-call the star Sae-ho back.
-Yes.

828
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,667
-Sae-ho.
-Yes.

829
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,601
SAE-HO IS RESURRECTED

830
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,669
Sae-ho.

831
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,437
We cried so much.

832
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,173
Why did you write such a sad letter?

833
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,243
At first, they told me

834
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,178
that they might create
a segment like this.

835
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,847
Since this is a variety show,

836
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:34,686
we talked about making it funny
so we can all have a good laugh.

837
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,555
But someone brought up the idea
of writing a last will,

838
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,824
so I told them that
I'd think about it too.

839
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,194
By taking the time to write this,

840
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,831
I thought I could
look back on the life I led.

841
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,866
From that point,

842
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,103
-the writing came pretty easily.
-I see.

843
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,572
-Really?
-Yeah, as I was writing it,

844
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,909
I realized that I didn't
want to make it sound funny.

845
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,912
I wanted to include my thanks as well.

846
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,815
After Jin-kyung sent me her first message

847
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,050
and when I was on my way to see her,

848
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,619
I wondered why such a huge star

849
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,788
would want to see me?

850
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,024
But she looked at me and said…

851
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,026
Well, Chang-hee was with me too.

852
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,830
She said, "The two of you are
such precious celebrities."

853
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,000
"And you are the celebrities
I want to see. Don't forget that."

854
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,968
When I came home after that,

855
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,703
I was so touched and thankful.

856
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,706
-I'm a bit embarrassed, but I did cry.
-You cried?

857
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,943
What I promised myself at that moment

858
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,446
was to always do

859
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,952
a bit more than
what I can do for Jin-kyung,

860
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,987
so I expressed my thanks to her in that.

861
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,623
When you asked me to
say something nice about Sae-ho,

862
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,326
I jokingly told you that I'd do it later,

863
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,562
but lately, I have been a bit depressed

864
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,465
and have been feeling down.
I was struggling.

865
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,136
Sae-ho saw that
I was feeling a bit depressed

866
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,205
while we were shooting on set,

867
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,876
so he kept on calling me
from that point on.

868
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,446
He called me once the next morning,
twice around lunch time,

869
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,814
and once in the evening.

870
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,083
"What are you doing now, Jin-kyung?"

871
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,087
I felt closer to him than family
because of that.

872
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,657
He has always been
such a thoughtful friend.

873
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,725
THANKFUL FOR THOUGHTFUL SAE-HO

874
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,828
Yeah, the two of you
have such a great friendship.

875
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,765
We did the Cho Sae-ho Show earlier,

876
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,535
but today was truly joyful

877
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,103
because I got to

878
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,473
do something in my own name
that I dreamt about for a long time.

879
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,277
I also thought we could
make people laugh until we die.

880
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:44,382
The time we will have together from now on
will feel even more precious.

881
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,684
That was what today made me feel.

882
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,454
You are really awesome, Sae-ho.

883
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,391
Sae-ho has more depth to him
than we think.

884
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,059
-No.
-And he's very cool.

885
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,595
When we did the speed quiz

886
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,397
on the Cho Sae-ho Show,

887
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,400
we were worried
it might be too much for him.

888
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,671
So Producer In-seok even asked
if we should stop since we did so many.

889
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,206
Let's just do one round.

890
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,074
We can do more. I'm totally okay with it.

891
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,710
He said in a very low voice.

892
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,513
As long as I can make people happy…

893
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,483
He said, "As long as
I can make people happy, I can never…"

894
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,817
-Good job.
-It was nothing.

895
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:20,885
I should thank you.

896
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,920
You let me have a great time.

897
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,189
-I don't know if it was funny though.
-It was so funny.

898
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,257
I'm so glad.

899
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,325
I'M SO GLAD

900
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,393
That's when I realized once again

901
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,362
that he is truly admirable.

902
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,931
Sometimes, he isn't as funny,

903
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,033
but I really saw…

904
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,504
-We learned a lot from him.
-…the very professional side of him today.

905
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:44,475
To be honest, it would not have been
easy to offer his car key as a prize.

906
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,010
-Yeah.
-So…

907
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,713
-He gave his everything.
-We expressed our gratitude,

908
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,348
we expressed how touched we were…

909
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,216
-The car key is the car key.
-Yes.

910
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,885
His belongings including his car key

911
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:57,822
will be given to Jin-kyung
who gave the biggest laugh to the Tazza.

912
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,459
JIN-KYUNG ACQUIRES HIS BELONGINGS

913
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,861
Let me make this clear.

914
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,164
Only the car key is the gift.

915
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,866
NOT LISTENING

916
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,935
I've never ridden it before.

917
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,236
Me neither.

918
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,240
-I've never driven one.
-I've never had a ride in it.

919
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,043
You know, your wife draws…

920
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,078
-very well.
-She draws so well.

921
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,581
-She drew it?
-I'm so thankful.

922
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,683
She wanted to give me this as a present

923
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,052
for our one year anniversary,

924
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,420
so this is very precious to me.

925
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,056
-Gosh.
-Are you sure I can have it?

926
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,592
-It's a gift.
-Are you taking it?

927
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,294
-I'm going to take it.
-This?

928
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,663
No, you can't. Sell it back to me.

929
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,464
-What about the key?
-What about this?

930
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,532
That should be returned.

931
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,600
-To whom?
-The key?

932
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,668
Me.

933
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,536
-What the heck?
-Look.

934
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,638
I wasn't told that
I had to give them away.

935
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,040
What about these gifts?

936
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,108
That's a book of poems
and the Screwballs' po…

937
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,077
-What?
-Po, what?

938
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,345
The poster for Screwballs.

939
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,713
The poster.

940
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,616
You all did such a wonderful job today.
Thank you.

941
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,651
-Thank you.
-Good job, everyone!

942
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,254
Screwballs is such an awesome team.

943
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,259
On the next episode of Screwballs.

944
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,195
A new sun is rising!

945
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,830
One person isn't well,

946
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,665
but we wish you a happy new year.

947
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,534
You can wash yourselves for the new year.

948
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,437
We're okay, but we don't
want these guys to get the wrong idea.

949
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,638
GET THE WRONG IDEA?

950
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,039
Get your mind out of the gutter.

951
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,107
Us?

952
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,343
-Us?
-I'm still worried.

953
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,644
I'M OKAY WITH IT

954
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,312
We're an asexual variety show.

955
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,947
I've never been to the men's bath.

956
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,216
-Wash up now?
-How much are we washing up?

957
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,618
The Group Deconstruction Show.

958
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,219
You'll go into the bath

959
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,687
and lay bare your true self.

960
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,057
DIG INTO THE SCREWBALLS' TRUE SELVES

961
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,126
It's Netflix,
but can we show our dead skin cells?

962
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,494
I see dead skin cells.

963
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,229
I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO DIG THIS DEEP

964
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,297
I already told you that

965
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,832
-you'd see dead skin cells.
-Lie down.

966
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,634
Come on! Are you crazy?

967
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,701
Oh, no.

968
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,570
This is really a deconstruction show.

969
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,339
Bare yourself
and find your personal color.

970
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,407
It doesn't suit you.

971
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,908
ISN'T THIS PRETTY?

972
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,644
It's the worst.

973
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,945
THE WORST

974
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,213
Shall we try vivid colors?

975
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,648
What the heck?

976
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,049
Can she criticize me like that?

977
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,350
WE THOUGHT
THEY'D GET ALONG IN THE NEW YEAR

978
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,418
No.

979
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,186
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT COLOR

980
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,254
Let's measure your chest.

981
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,922
Why?

982
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:12,890
My eyes!

983
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,091
Your chest is size M.

984
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,293
Your stomach is size XL.

985
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,427
My stomach is XL?

986
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,361
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

987
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,830
She's saying my chest is small
and my belly is big.

988
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:20,931
I quit!

989
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,900
I quit this segment.

990
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,635
CAN THE SCREWBALLS DECONSTRUCTION SHOW
END WELL?

991
