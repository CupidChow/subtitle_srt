00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,205
BLACK

00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,173
BLACK COFFEE

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,441

00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,044
BLACK PINK

00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,881
AND BLACK

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:20,353
BLACK SCREWBALLS

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,621
PFFT

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,089
Let us go now.

11
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:29,396
TYPICALLY, WHEN SOMETHING
STARTS WITH BLACK IT LOOKS COOL…

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,197
What exactly are you, Jin-kyung?

13
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,499
-What?
-What are you?

14
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,501
-The Grim Reaper.
-I'm Saja Boys.

15
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,869
We're different.

16
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,337
THE MOST POPULAR GRIM REAPER RECENTLY

17
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,238
You know…

18
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,006
You look hip.

19
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,641
That's kind of hip.

20
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,510
HOW THIS FOR GEN MZ GRIM REAPER?

21
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,780
Jin-kyung, for any viewer
who hasn't seen it yet,

22
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,948
-can you explain who the Saja Boys are?
-Yeah.

23
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,784
Explain who the Saja Boys are.

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,552
There's this cartoon movie.

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,486
Yes, a cartoon.

26
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,654
Hunters.

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,823
I haven't heard the words
"cartoon movie" in ages.

28
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,727
People usually call it an animation.

29
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,695
I haven't heard "cartoon movies" in ages.

30
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,130
Taoist Meoteol was fun.

31
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,199
Guru Radish and Guru Cabbage were in it.

32
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,601
Taoist Meoteol and
Guru Radish and Guru Cabbage

33
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,103
are from different worlds.

34
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,104
-Really?
-Yes.

35
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,605
-It's okay.
-Yeah, sure.

36
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,740
Do you know Bumpety Boo?

37
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,974
They're from the same period.

38
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,942
HA!

39
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,747
SAE-HO'S HERE

40
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,348
Wow.

41
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,019
WE TOLD HIM TODAY'S DRESS CODE IS BLACK

42
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,488
WHO ARE YOU?

43
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,689
What are you supposed to be?

44
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,790
What?

45
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,859
LOOKS VAGUELY FAMILIAR

46
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,594
What the heck? Who are you?

47
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,662
I don't have a clue.

48
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,696
How can you not know?

49
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,231
-Jack Black.
-Yeah, Jack Black.

50
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,401
WHEN YOU THINK OF BLACK,
IT'S JACK BLACK

51
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,270
After I heard that
the dress code was black,

52
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,306
my manager said,

53
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,675
"Don't you like Jack Black?"
So I thought, "Yeah!"

54
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,176
Jack Black.

55
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,414
That's precisely what we predicted.
When my stylist and I heard it was black,

56
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,149
we said, "Sae-ho will be Jack Black."

57
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,351
That is exactly what we said.

58
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,653
I was surprised
when he actually showed up as him.

59
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,255
Before I went on a diet,

60
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,225
my figure was similar to his,

61
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,894
so when I heard it was black,
I chose Jack Black.

62
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,765
-Are you done?
-Well…

63
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,267
-Are you done now?
-Yes.

64
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,436
-I am done.
-Are you? Okay. Good.

65
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,005
But you're a comedian.
You should look funnier.

66
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,773
-No.
-Put your arm on his shoulder.

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,509
-I'll stay here.
-Come with us.

68
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,676
Oh, no!

69
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:25,879
-It's time to go.
-What?

70
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,247
WHILE THE GRIM REAPERS TRY TO LURE HIM IN

71
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,215
AN UNIDENTIFIED ORGANISM SHOWED UP

72
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,651
Man, that suits her so perfectly.

73
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,520
It's so perfect.

74
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,654
KAONASOOK

75
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,923
Do you get paid more, Sook?

76
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,424
HEH

77
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,826
-What is this?
-It's so perfect.

78
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,127
SHUT UP AND EAT CHOCOLATE

79
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:45,231
If I see someone like that in my dream,
I think I might faint.

80
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,667
This thing doesn't talk, does it?

81
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,169
UMM…

82
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,638
AN UNCOMFORTABLE REGRESSION
IN HER SPEAKING ABILITY

83
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,806
TAP TAP

84
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,809
THE HUNTER ASKS HER TO JOIN HIM SOMEWHERE

85
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,378
To the afterlife.

86
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,779
LET'S GO TO THE AFTERLIFE TOGETHER

87
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,949
Wow!

88
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,819
-What is that?
-What is he supposed to be?

89
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,321
-Geez.
-Gosh.

90
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,656
HELLO

91
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,590
What is he?

92
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,359
LOOKS LIKE A BURNT-UP MATCH

93
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,494
What is his concept?

94
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,564
THE BLACK OBJECT SNEAKS UP TO WOO-JAE

95
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,566
-He must be a shadow.
-A shadow.

96
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,134
-He's Woo-jae's shadow.
-He's a shadow.

97
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,635
-Woo-jae's shadow.
-Lie on the floor.

98
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,771
-He's Woo-jae's shadow.
-Lie on the floor.

99
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,042
SHADOW WOO HAS GOOD REFLEXES

100
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,681
SHADOW WOO WAS ONCE A GOOD DANCER

101
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,416
-Hand.
-Copy me.

102
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,417
LOOK OVER THERE, MR. SHADOW

103
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,352
-Honey.
-Honey.

104
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,820
Wait for me at home.

105
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,355
Wait for me… Darn it.

106
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,324
It's Sae-ho now.

107
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,193
THE OFFENDED SHADOW
LOOKS FOR ANOTHER OWNER

108
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,699
THE SECOND FIGURE'S GESTURES
ARE RATHER BIG

109
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,367
Wow. He's good.

110
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,336
-He's good.
-Yeah, he's good.

111
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,471
He was always popular but…

112
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,405
What is he doing?

113
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,306
He's your shadow.

114
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,241
Try moving, Jin-kyung.

115
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,443
Hey, Woo-young is working hard.

116
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,178
BEING A SHADOW SUITS HIM WELL

117
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,579
-He does look like a shadow.
-Yeah.

118
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,015
HIS MOST SATISFACTORY COSTUME YET

119
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,216
He's good.

120
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,852
No one can tell that it's Woo-young.

121
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,056
Let's start with revealing today's star
of Screwballs Deconstruction Show.

122
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,491
There's someone who's wearing

123
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,993
-a different color.
-You're right.

124
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,361
THE ONE PERSON
WHO'S WEARING A DIFFERENT COLOR

125
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,062
-He stands out too much.
-It's you?

126
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,330
Were you aiming for that?

127
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,598
No, not at all.

128
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,201
The star for today's
Screwballs Deconstruction Show.

129
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,603
They don't spare themselves
when it comes to being funny.

130
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,638
The born-to-be comedian.

131
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,742
They have an irresistible charm
that stands out no matter where they are.

132
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,143
That's Sook.

133
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,845
-It's you.
-Today's star is

134
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,179
-Kim Sook…
-Yes.

135
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,414
What?

136
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,283
For real?

137
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,052
It's the person that Sook loves.
Cho Sae-ho.

138
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,887
THE 4TH STAR OF DECONSTRUCTION SHOW
IS CHO SAE-HO

139
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,124
-Cho Sae-ho!
-Cho Sae-ho!

140
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,058
Cho Sae-ho!

141
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,226
The Deconstruction Show

142
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,829
feels like we're taking turns
throwing each other birthday parties.

143
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,164
TODAY'S BIRTHDAY IS THIS GUY

144
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,099
Since Sae-ho is the star,

145
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,169
we gave you "black" as the dress code.

146
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,772
But why is it black when I'm the star?

147
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,840
Isn't black your favorite color?

148
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,977
-Me?
-He likes bold colors.

149
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,345
I like sky blue.

150
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,347
I'm the one who likes black.

151
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,816
-You got it all wrong.
-AMOUPRE is all sky blue.

152
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,018
-Yeah.
-Yeah, our main color is sky blue.

153
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,453
Black because of his dark future?

154
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,088
-No.
-Then, what?

155
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,556
-There's nothing on his script.
-Yeah.

156
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,325
-No, it's okay.
-I'm sure of it.

157
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,026
-He's reading a blank page.
-Yeah.

158
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,128
Then, what about this?

159
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,998
If you mix all the colors together,
it becomes black, right?

160
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,200
-You embrace all the colors.
-Good save.

161
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,969
-That's why you are the most colorful.
-Thank you.

162
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,871
-Doesn't it just become muddy?
-It does.

163
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,140
-Usually it becomes poop color.
-Yeah.

164
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,010
-We think Sae-ho is someone like that.
-Thank you.

165
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,178
ANYWAY, SAE-HO IS SOMEONE LIKE THAT

166
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,482
THE REASON FOR THE DRESS CODE BEING BLACK
WILL BE REVEALED SHORTLY

167
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,853
All right. Let's get into
Sae-ho's Deconstruction Show now.

168
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,122
If you were a celebrity,

169
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,423
especially if you were

170
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,325
a comedian and a host,

171
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:04,097
you would have dreamed of this segment.

172
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,998
-Dreamed of it?
-What could it be?

173
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,234
A solo talk show bearing your own name.

174
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,670
SOLO TALK SHOW BEARING ONE'S OWN NAME

175
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,372
-That's really a gift.
-How nice.

176
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,440
-This is Sae-ho's dream.
-I bet you'd be so good.

177
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,675
Today?

178
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,544
-You'll be the host of your own talk show.
-Sae-ho.

179
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,213
It's called the Cho Sae-ho Show.

180
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,248
THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

181
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,916
-It suits him.
-It sounds good.

182
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,719
-I think he's going to break down.
-Gosh.

183
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,888
With those four words,
The Cho Sae-ho Show,

184
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,456
my body got so stiff.

185
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,328
With 25 years of experience on TV,
the host Cho Sae-ho

186
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,196
will be entrusted with hosting all of it.

187
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,131
To me?

188
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,665
Sounds like a punishment.

189
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,901
The staff will stay out of it.

190
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,070
Will you be okay?

191
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,538
He's the solo host

192
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,540
-but there's no staff either?
-Exactly.

193
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,674
It's truly a solo show.

194
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,976
He's totally solo.

195
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,110
Isn't that just a wreck?

196
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,413
Yeah, that's not right.

197
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,548
Why are you burdening me like this?

198
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,317
I've learned in life that
there are things that suit us.

199
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,986
I know exactly what suits me.

200
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,621
I can do it with your help,

201
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,590
but as time goes by, you'll criticize me

202
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,225
-and do things like that.
-No.

203
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,661
If it's too much for you,
would you like to do it next time?

204
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,096
WOULD YOU RATHER DO IT NEXT TIME?

205
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,798
You already brought it up so let's do it.

206
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,234
You already prepared it
so it would be wrong to do it next time.

207
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,738
-Okay.
-Sae-ho, you will be the host

208
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,674
-and the rest will be guests…
-Guests.

209
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,444
…to make The Cho Sae-ho Show work.

210
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,446
Let me ask you, Sae-ho.

211
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,282
How is it different
from previous talk shows?

212
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,484
Previous talk shows run smoothly,

213
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,486
-but mine will be--
-Kind of rough?

214
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,921
It'll be rough.

215
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:39,058
Most famous hosts of talk shows

216
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,228
have very clear diction.

217
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,030
Mine will be crumbling diction.

218
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,265
-That's new.
-Because of that

219
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,633
viewers have to listen carefully.

220
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,602
-That's new.
-That's the kind of show it'll be.

221
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,604
There's a beauty in nervousness.

222
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,473
A little bit of clumsiness

223
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,441
and inappropriate choice of words.

224
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,543
I exceed others in one area,

225
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,412
and it is that I don't speak coherently.

226
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,348
-That's fresh.
-This is good. Keep this up.

227
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,051
Then, today's Cho Sae-ho Show

228
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,187
-will include some games.
-Okay.

229
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,122
It'll be an individual match.

230
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,860
The person who accumulates the most points

231
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,096
will receive an awesome present
that befits Sae-ho's class.

232
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,099
Sae-ho likes luxury brands.

233
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,201
We rarely do this on Screwballs,

234
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,070
but we prepared cue cards.

235
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,339
PRESENTING CUE CARDS
FOR THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

236
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,041
Sae-ho.

237
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,011
-This is too easy for you.
-Oh, man!

238
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,546
There's so many.

239
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,847
It starts with the opening…

240
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,216
-My gosh.
-"Wrapping up."

241
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,986
SO BEWILDERED

242
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,989
Since he's an excellent host,
I'd like to see this.

243
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,824
Without cue cards…

244
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,659
-I can do it.
-…can you do a monologue…

245
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,994
-I can--
-…for over three minutes?

246
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,029
I don't actually need cue cards.

247
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,030
Of course.

248
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,999
-Show us.
-Of course.

249
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,166
Here I go.

250
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,402
Very nice to meet you.
Thank you very much.

251
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,503
VNTMY TYVM!

252
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,105
I'm Cho Sae-ho

253
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,606
and I'm greeting you

254
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,341
from a show called the Cho Sae-ho Show.

255
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,709
Nice to meet you!

256
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,111
LIVE WITHOUT A SCRIPT

257
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,847
You are watching this show on…

258
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,050
I think I will be greeting
everyone around the world

259
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,052
by means of subtitles.

260
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,154
First of all,
from those watching from Japan!

261
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,989
Konnichiwa!

262
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,824
And America…

263
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,230
And China, dajia hao!

264
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,232
Come to the Cho Sae-ho Show

265
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,302
where you can be with people
from around the world!

266
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,339
Netflix mustered up the courage
to launch the solo talk show

267
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,509
the Cho Sae-ho Show, so let us begin.

268
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
From now on, without a script,

269
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,513
I will ad-lib

270
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,015
to fill every moment of this show.

271
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,117
Then, before we begin the show,

272
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,454
let me introduce the first guests

273
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,389
on Today's Cho Sae-ho Show.

274
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,624
Give them a big hand.

275
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,460
Joo Woo-jae, Kim Sook,
Hong Jin-kyung, Jang Woo-young!

276
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,062
LIVE WITHOUT A SCRIPT

277
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,531
The Cho Sae-ho Show! Wow!

278
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,801
Well done.

279
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,170
You did it. That was a great opening.

280
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,571
-Like this.
-Great opening.

281
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,407
-That's way better than this opening.
-His hands are cold.

282
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:15,081
I'd be grateful if you can warm up
my cold hands with your warmth.

283
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:20,920
TODAY MAY BE THE LAST TIME
FOR THIS SEGMENT

284
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,860
A SPECIAL SHOW THAT YOU CAN
ONLY WATCH ON SCREWBALLS

285
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,097
Once again, very nice to meet you.

286
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,099
Thank you very much.

287
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,533
It may be a bit clumsy,

288
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,469
but it's the most
boisterous show in the world.

289
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,271
The Cho Sae-ho Show will now begin!

290
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,240
THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

291
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,542
The Cho Sae-ho Show has launched

292
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,012
for the first time on Netflix.

293
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,448
Today may be the first episode
and the last episode,

294
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,283
but I'll never forget being grateful

295
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,120
and do my best to host today's show
in an enjoyable way.

296
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,523
So for the first guests
of the Cho Sae-ho Show

297
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,558
are the close friends of Sae-ho

298
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,761
who came to congratulate me.

299
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,462
Welcome, everyone.

300
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,930
WOO-JAE, WOO-YOUNG, SOOK, JIN-KYUNG

301
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,401
The members who are on Screwballs
with me have come today.

302
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,504
Can each one of you
say hello to the viewers?

303
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,773
-I'm Joo Woo-jae.
-Okay.

304
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,207
THE END

305
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,475
I'M SHADOW WOO

306
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,810
He's a shadow so he can't speak.

307
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,046
Let's move on to you. Introduce yourself.

308
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,848
-Hello, I'm Hong Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

309
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,684
Hello. Yes.

310
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,018
I'm Kim Sook.

311
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,553
Yes, welcome!

312
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,422
THANKFULLY THE GREETING
ENDED WITHOUT A HITCH

313
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,257
You all must've been pretty shocked

314
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,593
to hear about the Cho Sae-ho Show.
It must have seemed awkward.

315
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,430
I am curious to hear how you felt

316
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,999
after hearing about
the launch of this show.

317
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,600
-I was happy.
-Okay.

318
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,735
Thank you.

319
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,969
THANKFUL EVEN FOR HALF-HEARTED RESPONSES

320
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,639
What more do you need?

321
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,040
-He said he was happy.
-Of course.

322
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,809
I wonder how you feel, Sae-ho.

323
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,177
-About what?
-First talk show.

324
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,045
I don't know why we're doing this.

325
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,782
I actually think it is too soon.

326
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,718
But you've been doing this for 25 years.

327
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,920
I know exactly what I am capable of.

328
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:01,854
Come on.

329
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,789
There are things I can do and can't do.

330
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,291
But it has been 25 years.

331
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,860
Even though it has been 25 years,

332
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,830
I think I'm still lacking in so many ways…

333
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,499
-Come on.
-…so I hope you'll help me out.

334
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,169
Yes, that was our opening with you all.

335
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,271
Now, shall we begin the first segment…

336
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,206
I'm so excited.

337
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,942
…of the Cho Sae-ho Show?

338
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:27,279
There is something that
I started saying at some point.

339
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,217
-"I'm not kidding."
-That's right.

340
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,452
-You know that very well, right?
-It's so famous.

341
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,854
I'm not kidding.

342
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,689
You see, I'm not kidding but…

343
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,491
I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.

344
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,426
I'm not kidding. Gosh, I'm not kidding.

345
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,261
You know, I'm not kidding at all.

346
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,562
I don't kid around.

347
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,166
The reason why I started saying
"I'm not kidding" before I start talking

348
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,802
is because I want to make all of you laugh

349
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,973
and I want to show you a good time.

350
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,041
So I'd add a bit of exaggeration,

351
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,045
and I'd also tell someone else's story
as if it were my own.

352
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,648
That's why I prepared this segment.

353
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,316
It's called Cho Sae-ho's Talk Box.

354
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,887
Is it true or fake?

355
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,357
HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB OF HOSTING

356
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,025
Listen carefully.

357
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,127
From now on, I, Cho Sae-ho,

358
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,963
will tell you a variety of episodes.

359
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,565
After you hear these stories,

360
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,769
you have to guess
whether it is true or false.

361
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,371
Could they all be false?

362
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,639
They could all be false…

363
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,674
-Or all be true?
-…or they could all be true.

364
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,743
-Only two can be true.
-Okay.

365
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,912
Despite that, I am going to

366
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,446
do my very best

367
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,615
to tell you my stories.

368
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,286
From now on, you may guess
whether it's true or false.

369
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,822
Here is the first story.

370
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,357
-Sounds fun.
-This story

371
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,061
goes back to the year 2001
when I became a comedian.

372
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,965
One day, we had to prepare a sketch,

373
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,501
so there was Kyung-wook, me,

374
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,103
-a writer we were working with…
-Oh, Kyung-wook.

375
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,073
…and an assistant director
who accompanied us.

376
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,042
-We came up with an idea together.
-I see.

377
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,810
We'd stay up all night for it.

378
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,445
-Yes.
-But one day,

379
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,514
-we decided to…
-Get a drink?

380
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,483
…get a drink
and relieve some of this stress.

381
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,285
-So…
-That sounds so good.

382
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,355
I think that's the first time
I actually blacked out.

383
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,057
You blacked out?

384
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,826
There was the disappointment
from our sketch,

385
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,828
things weren't going well overall,

386
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,331
and the writer was a newbie too.

387
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,633
So we drank so much
as we were talking about

388
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,301
-who had it worse.
-Okay.

389
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,604
As we were drinking, it got very late,

390
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,805
-so we had to go home.
-Yes.

391
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,206
We all decided to take a taxi,

392
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,743
but everyone else couldn't
even walk straight.

393
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,011
Oh, no.

394
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,680
In my drunk condition,

395
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,450
I got them in the car one by one.

396
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,919
I got them in a car one after another.

397
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:47,920
Then, I got in one too.

398
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,957
After I got in the taxi, I asked
the driver to take me to Gangseo-gu

399
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,759
-as I was living there then.
-Okay.

400
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,427
After saying that, I fell asleep.

401
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,562
HE PASSED OUT AFTER GETTING IN THE TAXI

402
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,797
Then, I woke up.

403
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,534
But it felt like I slept
for about an hour and 20 minutes.

404
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,003
-I slept a lot.
-You slept a lot.

405
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,904
It was a lot.

406
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,172
It was more than enough time
to get to Gangseo-gu.

407
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,208
-So what on earth happened?
-It was late too.

408
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,343
I was so shocked.
I should have woken up sooner.

409
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,511
-Feels strange.
-Seriously.

410
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,879
I'm not kidding.

411
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,382
There were phone booths
everywhere back then, right?

412
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,951
I was sleeping inside a phone booth.

413
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,886
UNEXPECTED NAP SPOT

414
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,822
Kyung-wook was in front of me.

415
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,392
In front of him was the writer.

416
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,627
But I couldn't find
the assistant director.

417
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,763
-Where was he?
-He left after coming to his senses.

418
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,331
THE 3 BROTHERS
WHO FELL ASLEEP IN PHONE BOOTHS

419
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,400
-This sounds real.
-Why does this sound real?

420
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,001
I think this is false.

421
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,369
-False?
-Because

422
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,605
that could have actually happened

423
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,273
and it may have aired on TV as well.

424
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,475
But I think he is telling it
as if it's his own story.

425
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,277
You think it's fake, Jin-kyung?

426
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,079
I think it's false that it is his story.

427
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,281
Then, I think he is telling the truth.

428
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,551
You see, I'm not kidding, everyone.

429
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,552
"I'm not kidding."

430
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,120
In the past 25 years,

431
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,456
so many crazy things have happened.

432
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,325
-You see--
-I was so shocked back then.

433
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,327
-Geez. Let the guest speak!
-Okay.

434
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,629
-What kind of host does this?
-My bad.

435
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,130
You have to guess. Okay.

436
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,165
Woo-jae's time!

437
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,801
If it far surpasses the creative line,

438
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,235
it could actually be true.

439
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,038
The fact that they slept
in those separate phone booths

440
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,206
makes me think it's real.

441
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,775
I'm saying that it is
someone else's true story.

442
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,111
-You're saying it isn't Sae-ho's story.
-Yes.

443
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,512
It isn't his own story.

444
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,780
I think it's true,

445
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,849
but I think he made it sound like his own.

446
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,751
Tell us another one.

447
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,319
-What?
-Tell me another one.

448
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,823
No, you have to guess
whether it's true or false.

449
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,891
I think it's fake.

450
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,527
I think that there's
a high chance this story is true.

451
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,397
When Sae-ho makes up a story,

452
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,367
I think he becomes much more talkative.

453
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,901
This doesn't sound made up.

454
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,271
Also, from the way Sae-ho was talking,

455
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,541
he sounded like
he desperately wanted us to believe him.

456
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,377
-You felt that?
-Yes, I did.

457
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,947
All right. Then, Sae-ho's

458
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,050
"I was in a phone booth
when I opened my eyes" story.

459
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,053
If you think that story is true,
raise your hand.

460
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,389
-It's true.
-Woo-jae.

461
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,025
Last chance. One,

462
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,292
-two…
-Just trust me.

463
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,461
Right. I'm his shadow.

464
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,830
One, two, three.

465
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,068
Two people think it's true
and two people think it's false.

466
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,070
To make this up…

467
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,538
How could I make it up?

468
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,506
Three booths?

469
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,075
I'm saying that it's someone else's truth.

470
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,512
-Here's the answer to the first story.
-I'm so curious.

471
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,380
That story

472
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,683
actually happened.

473
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,085
I KNEW IT!

474
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,720
I told the story

475
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,991
of the writer who I worked with
on that sketch.

476
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,926
-It's false!
-Yeah!

477
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,761
-It was false.
-I knew it.

478
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,264
GOSH, THAT WAS FALSE

479
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,199
How could he do that?

480
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,768
How long are we going to do
this talk show?

481
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,370
Next up is a story

482
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,106
-from when I was in middle school.
-In middle school.

483
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,274
Let me share that story.

484
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,276
By the way, I wore a uniform back then.

485
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,411
-That was usually the case.
-Gyeongseo Middle School.

486
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,081
Back then,
our mothers would do house chores

487
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,551
-after we went to school, right?
-Yes.

488
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,853
That day was no different.

489
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,155
Me, my sister, and my dad left

490
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,624
and mom was at home
on a very hot summer day.

491
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,462
It happened to be the day that
Mom thought she should wash our uniforms.

492
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,696
-You know.
-Yeah.

493
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,867
Mom thought of washing our school uniforms
but it was hot that day.

494
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,704
Back then, we used to put
the washing machines in the bathroom.

495
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,705
-Right?
-Yeah.

496
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,342
She thought she could wash our uniforms
while she bathed.

497
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,111
That was her plan.

498
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,615
But I happened to bring my friends
over to our house

499
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,117
because we had a game console.

500
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,151
-I see.
-Play Station.

501
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,420
But when my mom
sensed someone in the house,

502
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,722
she knew she had to leave the bathroom,

503
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,924
but she didn't have any clothes to wear.

504
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,959
Oh, no.

505
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,360
She washed her clothes too?

506
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,661
When she went to bathe,

507
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,531
she went about it comfortably
since she was home alone.

508
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,700
But because we were in the living room

509
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,201
and she could hear noises,

510
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,171
she showed resourcefulness in her own way.

511
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,639
I was so surprised.

512
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,674
She came out of the bathroom

513
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,344
wearing a wet school uniform.

514
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,012
Your wet school uniform?

515
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,115
-I'm serious. She was wearing my uniform.
-Your uniform?

516
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,485
As you may know, my mom is quite spirited.

517
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,888
She didn't look embarrassed whatsoever.

518
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,924
She said, "Welcome. Have fun, kids."
And went straight to her room.

519
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,093
We saw her, right?

520
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,862
-There was water dripping down.
-Of course.

521
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,633
THE YOUNGER BROTHERS
DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT

522
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,967
That's hilarious.

523
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,869
Will your mother
reveal the truth this time?

524
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,771
I'll make a call to my mother.

525
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,241
-Okay.
-But whenever I go home, we talk about it.

526
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,743
-This one sounds real.
-Yeah.

527
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,912
The other one was funnier.
Tell us another story.

528
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,880
-No, you have to--
-That's not how you do this.

529
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,050
We have to figure out
whether it's true or false, Woo-young.

530
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,852
This time as well,

531
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,688
I choose the truth.

532
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:53,525
If you think this story is true,
raise your hand.

533
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,930
Very good. This one's for real.

534
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,364
You can count on me.

535
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,967
-Anybody else?
-But to bring up your mom…

536
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,802
Sook and Woo-jae think it's true.

537
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,004
Jin-kyung and Woo-young think it's false.

538
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,074
I know it's your own talk show,
but how could you

539
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,143
-tell your mom's story.
-Yeah.

540
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,678
All right.

541
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,646
I'll call my mom.

542
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,281
Sae-ho.

543
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,251
-Hello.
-Mom.

544
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,653
Sebastian, did you eat dinner?

545
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,088
Yes, I ate dinner

546
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,324
-and I'm shooting Screwballs now.
-Okay.

547
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,391
Are you?

548
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,660
If you're okay to talk,
can I ask you something?

549
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,129
You can answer freely, okay?

550
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,164
Okay.

551
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,801
Hello, ma'am. I'm Joo Woo-jae,
the fourth member of Screwballs.

552
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,336
Yes, Woo-jae. Hello.

553
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,004
Nice to meet you. Are you doing well?

554
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,706
Yes, I'm doing well.

555
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,242
-There was something I wanted to ask you.
-Okay.

556
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,643
-You know…
-Yes?

557
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,314
-…when Sae-ho was in middle school…
-Yes?

558
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,250
This feels awkward to ask.

559
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,156
While you were hand washing
Sae-ho's school uniform in the bathroom

560
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,492
and you were going to take a shower,

561
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,329
but Sae-ho and his friends
were in the living room,

562
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,131
-so did you have to--
-Did I…

563
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,466
The wet uniform.

564
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,668
Did you come out of the bathroom
wearing his wet uniform

565
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,004
and greet his friends nonchalantly,

566
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,405
"Okay, have fun, kids."

567
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,041
My goodness. What a ridiculous story!
Why would I do that?

568
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,776
What a ridiculous story!

569
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,413
WHY WOULD I COME OUT WEARING A UNIFORM?!

570
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,749
That is absolute nonsense.

571
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,351
How could you say such a thing?

572
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,355
-Why would I do such a thing?
-Are you for real?

573
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,990
-How could you?
-Geez.

574
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,792
-Ma'am.
-Hello.

575
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,127
-Geez.
-Mom?

576
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,729
Why would I… How could I…

577
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
Why would I come out

578
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,632
-wearing your uniform?
-She's all worked up.

579
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,700
I can't hear you well.

580
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,170
What the heck are you telling people?

581
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,972
I must have gotten the stories mixed up.

582
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,840
How could you get that mixed up?

583
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:52,210
That's right! It wasn't about you.
I heard it from someone else.

584
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,212
My gosh. Whatever.

585
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,181
-Anything to say--
-Don't go telling lies.

586
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,283
-That story is too preposterous.
-What?

587
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,985
Don't go around telling lies.

588
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,421
-That's too preposterous.
-All right.

589
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,256
We were playing a true or false game.

590
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,957
-Thank you. I'll call you back.
-Gosh.

591
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,060
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Take care.

592
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,094
Bye.

593
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,562
That was awesome!

594
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,131
-Geez.
-You're a genius, Sae-ho!

595
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,166
That story was false!

596
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:19,571
The reason why I chose truth
was because I thought,

597
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,606
-"It's his mom."
-Yeah.

598
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,674
-I know!
-Listen.

599
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,044
If you lie about your own mom…

600
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,281
-You're unbelievable.
-This segment is to distinguish--

601
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,217
-You definitely have Ripley Syndrome.
-No.

602
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,519
I do not have Ripley Syndrome.

603
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,488
I don't want viewers
to get the wrong idea.

604
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,156
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STORY

605
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,159
-Woo-young and Jin-kyung get one point.
-Okay.

606
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,662
-Both stories were false.
-The fourth story.

607
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,330
I think they're all false.

608
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,965
My mother appears in this.

609
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,200
Again?

610
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,768
-Again?
-She appears again?

611
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,870
-What if she scolds us again?
-My mom…

612
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,772
There was a show
called Comedy Talk League,

613
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,908
which was a spin-off of Comedy Big League
when it was on hiatus.

614
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,009
It was a talk show.

615
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,244
-Right.
-Well,

616
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,146
the comedians would bring their moms

617
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,581
and shoot the show together.

618
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,516
-Yes.
-So we did our talking.

619
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,686
-I had to do whatever I could to survive.
-Yeah.

620
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,889
Comedian Kim Ki-wook
showed up with his mother

621
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,625
and we were supposed to
have a conversation about family.

622
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,861
So Ki-wook said, "I'll go."

623
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,295
"I have a brother."

624
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,998
And he told a very funny story
about his brother.

625
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,666
-Did he?
-And I didn't want to lose.

626
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,935
So I said, "Hang on a minute."

627
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,571
"I have a brother too." I said that.

628
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,106
But Mom said,

629
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,143
"Hey, what are you doing right now?"

630
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,677
"You don't have a brother."

631
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,312
"You don't have a brother."

632
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,480
But you don't.

633
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:37,883
False.

634
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,719
Why?

635
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,021
-Hear me out.
-Okay.

636
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,224
So Dong-yeob said,
"Wait, do you not have a brother?"

637
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,626
"But you said you have a brother?"

638
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,728
-But Dong-yeob loved that.
-Of course.

639
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,663
He liked that I made up a brother.

640
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,498
So after filming the show,
Mom came up to me

641
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,535
and said, "Sebastian, I really hope

642
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,406
you will become successful,
but I don't want you to lie like this."

643
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,608
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

644
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,644
That was the story
about my mom getting upset.

645
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,878
AN EPISODE OF MOM'S DISCIPLINE

646
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,581
-So you told them that you had a brother?
-Yeah.

647
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,550
TRUE

648
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,717
This one sounds true.

649
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,085
I think it's false.

650
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,788
-Shall I call her?
-Are you calling her again?

651
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:17,856
Let's call my mom.

652
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,125
I think she'll scold us again.

653
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,693
"Sebastian."

654
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,994
CALLING HIS MOM AGAIN

655
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,897
-Hello.
-Sorry to call you when you're busy.

656
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,200
-Okay.
-You were mentioned in another story.

657
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,836
Can you confirm
whether this one is true or false?

658
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,437
-Okay.
-Let's hear it.

659
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,872
Woo-young, why don't you ask her?

660
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,875
-Hello, ma'am. This is Woo-young.
-Oh, hello.

661
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,009
Ma'am.

662
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,480
When Sae-ho was on Comedy Big League…

663
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,581
NO, IT'S TALK LEAGUE

664
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,615
-What?
-It's Talk League.

665
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,285
When he was on Comedy Talk League,

666
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,088
did you go to the studio with him
to observe his show?

667
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,857
-Film.
-To film the show?

668
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,458
He didn't listen at all.

669
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,194
-Did you ever film an episode with him?
-No.

670
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,429
-Is this false too?
-Ma'am.

671
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,298
Anyway, while Sae-ho was on that show,

672
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,468
he heard someone else
share a funny story about his brother.

673
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,371
Since Sae-ho didn't want to fall behind,

674
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,373
he said he had a brother too.

675
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,642
But you stopped him and asked him

676
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,111
-to stop lying.
-Yes, I did tell him that.

677
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,579
It's true!

678
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,949
I did say, "You don't have a brother."

679
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,519
-He kept making up stories.
-It's true.

680
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,721
And the story about the uniform is false?

681
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:27,325
I did ask him why he keeps lying on TV.

682
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,593
This one's real.

683
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,362
-It was true.
-Thank you.

684
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,897
-Thank you.
-Okay.

685
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,632
-All right.
-Okay.

686
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,300
-She sounds tired.
-Bye.

687
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,269
-This one's true.
-It's true.

688
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:41,006
So Sook, Jin-kyung, and Woo-jae
get one point each!

689
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,040
SOOK, JIN-KYUNG, WOO-JAE GAIN 1 POINT

690
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,709
This is the point I want to bring out.

691
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,746
There are so many true
and false stories in this world,

692
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,549
so you should listen carefully and…

693
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,718
LISTEN TO YOUR MOM, SEBASTIAN

694
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,853
Isn't this fun?

695
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,888
That is all for True or False.

696
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,524
Currently, Sook is in the lead.

697
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,326
KIM SOOK IS CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD

698
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,662
There's a final segment
in The Cho Sae-ho Show.

699
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,163
Is it already the final segment?

700
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
LIKE A FLEETING SPRING NIGHT'S DREAM

701
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,399
Why is it ending so soon?

702
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,335
Together with you,
we'll have an exciting show,

703
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,070
an amazing show, and a happy show.

704
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,672
It makes you look forward to tomorrow.

705
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,874
-Here's the second segment…
-Look forward to tomorrow?

706
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,642
…of the Cho Sae-ho show.

707
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,110
THEY CLAP FOR NOW

708
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,645
-The Cho Sae-ho Show is--
-Excuse me.

709
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,047
Why look forward to tomorrow?

710
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,148
You only have today.

711
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,084
Since it's the most boisterous show,
shall we laugh boisterously?

712
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,753
FORCING THEM TO GET HYPED

713
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,490
I, Cho Sae-ho, who is with you right now,

714
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:37,062
thankfully had so many guests
come to my wedding.

715
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,396
It was sensational.

716
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:42,200
I would like to thank you once again
from the bottom of my heart.

717
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,936
It would have been nice
if more people could have come,

718
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,006
but it would be impossible
to invite them all to one place.

719
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,708
Where is this talk show going?

720
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,042
Is it about the performance?

721
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,778
That's why we prepared this segment.
It's called

722
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:57,282
the Impersonation Speed Quiz!

723
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,284
A round of applause!

724
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,154
Are you giving the quiz
and we're guessing it?

725
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,889
Yes, I'm giving the quiz

726
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,158
and you will compete individually

727
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,760
to guess the answer.

728
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,829
-Let's try. Sounds fun.
-Let me explain.

729
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:14,165
You will be provided with
three categories in this quiz.

730
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,467
-The job.
-The job.

731
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,968
The show.

732
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,637
-And the commercial.
-The show?

733
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,872
As for the job,
let me give you an example.

734
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,777
"Jang Woo-young, you are sentenced
to three years in prison." Who is it?

735
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,145
-A judge.
-It's a judge.

736
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,681
-That's how you can guess the job.
-I see.

737
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,217
You'll be the one
doing all the impersonations?

738
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,251
I guess so.

739
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,020
I guess so.

740
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,556
We can only have one episode
of the Cho Sae-ho Show.

741
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,058
This is truly a one-man show.

742
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,028
Despite that, let me tell you more.
The types of shows are

743
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,264
variety shows, movies, or dramas.

744
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,233
And when it is a commercial,

745
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,236
the hint will be like "Kim Sook
who is advertising dental floss."

746
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,104
You mention the type of product.

747
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:57,842
This is done by my very personal ability,

748
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,711
so please be understanding
if it takes time.

749
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,080
-I don't know what it is either.
-Okay.

750
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,381
Then, shall we sit closer?

751
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,250
-Come here.
-The four of you can sit closer.

752
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,584
-I can't see anything.
-Okay.

753
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,319
-We can't see anything.
-You all fit.

754
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:12,257
Okay. The Impersonation Speed Quiz
with Cho Sae-ho!

755
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,725
The first round is

756
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,860
the person and their job.

757
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,395
Here's the question.

758
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,265
READING THE QUESTION

759
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,067
Geez.

760
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,269
Geez.

761
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,871
Come on, guys. Geez.

762
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,606
What are you doing right now?

763
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,408
My gosh. This is so annoying.

764
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,343
WHO IS THAT?

765
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,079
Is it Mr. Yang Taek-jo?

766
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,382
-If you want a deal, make a deal. Geez.
-I got it.

767
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,551
-If you want a deal, make a deal.
-I got it.

768
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,919
Geez.

769
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,654
Real Estate Agent Kim Gu-ra.

770
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,489
That's correct!

771
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,890
That's how it's done.

772
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,192
YES!

773
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,728
-That was a practice round.
-I see.

774
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,297
-What the heck?
-This is how it's done.

775
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,766
You see, it seemed
like Jin-kyung didn't get it.

776
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,000
I got it now.

777
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,135
I got it now.

778
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,970
Here goes the first question.

779
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,941
HEAVE HO, HEAVE HO

780
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,009
Come on. The net! The net!

781
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,678
Pull up the net!

782
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,780
I got it. Fisherman Kim Ho-young.

783
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,981
Fisherman Kim Ho-young…

784
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,549
is correct!

785
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,118
FISHERMAN KIM HO-YOUNG

786
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,986
That is correct, Woo-jae.

787
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,921
Here's the next one.

788
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,956
It's too easy.

789
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,759
Wow! Right now,

790
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,062
I think it would be great if I could stay!

791
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,296
HIS CHEEKS SHAKE MERCILESSLY

792
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,765
Wouldn't it be nice?

793
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,099
I got it!

794
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,901
Infomercial pitchman Kang Ho-dong.

795
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,003
That is incorrect. Keep watching.

796
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,706
SHOW HOST CHO IS
PERFECTLY IMPERSONATING SHOW HOST KANG

797
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,443
It is getting very hot right now.

798
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,278
There are a lot of people here.

799
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,946
But there's nothing in here.

800
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,315
-I got it.
-But a dove is flying out…

801
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,284
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE

802
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,986
BUT A DOVE IS FLYING OUT?

803
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,187
Magician Kang Ho-dong.

804
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,322
Magician Kang Ho-dong? That's correct.

805
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,124
That's correct.

806
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,058
BUMMER

807
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,794
Gosh. Am I doing this right?

808
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,595
Okay.

809
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,631
Okay.

810
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,599
Make it harder.

811
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,234

00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,370

813
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,606
AWKWARD SMILE

814
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,209
Listen, customer.

815
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,279
STARTING OFF WITH AN ABRUPT SCOLDING

816
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,447
Listen, customer.

817
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,649
SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS TWO HOLES IN HIS CHEST

818
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:18,917
-I got it.
-Go ahead.

819
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,219

-Okay.

821
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,357
-What brings you here?

823
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,294
-That's incorrect.
-What is it then?

824
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,596
-Here goes another hint.
-Okay.

825
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,232
What did you come here for?

826
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,134
Listen, customer.

827
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,068
I got it!

828
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,205
-Convenience Store Worker Lee Jung-jae.
-No.

829
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,942
Did you have a fever last night, customer?

830
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,777
-I got it.
-Doctor Lee Jung-jae.

831
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,878
-Wrong!
-I got it.

832
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,413
Pharmacist Lee Jung-jae.

833
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,581
That's correct!

834
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,017
SHE GOT THE ANSWER SNATCHED AWAY FROM HER

835
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,553
WOO-JAE GETS 4 ANSWERS IN A ROW

836
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,288
This is fascinating.

837
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,858
-The answers are all pretty clear.
-It's fun watching Sae-ho.

838
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,925
It's not Cho Sae-ho Show.

839
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,427
It's Watching Cho Sae-ho.

840
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,362
THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

841
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,930
WATCHING CHO SAE-HO

842
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,132
Here goes the next one.

843
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,269
-Let me think about this one.
-Okay.

844
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,704
HOST CHO RUNS INTO ROADBLOCK

845
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,939
One moment. Let me practice.

846
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,041
LAUGHING

847
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,945
Well… Seriously… It is so…

848
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,014
-Okay.
-…good.

849
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,949
It was really fun

850
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,485
doing this thing.

851
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,955
SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ALL OF A SUDDEN?

852
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,924
AND HE'S LISTENING CAREFULLY?

853
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,827
Well, Jin-kyung is really…

854
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,564
Well, Sa-rang loves your kimchi so much.

855
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,232
YouTuber Choo Sung-hoon.

856
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,634
That's incorrect.

857
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,670
HOST CHO KEEPS
LOOKING SOMEWHERE AS HE TALKS

858
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,672
I got it. Interpreter Choo Sung-hoon.

859
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,908
INTERPRETER CHOO SUNG-HOON

860
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,442
Can you say it clearly?

861
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,543
-Interpreter--
-I got it.

862
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,212
Simultaneous Interpreter Choo Sung-hoon.

863
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,480
That's correct!

864
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,814
That's correct!

865
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,086
SHE SNATCHED IT FROM RIGHT UNDER HIM

866
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,655
He was interpreting a kimchi show.

867
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,690
What the heck?

868
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,292
YOU'RE THE BEST

869
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,526
Do another one.

870
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,528
CHECKING THE NEXT QUESTION

871
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,230
-This one is--
-Gosh. This one.

872
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,464
Let me give it a try.

873
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,333
Do another one. Just do it.

874
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,968
-You're so good.
-Just do it.

875
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,036
He did all of them well.

876
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,105
-I'll give it a shot. I think I can do it.
-Just do it.

877
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,473
Here goes.

878
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,841
PUTTING ON A BIG FROWN

879
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,445
Come in. Come in!

880
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,581
A JOB THAT KEEPS ASKING THEM TO COME IN?

881
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,250
Hawker Hwang Jung-min.

882
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,284
No.

883
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,321
No. The answer is in the line I'm saying.

884
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,523
Listen carefully.

885
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,857
Can I get some water please?

886
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,359
MC CHO GETS UP IMMEDIATELY

887
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,627
-I got it.
-One moment.

888
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,995
Have some water, Jin-kyung.

889
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,331
Let me know if you need anything.

890
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,166
HE'S A HOST, QUESTION GIVER, AND STAFF

891
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,400
Sae-ho is so busy.

892
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,337
-The Cho Sae-ho show is very charming.
-You see,

893
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,273
-our staff's idea was so great.
-You do everything, Sae-ho.

894
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,874
Goalkeeper Hwang Jung-min.

895
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,242
GOALKEEPER HWANG JUNG-MIN

896
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,544
Wow!

897
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,545
That's wrong.

898
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,146
That's incorrect. I'll keep going.

899
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,681
Hey, brother.

900
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,249
Come in!

901
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,150
Brother?

902
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,086
There are a lot of seats so come in.

903
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,554
I got it.

904
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,289
Barbecue Restaurant Waiter Hwang Jung-min.

905
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,724
No, that's incorrect.

906
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,393
I guess there is one
at a barbecue restaurant too.

907
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,762
Let me give you another hint.

908
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,897
Come in and park here.

909
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,199
-I got it.
-I got it!

910
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,233
Valet Hwang Jung-min.

911
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,134
Valet Hwang Jung-min.

912
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,435
-More clearly?
-I got it.

913
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,104
Owner of Parking Lot Hwang Jung-min.

914
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,239
Parking Attendant Hwang Jung-min.

915
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,042
Parking Attendant Hwang Jung-min.
That's correct!

916
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,176
That's correct.

917
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,045
I wasn't sure it was right but…

918
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,246
Come in.

919
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,614
WHAT THE HECK

920
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,616
This level of difficulty is good.

921
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,984
-That's good?
-Do another one.

922
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:40,985
Another one.

923
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,388
-What are you doing? Is it fun?
-Here I go.

924
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,689
Yeah.

925
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,124
He's good.

926
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,825
Okay, next one.

927
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,363
I love it so much, man. Let's go!

928
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,432
-Let's go.
-Let's go now!

929
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,700
THEY GUESS WHO IT IS IMMEDIATELY

930
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,701
Poof!

931
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,538
IT'S RO HONG-CHUL
BUT HE'S GOING SOMEWHERE?

932
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,839
-He's going somewhere?
-Yes.

933
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,174
Travel Agent Ro Hong-chul.

934
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,276
-Travel agent?
-Travel Agent Ro Hong-chul.

935
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,277
That's incorrect.

936
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,311
CONTINUING WITH THE HINT

937
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,680
-Hey, man. The weather is so nice.
-I got it.

938
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,649
-What do you want to eat, man?
-I got it.

939
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,018
I got it.

940
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,521
Flight Attendant Ro Hong-chul.

941
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,755
That's correct.

942
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,724
SHE SNATCHED IT FROM UNDER SOMEONE AGAIN

943
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,192
My throat hurts so much.

944
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,128
My throat hurts so much.

945
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,063
DIES GLORIOUSLY AFTER THE BATTLE

946
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,499
I WENT TOO FAR

947
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,069
What is this? What are we doing?

948
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,338
We can only do
one episode of The Cho Sae-ho Show.

949
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,706
Your mic fell off.

950
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,476
-That was so funny.
-It was so funny.

951
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,778
By the way, you'll find out
in the next segment,

952
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,346
but Sae-ho won't say a word.

953
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,184
A FANCY HEALING SEGMENT IS WAITING FOR HIM

954
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,252
Why don't we move on from the jobs and--

955
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,754
Let's try another one.

956
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,422
-Do the one with shows.
-Okay.

957
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,424
-The category is shows.
-It's shows.

958
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,927
-This one is a show and a person.
-Okay.

959
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,363
Who is that? Who is it?

960
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,067
WHO IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

961
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,268
It isn't an entertainer.

962
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:11,109
THE SAE-HO EXCLUSIVE ANNOYING POSE
MAKES AN APPEARANCE AGAIN

963
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,978
VAGUELY FAMILIAR

964
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,949
I am going to drink. I--

965
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,118
I got it. Infinite Challenge G-DRAGON.

966
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,586
No.

967
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,987
I…

968
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,188
CONTINUING WITH THE HINT

969
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,524
…am going to drink.

970
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:29,994
I'm going to drink a soda.

971
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,330
I AM GOING TO DRINK A SODA

972
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,633
SODA?

973
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,336
-I got it. KPop Demon Hunters G-DRAGON.
-That's correct!

974
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:42,073
DEDUCED THE ANSWER FROM "LALALA SODA POP"

975
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,608
YOU GOT IT EXACTLY

976
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,043
Here I go again.

977
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,546
Okay. It's a show and a person.

978
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,616
Well. Hello.

979
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:56,354
I think this person's action
was wrong from the start.

980
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,956
You can't throw a milk carton
from up there.

981
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,625
Don't throw the milk carton.

982
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,027
Don't throw the milk carton.

983
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,362
Who threw it?

984
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,398
If you threw it,
follow me to the rooftop.

985
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,399
I got it!

986
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,868
Once Upon a Time in High School,
Oh Eun-young.

987
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:11,969
That's correct!

988
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,104
ONCE UPON A TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL
OH EUN-YOUNG

989
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,372
That's correct!

990
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,608
HOW DID HE GET THAT?

991
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,343
Let's move on to commercials.

992
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,978
-It's too hard.
-On to commercials.

993
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,346
How is he guessing all of these?

994
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,182
Woo-jae is amazing.

995
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,384
You have to guess
what kind of commercial it is.

996
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:33,457
THE LEAD-UP LOOKS PRETTY OMINOUS

997
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,992
When…

998
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,363
When…

999
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,334
WE KNOW WHO IT IS

1000
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,635
What kind of commercial is it?

1001
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,340
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
BUT HE CRUSHES IT JUST WITH HIS LOOKS

1002
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,841
Un-nyun!

1003
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,176
-Isn't he Jang Hyuk?
-Yeah.

1004
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,978
When…

1005
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,813
will it come out?

1006
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,248
-I got it.
-I got it.

1007
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,616
-I got it.
-I got it.

1008
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,084
Laxative, Jang Hyuk.

1009
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,352
Laxative, Jang Hyuk.

1010
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,620
That is correct.

1011
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,688
LAXATIVE, JANG HYUK

1012
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,258
-All right.
-You're so good at this.

1013
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,626
WE ASK FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING, HYUK

1014
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,096
AGAIN, COMMERCIAL + PERSON

1015
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,700
THAT PERSON APPEARS AGAIN

1016
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,901
I'm going to drink it.

1017
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,938
Who is that supposed to be? G-DRAGON?

1018
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,974
-It's G-DRAGON.
-It is G-DRAGON.

1019
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,308
I'm going to drink it.

1020
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,643
G-DRAGON THAT WENT BAD

1021
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,945
I'm going to drink it from my head.

1022
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,947
It isn't G-DRAGON.

1023
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,983
IT ISN'T G-DRAGON?

1024
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,185
I'm going to drink it. Swag.

1025
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,386
CONTINUES ACTING LIKE A FOOL

1026
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,054
Shampoo commercial.

1027
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,724
No, that isn't the answer.

1028
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,460
I'm going to drink it.

1029
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,495
I'm going to drink it.

1030
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,529
EVEN INCORPORATES DANCE MOVES

1031
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,898
-Drink it?
-It is a specific brand.

1032
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,066
It's a specific product.

1033
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,068
I'm going to drink it from head to toe.

1034
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,237
What is it?

1035
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,171
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?

1036
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,407
Hyun-moo probably drinks it too.

1037
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,942
-I got it!
-Oh.

1038
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:58,876
I got it.

1039
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,244
-G-DRAGON.
-Wait.

1040
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,313
You two were pretty close.

1041
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,914
-Let's give Sook a chance.
-I got it.

1042
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,084
The vitamin drink Oronamin C, G-DRAGON.

1043
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,386
That's correct!

1044
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,555
I'm going to drink it from head to toe.

1045
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,358
From head to toe, Oronamin C

1046
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,894
Gosh. It's fun to watch Sae-ho.

1047
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,862
NEXT QUESTION

1048
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,664
-It's a commercial.
-Okay.

1049
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,198
WOBBLING

1050
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,300
What is he doing?

1051
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,836
-Hello.
-I got it.

1052
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:26,937
The coffee Let's Be, Choi Hong-man.

1053
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,173
LET'S BE, CHOI HONG-MAN

1054
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,975
-Am I right?
-That is correct!

1055
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,343
That's correct.

1056
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,111
Choi Hong-man in a Let's Be commercial.

1057
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,446
What was it?

1058
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,782
-I get off at this stop.
-I get off at this stop.

1059
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,716
That's from Let's Be?

1060
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:39,884
-Let's Be.
-Okay.

1061
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,285
HE GOT IT FROM HIS BUS STRAP-GRABBING POSE

1062
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,154
That's from Let's Be? He's really fast.

1063
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,555
Moving on to the next one.

1064
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,923
Give Woo-young a chance.

1065
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,291
-Okay, Woo-young.
-I don't know.

1066
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,926
Let's give Woo-young a chance.

1067
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,461
-I'm having fun though.
-Try guessing.

1068
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:52,997
WOW

1069
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:57,068
I am right here.

1070
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,136
Right here.

1071
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,139
-Right here.
-Yeah.

1072
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,176
Gosh. Isn't this what it's all about?

1073
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,845
-You know who it is, right?
-Yeah, I know.

1074
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,847
I forgot.

1075
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,417
I am hanging out with Woo-jae,

1076
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,220
but the sofa is unbalanced.

1077
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,688
It's unbalanced.

1078
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,925
THE SOFA IS UNBALANCED?

1079
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,026
-The sofa?
-Yeah.

1080
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,961
Is it that? I bet it's that.

1081
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,029
Yeah. Give it a shot.

1082
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,364
-I got it.
-Okay.

1083
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,932
Good Choice, Heo Gyeong-hwan.

1084
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:29,600
That is correct.

1085
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,770
CONGRATULATIONS WOO-YOUNG,
ON YOUR FIRST CORRECT ANSWER

1086
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,106
GIDDY

1087
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,041
NEXT QUESTION

1088
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:37,942
This one's too easy.

1089
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,210
OKAY, GOT IT

1090
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,381
It's Choi Hong-man.

1091
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,515
Listen carefully.

1092
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,583
He's so good.

1093
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,052
Oh, hello.

1094
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,921
Two all-beef…

1095
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:51,956
I got it.

1096
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,026
HE GOT THE ANSWER

1097
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,295
FROM THAT MUMBLING?

1098
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,165
-I got it. McDonald's, Choi Hong-man.
-That is correct!

1099
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,066
What did he say?

1100
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,169
Two all-beef patties on a sesame bun,
special sauce, lettuce,

1101
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,670
-pi…
-You know…

1102
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,539
Cheese, pickles, and onions.

1103
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,408
Let me say it exactly.

1104
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,343
Two all-beef patties on a sesame bun,

1105
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,178
special sauce, lettuce,

1106
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,614
-cheese, pickles, and onions.
-Cheese, pickles, and onions.

1107
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,550
BA DA BA BA BA

1108
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,920
CHO SAE-HO IS AMAZING

1109
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,122
THEY'RE BEYOND IMPRESSED,
THEY'RE ASTONISHED

1110
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,257
HE WAS BORN WITH THAT TALENT

1111
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,491
You're awesome!

1112
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,293
Do one more. One more.

1113
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,462
-Here I go.
-This is so fun.

1114
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,032
Gosh, you know what? This is just…

1115
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,700
Hey, Sae-ho. That's not what I'm saying.

1116
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,903
-It's Kim Gu-ra.
-Yeah, you're right.

1117
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,905
FOR SOME REASON, THESE TWO
ARE GUESSING IT TOGETHER

1118
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,841
Hey, even Jin-kyung did it.
Aren't you going to do it?

1119
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,911
-Is it because you're worried about this?
-I got it.

1120
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,879
Stock tip group, Kim Gu-ra.

1121
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,080
-That's incorrect.
-What?

1122
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,016
Even Jin-kyung did this,

1123
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,318
and sadly, she went through that thing,

1124
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,986
but she got some.

1125
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,087
Loan.

1126
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,290
That's wrong. But you're doing good.

1127
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,425
-I have no idea.
-You see…

1128
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,661
-I got it. Rush-and-Cash, Kim Gu-ra.
-No, that's wrong.

1129
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,596
Listen, everyone.

1130
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,098
Anything can happen these days, right?

1131
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:08,999
I got it!

1132
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,503
Insurance company commercial, Kim Gu-ra.

1133
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,637
That's correct.

1134
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,072
INSURANCE COMPANY COMMERCIAL, KIM GU-RA

1135
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,041
-She got some.
-She got some.

1136
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,076
THE HINT WAS IN HIS LINES

1137
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,712
REVEALING THE NEXT QUESTION

1138
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,547
Can you do this?

1139
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,349
UMM…

1140
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,417
We don't even know how.

1141
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,785
-I'll give it a try.
-Go ahead.

1142
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,320
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT?

1143
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,621
I don't think this is possible.

1144
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,658
WRINKLING HIS NOSE

1145
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,229
WE'RE AT AN UNCOMFORTABLE JUNCTURE

1146
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,630
This is the last one.

1147
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,564
Who is it?

1148
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,299
It's a woman.

1149
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,535
WOW

1150
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,273
-Who is it?
-Guess.

1151
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,575
-I'm impersonating the action.
-I got it.

1152
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,478
Makeup commercial, Macaulay Culkin.

1153
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,746
No.

1154
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,351
IT'S JUST SAE-HO MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF

1155
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:01,752
This is very hard.

1156
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,654
DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHO THIS IS

1157
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,723
I got it. Makeup commercial, Cha Eun-woo.

1158
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,057
MAKEUP COMMERCIAL, CHA EUN-WOO

1159
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,359
That's correct.

1160
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,560
That's correct.

1161
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,164
I can recognize what you do.

1162
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,467
How did you figure that out, Sook?

1163
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:18,402
This is…

1164
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,471
-How did she figure it out?
-I knew it.

1165
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,206
HOW ON EARTH DID SHE GUESS THIS?

1166
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,374
-That's funny.
-Okay.

1167
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,675
And so…

1168
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,044
-You're amazing.
-…the Impersonation Speed Quiz…

1169
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,979
-That was so much fun.
-…with Cho Sae-ho is over.

1170
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,415
EXPLOSIVE REACTION

1171
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,352
-He'll sleep until two in the afternoon.
-I am just fine.

1172
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:39,790
You know,
seeing Sae-ho struggle so hard made us

1173
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,091
feel sorry for him,

1174
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,595
but our intention
was to make Sae-ho shine.

1175
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,496
Of course. Thanks.

1176
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,464
-He is shining so much.
-He really is.

1177
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,534
-We wanted to see his talents explode…
-I'm thankful.

1178
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,469
…so we created this space for him.

1179
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,004
Thank you. I loved it.

1180
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,507
-He shined so brightly.
-Making people laugh…

1181
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,708
When will it come out?

1182
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,842
MC CHO SHINED BRIGHTLY

1183
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,045
Before we announce the result,

1184
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,614
can you tell us how you felt
about being on the Cho Sae-ho Show?

1185
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,015
Tell us briefly, one by one.

1186
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,184
It was astounding.

1187
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,053
-Astounding?
-You know how

1188
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,424
when you look at a movie poster,
the film critic leaves a one-line review?

1189
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,127
All you need is an exclamation mark
after "astounding."

1190
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,662
-No further words are needed.
-Thanks.

1191
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,297
He is a born-to-be comedian.

1192
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,466
That is the highest praise I can get.

1193
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,601
Jin-kyung.

1194
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,270
He is always more than what I expect.

1195
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,538
Always more than I expected.

1196
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,974
He is more than what I expected.

1197
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,043
The Cho Sae-ho Show must return.

1198
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,845
-Thank you.
-For real.

1199
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,582
-I felt something close to reverence.
-Thank you.

1200
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,984
That is all.

1201
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,519
They are telling me
that the results are in.

1202
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,722
Let me announce the last place.

1203
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,856
-It's me.
-Yes.

1204
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,757
-Yeah.
-Last place.

1205
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,592
Last place is

1206
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,427
Woo-young.

1207
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,662
WOO-YOUNG IS IN LAST PLACE
ON THE CHO SAE-HO SHOW

1208
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:52,830
THIS RESULT HAS NO MAJOR UPSET

1209
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,598
-Good job.
-Sadly,

1210
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,201
he wasn't very active.

1211
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,903
But two people are in second place.

1212
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,806
Let me go straight
to announcing first place.

1213
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,608
-I bet I'm second.
-This person is…

1214
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:08,345
-I got some wrong in the beginning.
-…the winner of the Cho Sae-ho Show.

1215
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,080
Congratulations.

1216
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,348
WHO WILL GET THE AWESOME PRESENT?

1217
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,317
-Woo-jae?
-Give her a round of applause.

1218
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,021
-It's Kim Sook. Congratulations.
-What?

1219
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,088
KIM SOOK IS THE FINAL WINNER

1220
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,091
-You're in first place?
-I am?

1221
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,326
-Yes.
-For real?

1222
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,862
She got a lot of True or False ones right.

1223
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:28,465
SOOK WAS IN 1ST PLACE ON THE TRUE OR FALSE

1224
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,901
-Let me give you the present.
-The present.

1225
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,202
I wonder what it is.

1226
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,638
My goodness. That's a nice gift.

1227
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,873
What the heck?

1228
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:36,774
THE LOGO LOOKS FAMILIAR

1229
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,208
It really is a present.

1230
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,411
First of all, here you go.

1231
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,445
Here's the present.

1232
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,513
Show them what it is.

1233
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,548
It's pretty heavy.

1234
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,217
SHE FREEZES IN PLACE

1235
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,786
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

1236
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,487
-It's very useful.
-But…

1237
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,655
Look.

1238
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,391
BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

1239
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,195
There's the Joggokzi nipple patch…

1240
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,297
-Yes.
-…and dental floss.

1241
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,332
I'm almost done with mine.

1242
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,368
-There's a variety.
-That's nice.

1243
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,937
There's a generous amount.

1244
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,706
I don't know when you may need it,

1245
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,174
but you get the nipple patch.

1246
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,442
Many people use it.

1247
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,410
-Thank you.
-Wow.

1248
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,312
-This is really a gift.
-The other one

1249
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,015
is the new sweater

1250
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,350
-from AMOUPRE.
-The new one.

1251
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,785
It's so pretty.

1252
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,421
A WARM SWEATER
THAT'S PERFECT FOR THE WINTER

1253
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,823
-That's all.
-Thank you.

1254
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,524
Isn't this very hard to get?

1255
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,393
You can get it easily.

1256
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,961
YOU CAN GET IT EASILY

1257
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,696
A hearty congratulations to you.

1258
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,531
That is all for the Cho Sae-ho Show.

1259
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,934
See you again. Goodbye!

1260
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,269
Don't go!

1261
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,838
Don't go!

1262
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,239
It was so fun.

1263
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,575

1264
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,910
ONE HOUR LATER

1265
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,416
Yes, I may be leaving first…

1266
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,488
And if it's okay with you,

1267
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,023
please take care of my wife
whom I'm leaving behind.

1268
