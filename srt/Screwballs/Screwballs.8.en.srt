Today's theme is Chaebol Heir Audition.

ACQUIRE ASSETS TO BECOME
THE HEIR AND WIN PRIZE MONEY

00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,944
You'll be given some free time
starting now.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,214
You have one hour to explore
and take advantage of the facilities.

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,916
You can either spend your earnings
or increase your assets.

00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,151
INVEST,
MANAGE REPUTATION, OR WORK

-Tudum.
-Tudum.

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,459
LET ME TRY ONE MORE TIME

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,161
ANOTHER LOSS

13
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,896
Hey, let me take a turn.

14
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,233
We're bound to see
at least one of us going completely broke.

15

DELIVERY GIG: EACH SUCCESSFUL

00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:36,903
ARE YOU EXHAUSTED?

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,072
YES

18
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,041
A GAME CHANGER STRIKES

19
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,876
AS CHAEBOL WANNABES'
BREAK NEARS ITS END

20
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,980
CURRENT STANDINGS
1.04B, 1.6B, 430M, 480M, 1.201B

21
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,783
I'm hungry. In fact, I'm starving.

22
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:50,850
Let's get something.

23
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,352
Are you having something, Woo-young?

24
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,422
-I want a pig's trotter.
-Pig's trotter?

25
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,891
-It's listed as Schweinshaxe.
-That's 500 million.

26
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,161
-You're spending a whopping 500 million?
-Yeah, I'm way too hungry.

27
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,063
Did you order some food?

28
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,831
-Yeah, one pig's trotter.
-Really? Okay.

29
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,032
Still, it's too expensive.

30
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,667
WHAT DID SHE MEAN "OKAY"?

31
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,304
-That looks so good.
-It looks so tasty.

32
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,972
-Why don't we share it?
-No dice.

33
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,408
-Why not?
-Pay me if you want some.

34
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,511
We'll chip in 100 million each.
Let's share the food.

35
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,015
-Good idea. If we all chip in…
-That totals 300 million.

36
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,850
Yeah, so you'd only have paid 200 million.

37
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,752
But there aren't so many slices here.

38
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,154
Don't worry about that.
We're not here to eat, are we?

39
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,656
All right. Here's my idea.

40
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:33,226
I'll take your 300 million.
Let me just take my portion aside.

41
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,028
-Don't be like that.
-I'd still be sharing.

42
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,131
Let's eat off the same plate.
This isn't some competition.

43
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,699
Don't come on too strong, okay?

44
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,468
-I'm only taking my chopsticks.
-First off…

45
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,870
Pay me 100 million each.
Man, you're all so…

46
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,039
-Let me see your 100 million won.
-You're so distrustful.

47
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,809
COLLECTS 100 MILLION PER PERSON

48
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,178
Jeez. What do you think you're playing at?

49
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,047
-Give me my 100 million.
-I don't have it.

50
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,449
-Forget the food, then.
-I'd pay up if I had money to spare.

51
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,485
-Anyways… Let's eat.
-Do you see me as a miser?

52
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,053
Cut her some slack.

53
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,254
WHY IS SHE ACTING SO BOLD?

54
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,556
You can have a single bite
with your ten million.

55
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,891
OKAY, THEN…

56
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,694
-Is ten million all she has?
-Yeah, I don't see how she could be so…

57
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,262
I'll give you one slice, Jin-kyung.

58
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,297
-No, I want to pick one myself.
-Here you go.

59
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,733
Let me choose one myself.
I did pay ten million.

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,568
I think I'm entitled to that.

61
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,870
DON'T YOU DARE TAKE TWO SLICES…

62
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,271
HOW CHILDISH…

63
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,140
-Okay.
-Don't squabble over food.

64
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,708
Take your money's worth, Sook.

65
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,109
-Let's have a seat first.
-Okay.

66
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,577
Yeah, let's eat in comfort.

67
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,546
Dang, this ate up almost 300 million.

68
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,482
The portion isn't so generous
considering its price.

69
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,617
Still, let's enjoy it.

70
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,353
Don't you think a slice
for ten million is too stingy?

71
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,621
-This is lit.
-I had no choice.

72
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,589
-I love pig's trotter.
-Pay up more.

73
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,591
Why? I gave you 100 million.

74
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,593
YUM

75
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,663
Still, a slice per ten million
is outlandish.

76
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,432
With another ten million,
you can have another slice.

77
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,835
HOW PETTY…

78
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,336
-I can't believe you.
-What's that?

79
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,971
RUMMAGES IN HER FANNY PACK

80
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,773
Okay, take another slice.

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,974
A 10-MILLION DEAL CLOSED

82
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,110
But that's…

83
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,279
-Hey, watch it. You only get a slice.
-Oh, come on.

84
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,414
-I'm having trouble picking one up.
-I don't buy it.

85
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,550
-It's really that tricky.
-You did fine earlier.

86
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,318
IN CASE YOU FORGOT,

87
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,054
THEY'RE COMPETING
TO BECOME THE CHAEBOL HEIR

88
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,156
-This is my last piece.
-Hey, stop that.

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,628
THAT'S WHEN THEY HEAR…

90
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,729
Someone must've won.

91
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,897
…THE CHEER FOR THE JACKPOT

92
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,599
-Their pot grew tenfold.
-For real?

93
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,733
Oh, wow.

94
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,769
That's the first ever jackpot.

95
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,306
IT DOES LOOK LIKE HE WON…

96
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,941
SO WHY IS HE DESPAIRING?

97
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:29,776
For real?

98
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,478
Are you sure?

99
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,849
30 SECONDS AGO

100
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,352
Can you give me a demonstration
without a bet?

101
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,920
Go!

102
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,422
HERE'S A SPECIAL
PERFORMANCE FOR YOU

103
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,023
Stop.

104
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,059
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

105
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,494
-Oh, yeah!
-Hold on.

106
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,463
THERE IT IS, THE JACKPOT

107
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,664
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

108
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,670
Why didn't I make the bet?

109
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,640
Hold on. Let me think.

110
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,775
I as good as wasted my good luck here.

111
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,677
There's no way I can win at this again.

112
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,080
That's how the world is.

113
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,316
An event like this
doesn't happen in a row.

114
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,553
BUT HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT HUMAN NATURE

115
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,687
Ten times, huh?

116
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,189
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS SO RATIONAL

117
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
Ten times the bet…

118
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,960
EVEN THE MOST ANALYTICAL MIND
CAN BE TEMPTED

119
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,229
I'm betting 100 million.

120
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,499
Go!

121
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,401
WHEN GOOD LUCK
SLIPS THROUGH YOUR FINGERS,

122
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,638
YOU CAN EASILY DELUDE YOURSELF
INTO THINKING THAT IT WAS YOURS

123
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,539
Stop.

124
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,707
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

125
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,209
SO, YOU'RE NO WINNER

126
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,810
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

127
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,846
DEEP DOWN, WOO-JAE
MUST'VE FORESEEN THIS TOO

128
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:40,980
Damn it.

129
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,750
How much did you win?

130
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,251
-What?
-You won?

131
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,386
I meant the slot machine.

132
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,754
-We heard them clapping.
-Yeah.

133
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,955
You'll see.

134
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,557
IS THAT RIGHT?

135
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,293
I should go try my luck.

136
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,628
I'm playing the slot machine.

137
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,298
I'm going to order in pig's trotter later.

138
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,067
Let me bet 20 million.

139
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,435
IF HE WINS, HE EARNS 200 MILLION

140
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,803
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

141
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,871
Go!

142
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,507
IF WOO-JAE WON, SO CAN I

143
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,841
Oh, dang it!

144
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,476
GROAN

145
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,478
UGH

146
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,281
There's no winning that.

147
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,349
-100 MILLION IN TOTAL

148
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,251
This one has a 50% chance, at least.

149
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,287
-Welcome.
-I'm losing my mind here.

150
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,189
ABOUT TO PLACE A BET
AT CULINARY GUESSING WAR

151
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,558
SNEAKING UP

152
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,859
Wanna place a bet together?

153
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,228
Seven, eight, nine. That's all I have.

154
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,097
I'm betting 50 million only.

155
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,598
I'll join her pot for 100 million.

156
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,034
I'm sure we'll win if we join our forces.

157
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,202
FIRST-EVER JOINT VENTURE

158
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,770
-No second thoughts?
-None.

159
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,238
Here we go.

160
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,342
SECRET COOKING SESSION BEGINS

161
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,411
HERE'S A COOKING ASMR SHOW THAT
GIVES YOU A RUSH OF ADRENALINE

162
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,547
HYPER-FIXATED

163
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,549
THANK YOU FOR WAITING

164
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,852
Now, it's the moment of truth.
Please choose black or white.

165
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,921
I'll start counting.

166
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,056
One, two,

167
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,225
-three, four,
-What do you think?

168
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,294
five, six,

169
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,429
seven,

170
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,497
-eight,
-Black… No, white.

171
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,232
-Black?
-nine,

172
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,101
-Trust me, okay?
-ten.

173
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,369
Black!

174
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,970
PUTS ALL HER FAITH IN SAE-HO

175
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,639
Please open the lid on the count of three.

176
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,409
One, two, three!

177
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,477
…three!

178
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,544
Look, Jin-kyung.

179
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,279
STEALS A GLANCE

180
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,383
I can't deal with this.

181
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,550
Thank you!

182
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,419
JOINT VENTURE FAILS

183
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,720
Thank you!

184
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,055
Black!

185
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,223
HE WAS SO CONFIDENT

186
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,458
Who does he think he is?

187
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,627
You asked me to trust you, didn't you?

188
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,330
I wonder what made you so confident.

189
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,400
I can't even…

190
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,467
LET'S MAKE A DELIVERY

191
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,704
Who are you to tell me to trust you?

192
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,573
CRUMPLED

193
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,841
Let's make another delivery.

194
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,844
You'd better do right by me.
Give me 50 million.

195
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,112
Why would I do that?

196
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,414
-Just give it to me.
-I'm all out.

197
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,549
Throw me a bone here.
You have millions of won.

198
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,683
I don't, Jin-kyung.

199
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,918
I know you're loaded.

200
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,521
-You cost me my entire fortune!
-But Jin-kyung…

201
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,156
I was going to go with black.

202
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,092
What? You meant to go…
You meant to choose black?

203
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,194
-I did mean to go with it.
-But we got white.

204
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,097
-The white side was up.
-I mean, I said white first.

205
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,598
-Give me 30 million, then.
-I'm out.

206
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,334
-Just 30 million.
-You had your fill of my food earlier.

207
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,970
AT THIS RATE, SHE MIGHT
TAG ALONG FOR THE WHOLE JOURNEY

208
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,839
-Come on, dude.
-I'm sorry.

209
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,408
You have tons of money.
But I lost all I had.

210
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,076
All right, then.

211
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,979
-Give me 30 million, no more.
-Let me make the delivery first.

212
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,248
If things turn around, I might be able to…

213
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,919
Like I said, I told you
we should go with white.

214
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,887
But you demanded that I trust you.

215
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,323
What made you so bold, huh?

216
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,660
Why make an empty promise
you can't even deliver?

217
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,262
I'm so pissed.

218
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,566
IN THE END, SHE HAS ACCOMPANIED HIM
TO THE DELIVERY SITE

219
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,633
SIGHS

220
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,336
Why trouble us
with this annoying challenge?

221
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,472
TAKE CAUTION
WHEN MAKING A JOINT INVESTMENT

222
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,507
Today's shoot is so draining.

223
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,742
LET'S TAKE CARE OF
THE DELIVERY FIRST

224
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,879
DELIVERY COMPLETE

225
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,947
Okay!

226
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,949
CELEBRATING AS IF
IT WERE HER OWN SUCCESS

227
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,787
TWO COURIERS
FOR A SINGLE DELIVERY

228
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,956
Dang, I can't go on.

229
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,826
I can push you all the way for 20 million.

230
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,661
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN

231
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,830
-How about I push--
-Okay, then.

232
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,898
SIGHS

233
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,700
TOO TIRED TO FIGHT HER OFF

234
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,069
I'm so exhausted.

235
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,438
SMEAR CAMPAIGN - 1ST PLACE:
-500M, 5TH PLACE: +500M

236
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,173
Who should I call next?

237
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,475
Why don't I call Hee-jin?
I mean the actress.

238
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,912
-Oh, man. I adored her when I was young.
-You did?

239
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,848
One of her works, Feelings,
is my all-time favorite series.

240
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:36,949
Yeah? Feelings?

241
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,619
-Hey, Sook.
-Hi, Hee-jin.

242
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,520
-Yes, Sook?
-I'm in a bit of a rush.

243
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,922
-Okay, shoot.
-Here goes.

244
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,891
Please rank my castmates

245
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,628
on the possibility of their buying
a gift for their sweetheart secondhand.

246
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,563
Rank all five of us.

247
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,865
-I absolutely loved Feelings.
-Let's hear it.

248
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,267
Who's in first place?

249
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,338
Okay, then how about the person
who would never do that?

250
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,806
Woo-jae.

251
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,210
MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE STAR
SEES ME IN A GOOD LIGHT

252
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,212
What about first place? Who seems…

253
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,749
I mean, whatever you say goes here.

254
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,285
-Well, I'm going to go with you.
-The first place…

255
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,288
-Let's roll with that.
-Hold on.

256
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,089
Let's think it over, Hee-jin.

257
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,760
You have to rank all five members,
from first to fifth place.

258
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,161
Who's your pick for first place?

259
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
You, Sook.

260
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,532
-All right, thanks.
-Hee-jin.

261
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,169
Hello, this is Joo Woo-jae.
It's such a pleasure to talk to you.

262
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,237
Oh, hi.

263
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,407
-I'm not pulling your leg or anything--
-He's a huge fan of yours.

264
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,741
-That's Min-jong's song.
-I'm honored.

265
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:36,809
She said she's honored.

266
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,311
Oh, gosh. Really?

267
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,879
He's gonna treat you big time.

268
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,415
-Of course.
-He's earned like 500 million today.

269
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,851
-I have a billion won, actually.
-He's raked in all the money.

270
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,554
Thank you so much, Hee-jin.
I appreciate it.

271
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,356
Yeah, thanks.

272
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,892
Sorry, buddy.
You still get the first place.

273
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,660
Sure, I get it.

274
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,229
-Thanks, Hee-jin. I'll catch you later.
-Sure.

275
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,864
-Talk to you soon.
-Thanks again.

276
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,133
Her voice hasn't changed
after all these years.

277
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,769
-What do we do next?
-I'm floored.

278
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,837
WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?

279
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,238
Don't you forget this.

280
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,974
My friend gave you 500 million,
so we're even.

281
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,675
-Still, remember this.
-I swear I will.

282
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,143
You got to talk to your beloved…

283
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,244
That punk! Treat me, okay?

284
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,913
GAINS AND LOSSES
WILL BE SETTLED LATER

285
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:21,287
15 MINUTES OF FREE TIME REMAINS

286
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,724
In the end, everything is about odds.

287
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,059
-I've tried things on offer.
-Yes.

288
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,829
Winning a reward or getting a penalty

289
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,831
on the phone call challenge

290
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,500
relies on a 1/5 chance, respectively.

291
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,068
The slot machine gives me a 1/27 chance.

292
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,770
As for the gig,
it requires humongous effort.

293
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,904
But your station…

294
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,540
This place offers the best chance,
if you ask me.

295
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,110
I can say it with certainty
because that's what the odds say.

296
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,911
And so…

297
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,179
I'm betting 100 million.

298
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,586
Hold on. Is it worth my while
to play the game to earn 100 million?

299
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,255
Should I raise my bet?

300
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,525
Let's say I went all in here.

301
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,094
I can be the obvious winner, then.

302
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,100
That's 500 million in total.

303
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,536
I'll go big and leave in peace.

304
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,740
I won't give you a chance
to reconsider this time. Look closely.

305
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,643
Black, white. Black, white.
Black, black, white.

306
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,645
All right, the black side is up. Now…

307
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,947
THE MIND GAME BEGINS

308
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,617
THE LARGEST POT
THE CHEF HAS SEEN SO FAR

309
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,852
Darn it, I can't even guess.

310
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,292
You can open the lid yourself
after my ten-second count.

311
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,363
One, two, three,

312
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,231
-four, five…
-Black!

313
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,535
-I'm going to open the lid.
-One, two, three!

314
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,171
Congratulations.

315
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,644
+1 BILLION

316
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,479
I'll have to close up the shop.

317
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,351
CLEARED OUT

318
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,753
I'm just speechless.

319
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,221
I want to say something,

320
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,457
but I can't think of anything.
I just can't.

321
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,725
Here you go.

322
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,527
It's all thanks to you
that I get to have this huge sum.

323
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,530
And so… Let me think.

324
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,598
FOR SOME REASON…

325
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,634
WOO-JAE ISN'T MOVING ON

326
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,138
OUR MINDS

327
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,842
WORK IN A VERY CURIOUS WAY

328
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,747
Let me put it this way.
As a way to repay your kindness, Director,

329
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,715
-I'll put down 200 million.
-A 200-million bet?

330
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,352
-I'm bracing myself for the loss.
-All right.

331
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,521
GAMBLING ADDICTION STARTS
FROM THE SO-CALLED "BIG WIN"

332
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,490
Your ten seconds here

333
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,658
may or may not affect
the following decade.

334
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,694
Now, allow me to start the count.

335
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,095
One, two…

336
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,930
-I'll go with white.
-White, it is.

337
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,899
Open the lid on the count of three.

338
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,100
-Got it.
-One, two, three.

339
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,301
One, two, three.

340
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,936
Thank you.

341
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,106
THANK YOU
FOR THE 200-MILLION GIFT

342
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,741
I genuinely made the bet as a gift.

343
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,077
-Oh, sure. Thank you.
-I earned 500 million from you.

344
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,614
TRIES HARD TO LOOK UNBOTHERED

345
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,482
CHOKES UP

346
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,451
I honestly feel like crying.

347
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,090
You need a full belly for motivation.

348
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,093
I'm too hungry
to work up the enthusiasm to try anything.

349
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,063
-Did you buy some lettuce?
-Don't you dare, man.

350
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,698
WOO-JAE WON'T BE
JOINING THIS PARTY

351
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,501
Stop it, Woo-young.
That's why I'm cutting the meat to bits.

352
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,504
This makes no sense. Why aren't we
treating it like the pig's trotters?

353
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,573
Let me give the skillet a shake.

354
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,942
SIZZLING

355
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,545
Man, that looks amazing.
Don't they seem ready to eat?

356
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,979
All right. Let's eat.

357
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,915
Go ahead.
The meat doesn't need black pepper.

358
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,384
-Thanks for the food.
-Bon appétit.

359
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,586
Let's not rush our meal.

360
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,054
ALL OUR DAILY STRUGGLES…

361
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,222
Is it amazing?

362
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,558
…ARE TO PUT FOOD IN OUR MOUTHS

363
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,625
Oh, my.

364
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,360
Hot damn.

365
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,597
THIS IS INSANE

366
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,232
IT'S SO GOOD

367
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,302
GULP

368
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,970
Don't you want a bite, Woo-jae?

369
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,038
Nope.

370
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,540
HOLD ON

371
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,643
HOW COME I MISSED THAT?

372
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,748
You have 3 fruits each,
so I'd have to multiply 1/3 3 times.

373
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,551
Then, I get 1/27. That's impossible.

374
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,787
I ASSUMED THAT
THE ODDS WERE 1/27…

375
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,755
-I suggest that you…
-Stop.

376
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,660
I WAS MISTAKEN

377
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,631
I get it now. With 3 fruits,
you get 3 possible winning cases.

378
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,636
Since each case has a 1/27 chance…

379
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,938
In total, that's a 1/9 chance.

380
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,140
The returns can be ten times your bet.

381
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,143
This weird feeling
just hit me like a truck.

382
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,246
I'm getting this strange hunch here.

383
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,882
My gut's telling me
we're about to see a success.

384
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,817
-So, I'm betting 100 million.
-Go ahead.

385
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,518
THE REWARD CAN REACH 1 BILLION

386
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,153
Go!

387
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,759
Stop.

388
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,060
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

389
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,096
Stop.

390
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,665
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

391
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,767
WOO-JAE LOSES

392
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,037
Not a single fruit matched.

393
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,306
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT

394
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,742
TAKES OUT HIS WAD OF CASH AGAIN

395
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,443
-This is strange.
-Go!

396
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,679
SECOND ATTEMPT

397
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,747
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

398
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,081
ANOTHER LOSS

399
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,316
WHY ISN'T IT GOING MY WAY?

400
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,018
-Let's see.
-Go!

401
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,953
SENSES DOOM AND LEAVES

402
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,756
3 CONSECUTIVE LOSSES

403
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,724
-I don't get it.
-Go!

404
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,893
-Stop.
-Tudum.

405
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,261
4 CONSECUTIVE LOSSES

406
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,996
HE CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES

407
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,164
LET ME TRY AGAIN

408
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,399
OH, DEAR

409
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,466
AGAIN

410
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,668
YOU POOR THING

411
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,937
TOO BAD

412
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,773
You're peeking, aren't you?

413
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,841
-We can't see a thing.
-Nothing at all.

414
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,377
Can you turn around a bit?
Let me adjust your angles.

415
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
Not like that. Please face away
at a 45-degree angle.

416
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,316
LIKE THIS?

417
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,917
Stop.

418
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,018
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

419
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,853
YOU SEE?

420
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,022
SO THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT

421
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,091
Turn around. Just a bit.

422
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,461
PRESSING HARD

423
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,862
-Tudum.
-Tudum.

424
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,665
THIS STATION OFFERS A HONEST GAME
JUST LIKE THE PANCAKE JOINT

425
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,036
THE HIGH ROLLER FINALLY LEAVES

426
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,272
-300 MILLION

427
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,407
Darn it. I'm about to lose it.

428
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,443
Welcome. Swing by my pancake joint.

429
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,080
HIS RANK IN ASSET
IS FREE-FALLING

430
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,983
I guess I got my taste of gambling.

431
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,252
There was a moment earlier
when I could've walked out.

432
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,320
The sign was clear.

433
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,157
I could sense my subconscious
urging me to stop.

434
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,094
WAS IT THE TIME HE ALMOST CRIED
AFTER LOSING 200 MILLION?

435
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,063
OR WAS IT THE TIME
SOOK INVITED HIM TO THE MEAL?

436
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,834
If I had stopped then,
I could've secured second or third place.

437
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,602
Why didn't I stop?

438
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,006
Let me think. A 50% chance…

439
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,174
TAP, TAP

440
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,977
SHOULD I STOP WHILE I STILL CAN?

441
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,179
-If I were to bet now, Director,
-Yes?

442
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,048
could you spare me the show?

443
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,116
Of course.

444
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,051
This here is an honest pancake joint.

445
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,421
Black and white are your only choices.
You're always welcome here.

446
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,489
Now, Woo-jae.

447
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,923
Your moments here

448
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,893
may or may not affect
the following decade.

449
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,229
-Seriously, though.
-Black or white.

450
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,331
-You can't help but wonder.
-White or black.

451
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,700
What's with this place

452
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,169
with all these fake bills?

453
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,905
Why drive us to consider
stooping to the lowest point?

454
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,976
Damn it…

455
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,280
All right. You never know how it will go.

456
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,015
Who says I'll keep losing?

457
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,450
I could start winning.

458
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,718
It's either black or white.

459
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,219
The odds are a whopping 50%.

460
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,855
LET'S BET ON THAT CHANCE

461
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,058
I heartily welcome your choice, Woo-jae.

462
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,693
Thank you for the 300 million won.

463
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,228
This here is an honest pancake joint.

464
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,330
Black or white. White or black.

465
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,799
FAILS TO HOLD IT IN

466
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,866
UNPERTURBED

467
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,902
IS WOO-JAE LOSING HIS COMPOSURE?

468
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,737
White.

469
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,572
One, two, three.

470
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,240
White.

471
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,376
One, two, three.

472
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,214
THESE TWO STATIONS ATE AWAY
ALMOST 600 MILLION OF HIS ASSETS

473
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,250
WILL HE TAKE SOME BACK
OR LOSE MORE?

474
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,252
Thank you.

475
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,154
-300 MILLION

476
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,124
This here is an honest pancake joint.

477
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,927
Black or white. White or Black.

478
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,637
GAMBLING HELPLINE
DIAL 1336 WITHOUT AREA CODE

479
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,975
HE CRASHED AND BURNED

480
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,511
Real money can only be gained
with blood and sweat,

481
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,779
not with dumb luck.

482
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,548
Let's have one Margherita.

483
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,050
-Margherita?
-Yeah.

484
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,885
I'll have one Margherita, please.

485
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,488
MARGHERITA, 250 MILLION

486
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,089
-Margherita!
-It's Sook's treat!

487
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,658
-I bet it will taste amazing!
-Here we go, Margherita!

488
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,826
-Awesome!
-Go, Sook, go!

489
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,828
Mouthwatering Margherita!

490
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,897
Mouthwatering Margherita coming right up.

491
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,599
That's taking up almost all my fortune.

492
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,334
THIS LADY LIVES FOR THE DAY

493
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,468
HUFFING AND PUFFING

494
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,371
AND YET…

495
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,308
THIS YOUNGSTER IS STRUGGLING IN
AGONY, REFUSING TO EAT OR DRINK

496
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,745
ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION

497
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,581
CLIP-CLOP

498
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
WHINNYING

499
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,417
WHINNYING

500
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,520
Stop neighing, will you?

501
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,523
REVOLTING THE HORSEY WAY

502
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,591
CRUMPLES

503
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,194
LET'S JUST EARN
THAT 50 MILLION QUICKLY

504
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,297
DELIVERY FAILED

505
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,933
NO, MY PRECIOUS
50-MILLION DELIVERY FEE!

506
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,602
You still need to return the horse.

507
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,670
CHEER UP, MASTER

508
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,606
-They're giving us free food.
-What, ramyeon?

509
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,376
-Yeah, it's on the house.
-That's incredible.

510
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,013
WOO-JAE FINALLY HAS
HIS FIRST MEAL OF THE DAY

511
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,849
SLURPING

512
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,117
WOLFING IT DOWN

513
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,221
HE MAKES HIS LIVING
FINE IN REAL LIFE…

514
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,891
Woo-jae must've been really starving.

515
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,594
I almost died,
watching you have pork belly.

516
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,229
-You should've joined us, then.
-Yeah.

517
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,397
You didn't have to fast.

518
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,565
I didn't have any money.

519
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,133
-As if.
-I don't buy it.

520
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,702
He's putting up an act, all right.

521
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,070
MR. ZERO-CREDIBILITY

522
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,138
FRUSTRATED

523
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,240
The path to becoming the heir is so rocky.

524
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,909
You can each take a turn

525
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,478
to receive the winnings
from the reputation surveys.

526
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,715
I wonder if I will gain or lose.

527
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,051
So the results aren't being shared.

528
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,955
PRIVATE ACCOUNTING SESSIONS
BEGIN NOW

529
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,390
STARTING OFF
WITH THE ELDEST MEMBER

530
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,960
Based on the surveys
on your personal brand,

531
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,028
you have earned two billion.

532
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,664
Two billion?

533
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,066
SAE-HO'S MOTHER

534
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,269
Who do you think would be
the best to promote Chanel, ma'am?

535
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,937
Sook, Kim Sook.

536
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,039
YOO SEON-HO, ACTOR

537
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,542
Rank my castmates on the likelihood
of their crying on dating shows.

538
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,745
-What about fifth place?
-Sook. I bet she'd never cry.

539
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,548
The person best suited to be the president
gets the fifth place.

540
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,616
KIM JAE-YEONG, MODEL

541
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,418
-Next up are you and then Sook.
-Oh, dang it. You little punk!

542
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,321
Hey, Car, the Garden.
Can you rank my castmates on…

543
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,856
Who'd buy their gift secondhand?

544
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,858
I'm giving Sook the fifth place.

545
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,027
Tell me, why do I get the first place?

546
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,963
LOVELY LUNCH HOUR
LEFT HER ONLY 80 MILLION

547
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,532
I was almost about to go broke.

548
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,335
This is the first time I'm seeing
my portrait on the one-billion bill.

549
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,771
I'll keep it safe with me. Thank you.

550
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,506
NEXT UP IS SAE-HO

551
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,742
Based on the surveys
on your personal brand,

552
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,410
you lost 50 million.

553
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,812
That means you have to pay 50 million.

554
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,683
I actually tightened the purse strings
like never before.

555
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,653
Now that I've become a family man,
I could restrain myself.

556
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,254
Still, what a bummer.

557
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,225
Let's find out the results
of your personal brand surveys.

558
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,726
You earned nothing.

559
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,828
ZERO

560
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,130
HA-HA

561
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,066
Should I be glad?

562
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,269
PROBABLY?

563
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,470
Now, Woo-jae…

564
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,005
-All right, Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

565
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:51,810
Let's discuss your earnings
from the personal brand survey results.

566
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,845
The results of all the surveys show

567
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,349
that you have lost 500 million.

568
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,719
You have lost one billion.

569
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,523
REMOVING ONE BILLION
FROM THE PACK

570
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,824
IS THAT ALL THAT'S LEFT?

571
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,131
Give him the car fare.
That's the decent thing to do.

572
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,133
Is that… It's one million won.

573
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,935
CAR FARE FROM EARLIER

574
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,805
THAT 1 MILLION
IS ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR HIM

575
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,507
But you never know, right?

576
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,010
Someone's balance might've hit zero.

577
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,512
-Is that all you have?
-Yeah.

578
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,980
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

579
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,315
I'm still in good shape, right?

580
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,550
I CAN'T BE IN THE LAST PLACE

581
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,221
WHO AMONG THESE TWO
RANKED LOWEST?

582
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,358
We're resuming the shoot after the sundae.

583
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,494
Sook must've received a huge sum.

584
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,995
This is the least I can do.

585
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,732
Oh, my. Look at that fat wad of cash!

586
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,600
-She's become a magnate.
-I saw two billion-won bills.

587
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,370
-Oh, yeah? Seriously?
-She has a couple of them.

588
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,472
The loser has already been narrowed down

589
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,241
to Jin-kyung and me.

590
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,810
You have one more game to go.

591
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,445
-Yeah.
-There's one more?

592
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,847
-Okay.
-We still have one more?

593
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:06,952
Has it been designed to make
a come-from-behind victory possible?

594
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,688
The prize money at each tier varies,
so it's possible.

595
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,756
Okay!

596
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,560
CURRENT STANDINGS - SOOK: 1.83B,
WOO-JAE: 1M, OTHERS: MYSTERY

597
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,396
GATHERED FOR THE FINAL CHANCE
TO TURN THE TABLES

598
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,663
I don't care what happens.

599
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,732
-I'm stuck down in this rabbit hole.
-Oh, really?

600
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,735
I'm actually resenting the directors
who didn't try to stop me.

601
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,803
Yeah, I feel you.

602
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,772
Culinary Guessing Wars' chef went too far.

603
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:27,839
-Yeah.
-In what way?

604
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,141
He was too good.

605
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,376
Frankly, it didn't look like
he was doing it on orders.

606
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,578
I'm sure he volunteered for the job.

607
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,747
SELF-ACTUALIZATION

608
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,518
Are the current numbers
enough to keep the viewers interested?

609
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,120
-I should think so.
-Really?

610
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,489
What do our assets
have to do with this setup?

611
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,324
-I'm wondering the same thing.
-All right…

612
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,759
What have they prepared this time?

613
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,595
Do you remember the message
from Chairman Do this morning?

614
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,365
When his children caused him scandal…

615
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,100
HE DISOWNED THEM
WITHOUT HESITATION

616
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,037
…he decided to disown them.
That shows his concerns about owner risks.

617
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,707
Do you see yourself as well-prepared
against potential risks?

618
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,476
I'm all about security.

619
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,278
-Hmm…
-I put it first and foremost.

620
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,313
Who then was the gambler from earlier?

621
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,116
On, no. Let's forget I said that.

622
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,451
Gambling is a disease, you know.

623
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,587
You end up betting it again and again
to win back the money you lost.

624
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,655
You lose your mind.

625
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,990
When Woo-jae finally joined us
at the table, his eyes were red.

626
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,325
SUNKEN EYES

627
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,595
-They were all bloodshot.
-Are you perhaps interested

628
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,198
-in a 500-million thigh wrestling?
-See?

629
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,532
He's in serious trouble.

630
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,569
CALL 1366 TO SEEK HELP
GAMBLING ONLY LEADS TO RUIN

631
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,206
We have one final mission left.

632
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,942
To remain unaffected
by the various possible risks,

633
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,411
chaebols need
a solid set of core muscles.

634
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,014
You're making a connection
between this and chaebol like that?

635
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,317
You will see two major threats before you.

636
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,485
A balloon to your front

637
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,886
and a bowl of flour to your back.

638
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,189
The participants of each round must wear
a headband studded with a pin

639
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,458
and do sit-ups.

640
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,229
Your game ends immediately
if you pop the balloon.

641
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:01,166
Even if your head gets covered in flour
or brushes upon the balloon,

642
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,669
you can continue on with the mission
as long as the balloon remains intact.

643
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,873
So basically, we can get away
with getting flour all over us?

644
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:08,940
That's correct.

645
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,276
You have a three-minute time limit.

646
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,946
Your rank will be decided
on the number of sit-ups you performed.

647
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,115
First place receives 1 billion.
Second place, 500 million.

648
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,216
Third place, 200 million.

649
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,852
Fourth place, 100 million.
Fifth place, none.

650
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,256
If I don't make it to Where Is My Home
tomorrow, make up a good excuse for me.

651
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,325
I'm going to go all out for this game.

652
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,160
Gee, I ate too much earlier.

653
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,529
It's going to be fine. Don't worry.

654
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,697
Can I take a dump before we begin?

655
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,165
-What's up with him?
-Are you serious?

656
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,334
-I'm ready to bust.
-Go take a bathroom break, then.

657
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,570
Let me give you a heads-up, Woo-young.

658
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,039
I just checked out the balloon myself.

659
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,340
EXAMINING THE WATER BALLOON

660
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,175
PUT A GRIN ON HIS FACE

661
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,877
It's filled with cold water.

662
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,012
-Really?
-Yeah.

663
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,614
-He's right about that.
-The moment you get splashed in it…

664
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,684
-Jeez, what is wrong with you?
-…you'll be shivering nonstop.

665
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,052
Okay. Let's do this.

666
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,122
The order can likely play
an important role here.

667
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,292
-I'll go first and lead by example.
-Oh, no. You can go later.

668
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,626
Sook.

669
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,562
-I'm penniless, okay?
-Shall I go first?

670
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,096
-Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
-Seconded.

671
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,698
-We'll let the winner decide.
-Okay.

672
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,500
-You snooze, you lose
-You snooze, you lose

673
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,302
SOOK, 5TH PLACE

674
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,304
Rock, paper, scissors. Okay.

675
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,105
WOO-JAE, 3RD PLACE
JIN-KYUNG, 4TH PLACE

676
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,607
WOO-YOUNG, 1ST PLACE
SAE-HO, 2ND PLACE

677
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,542
-I got third place.
-Take your pick.

678
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,846
I honestly don't think
my footage can be aired.

679
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,214
Are you going to poop?

680
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,151
I'm being serious.

681
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,186
You'd become a legend if you did.

682
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,423
Can you take my place for 500 million?

683
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,991
That's not a bad deal.

684
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,526
I can gladly take your place.

685
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,595
Count me interested too.

686
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,030
Are you really experiencing
some discomfort, Woo-young?

687
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,267
I'll try to keep myself in check,
but please cut off my MIC.

688
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,737
Talk about full disclosure, am I right?

689
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,973
EXPLORE WOO-YOUNG'S CHARMS

690
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,541
-So, make your choice.
-I'll go second.

691
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,809
-Second, huh?
-And you, Sae-ho?

692
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,011
-I'll go third.
-And you, Woo-jae?

693
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,647
Surely not first, right?

694
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,916
I'm sticking with my choice to go first.

695
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,618
-Really?
-He must feel confident.

696
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:00,752
I'll go last.

697
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,554
Okay, I'll go fourth
followed by Jin-kyung.

698
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,291
THE ORDER IS ALL SET UP

699
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,759
MAKING PREPARATIONS

700
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,161
Let me take that, Woo-jae.

701
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,596
NUDGES

702
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,199
WHISPERS

703
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,334
SNICKERING

704
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,371
SWAP PLACES STEALTHILY

705
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,306
How diabolical.

706
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,742
CASTMATES MAY CAUSE TROUBLE
WITH THE BALLOON

707
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,978
Anyway, how far do you have to raise
your torso to count as one sit-up?

708
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,179
Just a second.

709
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,681
I don't want Jin-kyung managing it.

710
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,982
It doesn't work that way.

711
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,751
Remember, I'm all about quid pro quo.

712
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,220
Keep that in mind, okay?

713
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,721
I'M GIVING IT UP, THEN

714
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,723
Let's play it fair today.

715
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,259
Yeah, we should be able
to count the sit-ups properly.

716
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,327
SPEECHLESS

717
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,162
-I'll wear it like this…
-You've done it correctly.

718
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,131
I should tighten it here, too.

719
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,867
THIS LADY STILL SEEMS
TO BE CLINGING TO HER DREAMS

720
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,435
WHISPERS

721
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,938
SCHEMING AGAIN

722
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,508
-You're switching places again?
-No way.

723
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,477
-If you pull this on me, I'll retaliate.
-Don't worry about it.

724
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,845
I'm not getting involved.

725
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,414
I'm way back here.

726
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,516
-Ready.
-All right.

727
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:05,850
Set…

728
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,553
HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE
GIVEN THE PENALTY

729
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,021
WITH ONLY 1 MILLION WON
IN HIS POSSESSION

730
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,524
GO

731
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,591
Okay. One.

732
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,827
-Two.
-Two.

733
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,962
-Three.
-Three.

734
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:19,898
Four.

735
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,100
-Five.
-He's doing so well.

736
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,269
-Six.
-No ducking or turning.

737
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,403
-Oh, man…
-Seven…

738
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,106
What on earth?

739
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,374
Seven…

740
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,508
What on earth?

741
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,511
Let's get back to the game…
Oh, look. He freaked out.

742
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,480
CAN THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?

743
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,615
-I thought this had popped.
-It held too much water.

744
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,218
-He got shaken real bad.
-That was terrifying.

745
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,321
That was a major shocker.
I'm so glad I didn't go first.

746
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,056
Are you okay, Woo-jae?

747
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,292
How are you holding up?

748
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,261
It was fortifying… I mean, horrifying.

749
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,297
My six sit-ups still count, right?

750
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,598
No, you have to start from scratch.

751
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,767
Oh, please.
My abs remember their hard work.

752
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,504
You had your legs placed
in the course of the balloon, right?

753
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,940
-Let's have the half count.
-All right.

754
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,675
-Give me four.
-Let's keep it at three.

755
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,977
-Give it a rest.
-Make it four, dang it!

756
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:10,281
Woo-jae must be feeling pretty desperate
seeing how adamant he is about that.

757
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,551
-You can't keep your legs in one place.
-That was rather pathetic.

758
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,819
Let's resume the game.

759
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,287
Ready, go.

760
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,956
Five.

761
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,290
-Six.
-Oh, man.

762
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,993
THE DESPERATION THAT DROVE
WOO-JAE TO CAUSE A SCENE

763
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,095
ALSO MADE HIM GIVE HIS ALL

764
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,630
-He's going for it.
-Twenty.

765
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,999
Twenty-one.

766
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,068
SPOOKED

767
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,871
-Twenty-four.
-He's good.

768
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,307
-Thirty.
-He's lasted for so long.

769
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,408
Thirty-one.

770
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,780
-Should I just wear that damned costume?
-Keep on going.

771
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,848
ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT
OF TAUNTING HIM

772
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,617
-Get back up.
-I could always wash my hair.

773
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,985
REPENTING HIS MISTAKES…

774
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,520
Forty. Wow, that's a big number.

775
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,055
…HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE GAME

776
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,457
Forty-seven.

777
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,192
Forty-nine.

778
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,660
-Fifty.
-Okay.

779
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,663
-Lie down.
-Stop.

780
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,731
SINKS DOWN

781
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,099
He's out.

782
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,267
PASSES OUT AFTER 50 SIT-UPS

783
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,269
Fifty sit-ups aren't an easy feat.

784
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,737
-What are you doing?
-You two…

785
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,072
Fifty sit-ups aren't an easy feat.

786
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,340
-What are you doing?
-You two…

787
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,577
WHAT DO THEY THINK
THEY'RE DOING?

788
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,979
-Oops. Sorry.
-Get back up already.

789
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,114
His time is up.

790
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,850
-Okay. He did a lot.
-Fifty sit-ups.

791
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,451
AND I CAN'T DO MORE…

792
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,519
My gosh. I mean…

793
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,055
Woo-jae must be at the bottom.

794
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,191
He's never gone all out like this.

795
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,026
He's leading this mission so far.

796
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,628
Shall we call it a day?

797
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,865
-Yeah, let's wrap it up.
-I'd like that.

798
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,834
-I'd be fine with that, too.
-Okay.

799
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,369
We can do that if we all drop out, right?

800
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,038
What was that?

801
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,675
But if Woo-jae wins one billion,
you might end up at the bottom.

802
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,444
I'll wear that costume, then.
I don't mind.

803
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,248
-That looks worse to me. I mean that.
-I'd rather take the costume too.

804
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,351
You'll receive the prize money
for your efforts, so it wasn't in vain.

805
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,087
-I'm giving up.
-Me too.

806
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,190
I'M TELLING MY MOM ON YOU

807
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,992
I'm really feeling off, guys.

808
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,060
What if I…

809
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,095
You can bleep things out
on Netflix, right?

810
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,431
NATURE'S CALL ISSUES

811
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,900
Your pants are brown, so you'll be fine.

812
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,368
-Yeah, you'll be all right.
-Darn it.

813
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,404
I haven't done sit-ups in ages.

814
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,440
WORRIED

815
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,507
Oh, no.

816
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,809
I had too much to eat.

817
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,377
What do I do? Just a minute.

818
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,979
-I'm so sorry.
-What was that for?

819
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,714
-Just a minute.
-I'm so sorry.

820
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,349
What was that for?

821
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,851
-Seriously, Jin-kyung!
-My bad.

822
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,454
Please get in position.

823
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,256
-Ready, go.
-You timed the balloon perfectly.

824
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,124
One.

825
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,425
Take pity on me. Two.

826
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,493
Two.

827
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,861
-Three.
-Three.

828
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,797
Ouch, my stomach. Four.

829
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,299
Five… Gee, my stomach hurts!

830
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,867
-Six.
-I might have to poop!

831
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,369
-Eight.
-Could I, though?

832
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,037
-Nine.
-Everyone, please leave.

833
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,839
-Eleven.
-Wait, I'm serious.

834
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,107
Twelve.

835
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,508
HOLD IT IN, OR YOU'RE DOOMED

836
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,576
-Fifteen.
-He's in danger.

837
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,777
Wait.

838
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,779
-Sixteen… Goodness.
-Oh, my.

839
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,482
HIS STOMACH HURTS,
AND THE BALLOON SCARES HIM

840
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,984
-You aren't sitting up properly.
-Fifteen.

841
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,252
Lift your torso further.

842
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,821
SPOOKED

843
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,291
BECOMING THE MAN
FROM MUNCH'S "THE SCREAM"

844
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,993
Lift up your upper body more.

845
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,563
THE HELLISH TRIFECTA OF WATER BALLOON,
NATURE'S CALL, AND FLOUR

846
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,631
-Your eyes--
-Oh, no!

847
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,366
-Your eyes--
-Oh, no!

848
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,902
AT LEAST HE AVOIDED
A MAJOR CRISIS

849
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,971
He did 29 sit-ups, right?

850
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,006
Did you poop your pants?

851
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,475
I did feel a little bit of release.

852
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,411
I felt the pop.

853
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,479
CHECKING HIS PANTS

854
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,547
Did I do 25?

855
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,615
-Can you tell us?
-Twenty-nine.

856
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,517
You did 29 sit-ups.

857
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,218
How on earth did I manage to do 50?

858
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,620
-Tell me about it.
-You did great.

859
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,121
I can't remember, actually.

860
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,923
You're all set.

861
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,758
Wow, the headband looks good on you.

862
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,294
-Jin-kyung's got a new glint in her eyes.
-Wait, guys…

863
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,063
There she goes again.

864
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,831
GRINNING EAR TO EAR ALREADY

865
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,566
-The swinging motion…
-Hold your hands like so.

866
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,034
-That's it.
-It's moving too fast.

867
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,336
-Back and forth.
-Way too fast.

868
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,671
-No, that's suitable.
-No way. It's too fast!

869
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,406
That's how it moved for me too.

870
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,874
Get ready.

871
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,343
-One.
-Sit up properly.

872
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,410
Two.

873
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,312
-Sit up properly.
-Two.

874
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,982
Three.

875
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,817
-You can't turn away from the balloon.
-Four.

876
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,952
THINGS ARE RUNNING SMOOTHER
THAN WE THOUGHT

877
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,088
-Six.
-One second.

878
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,155
Seven.

879
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,193
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE

880
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,527
SO HAPPY

881
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,196
Nine. Ten.

882
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,263
WE'RE AT YOUR SERVICE

883
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,199
TO DELIVER AN ENDLESS
BARRAGE OF SWINGS

884
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,667
Nine. Ten.

885
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:23,968
DEFENSELESS

886
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,036
Eleven.

887
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,208
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
THIS WAS INEVITABLE

888
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,012
-What on earth is this?
-Let's take it easy.

889
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,514
CALM DOWN AND SIT UP SLOWLY

890
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,549
THESE TROUBLEMAKERS
ARE OVER THE MOON

891
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,651
I teared up from laughing so hard.

892
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,853
THEIR VICTIM IS UPSET

893
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,088
You can't just do whatever you'd like.

894
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,189
TEARS

895
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,592
With games,
you have to have sportsmanship.

896
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,893
But you guys…

897
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,396
You acted like kids with an all-day pass
at an amusement park.

898
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,264
That just wasn't right.

899
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,666
The balloon didn't swing
back and forth like so.

900
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,535
Instead, it just swung down on you.

901
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,671
Those who play later have it worse.

902
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,908
That's why I urged you to go first.
I took my own advice.

903
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,577
AT ANY RATE, SAE-HO'S
RECORD IS 11 SIT-UPS

904
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,613
Am I wearing the headband correctly?

905
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,348
-You too will--
-Gosh, that's terrifying!

906
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,417
How on earth have you guys handled it?

907
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,985
-It's sheer terror.
-Oh, no.

908
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,054
-Wait! Just a second!
-Ready, go.

909
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,188
-Oh, no.
-One.

910
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,391
NARROWLY MISSING THE MARK

911
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,592
-Wait!
-Go on. Two.

912
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,760
I'm getting a gust of wind.

913
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,663
Come on, it's not fair to hang it
low enough to meet my hands.

914
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,665
Go on. Two.

915
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,733
Three.

916
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,001
ITS PURPOSE HAS
LONG BEEN FORGOTTEN

917
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,871
EMBRACE YOUR FATE

918
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,873
CIRCLING

919
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,142
Guys, it's moving in a circle!
It's so frightening!

920
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,852
THE BALLOON BLEW UP
ALMOST CHEERFULLY

921
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,587
That sound was incredible.

922
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,955
MISERABLE

923
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,091
I can't do this. It's just too hilarious.

924
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,659
CRYING HIS EYES OUT

925
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:58,429
HAPPINESS INDEX AT 100%

926
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,431
She stood no chance either, did she?

927
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,267
You guys shoved it right into my face.

928
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:07,138
But I swear Jin-kyung and I managed it
in a regular fashion. Don't you agree?

929
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,141
NO, YOU DIDN'T

930
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,410
The balloon spun round and round.

931
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,078
I didn't have enough room to move

932
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,048
-with it going in circles.
-That was priceless.

933
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,716
SOOK'S RECORD STANDS AT 7 SIT-UPS

934
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,885
-Oh, dear. It's getting to me.
-That was golden.

935
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,754
ONE CAST MEMBER SUDDENLY
REALIZED THAT IT'S HER TURN NOW

936
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,090
Jin-kyung, going last
won't be exactly good for you.

937
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,892
I had a blast so far,

938
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,128
but now my mood has turned sour.

939
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,431
Oh, I like it. It's set up perfectly.

940
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,333
It weighs just right and even looks cute.

941
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,102
Here's the thing, Jin-kyung.
We partnered up earlier for the balloon,

942
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,371
and you know that I keep a regular tempo.

943
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,772
So, I'm giving you a choice now.

944
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,840
I swear I won't pull tricks.

945
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:43,941
REALLY?

946
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,611
On the other hand…
Look at Sae-ho messing around.

947
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,483
RUNNING WILD

948
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,085
Shall we let him take the reins alone?

949
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,453
We're giving you a choice.

950
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,787
Pick two among us.

951
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,890
And? What do I get from choosing you?

952
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,525
-I won't mess around.
-Look at him go.

953
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,593
Just see what Sae-ho is up to.

954
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,728
I'M READY FOR TROUBLE 24/7

955
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,130
Woo-young and I
are roughly the same height.

956
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,198
Is that right?

957
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,733
-Then I'll go with you two.
-Okay.

958
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,067
Okay.

959
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,135
You don't like this?

960
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,937
Stop it. Just stop.

961
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,005
DO YOU EVEN HAVE TO ASK?

962
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,439
You look even taller lying down.

963
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,807
Get ready.

964
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,042
Take it easy, Jin-kyung.

965
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,810
-It's so frightening.
-Don't let it get to you.

966
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,078
But I'm terrified.

967
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,513
Your time starts now.

968
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,782
-Ready, go.
-Keep this tempo.

969
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,117
Just relax.

970
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,185
One.

971
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,520
-Two.
-Two.

972
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,455
-Three.
-Three.

973
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,890
You're doing great.

974
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:33,958
-Four.
-Four.

975
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,826
-It's still terrifying.
-Five.

976
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,528
-Three.
-Three.

977
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,696
A FURTIVE GLANCE

978
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,832
THE BALLOON STARTS TO MOVE
AT A MORE EXTREME ANGLE

979
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,635
CRUMPLED

980
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,477
EVERYONE RUNS AWAY

981
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,014
That wasn't us.
I swear we didn't do that.

982
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,883
It wasn't us.

983
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,952
-No…
-Yeah, that wasn't our doing.

984
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,090
BUT YOU DANGLED IT
DANGEROUSLY LOW FROM THE START

985
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,594
A BALLOON EATING SHOW

986
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,229
ITS IMPACT LINGERS

987
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,663
Where did he go?

988
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,565
-We made a heck of a show today.
-You're so mean.

989
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,800
COVERS UP HER MOUTH

990
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,969
Of all the things to eat,
you chose a balloon?

991
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,838
Why would you chew on it?

992
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,840
It popped so nice and neat.

993
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,076
-Deliciously so.
-It looked so cute, too.

994
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,012
AS REFRESHING AS
A SODA COMMERCIAL

995
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,648
AS THE HOUR GROWS LATE…

996
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,317
Let me announce the results of the game.

997
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,019
The winner is Woo-jae.

998
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,921
-Congrats. You won a billion.
-Gosh, that's insane.

999
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,489
Can we call it a win, though?

1000
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,891
That would help you avoid
placing at the bottom, at least.

1001
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,027
You can't say that.
You don't know how much I have.

1002
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,029
The runner-up is Woo-young.

1003
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,597
-How much does he get?
-You won 500 million.

1004
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,766
That might've gotten him to the top.

1005
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,535
In third place is Sae-ho.
Congrats, you won 200 million.

1006
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,471
What a bummer.

1007
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,406
Sook and Jin-kyung
are tied at fourth place.

1008
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,475
You'll both receive 100 million each.

1009
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,543
We did… I mean, we still did our best.

1010
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,346
Now, I'll announce the final results.

1011
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,248
We held Chaebol Heir Audition today.

1012
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,351
Let's find out the lucky chaebol heir

1013
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,322
set to receive a prize money
of one million won.

1014
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,659
I'll announce third place first.

1015
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,160
You're off the hook if you place third.

1016
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,628
It's sweet compared to lower ranks…

1017
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,997
-We only need to avoid being the loser.
-Yeah, exactly.

1018
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,066
-I'll announce third place.
-Let's hear it.

1019
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,367
Please let it be me.

1020
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,070
-It's better, nice and clean.
-Name me. I want to stay in the middle.

1021
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,472
-Congratulations, Sae-ho.
-Oh, yes!

1022
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,875
What a lucky guy.
But at the end of the day--

1023
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,911
-I'm not getting the penalty, right?
-That's correct.

1024
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,681
-You placed third after that 200 million?
-Yeah.

1025
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,915
So you didn't have much.

1026
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,650
And I've said so countless times!

1027
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,752
But I saw you holding
a bunch of 100-million-won bills.

1028
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,888
It wasn't a bunch. I only had a few.

1029
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,589
Next, I'll announce the runner-up.

1030
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,358
Congratulations, Woo-young.

1031
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,360
Maybe I was meant to place second today.

1032
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,330
-I'll now announce the winner.
-It must be Sook.

1033
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,397
That's for sure.

1034
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,032
He just won a billion.

1035
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,601
You're the chaebol heir, Sook!

1036
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,737
THERE WAS NO PLOT-TWIST
SOOK BECOMES DORA-GROUP'S HEIR

1037
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,472
But I didn't do much.

1038
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,341
You earned a lot
from the reputation surveys.

1039
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,942
Oh, the personal brand image…

1040
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,577
-All those calls…
-I see it now.

1041
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,313
Look. I won the final game
with 50 sit-ups,

1042
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,816
but I'm still struggling
to avoid placing last.

1043
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,852
Considering that the three of us
ranked pretty high,

1044
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,488
could we dress a bit nicely
for the next shoot?

1045
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,657
-No.
-No?

1046
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,359
He said no.

1047
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,793
How far do we have to go, then?

1048
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,429
You just made things awkward
for no reason.

1049
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,631
What exactly would we have to prepare?

1050
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,833
How far do we have to go?

1051
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,136
It is finally time to announce
the day's glorious loser.

1052
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,105
Here we have
the greatest rivals of Screwballs.

1053
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,606
They're a match made in heaven.

1054
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,807
OR A MATCH MADE IN HELL

1055
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,275
Who is the loser of the day?

1056
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,478
Congratulations, Jin-kyung.

1057
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,947
MIXED FEELINGS

1058
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,148
…Jin-kyung.

1059
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,216
GOT YOU, SCAREDY-CAT

1060
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,451
ROARS

1061
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,887
I'M SAFE!

1062
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,123
-Are you satisfied?
-She's lost all her energy.

1063
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,225
You must've been really low on funds.

1064
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,129
Would you look at that?
He saved himself with 50 sit-ups.

1065
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,430
Can you tell us how we fared?

1066
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,432
I'll tell you the numbers.

1067
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,834
The winner, Sook, had 1.93 billion.

1068
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,203
The runner-up, Woo-young,
had 1.145 billion.

1069
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,705
What? You little punk!

1070
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,908
Third place, Sae-ho, had 1.14 billion.

1071
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,178
Fourth place was Woo-jae.
He had 1.001 billion.

1072
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,346
So you weren't in the red.

1073
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,914
I only had a measly one million.

1074
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,550
-One million…
-This single bill was all I had.

1075
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,452
Turns out I always kept you company.

1076
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,021
Prepare to be amazed
by Jin-kyung's assets.

1077
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,390
-I wonder how much she had.
-Her final balance…

1078
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,526
stood at zero.

1079
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,294
-What happened to you?
-You had nothing?

1080
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,296
Before the final game,
she was 100 million in debt,

1081
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,198
but the 100-million prize money
balanced that out.

1082
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,267
So she came from nothing
and returned to nothing.

1083
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,568
-I suppose so.
-Back to square one.

1084
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,172
ALL DAY LONG,
SHE PUT HER PELVIS TO WORK

1085
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,508
AS WELL AS HER THIGHS
AND HER FACIAL MUSCLES

1086
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,644
DON'T FORGET HER HIP JOINTS EITHER

1087
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,480
SHE EVEN STOLE BITES
FROM SAE-HO'S DISH

1088
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,783
IT SEEMED LIKE
SHE WAS SAVING UP FINE

1089
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,652
That wasn't us.

1090
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,654
Her final balance stood at zero.

1091
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,989
I feel so bad for Jin-kyung.

1092
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,057
Moving on…

1093
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,294
Jin-kyung, your costume for the next shoot

1094
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,865
will be chosen by your castmates.

1095
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,733
I promise to pitch as many ideas as I can.

1096
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,102
Wait, Director. I have one request.

1097
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,606
Could you film our group chat
as we discuss her outfit of the day?

1098
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:19,376
Someone should be on watch
to prevent her from trying to tell us off.

1099
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,812
She may even call us privately.

1100
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:26,750
It is my pleasure to announce
Sook as Dora-Group's heir!

1101
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,152
-Congratulations!
-Way to go!

1102
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,088
-I see how it is.
-Sook, thanks for the sundae earlier.

1103
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,425
So I became the heir. Thank you, everyone.

1104
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,493
You weren't lying!

1105
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,895
Here's your reward,
one million won in cash.

1106
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,699
This is crazy. Can it be real?

1107
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,602
It's real.

1108
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,872
A BUNDLE OF REAL CASH

1109
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,939
MESMERIZED

1110
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,241
Oh, my. They weren't lying.

1111
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,243
-Why don't I count them for you?
-That's not necessary.

1112
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,512
It's hefty, all right.

1113
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,613
I'm holding one million won.

1114
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,348
I haven't touched cash in a long time.

1115
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,717
So you're not playing tricks
now that we're on Netflix.

1116
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,886
We barely fit that in an envelope.

1117
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,388
I'll use it for a good cause.

1118
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,825
I'm told that Dora-Group had arranged

1119
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,661
a full itinerary for their new heir.

1120
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,299
In fact, Chairman Do requested
that you attend an event immediately.

1121
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,600
SNORTS

1122
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,103
Please grace the event with your presence.

1123
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,538
-We'll be delighted.
-You mean Sook only?

1124
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,506
Not at all. Please attend it together.

1125
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,041
But Sook will be the star

1126
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,378
-while the others will be honored guests.
-Oh, we get it.

1127
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,748
-I thought winning was the end.
-Please head to the conference room.

1128
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,718
-It's a celebratory ceremony.
-You prepared all that? Wow.

1129
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,554
-Hey, Jin-kyung.
-Let's all move.

1130
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,023
Who would you be?
Han Ki-bum or Ha Seung-jin?

1131
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,091
She's dressed up as Mr. Han
many times already.

1132
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,128
THE HEIR'S LIFE
RUNS ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE

1133
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,195
Can we go right in?

1134
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,865
Sook, please take the center stage
and grace the event.

1135
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,501
Please open the doors
and walk in together.

1136
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,136
What kind of event…

1137
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,907
What kind of event…

1138
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,749
THE HEIR'S FIRST OFFICIAL OUTING
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS' NIGHT

1139
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,185
AN OMINOUS-LOOKING UNICORN

1140
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,759
THE FIRST PUBLIC EVENT SEEMS
TO HAVE MADE THE HEIR NERVOUS

1141
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,929
BUT HER GUESTS SEEM ELATED

1142
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,732
-Kim Sook!
-Kim Sook!

1143
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,801
A MEANINGFUL EVENT
FOR THE NATION'S

1144
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,736
7.66M SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

1145
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,906
WELL, THAT'S AWKWARD

1146
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,374
THE LOSERS ARE IN BETTER SPIRITS

1147
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,909
Way to go, guys!

1148
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,712
Thank you for coming, everyone.

1149
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,048
Let's welcome Ms. Kim Sook
with warm applause!

1150
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,250
HERE'S OUR CHAEBOL HEIR

1151
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,588
APPROACHING THE UNICORN DEMURELY

1152
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,824
She's come a long way today.

1153
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,893
-Please hop on, Sook.
-I haven't seen this in a long while.

1154
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,531
And now, Sook is on her way!

1155
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,301
DAWDLING

1156
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,170
SWOOSH

1157
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,174
ESCORTED TO THE MYSTERIOUS BOX

1158
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,513
"VLOG, A DAY
IN CHAEBOL HEIR'S LIFE"

1159
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,683
I should've gotten the hint
from the envelope.

1160
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,753
It somehow reminded me
of Experience All Walk of Life.

1161
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,621
I thought, "Wow, it's taking me back."

1162
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,759
So, Sook. You're here to perform
a great act of charity today.

1163
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,427
Can you tell us how you're feeling?

1164
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,863
"VLOG, A DAY IN
CHAEBOL HEIR'S LIFE"

1165
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:29,166
To be honest, I had a dream.

1166
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,701
I've had my eye

1167
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,703
-on this new tent, you see.
-I see.

1168
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,371
A new item…

1169
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:38,342
The prize money would've been just enough
to buy the tent and a stove.

1170
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,377
-So my shopping cart…
-You gave it a look.

1171
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,213
-I did so with joy, too.
-I see.

1172
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,448
But the truth is,

1173
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,150
my camping gear hardly matters.

1174
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,618
Let's give it up for Sook!

1175
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,087
I'll use it for a good cause.

1176
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,155
AND SHE FOUND ONE

1177
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,428
THAT'S THE WRONG ENVELOPE

1178
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,963
OBLIVIOUS, EVERYMAN CREW
CONTINUES TO CHEER FOR SOOK

1179
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,332
This isn't it. Where's the other envelope?

1180
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,400
-Sorry?
-The other one.

1181
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,802
-That holds two billion.
-I insist.

1182
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,004
-Don't use the game money.
-But that's worth two billion.

1183
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,106
-Come on. Take it out.
-Let's applaud Sook

1184
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,508
for making this generous decision.

1185
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,343
YOU ROCK, MY FRIEND

1186
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,080
HERE'S THE ENVELOPE
HOLDING REAL PRIZE MONEY

1187
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,981
I thought you might not do it.

1188
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,720
As for the others…

1189
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,787
SNEER, EMBARRASSED

1190
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,157
HER HANDS WERE FASTER
THAN HUMAN EYES

1191
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,659
She stole a few bills.

1192
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,561
She's kept exactly 100,000 won.

1193
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,263
That's for our dinner,
20,000 won per person.

1194
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,365
Even so…

1195
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:36,934
You still have to do the right thing.

1196
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,969
A DEEP SIGH

1197
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,638
I was truly happy,
if only for a short while.

1198
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,342
HALTS

1199
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,944
Let's give it up for Sook!

1200
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,647
OH, I ALMOST MISSED THAT

1201
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,118
AN UNASKED, UNEXPECTED DONATION

1202
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,186
For the small business owners!

1203
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,722
-Magnanimous like a true chaebol!
-Way to go!

1204
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,190
Chaebols are so noble!

1205
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,159
A TRUE ACT OF NOBLESSE OBLIGE

1206
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,594
WE CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE DONATED IT ALL

1207
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,530
You guys are really something.

1208
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,499
You're so sneaky.

1209
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,835
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS

1210
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,004
CLICHÉ IN CHAEBOL SHOWS

1211
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,372
One, two, three.

1212
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,440
IT WAS JUST A DREAM

1213
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,075
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work, everyone.

1214
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,744
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS
-SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

1215
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,048
Thank you for coming all this way.

1216
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,817
CAST AND CREW
OF SCREWBALLS LAND IN BUSAN

1217
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,852
-Today's theme is "Besties Trip in Busan."
-"Besties Trip"?

1218
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,821
-Today may be therapeutic.
-That's Busan for you!

1219
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,523
You're not from Busan, actually.

1220
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,491
So why are you playing the know-it-all?

1221
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,226
Are you picking a fight this early?

1222
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,828
I won't ever try it with Woo-jae again.

1223
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:38,896
Crackers.

1224
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,032
I've been meaning to say that, you jerk!

1225
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,300
-What is 6 times 8?
-It's 48.

1226
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,935
-What is 7 times 9?
-Oh, come on.

1227
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,537
FORGET ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

1228
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,871
ANY LOSS TRIGGERS AN UPROAR

1229
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,239
I'm so mad.

1230
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,875
Just what about this trip
screams friendship?

1231
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:52,943
AND YET…

1232
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,044
What are you doing?

1233
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,180
A LIFE WITHOUT FRIENDS
CAN BE MONOTONOUS

1234
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,382
Here's one going your way.

1235
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,650
That can drive anyone mad.

1236
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,553
A DANGEROUS JOURNEY
TO BE REUNITED WITH FRIENDS

1237
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,422
AN EPIC JOURNEY
TO REBUILD FRIENDSHIP

1238
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,690
What's that? Goodness.

1239
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,225
TO OVERCOME
THE DIFFICULTIES AHEAD,

1240
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,927
THEY MUST JOIN THEIR FORCES

1241
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,795
-Gosh, it's nerve-racking.
-It's okay, Woo-jae.

1242
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,664
HEARTWARMING TEAMWORK OF FRIENDS

1243
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,766
AS ALWAYS, THEIR FRIENDSHIP…

1244
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,167
GROWS STRONGER
AFTER A ROUGH PATCH

1245
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,102
-We have such a strong bond.
-Tell me about it.

1246
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,139
BESTIES TRIP IN BUSAN
