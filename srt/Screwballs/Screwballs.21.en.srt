1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,105
A FAIRY-TALE-LIKE NIGHT
SURROUNDED BY SHIMMERING LIGHTS

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,174
THE GRAND FINALE TO SOOK'S
30TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER CAREER

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,644
A milestone party is not complete
without good music and dance.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,546
We'll now have special performances.

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,614
Okay.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,517
Good music is a must.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,154
To lighten up Sae-ho's load
of being the resident MC,

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,756
Sook's die-hard fans,

9
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,224
Woo-jae and Woo-young,

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,226
-volunteered to be the MCs for the night.
-Really?

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,594
I see the script over there.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,596
-Do we get any compensation?
-Compensation?

13
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,531
-There's none.
-Did you say we "volunteered" for this?

14
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,599
"Compensation"?

15
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,666
JUST DO IT

16
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,101
Two, three.

17
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,972
The sheer volume of contents
matches that of Open Concert.

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,373
HEH-HEH

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,675
GRAND OPENING TO THE CELEBRATION
THROWN IN SOOK'S HONOR

20
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,778
All right, Hello, everyone.

21
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,079
PLEASED

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,248
Dear viewers of Screwballs,

23
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:53,086
it's an honor to have you join us
for Kim Sook's 30th anniversary party.

24
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,623
Let's give it up for Sook!

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,659
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER POSTURE
SCREAMS PURE CLASS

26
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,194
LOUDER!

27
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,831
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
I'm your host, Woo-jae.

28
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,599
I'm his cohost, Woo-young.
It's a pleasure.

29
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,670
ALL THESE A-LISTERS RUSHED OVER
TO CELEBRATE SOOK'S MILESTONE

30
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,839
Man, I've been in the showbiz industry

31
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,374
for 11 years now.

32
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,975
-That's a long while.
-Out of those years,

33
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,412
I've worked with Sook for eight years.

34
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,714
I've been seeing her almost weekly
for eight long years.

35
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,349
She's like a sister to me.

36
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,921
Sook is my most trusted colleague
and my nearest and dearest friend.

37
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,290
I welcome this honorable opportunity

38
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,460
to cohost the party
celebrating the 30th year of her career.

39
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,828
-It's an honor, Sook.
-Gosh, Woo-jae.

40
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,498
And to our dear crew
who gave us this opportunity,

41
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,533
I hope you'll consider compensating us.

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,868
There he goes again.

43
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,637
Get those youngsters back in line,
will you?

44
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,039
I'll see what I can do.

45
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,007
Without further ado,

46
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,177
we'll introduce Ms. Kim Sook,
the woman of the hour.

47
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,513
A SUMMARY OF
THE 30-YEAR CAREER OF KIM SOOK,

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,581
THE LEGENDARY COMEDIAN

49
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,516
Introducing Kim Sook.

50
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,318
Born in Busan on July 6th, 1975.

51
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,954
She's the youngest
of the five daughters in the family.

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,126
She first debuted in 1995
as the 12th cohort of KBS comedians.

53
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,393
But then…

54
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,464
she had to spend seven years
only playing minor roles,

55
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,666
and even those were hard to keep.

56
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,635
-Right.
-The rookie's only friend

57
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,437
to console her at this time

58
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,105
was three packs of cigarettes.

59
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,975
Why would you bring that up?

60
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,544
Hey, stick to the script.

61
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,980
It's in the script, and it's all true.

62
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,548
You even got the number right.

63
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,616
SHE'S A NONSMOKER NOW

64
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,619
She was nicknamed the screwball
of the Comedian Department at the time,

65
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,487
and she created a character
based on herself.

66
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,723
"You got a crush on me or what?"

67
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,124
That was my line back then.

68
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,793
Her bratty girl character
unlocked her hidden charms

69
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,129
and had the whole nation
fall in love with her.

70
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,265
After that,
she had another hit with Nanda Kim,

71
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,867
singing the song, "Lend Me 40 Million."

72
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,503
It seemed like success
was all but guaranteed.

73
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,540
But she was put to the test yet again.

74
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,675
Believing that there were
no more roles she could play,

75
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,877
she was about to seek asylum overseas.

76
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,345
But her friend and colleague of 20 years,

77
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,549
Song Eun-i suggested
that they do a podcast together.

78
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,250
THEIR SHOW BLEW UP
AND BECAME A GREAT SUCCESS

79
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,187
She's always been bold and big-hearted…

80
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,655
Gosh, this is one of her finest works.

81
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,558
She appeared alongside Yoon Jung-soo
on a show as a pretend couple.

82
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,761
-That was a wild hit.
-"It's unseemly

83
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,429
for a guy to raise his voice!"

84
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,832
That was only the first entry
to the long list of her iconic lines.

85
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,736
Her subversive jokes enchanted the public,
who gave her the nickname, "Sook Crush."

86
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,271
-In 2016…
-I took my sweet time.

87
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,573
…she was named the Best Female Performer

88
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,541
in Variety Shows
at the Baeksang Arts Awards,

89
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,410
officially ending her years of obscurity,

90
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,146
and she's had major successes
with every show she's ever appeared in.

91
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,615
Then, in 2020,

92
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,952
she was honored with the Grand Prize
in the KBS Entertainment Awards.

93
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,120
I texted her congratulations
while I was watching that show.

94
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,790
She received the highest honor
for a Korean entertainer.

95
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,525
And now, in 2025,

96
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,428
she's breaking into the global market
along with Screwballs.

97
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,364
She continues to be a role model
for many in the industry

98
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,801
-and a great friend to her subscribers.
-A shoutout to my subscribers?

99
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,569
She's just desperate.

100
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,271
Still desperate to amaze the crowd.

101
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,672
Let's give it up for Sook!

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,175
-All right, Sook!
-Yeah!

103
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,444
THAT'S ENOUGH,
YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH

104
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,912
INVITING THE CREW TO DO THE WAVE

105
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,048
Make some noise!

106
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,317
CUTESY LITTLE SHOW

107
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,518
Look at them acting up.

108
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,720
Look at them.

109
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,155
-What's wrong with them?
-They're overdoing it.

110
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,857
The second-hand embarrassment
is killing me.

111
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,092
-All right.
-Geez, my back hurts.

112
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,327
-Let's move on to the next segment.
-"The next segment"?

113
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,496
It says the table and the items
should be brought in.

114
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,266
So we have to bring those in? Okay.

115
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,367
SCURRYING OVER

116
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,737
-Let's roll.
-No, the table's in position. Leave it.

117
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,372
-This is where it's supposed to be?
-Yeah.

118
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,208
We have special performances lined up.

119
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,610
My gosh. What a bold choice.

120
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,345
WHAT IS IT?

121
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
Let's skip it.

122
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,217
-Tell us what it is.
-It must be RADO's song.

123
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,353
Jin-kyung will be singing
"Poison" by Uhm Jung-hwa.

124
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,688
You're doing what?

125
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,224
-For real?
-That's what the script says.

126
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,725
You're good with difficult songs, huh?

127
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,193
-You think so?
-Yeah, I can't wait.

128
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,762
For the opening performance,

129
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,564
Jin-kyung will grace the stage.

130
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,767
Please welcome her with a big applause.

131
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,737
SENSING A GROWING UNEASE

132
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,640
"POISON" BY UHM JUNG-HWA
SUNG BY JIN-KYUNG FOR SOOK

133
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,809
SHE EVEN CHANGED HER WIG

134
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,444
What's with the sound system?

135
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,681
IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
LET'S CHECK HER VOCAL ABILITIES

136
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,683
POP

137
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,084
AN IMPACTFUL ENTRANCE

138
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,487
OH!

139
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,622
SNICKERS

140
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,191
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR 30TH ANNIVERSARY, SOOK

141
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,327
UNNATURAL, DISJOINTED MOVEMENTS

142
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,795
AND A PERFECT
STAGE-READY EXPRESSION

143
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,597
HEH

144
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,735
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS, SOOK?

145
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,070
Is that the right dance move?

146
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,638
-She's got it wrong.
-Isn't it this?

147
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,707
SNORTS

148
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,742
SHE'S TOSSING HER HAIR
NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY

149
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,577
SHOWING SUPPORT BY DANCING ALONG

150
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,381
I left you behind

151
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,150
I left you behind

152
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,618
BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER

153
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,387
SNORTS

154
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,589
AN ABSOLUTE FIASCO

155
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,158
Just a second.

156
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,760
-Hold on.
-I'm sorry.

157
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,896
THE TWO MCS ARE DISPATCHED
TO HANDLE THE EMERGENCY

158
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,832
-I'm sorry.
-Just a second.

159
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone, please be careful of the poison.

160
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,469
It's spreading in the air. Be careful.

161
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,838
-It was really toxic.
-Give us a second.

162
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,673
-We need some time to check.
-I'm sorry.

163
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,842
-Are you Ms. Hong Jin-kyung?
-Yes.

164
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,009
-Let me try again.
-All right.

165
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,611
-Excuse me.
-Sorry about that.

166
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,979
Could you tell us

167
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,248
if you had made any preparations

168
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,050
or if you were winging it

169
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,186
-on the spot?
-Is your conscience free of guilt?

170
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,955
I'm sorry. It's just…

171
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,257
It's been a while since I last sang this.
I apologize.

172
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,425
Let me try properly this time.

173
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,360
-It's your last shot.
-Understood.

174
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,895
Try to hit the first note at least.

175
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,564
If you miss the beat again this time…

176
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,000
-I get what you mean.
-…we can't let you sing again.

177
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,935
-I hope you'll keep this in mind.
-Of course.

178
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,871
-We'll play the song right away.
-Okay.

179
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,205
CHORTLING

180
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,542
IS THIS THE OLYMPICS OR WHAT?
ANYWAY, HERE GOES THE 2ND ROUND

181
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,978
Let's give it up for Jin-kyung!

182
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,347
A SECOND CHANCE
ONLY AVAILABLE TO TAPED SHOWS

183
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,515
SHE'S GOING TO SHOW THEM ALL

184
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,418
MISSED THE BEAT

185
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,019
SNICKERS

186
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,289
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING GOOD
FROM THE START

187
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,458
STILL, SHE'S MADE IT
INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE!

188
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,861
BUT WHY IS SHE WALKING BACKWARD?

189
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
Why is she walking backward?

190
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,998
-She turned around the last time.
-Right.

191
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,466
It's a total mess.

192
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,437
She made no preparations whatsoever.

193
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,740
CONTINUES TO PERFORM DESPITE
THE DISTRUST AND ACCUSATIONS

194
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,643
Shouldn't she at least do this move?

195
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,711
COPIES HIM IMMEDIATELY

196
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,547
I left you behind

197
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,916
And walked away

198
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,018
To save you from your guilt

199
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,085
IS SHE BLEATING?

200
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,887
Tears were building up

201
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,422
But I didn't want to show it

202
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,158
That's why I had to leave early

203
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,226
HA-HA

204
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,663
I knew this day would come

205
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,233
The day when our love ends

206
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,636
TECHNICALLY,
THIS IS AS A MAJOR BLUNDER

207
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,338
Our misplaced love was doomed

208
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:57,109
As the heavens would never allow it

209
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,546
Please tell her

210
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,549
-That I apologized
-That I apologized

211
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,285
-I took away her happiness
-I took away

212
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,188
Her happiness

213
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,624
Her happiness

214
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,192
CRACKING UP

215
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,260
She's playing with notes.

216
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,964
Don't hurt another this way

217
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,701
It was bad enough that I suffered

218
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,504
THE SET OUTSHINES THE TALENT
ON STAGE

219
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,407
Return to her arms

220
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,942
THE WOMAN OF THE HOUR IS HAPPY

221
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,079
RECREATING KIM JONG-MIN'S
"V-MAN" MOVES

222
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,146
What are you doing?

223
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,214
-You don't know this?
-What is it?

224
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,916
So you don't know much about this song.

225
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,618
The karaoke machine gave you zero points.

226
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,487
THE FIRST PERFORMANCE
ENDED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL MISHAP

227
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,089
You're the best, Jin-kyung.

228
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,493
-Who's next?
-Allow me to present the next performer.

229
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,029
Unfortunately, Jin-kyung
wasn't informed of the talent show

230
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,798
and didn't get to prepare anything
in advance.

231
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,768
-What now?
-She'll do her part

232
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,272
by providing funny reactions
to her costars' performances.

233
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,908
-What seems to be the problem?
-I just performed "Poison."

234
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,809
-Excuse me?
-I sang "Poison."

235
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,645
Remember the toxic performance?

236
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,080
I performed just earlier.

237
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,348
Let's welcome Woo-jae,

238
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,851
the first performer of the night!

239
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,719
Woo-jae's singing alone?

240
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,656
Yes, that's right.
Woo-jae here has had a long history

241
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,358
working along with Sook.

242
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,395
That's why he volunteered
to do a solo performance for you.

243
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,531
Out of the 11 years he spent
being on variety shows,

244
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,267
you were there with him
for eight long years.

245
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,071
Woo-jae said he owed you so much

246
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,539
on various occasions.

247
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:38,711
Apparently, he chose this song
because it reminded him of you.

248
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,382
I hope Sook will appreciate the lyrics.

249
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,851
I'll pour all my heart
into the performance.

250
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,522
In a sense, it's my letter to Sook.

251
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,759
Why don't you come onto the stage
for this special performance?

252
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,295
Like a marriage proposal,

253
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,530
-he'll sing--
-What?

254
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,565
FLUSTERED FUTURE GROOM

255
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,168
That's so not what I had in mind.

256
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,936
We'll set up the scene

257
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,638
-like a marriage proposal.
-Drop the shy act.

258
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,973
-Cut it out.
-Can I get a chair?

259
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,040
WHAT DID I DO?

260
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,976
I had a different idea in mind.

261
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,043
Please take a seat.

262
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
This is far from what I had planned.

263
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,846
Here's your seat.

264
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,248
HE MEANT TO SAY THIS
BACK IN APRIL

265
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,383
Sook!

266
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,652
I realize we only met tonight,

267
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,153
but I must tell you how I feel.

268
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,288
These two decided to go out together.

269
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,924
HE DIDN'T GET TO SHARE
BECAUSE OF THE OTHERS

270
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,326
Let's give those two the room.

271
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,528
Why did I become your target?

272
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,796
GO AHEAD AND ASK ME OUT

273
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,632
Why are you putting me on the spot?

274
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,066
Just do it.

275
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,601
Focus on the words, Sook.

276
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,069
The song's lyrics

277
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,904
are his letter to you.

278
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,742
"COMING OF AGE STORY"
BY LEE MU-JIN

279
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,243
SUNG BY WOO-JAE FOR SOOK

280
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,946
THEY HAVE BUILT
A SIBLING-LIKE BOND

281
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,081
FROM WORKING TOGETHER
FOR 8 YEARS

282
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,418
WOO-JAE CHOSE
TO EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE

283
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,120
FOR SOOK THROUGH THE LYRICS

284
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,190
DEAR SOOK

285
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,127
We're at a wonderful age

286
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,295
Though on the slightly young side

287
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,731
We have so many things to try
And paths to tread

288
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,734
On top of things we must do

289
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,204
We're like a wild card
Among brick-wall certainties…

290
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,775
8 LONG YEARS HAVE PASSED
SINCE THE AWKWARD FIRST MEETING

291
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,146
BUT HE CAN NOW BE FORGIVEN
FOR THROWING HER ON THE FLOOR

292
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,415
We rose to the surface
Even after the plunge

293
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,917
Our hearts felt full even when exhausted

294
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,522
We have made it through
Countless days together

295
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,925
OLD MEMORIES HAVE BECOME FAINT
LIKE A SMALL DOT

296
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,194
IF I COULD TRAVEL TIME
AND MEET YOU BACK THEN

297
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,330
I WOULD COMFORT YOU
WITH WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT

298
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,367
YOU WERE LIKE
A YOUNG BUD BACK THEN

299
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,136
AND YOU'RE NOW IN FULL BLOOM

300
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:49,008
THIS IS THE MESSAGE
WOO-JAE WANTED TO TELL SOOK

301
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,677
I'm not avoiding

302
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,814
The source of the gentle swells

303
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,884
Because I don't know where they surge up

304
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,186
ALL THAT LISTENING'S
MAKING ME STIFF

305
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,787
That's not the vibe of this song.

306
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,056
A flight toward the clouds

307
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
MASK OF DETERMINATION

308
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,260
Might give you worries

309
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,395
A LIGHT WARMUP

310
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,898
HE'S NEVER ASKED FOR ANY GUESTS

311
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,836
BUT EVERYONE'S GETTING READY
TO JOIN HIM ON STAGE

312
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,871
SINGS HIS HEART OUT NONETHELESS

313
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,908
Let's soar

314
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,611
THE INTERLUDE IS PLAYING

315
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,146
The idea was…

316
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,482
that she'd listen to the lyrics…

317
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,817
AFTER THE MOVING FIRST VERSE

318
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,653
COMES THE NATURAL TRANSITION

319
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,422
I was hoping she'd be moved…

320
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,291
We're at a wonderful age

321
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,127
But we're still too young

322
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,194
LIVELY SECOND VERSE

323
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,797
DEAR TEAM,
THE TIGHT SHOOTING SCHEDULE

324
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,999
SOMETIMES FILL ME WITH DREAD

325
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,402
I WONDER IF THE FOOTAGE
WILL TURN INTO A FILLER EPISODE

326
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,005
OR A GREAT EPISODE
THAT MANY REMEMBER FOR YEARS

327
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,374
IT'S NEVER EASY TO TELL

328
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,842
BUT WE SHOULD STILL WORK HARD

329
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,644
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE WAY OF SCREWBALLS

330
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,147
Some took the upward road
While others took the downward path…

331
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,682
SHY SOOK SHOWS HER APPRECIATION
WITH HER HOOP TRICK

332
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,419
Though the loneliness is growing

333
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,654
A DAY FILLED WITH GRATITUDE

334
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,090
We can reach our destination
As long as we keep going

335
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,626
While we take this journey
Between our stop and the onset

336
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,896
Let's take a pause
Under the shade by the wayside

337
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,065
EVEN AS HIS COSTARS
CAUSE A SCENE

338
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,301
WOO-JAE STILL TRIES TO MOVE THEM

339
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:27,206
THEY MAY LACK THE TACT,
BUT THEY DO HAVE AMAZING GIFTS

340
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,209
WOO-JAE DREAMS OF
ANOTHER TRENDING VIDEO

341
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,944
AFTER HIS SUCCESS
WITH "TO REACH YOU"

342
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,847
BUT OTHERS ARE TRYING
TO CREATE A TRENDING VIDEO

343
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,915
IN A DIFFERENT GENRE

344
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,483
I'm trying to move you here!

345
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,152
At our last goodbye

346
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,390
YEEHAW!

347
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,860
HEH-HEH

348
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,763
"KEEP IT COOL, YOU'RE KAZEHAYA"

349
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,168
When time passes
This will be remembered as a great moment

350
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:02,308
Though it may feel a bit bittersweet

351
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,211
HE PROBABLY FINDS
THIS VERY BITTERSWEET

352
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,180
The faded memories of the stories

353
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,683
Are what make them more glorious

354
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:15,621
Will the future we have longed for
Be waiting for us too?

355
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,257
One thing is for certain

356
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,327
We'll shine brighter than ever

357
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,495
This is just our beginning

358
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,364
SHE MISSED THAT

359
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,367
To the highest point of the world…

360
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,973
Dang it. It's screwed, all right.

361
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,944
TOO DEVOTED TO PROVIDING
A SPECTACLE

362
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,447
HE'S GIVEN UP NOW

363
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,716
IT MAY SEEM OUT OF ORDER

364
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:50,689
BUT THE TEAM'S JOURNEY
CONTAINS A PACK OF FUN

365
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,792
PUNCHING THE AIR

366
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,562
MANAGES TO DO HIS FINISHING MOVE

367
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,230
I had so much fun.

368
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,332
-Great work, everyone.
-It was amazing.

369
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,700
Good work, guys.

370
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,603
"YOU DID GREAT, WOO-JAE"

371
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,071
Man, that was great.

372
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,140
-Were you moved?
-Of course.

373
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,208
-It was great.
-And the lyrics?

374
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,976
Let's give Woo-jae a big hand.

375
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,678
Did you focus on the lyrics?

376
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,847
-That wasn't necessary. You were great.
-We loved it.

377
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,682
-That was amazing.
-We really loved it.

378
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,617
It was really touching.

379
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,686
-Truly--
-You get ideas of how the shoot would go

380
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,454
before coming in, right?

381
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,356
That just now was so far
from what I had pictured.

382
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,595
Woo-jae has had success
with his recent trending video.

383
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,864
-Oh, that's true.
-I couldn't even sing properly.

384
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,100
Let's dive right into
the second performance.

385
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,303
Oh, so this guy
is getting ready for a show.

386
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,205
I believe he came here
to break his own record.

387
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,273
He's singing this song?

388
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,208
Currently, his cover video of "If You"

389
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,712
has about 7.3 million views on YouTube.

390
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,681
-It was all the rage.
-It's a legendary video.

391
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,282
-What an incredible number.
-If you

392
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,917
THE VIDEO WITHOUT SOOK
HAS ABOUT 640,000 VIEWS

393
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,187
RADO is the man
behind the sensational cover of "If You."

394
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,222
Can I step up now?

395
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,158
Sure, step up and leave. It's that way.

396
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,793
-I have to ask.
-Go ahead.

397
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,795
Did you come to congratulate Sook
or for something else?

398
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,596
For both, I should say.

399
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,065
-For both, huh?
-That's right.

400
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,132
Tell us about your song.

401
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,835
Sook is celebrating
the 30th year of her career, right?

402
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,103
-Indeed.
-So…

403
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,139
I picked a song with lyrics
that suited her.

404
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,541
It's Jung-in's "Rainy Season."

405
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,878
There's a line that goes, "You're my sun."

406
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,347
-That's lovely.
-That's why I chose it.

407
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,881
I'll be singing it in its original key.

408
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,184
-Without adjustment?
-Yeah.

409
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,552
Please remove the vocal guide.

410
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,021
Why don't we turn off the lights?

411
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,423
You're turning the lights
of Lotte World down for this?

412
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,894
I love the echo here.

413
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,730
-Let's roll.
-Okay.

414
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,332
To think we're turning off the lights
of this amusement park…

415
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,400
SPECIAL TREAT JUST FOR SOOK

416
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,035
"Rainy Season."

417
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,438
DON'T FORGET TO TAKE
YOUR UMBRELLA OR RAINCOAT

418
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
IN THIS RAINY SEASON

419
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,443
I love this song!

420
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,645
"RAINY SEASON" BY JUNG-IN
SUNG BY RADO FOR SOOK

421
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,218
I'm letting you go

422
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,120
That's a really high note.

423
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,891
So you won't get weary

424
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,599
I'll wait

425
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:21,240
Until I can forget you

426
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,347
You won't ever return to me

427
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,884
You will never return

428
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:38,223
And I know it all too well

429
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:44,430
But I still can't help but wait for you

430
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:49,735
My foolishness is making me mad

431
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,773
And the tears won't stop running

432
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,612
You're my sun

433
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,583
After you left

434
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,620
Raindrops won't stop falling from my eyes

435
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:13,859
That must've triggered the start

436
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:18,230
Of the endless rainy season

437
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:23,302
The rain just won't stop

438
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,704
THE CHILLS WON'T STOP
RUNNING DOWN MY SPINE

439
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:32,711
If you ever returned to me

440
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,817
I would never let you go

441
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
Thank you.

442
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,990
-You killed it, dude!
-Way to go!

443
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,058
That was a killer!

444
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,129
First off, I want to say
my congratulations on your milestone.

445
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,998
Continuing to work in your line of work
for 30 years straight

446
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,067
is a miracle in itself.

447
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,468
I hope you'll stay in good health.

448
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,204
Please reach out to me
if you ever have an opening for me.

449
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,339
-Thanks for coming.
-Any time.

450
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,640
Come join us again.

451
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,142
-Thank you.
-No problem.

452
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,744
The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call…

453
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,812
What's he up to now?

454
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,080
-Who was he again?
-Baek Kang-hyuk.

455
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,448
Right. Baek Kang-hyuk signing off.

456
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,483
He couldn't remember the name?

457
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,186
-Goodbye.
-He forgot the lyrics he wrote

458
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,888
and the name of the character
he dressed up as.

459
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,189
Go see a doctor.

460
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,126
-The party is nearing its end.
-Right.

461
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,897
A perfect song for this milestone party
just came to my mind.

462
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,666
-It's "She's Smiling" by Kim Hyung-joong.
-That's a good one!

463
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,502
-Here's to hoping Sook will smile more.
-I love the idea.

464
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,937
That's why I thought of this.

465
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,138
Here I go.

466
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,840
WOO-JAE'S LAST SONG FOR SOOK

467
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,548
EVEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT

468
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,017
Maybe I should sing a pop ballad too.

469
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,485
Who's that? Someone's on stage.

470
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,120
What? What's going on?

471
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,022
Who's that? Someone's on stage.

472
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,124
What? What's going on?

473
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,559
WHO IS THAT BEHIND WOO-JAE?

474
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,194
-What on earth?
-What's going on?

475
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,396
WOO-JAE HAS RETURNED TO HIS SEAT

476
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,463
What now?

477
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,272
It was in 1975

478
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,309
that I welcomed

479
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,512
the most precious being into my life.

480
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,883
CELEBRATION OF THE 30TH YEAR
IN SOOK'S CAREER

481
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,552
AND THIS IS
THE TRUE GRAND FINALE

482
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,824
A STORY TOLD BY
THE YOUNG COMEDIANS OF KBS

483
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,229
Goodness, my youngest is so adorable.
Look at her smiling.

484
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,430
JULY 6TH, 1975 IN BUSAN

485
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,834
I hope your life is full of days
where you get to smile.

486
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,909
There you go
Keep on smiling just like that

487
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:48,413
You're the prettiest
Among all the smiling girls

488
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,284
-What on earth?
-You would wave your hands to say no

489
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:57,055
But you would still smile
Like you're happy and enjoying it

490
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:02,127
And you're the sunlight of my life

491
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,831
What on earth is this?

492
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,238
-Dad.
-There you are, Sook.

493
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,241
-They're fellow comedians.
-You cute little thing.

494
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,176
-Dad.
-Wait, guys.

495
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,812
Isn't she too pretty to play Sook?

496
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,514
She's supposed to be me?

497
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,651
That's how you look to your dad.

498
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,586
All right, dear Sook.

499
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,887
-Dad.
-You grew up so quickly.

500
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,124
I'm going to be a comedian
when I grow up, Dad.

501
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,426
No way!

502
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,229
You have no idea how challenging it is
to make it as a comedian.

503
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,965
I won't let you. Why would you want
that thorny path for yourself?

504
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,833
Come on!

505
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,335
HER DAD DOESN'T WANT HER
TO TAKE THE HARD PATH

506
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:49,841
I never minded the bloodshot eyes
From pulling all-nighters

507
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:54,680
The thoughts of making you laugh
Would make me excited enough

508
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,717
I didn't want to get tongue-tied

509
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,854
So I learned every single word
Of the funny stories

510
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:07,392
I even did rehearsals
So my jokes wouldn't sound staged

511
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,696
SOOK STILL CLUNG TO HER DREAM
DESPITE HER FATHER'S CONCERNS

512
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,465
My answer is still no.

513
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,734
He would say,
"Who are you to become a comedian?"

514
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:16,802
He was very against it.

515
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,904
I kept it a secret.

516
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,440
I told him I was going out with a friend.
Then, I came to Seoul.

517
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,507
BUT SHE KEPT ON DREAMING

518
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,343
Some even fail ten auditions in a row.

519
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,945
It's impossible
to become a comedian overnight.

520
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,014
Dad, I passed the audition!

521
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,215
You did?

522
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,150
How is that possible?
You made it on your first try?

523
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,153
Hello. I'm Kim Sook,
a KBS comedian from the 12th cohort.

524
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,289
CONGRATS, SOOK

525
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,057
I can't believe this.

526
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,226
This is too much.

527
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,994
AS A FELLOW COMEDIAN,
SAE-HO ALSO CHOKES UP

528
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,198
You'll be seeing me on TV often now,

529
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,466
so make sure to tune in, okay?

530
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,770
SOOK MOVED TO SEOUL

531
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,606
AND STARTED A CAREER
IN THE SHOWBIZ INDUSTRY AT 20

532
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,741
Guys, listen.

533
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,509
Shin Dong-yeob will be coming by soon.

534
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,744
-What?
-No way.

535
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,379
The great Shin Dong-yeob is visiting us?

536
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,247
Yeah, he is!

537
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,049
You little punks!

538
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,017
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

539
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,085
You little punks!

540
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,487
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

541
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,188
THEY LOOK ALIKE!

542
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,857
Are you all well-prepared?

543
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,991
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

544
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,826
-Let me see what you've got.
-Sir!

545
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,828
I prepared a hilarious bit.

546
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,896
I can't wait.

547
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,665
How would a chicken cry in a hair salon?

548
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,733
A chicken in a hair salon?

549
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,901
Cock-a-doodle-doo? Tell me.

550
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:23,969
Crew-cut-a-doodle-doo.

551
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,172
Crew-cut-a-doodle-doo.

552
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,374
How did you become a comedian?

553
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,376
I guess you got in
because you're handsome like me.

554
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,444
THEY ALL LAUGH ALONG

555
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,413
-That must be it!
-Why don't I clear the air?

556
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,480
That'd be great.

557
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,750
I'll do an impression of Han Seok-kyu,
participating in a game of tug-of-war.

558
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,622
Hello, I'm Han Seok-kyu.
I'll play a game of tug-of-war.

559
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,225
First, you grab the rope.
Then you pull like this.

560
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,560
Oh, I lost.

561
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,662
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE!

562
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,930
He's so good!

563
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,232
I'll do an impression of an idol
who looks just like me.

564
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,301
-An idol?
-And who does he look like?

565
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,604
My heart keeps on believing

566
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,506
That you might return to me

567
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,408
THAT'S NOT HOW OUR GUY DID IT

568
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,510
That's not my part.

569
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,779
-Grab him.
-Stop right there.

570
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,848
-What's the matter?
-I'm worried we might get sued.

571
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,616
-He's not looking good.
-It was just an impression.

572
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,984
Will you file a suit or not?

573
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,920
You can usually tell
by their facial expression.

574
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,988
-My apologies.
-We sincerely apologize.

575
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,156
YOU'RE ALL ADORABLE

576
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,825
Sir!

577
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,794
I prepared an impression
of Hong Jin-kyung in her early days.

578
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,663
-Her early days?
-I can feel the vibe.

579
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,097
Not at all.

580
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,167
I only won one award.
The Best Pose Award, to be exact.

581
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,571
My dad had a dream about a huge dragon.

582
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,073
I've prepared an idea
for a commercial too.

583
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,808
Out of my way, constipation!

584
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,110
Bicogreen.

585
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,345
SHE'S GOOD TOO…

586
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,449
I'll be doing an impression of Jinsung,
the trot singer, catching a mosquito.

587
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,185
-Was the wind enough…
-He's good.

588
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,521
SOOK'S TALENTED COHORTS
INTIMIDATE HER

589
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,957
I've prepared
the Korean traditional dance,

590
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,059
particularly, the Lion Dance
of Bongsan Mask Dance.

591
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,394
What a brilliant idea. Hold on.

592
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,396
-You'd need a mask. Where can we get one?
-Where is it?

593
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,464
-Let's find it.
-Let's see.

594
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,966
Sir, I don't need one.

595
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,033
NO NEED

596
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,605
I CAN PUT ON A MASK OF MY OWN

597
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,276
BIT BASED ON
INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

598
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,812
SHOCKED

599
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,880
What do you think?

600
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,081
-I love it! Try it on stage!
-You do?

601
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,249
HER TALENT SPARKS JEALOUSY

602
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,355
Wait, what about Sook?

603
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,323
She didn't get to pitch her idea.

604
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:30,328
"Others are moving ahead.
Why do I feel like I'm going in circles?"

605
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,699
Sook grew up so fast
while she was under my wings,

606
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,868
but it seems her time
has slowed to a stop.

607
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,304
-She can't handle the embarrassment.
-My gosh.

608
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,206
They're all great.

609
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,910
What am I supposed to come up with?

610
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,378
"WHAT SHOULD I DO?"

611
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,445
I got it.

612
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,515
What am I good at?

613
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,253
-Sure, she's good at that.
-You got a crush on me or what?

614
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,022
-That's it.
-I like the idea.

615
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,491
Shall I name the character "Bratty Girl"?

616
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,093
This could work.

617
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,895
It's funny.

618
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:09,534
Call me a clown or even a fool

619
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,837
As long as you're happy

620
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,409
I'll gladly take on
An even harsher ridicule

621
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,543
DREAMS OF MAKING OTHERS LAUGH

622
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,780
But you must've won
your family's approval at some point.

623
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,348
That only happened

624
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,916
after seven years.

625
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,686
I did a nationwide tour
with the bratty girl character.

626
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,421
When we had a show in Busan,

627
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,456
my whole family came to see it.

628
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,092
When I said "Father," my signature line,

629
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,561
the crowd went wild, screaming.

630
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,629
That startled my whole family.

631
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,065
That made them go,
"Sook is now a proper comedian."

632
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,868
BUT…

633
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,405
I played the character of Nanda Kim
on People Looking for a Laugh.

634
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,575
Things died down for Sook
after her big break.

635
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,980
She didn't shine when she first started
appearing on variety shows.

636
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,848
It would've been fine
even if I hadn't had a mic.

637
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,483
I couldn't jump in
and join the conversation.

638
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,151
I was still too shy.

639
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,389
What is Sook up to these days?

640
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,692
After the big hits with the bratty girl
and Nanda Kim, she's had no luck.

641
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,394
I knew it.

642
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,296
Her fame was temporary.

643
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,131
Hey, don't be so harsh.

644
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,633
That's just how it is in this industry.

645
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,235
Hear me out.
I knew Sook didn't have it in her.

646
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,305
Just look at her face.
She's not geared up for success.

647
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,574
She's not geared up for success.

648
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,743
Why are you saying that to my face?

649
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,044
Face the front and say it out loud.

650
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,512
I can't look that way.

651
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,448
There's just the three of us here.
Say what you've got to say.

652
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,584
-Don't pick on me.
-Face that way and say it.

653
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,885
I'm so sorry!

654
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,620
RUNS AWAY

655
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,122
I wonder why he's acting that way.

656
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,824
They're all so talented.

657
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:43,895
Goodness.

658
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,432
Why don't I get a single call
asking if I'm available for a show?

659
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,868
I hear the others get loads of calls.

660
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,804
Hello?

661
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,841
I'm not interested in insurance.

662
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,710
Geez.

663
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,245
Her father must be watching TV.

664
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,748
Hello? This is Kim Sook…

665
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,384
I told you I wasn't interested.

666
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,787
Are they for real?

667
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,889
SHE WAS GETTING USED TO SPARKS
OF HOPE AND GRIPPING GLOOM

668
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,757
-Hello? This is Kim Sook--
-It's me, Sook.

669
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,632
What's up? I'm busy.

670
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,369
I don't buy that.

671
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,471
You're barely on TV these days.

672
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,544
You know, if this is how it's going to be,

673
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,082
you might as well give it up
and return to Busan.

674
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,249
-What?
-Come back

675
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,853
and live a quiet life, for goodness' sake.

676
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,989
Get married like all other girls

677
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,160
and live a normal life back home.

678
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,930
What would you know, Dad?

679
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,432
I'm doing to best I can to…

680
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,670
I'll manage my life on my own.

681
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,973
I'm hanging up now.

682
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,777
Damn it.

683
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,947
Why does the longing in my heart

684
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,883
always turn into barbed words

685
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,219
that would break her heart?

686
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,226
WHILE SOOK ENDURED
THE DESOLATE TIMES

687
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,061
HOPING TO ACHIEVE HER DREAM

688
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:27,132
HER FATHER SUFFERED JUST
THE SAME THOUGH FROM AFAR

689
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:33,238
Even if I have to turn around
And swallow all the tears

690
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:37,008
It's still more preferable

691
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:42,180
To the days I didn't have you in my life

692
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,385
THOUGH THE DARK TUNNEL RAN LONG

693
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,820
This is crazy.

694
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,791
I can't pinpoint when,
but I'd find Sook on ten different shows

695
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,994
whenever I turned on the TV.

696
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,696
Aren't you Kim Sook?

697
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,165
Oh, I am. Hi.

698
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,699
I'm a huge fan of yours.

699
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,768
-Thank you.
-Can you do a line of Matriarch Sook?

700
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,637
Gosh, no, not in front of
such a huge crowd.

701
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,272
-Please?
-I can't.

702
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,773
Come on!

703
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,042
"It's unseemly
for a guy to raise his voice!"

704
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,046
From what I recall,
Sook finally had her major break

705
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,514
-when working with Jung-soo.
-On With You.

706
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,150
-Was the subhead "the Greatest Love"?
-That's it.

707
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,451
THE PUBLIC LOVED
THE LATE BLOOMER

708
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:22,954
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

709
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,022
No problem.

710
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:37,368
There you go
Keep on smiling just like that

711
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:43,842
You're the prettiest
Among all the smiling girls

712
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:50,014
WHILE THE PASSAGE OF TIME
TURNED HER FATHER'S HAIR GRAY

713
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,616
Hello?

714
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:56,688
Sure, my Sook is on TV
all the time these days.

715
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,022
Yeah, she's on Battle Trip.

716
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,024
That's right.
She's on Boss in the Mirror too.

717
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,593
Yeah, exactly!

718
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,462
She's on Love Naggers
and countless other shows.

719
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,298
I told you she's not seeing Jung-soo.
Stop bringing that up.

720
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,133
Don't test me, okay?

721
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,568
That's not it.

722
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,872
I get the feeling she has a thing
going with a certain Mr. Gu.

723
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,141
-But I'm not certain.
-He's up to date now.

724
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,811
At any rate, make sure to watch
anything Sook appears in.

725
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,413
All right. Got it.

726
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,019
I wonder if she's had her meal.

727
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,220
Oh, let's not worry.

728
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,256
I'm sure she's busy.

729
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,837
The Grand Prize of 2020 goes to…

730
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,307
Kim Sook!

731
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,642
WINNER OF
THE 2020 KBS GRAND PRIZE

732
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,112
-Hey, Sook.
-Congratulations, Sook.

733
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,613
Thanks, guys.

734
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,117
"I must've gone prizeless for so long
so I could win this great honor."

735
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,085
Geez, don't do an impression of me.

736
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,520
Just a second.

737
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,056
Hello?

738
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,791
Gosh, it's nothing.

739
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,160
Oh, no. I should treat you.

740
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,095
Thanks again.

741
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,463
I'll make sure to treat you
to a nice meal.

742
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:13,998
Bye.

743
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,402
She's dressed up as Lee Young-ja.

744
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,838
I'm so happy for you, Sook.
You little rascal.

745
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,975
I hope you'll have no end of success.

746
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,444
Keep on doing your best in everything.

747
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,879
He's really on point there.

748
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,947
Dong-yeob.

749
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,016
Goodness, must you be the MC even now?

750
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,118
-Young-ja.
-Hey, Sook.

751
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,487
-Be good to your father, okay?
-Sorry?

752
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,823
Did you know he gave me
a 300,000-won money gift?

753
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,962
He gave me a handwritten note too,
asking me to look after you.

754
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,763
-Seriously?
-My dad did that?

755
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,865
The thought of your father…

756
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,769
CHOKING UP

757
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,137
SHE'S JUST LIKE YOUNG-JA

758
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,272
Your father…

759
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,242
That's a brilliant impression.

760
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,417
Dad…

761
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,392
He's probably sleeping.

762
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,861
Let's forget it.

763
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,470
She must be swamped.

764
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,840
As a father, my role is to wait patiently.

765
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,075
As long as Sook is smiling,

766
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,011
that's more than enough for me.

767
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,653
That's a wrap on the special episode
of Screwballs for Sook's 30th Anniversary.

768
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,288
-Good work.
-My gosh.

769
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,957
-Great job.
-Gosh, guys!

770
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,558
-Well done.
-Thank you, everyone.

771
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,693
-Congrats again.
-Thanks.

772
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,195
-Great work.
-You too, Sook.

773
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,564
Not at all. You did the heavy lifting.

774
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,366
-Congrats.
-Time flies, right?

775
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,501
WHEN DID THEY PREPARE THIS?

776
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,002
Did you get some sort of treatment?

777
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,004
Do I look different?
I didn't get any work done.

778
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,373
Maybe she's had
far too many Ulthera shots.

779
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,908
You do look different today.

780
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,510
-Tell me about it.
-No, I don't.

781
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,945
Is there anything you'd like?
We'll chip in and get it for you.

782
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,280
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

783
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,748
-How about a Porsche?
-A Porsche?

784
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,650
I'll go see a dealer tomorrow.

785
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,919
TRYING TO LAUGH IT OVER

786
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,054
Thanks.

787
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,824
I hear you're paying for the team dinner.
I can't thank you enough.

788
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,627
DID I NOW? LET'S LAUGH AWAY

789
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,795
Gosh, you didn't have to.

790
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:24,929
She's hilarious, right?

791
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,098
HOW FUN

792
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,733
-Okay, it's on me.
-Thank you!

793
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,169
-Let's have a team dinner later.
-I'll see you later.

794
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,670
-Get home safely.
-See you.

795
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,738
-Bye.
-Great work.

796
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,839
Thanks.

797
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,307
-See you later, Sook.
-Bye.

798
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,975
So they were in on it all along.

799
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,312
Now…

800
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,716
SHE MUSTERS UP THE COURAGE

801
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,886
TO CALL HER FATHER

802
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,588
Hey, Dad.

803
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,590
I should've…

804
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,159
I should've called more often.

805
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,962
You know…

806
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,431
it's been 30 years
since I started working.

807
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,202
Time flies, doesn't it?

808
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,004
Dad?

809
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,072
Sook.

810
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,709
Dad?

811
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,777
Sook.

812
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,850
Sook.

813
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,285
Thirty long years have passed

814
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,621
since you started your career
in the showbiz industry.

815
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,389
A MESSAGE FROM A FATHER
TO HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER

816
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,793
Congratulations on reaching your milestone
all safe and sound.

817
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,363
I've never been much help to you.

818
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,799
You moved to Seoul,

819
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,337
carved your path,
and found success all by yourself.

820
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,739
I can't describe
how happy you have made me.

821
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,875
I'm so grateful to you.

822
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,212
Good job on hanging in there
for the last 30 years.

823
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,982
I'm glad

824
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,918
that all your hard work has paid off.

825
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:59,357
Looking back on all those early years
when you struggled

826
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,459
fills me with a different set of emotions.

827
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:08,599
You're the greatest pride and joy
of our whole family.

828
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:13,271
I'd like to thank you for all the joys
you've given us so far.

829
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,009
Keep that happy smile on your face

830
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,444
and stay healthy.

831
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,246
That is my dearest wish.

832
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,916
Don't forget your fans

833
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,520
who have supported you for 30 years
and make sure to return their kindness

834
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,890
by bringing hope and joy to their lives.

835
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,394
I understand how busy you are.

836
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,163
But still, my dear youngest,

837
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,399
I must say I miss you.

838
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,269
Thank you, Sook.

839
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,374
This is crazy.

840
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,953
HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
WAS FACING THE WORLD ALONE

841
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:07,258
BUT ALL HE COULD DO
WAS WATCH HER FROM AFAR

842
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,895
COULD SOOK HAVE KNOWN HOW
HARROWING IT WAS FOR HER FATHER

843
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:16,334
TO BE UNABLE TO HELP HER
WITH ANYTHING?

844
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,373
But you don't have to know any of it
Please do me a single favor

845
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,546
Allow me to make you smile

846
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:33,084
I can handle the tears and the heartaches

847
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:39,457
As long as you'll keep on smiling

848
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,715
What was all that about?

849
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,386
-Congrats, Sook.
-Congrats.

850
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,421
-Congrats, Sook.
-Congrats, Sook.

851
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,090
-Let me bow to you.
-Did you have to make me cry?

852
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,592
There he goes again.

853
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,926
A BIG BOW FOR YOU, BIG SISTER

854
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,062
Cut it out!

855
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,130
Congrats, Sook.

856
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,266
This is as far as I can go
given my lymph nodes.

857
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,869
Oh, gosh.
You didn't have to prepare all that.

858
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,137
Congrats, Sook.

859
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,273
Hearing your father's voice
made me cry so much.

860
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,775
Tell me about it.

861
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,611
I've kept saying this since Beat Coin.
Let's not get our families involved.

862
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,580
This kind of stuff makes you choke up.

863
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,217
Let's not forget all the effort
our junior colleagues put in.

864
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,652
Where are they?

865
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,321
-Please come join us.
-Come on out.

866
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:47,258
TIME TO MEET THE STARS
OF THE AMAZING PERFORMANCE

867
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,661
-It was amazing.
-You were great.

868
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,862
Totally.

869
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,765
To congratulate
the 30th year of Sook's career,

870
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,836
the junior KBS comedians
prepared this show.

871
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,204
Thank you so much.

872
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,740
Your acting skills blew my mind.

873
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,610
The performance we watched today
was produced in the same format

874
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,846
as the popular segment on Gag Concert,
"Song We All Know."

875
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,316
Since you first kick-started
your career at KBS,

876
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,419
we thought that a collaboration
with the younger generation of comedians

877
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,821
would be a great idea.

878
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,789
That's how we got this project rolling.

879
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,991
I must say this, though.

880
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,863
I'm embarrassed
about the whole 30th-year milestone.

881
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,434
I keep thinking I let those years pass
without accomplishing much.

882
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,003
I get the urge to hide
that I hit that milestone.

883
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,808
But all of you showed up just for me.

884
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,711
I can't thank you enough
for going over my life's story.

885
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,980
I'd have no luck
if I tried to audition now.

886
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,182
I'm sure I'll get flunked right away.

887
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,851
-You're all talented actors
-I know, right?

888
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,920
-with so many skills up your sleeves.
-Right.

889
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,391
I was amazed by my young colleagues
more than anything.

890
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:57,294
I must thank you again. Thank you so much.

891
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,330
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

892
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,867
-Why don't you give her a hug?
-Oh, sure.

893
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,069
AN EMBRACE BETWEEN THE SOOK
OF 2025 AND THE SOOK OF 1995

894
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,139
-Thank you so much.
-It was a heartwarming show.

895
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:11,442
Could I ask for a favor before they leave?

896
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,977
I'd love to see the Lion Dance.

897
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,180
Thanks for stepping up.
I've been wanting to ask that myself.

898
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,248
GETS READY IN A FLASH

899
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,117
I loved the bit you prepared,
but we didn't get to see its full length.

900
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,854
ENCORE PERFORMANCE OF
THE LION DANCE

901
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,758
SHE'S SO GOOD, LOL

902
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,226
She's amazing.

903
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,294
THIS WILL BE PLAYED

904
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,363
WHEN KIM GA-EUN CELEBRATES
HER 30TH MILESTONE

905
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,868
That was hilarious.

906
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,605
I'll set up a date
so that we can all have a meal together.

907
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,674
I'll contact you later.

908
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,776
-It's an honor.
-Let's all get together.

909
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,411
-Thank you so much.
-Congrats.

910
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,479
-Congrats.
-Congrats.

911
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,980
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

912
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:54,051
WE WISH YOU A BRIGHT FUTURE,
YOUNG COMEDIANS

913
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,756
Let's circle back to when they played
the recording of Sook's father.

914
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,359
Why did you cry more than Sook?

915
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,662
-We were in the back…
-That's understandable.

916
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,963
…and Jin-kyung was bawling.

917
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,233
We took the wrong route
during the show by mistake.

918
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,935
We mistook the directions, you see.

919
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,037
We have to take a big turn.

920
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,405
TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE

921
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,841
I got ahead of them.
But when I turned around…

922
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,043
Goodness.

923
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,479
CRYING HER HEART OUT

924
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,113
She was running over while weeping.

925
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,115
She was crying and running
at the same time.

926
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,519
What have you done to my father?

927
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,655
-But you know--
-My father rarely makes phone calls.

928
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,359
We reached out
to one of your older sisters for help,

929
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,194
so she recorded it and sent it to us.

930
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,196
I SEE

931
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,199
Every letter deserves a reply, right?

932
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,367
-I guess.
-He's right.

933
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,436
Why don't you send
a video message to your father?

934
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,004
-I can't.
-Come on.

935
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,138
-I can't.
-Come on, Sook.

936
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,508
-I'm going to tear up.
-It can be a short one.

937
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,909
ALREADY GETTING TEARY-EYED

938
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,944
-He'll be watching.
-I'll call him or something.

939
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,479
They want you to cry.

940
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,614
I'm serious.

941
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,149
Make it short and simple.

942
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,985
-It doesn't have to be long.
-Just a short one.

943
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,052
THIS IS IT, WOMAN UP!

944
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,787
It doesn't have to be long.

945
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,758
My gosh. Father.

946
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,362
You know how our whole family

947
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:15,399
is a pack of reserved introverts.

948
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,935
So we rarely get to exchange simple words

949
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,070
like "Thank you" or "I love you."

950
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,777
I told you I couldn't do this, didn't I?

951
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,145
Dang it.

952
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,214
Father.

953
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,985
Please stay by my sisters and me

954
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,389
for as long as you can in good health.

955
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:42,793
That would be the greatest gift
I could ever ask for.

956
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,496
I love you, Father.

957
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,100
-She did it.
-She sure did.

958
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,837
-I hate doing this kind of stuff.
-You did it.

959
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,308
"An award of appreciation
for 30 years of continued efforts."

960
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:58,442
"Recipient, Kim Sook."

961
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,779
"As 'Sook Crush,'

962
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,748
you have empowered
your fellow female comedians."

963
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:10,287
"Armed with the spirit of Confidentiality,
you spent 30 long years in the industry,

964
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:13,357
continuing to charm your audience
into developing a crush for you."

965
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,225
"Therefore, we give you this award."

966
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,295
-That doesn't make any sense.
-On behalf of the Screwballs team,

967
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,264
I present it to you on May 10th, 2025.

968
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,332
Thank you.

969
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,801
Congratulations.

970
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,502
Great job so far, Sook.

971
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,640
Let's take a photo together.

972
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,941
-Sook.
-They brought flowers.

973
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,910
AFTER THE SHOOT WRAPS

974
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,213
Take the bouquet, Sook.

975
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,517
THE JUNIORS STAYED BEHIND
TO GIVE HER THE BOUQUET

976
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,853
-Thank you so much.
-It has such an amazing fragrance.

977
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,124
-Why don't we take a group photo?
-Shall we?

978
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,392
You can take the center spot.

979
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,328
Why does something like this only happen
when I look like this?

980
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,364
Couldn't you have given me a heads-up?

981
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,165
This is who you are.

982
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,500
You look prettiest today.

983
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,801
-It's so you.
-You brat.

984
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,069
Let's get you in the center.

985
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,207
One more time. One, two, three.

986
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,710
One more time. One, two, three.

987
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:12,016
THE END OF SOOK'S
30TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY

988
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,923
Next episode on Screwballs…

989
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,193
WHILE AWAY ON A SUMMER VACATION…

990
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,429
THEY RECEIVE A CALL
FROM A MYSTERIOUS CALLER

991
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,132
-Who is it?
-Listen closely, heroes.

992
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:31,402
Kim Na-bak of the beloved girl group,
doLIVE, went missing.

993
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,170
Let's roll, guys.

994
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,740
Would finding Kim Na-bak
be the end of this case?

995
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,542
THEY MUST SPRING INTO ACTION
IN THEIR HERO UNIFORMS

996
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,412
A member of doLIVE has been kidnapped.

997
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,047
We've come to save her.

998
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,015
I'm Optimus Prime.

999
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:48,185
All events took place here,
the shared living space of the group.

1000
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,688
Find all the hidden clues
and uncover the truths

1001
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,057
to get to the bottom of this case

1002
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,359
and find the missing Kim Na-bak.

1003
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,396
Maybe the girls found out
about Woo-jae two-timing them.

1004
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:03,367
Couldn't that have driven
Young-GD and Na-bak into arguing?

1005
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,469
IS THE CULPRIT
AMONG THE MEMBERS?

1006
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,538
-It says Sook and her smoking habits…
-Did she mind that?

1007
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,239
…made her yank Sook's hair.

1008
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,709
IS HE TRYING
TO DISGUISE HIMSELF?

1009
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,444
That is not a person's face.

1010
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,678
Face recognition failure.

1011
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,680
THEY TRY TO OBTAIN LEADS
IN ANY WAY THEY CAN…

1012
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,348
BUT THE CASE IS TOO COMPLICATED

1013
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,951
FINALLY,
THE TRUTH STARTS TO UNFOLD

1014
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,553
-Hey, just a second.
-This is it.

1015
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,620
Found it.

1016
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,122
THE SHOCKING TRUTH

1017
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,990
HIDDEN IN THE SHARED HOUSE
OF THE GIRL GROUP

1018
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,727
-"Look forward to how I manage it."
-This must be the culprit.

1019
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,128
-That's incredible.
-Well done.

1020
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,698
I took you for ragtag amateurs,
but you turned out to be quite bright.

1021
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,900
AND THEN…

1022
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,138
THE FURTHER THEY DIG INTO
THE CASE

1023
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:42,806
THE SCARIER IT GETS

1024
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,608
Give it a rest, will you?

1025
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,477
TO SUCCESSFULLY RESCUE
KIM NA-BAK

1026
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,545
THEY MUST OVERCOME THEIR FEARS

1027
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,613
She must be locked up.

1028
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,683
WILL OUR HEROES HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO LIVE UP TO THE TITLE?
