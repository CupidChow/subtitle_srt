CHARGE 2

00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,553
Testonia is…

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,955
Egenstory is…

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,956
Egenstory?

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,990
CHARGE 3
CRIME OF IGNORANCE

11
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,392
Which color would you use?

12
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,128
AND FOR CAUSING VARIOUS CONTROVERSIES

13
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,729
Get on the floor.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,168
The five criminals are sentenced
to exile in Gangjin, Jeollanam-do.

15
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,871
GANGJIN, JEOLLANAM-DO

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,408
PLACE OF EXILE

17
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,078
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S NATURE'S HAVEN

18
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,353
THE 5 VILLAINS ARE EXILED TO GANGJIN

19
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,656
TODAY'S DRESS CODE: VILLAIN

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,861
Gosh, I can't make it funny.

21
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:02,762
Do it. You can do it.

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,230
You're a comedian, Sae-ho.

23
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,632
He looks like a granny from behind.

24
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,903
He really looks like
my grandma from behind.

25
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,805
Aren't grandmas kind of petite?

26
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,139
REAPPEARING

27
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,707
Do you know who I am?

28
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,743
-His hair is like grandma's--
-I told you to stop.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,545
You're making me insecure.

30
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,247
ALREADY HIS FOURTH APPEARANCE

31
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,083
Do you know who I am?

32
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,717
Cho Sae-ho.

33
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,820
I'm Dan Chen,
the shorter version of Jang Chen.

34
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,955
DAN CHEN, 166.9CM

35
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,190
WAS THAT FUNNY?

36
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,124
Good.

37
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,093
Do you know where this is?

38
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,528
This is Gangjin's famous spot,

39
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,996
the reed field!

40
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,264
You're nervous, aren't you?

41
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,232
No, that's not it.

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,634
-That's not what Jang Chen is like.
-It isn't.

43
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,339
-Who are you?
-Why are you so loud?

44
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:48,975
Why are you so loud?

45
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,677
LOADING THE OXYGEN GUN?

46
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,978
It's a respirator.

47
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,079
FRESH AIR

48
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,081
I keep people alive.

49
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,183
Heads or tails?

50
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,952
Heads or tails?

51
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,120
WHAT DO I GET FOR WINNING?

52
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,488
Heads or tails?

53
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,289
Wouldn't it be heads?

54
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,758
Wouldn't it be heads?

55
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,827
It's heads.

56
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,162
You're lucky.

57
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
You're lucky.

58
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,366
From No Country For Old Men,

59
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,367
I'm Javier Bardem.

60
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,869
I'M JAVIER BARDEM

61
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,571
Who's that long-legged guy?

62
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,509
Hey, scumbags.

63
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,676
Did he lose his mind?

64
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,546
Can't I like you?

65
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,181
Who are you?

66
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,849
Show some respect. You don't know me.

67
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,185
Geez. I could knock him out
with a light punch.

68
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,220
INHALE

69
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,023
I kept him alive too.

70
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,926
-Gosh.
-I am Jang Kyong-chul.

71
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,362
-From I Saw the Devil?
-From I Saw the Devil.

72
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,463
Tall Jang Kyong-chul.

73
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,664
Isn't that too long?

74
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,666
He's Dan Chen. I'm Tall Jang Kyong-chul.

75
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,034
Who's he supposed to be?

76
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,235
WHO'S HE SUPPOSED TO BE?

77
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,136
Who's this?

78
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,138
Who are you?

79
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,073
-One, two, three, four!
-Three, four.

80
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,408
Lalala soda pop

81
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,143
-It isn't "Lalala."
-What is it?

82
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,545
-It's "My little."
-Oh, I see.

83
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,946
Isn't it "Lalala soda pop"?

84
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,748
-Sounded like that.
-One, two, three, four!

85
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,483
Lalala soda pop

86
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,385
Lalala, lalala

87
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,020
Sing with me, lalala

88
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,022
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

89
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,491
WOO-YOUNG'S CONCEPT
ABBY FROM SAJA BOYS

90
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,459
-An elderly person is approaching.
-Hi.

91
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,494
-An elderly person.
-Hi.

92
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,196
-An elderly person is approaching.
-Hi.

93
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,230
-An elderly person.
-Hi.

94
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,066
I know. She's Kim Wan-sun.

95
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:20,967
PIERROT SMILING AT US

96
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,202
LAUGHING

97
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,204
-I would
-I would

98
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,439
-Rather be
-Rather be

99
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,740
No, Wan-sun wasn't like this.

100
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,209
A smiling pierrot

101
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,910
She wasn't so skinny.

102
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,512
You aren't just Joker.

103
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,380
Aren't you Big Joker?

104
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,082
-Super Big Joker.
-Really Big Joker.

105
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,284
Doesn't she look
like a standard poodle today?

106
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,419
They're this big.

107
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,690
You've heard that
today's dress code is villain.

108
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,226
Have you done any bad things in life?

109
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,727
In my case,

110
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,297
I get disappointed in myself
from time to time.

111
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,533
-Yourself?
-It isn't necessarily bad,

112
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,102
but I tend to make stories up

113
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,637
to make people laugh.

114
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,840
In a previous episode, I told a story
about how Woo-young didn't pay

115
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,942
after we ate together
when he said he would pay.

116
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,911
Those stories aren't necessary in life.

117
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,746
I feel kind of empty inside.

118
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,281
-I feel empty.
-Then, just retire.

119
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,182
Just quit.

120
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,184
-I want to go on for a bit more.
-Okay.

121
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,453
-There's a story about a good deed.
-Really?

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,754
Someone from our team?

123
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,589
-Yes.
-That can't be true.

124
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,124
Say, "Thank you."

125
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,158
Thank you.

126
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,194
-Are you getting this?
-Your niece?

127
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,895
-Uncle Sae-ho.
-Your niece?

128
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,798
Uncle Sae-ho, give me some allowance.

129
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,635
-Say it again.
-Give me some allowance.

130
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,671
I sent this to Sae-ho, right?

131
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,639
And?

132
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,673
So Sae-ho

133
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,775
really sent 100,000 won.

134
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,277
-Oh, my.
-But…

135
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,912
I didn't accept it.
I was just messing with him.

136
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,347
But he said I should accept it

137
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,982
so we can use it for the opening.

138
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,717
THINKING ABOUT THE SHOW ALL THE TIME

139
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,185
Everyone's spending a lot of money
for the opening.

140
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,086
So I accepted it

141
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,823
and bought a toy for my niece.

142
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,926
Uncle Sae-ho, thank you so much!

143
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,295
Ask him why he hasn't visited.

144
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,030
Why haven't you visited?

145
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,167
My niece asked
why Sae-ho hasn't visited her.

146
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,402
She is so cute.

147
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,171
-Anyway, he really gave me money…
-Come on.

148
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,606
-…to buy her a gift.
-Uncle Sae-ho,

149
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,840
give me some allowance.

150
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:08,775
Ask for 200 million.

151
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,842
Give me 200 million.

152
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,011
That will be all.

153
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:12,945
SPEECHLESS 25-YEAR COMEDIAN

154
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,913
Uncle Sae-ho.

155
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,448
-Give me…
-200 million.

156
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,084
There's a reason why
world-renowned villains

157
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,186
have come all the way to Gangjin.

158
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,788
Gosh, Gangjin is

159
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,656
so nice.

160
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,358
SUCH AN OBVIOUS PLUG

161
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,960
If I get married again,
I'll come here for my honeymoon.

162
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,329
If you get married again?

163
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,430
You said it first.

164
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,598
I think I'm okay with a guy from Gangjin.

165
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,268
Actually, let me tell you
a little about Gangjin.

166
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,003
The reed field is so beautiful

167
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,639
-and there are many local festivals.
-That's right.

168
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,374
There was a beer festival recently.

169
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,009
You did a lot of research, didn't you?

170
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,377
Of course. You shouldn't

171
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,312
come empty-handed. Did you?

172
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,047
-I was--
-That's wrong.

173
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,649
You should do research beforehand.

174
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,518
You heard that from the table over
at the bar last night.

175
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,520
So you did study.

176
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,756
There was a couple
sitting next to us at the bar.

177
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,359
-They gave us a lot of info about Gangjin.
-Yes.

178
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,661
They recently held the Hamaek Festival,
didn't they?

179
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,364
Actually, Gangjin is historically famous

180
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,734
as the hometown of
thousand-year-old Goryeo celadon.

181
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,169
It's where the blue sea
and Gangjin Bay come together

182
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,004
to create a scenic natural landscape.

183
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,207
-It is the treasure of Jeollanam-do.
-Right.

184
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,677
Where you are standing is called
Gangjin Bay Ecological Park.

185
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,644
It's so nice here.

186
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,748
It's famous for its endless reed field
and as a migratory site for wild birds,

187
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,385
and the Gangjin Bay Dancing Reed Festival
is held every year.

188
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,121
You can't see this kind of
scenery and nature in Seoul.

189
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,455
-None at all.
-No.

190
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,190
MUDSKIPPER

191
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,525
RED FLOWER CRAB

192
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,560
WHOOPER SWAN

193
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,730
Gangjin is also known as a place of exile.

194
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,067
COUNTLESS STORIES FROM HISTORY
HAVE LINGERED HERE

195
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,270
A PLACE THAT HOLDS STORIES OF EXILE

196
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,873
JUMPING THROUGH TIME

197
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,307
PRESENT DAY, THE YEAR 2025

198
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,709
WALK

199
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,177
SEE

200
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,412
EAT

201
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,180
AND ENJOY

202
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,017
THE TREASURE OF JEOLLANAM-DO,
THE PLACE OF FESTIVALS

203
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,620
As the worst villains of the world,

204
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,322
you've ended up
at the worst place of exile, Gangjin.

205
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,525
That's why?

206
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,592
THE GLOBAL PLACE OF EXILE, GANGJIN

207
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,694
-That's why we're--
-We've been exiled?

208
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,065
Jin-kyung, do you know
any famous historical figures

209
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,734
who were exiled to Gangjin?

210
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,335
-No way.
-Oh.

211
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,637
You said you studied yesterday.

212
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,238
PREPARED TO RIDICULE HER

213
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,773
Jeong Yak-yong.

214
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,442
-Jeong Yak-yong?
-Yes.

215
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,509
How did you know that?

216
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,344
-Why are you so surprised?
-I didn't mean to.

217
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,813
It's common knowledge.

218
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,181
Jeong Yak-yong.

219
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,782
You can't air this anyway.

220
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,117
Why can't we air this?

221
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,251
Try again.

222
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,287
-We're a variety show, not a history show.
-Come on.

223
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,289
You want me to act like I don't know it?

224
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,659
Acting like you don't know something
is so old-fashioned, you know.

225
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,860
By the way, who are you?

226
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,297
THIS IS THE JIN-KYUNG WE KNOW

227
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,498
You're right.

228
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,501
The greatest Silhak scholar
of the Joseon Dynasty, Jeong Yak-yong,

229
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,903
endured 18 years

230
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,805
of exile here.

231
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,774
He authored
"Admonitions on Governing the People"

232
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,875
during his time here,

233
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,311
which is a guide to
a fair and honest administration

234
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,947
and it greatly helped
the lives of the people.

235
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,081
NEVER CEASED STUDYING FOR THE PEOPLE

236
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,486
Like him, you can accomplish
great achievements in a place of exile.

237
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,355
That is why we have chosen this theme.

238
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,491
Surviving as a criminal
charged with high treason.

239
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,359
You villains

240
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,428
must go around various places in Gangjin

241
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,797
-and carry out the exile mission.
-Okay.

242
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,766
Today's exile mission
is an individual competition.

243
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,101
-Oh.
-Okay.

244
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,537
If your ranking is high,

245
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,539
you'll become a model exile

246
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,174
and be comfortable.

247
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,042
And if you become a bad exile,

248
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,645
-you'll suffer.
-Isn't that going too far?

249
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,880
We'll get going now.

250
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,281
When you think of being in exile,

251
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,584
-you think of a faraway island.
-We're going to an island?

252
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,819
It's called Gau-do.

253
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,153
GAU-DO

254
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,055
Are we taking a boat?

255
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,625
-Well, there's a bridge.
-So we're walking there?

256
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,792
We're walking?

257
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,662
-What on earth?
-You want us to walk to the island?

258
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
We're really exiled.

259
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,367
You're exiles.
How else would you get there?

260
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,738
So I hope you can introduce
the beautiful place of exile, Gangjin.

261
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,340
-Before we go, I thought we could do this.
-What?

262
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,577
Laughing like a villain.

263
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,178
Whoever does that the best…

264
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,213
Gosh.

265
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,348
You'll get the title
of being the best villain.

266
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:11,951
NO PRIZES INVOLVED

267
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,352
Laughing like a villain.

268
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,221
Silver award winner
of KBS Comedy Festival.

269
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,756
-College Comedy Festival.
-Silver award.

270
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,657
INHALING OXYGEN

271
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,758
How will she do?

272
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,928
EVIL LAUGH

273
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,999
DOMINATING WITH HER APPEARANCE
AND INTENSE PERFORMANCE

274
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,135
LOOKS LIKE SHE'LL SHOOT YOU
WITH AN AIR GUN IF YOU MESS AROUND

275
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,703
Why don't you just take first place?

276
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,038
We can't beat that.

277
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,373
Give us your villainous laugh!

278
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,274
NEXT UP IS JOKER

279
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,143
PFFT-HA

280
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,178
You're just laughing.

281
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,379
-Do something.
-She's just laughing.

282
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,181
-That's usually how you laugh.
-Oh, my belly.

283
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,950
Villains don't make a lot of noise.

284
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,685
-Yeah, you're right.
-I see.

285
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,953
PWHA

286
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,055
-Mr. Choi Bul-am?
-You sound like Mr. Choi Bul-am.

287
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,356
That's just laughing.

288
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,991
-Okay. Next.
-Next.

289
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm going to be more relaxed.

290
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,063
SMIRK

291
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,164
-What was that?
-What?

292
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,131
Stop acting cool.

293
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,267
Why are you trying to look pretty?

294
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,401
Lalala

295
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,037
He lives such an easy life.

296
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,539
-Next.
-What is wrong with you?

297
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,440
HCK!

298
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,108
-It suits you.
-That was quick.

299
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,945
Since I'm a psychopath, I don't laugh.

300
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,946
-That's why.
-Suits you.

301
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,750
EVIL LAUGHTER

302
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,052
-It's not your turn yet.
-We're still talking.

303
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,721
-What's wrong with you?
-We're talking.

304
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,389
Don't laugh while we're talking.

305
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,391
-I was explaining.
-What are you doing?

306
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,593
A real psycho does
a good job playing a psycho.

307
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,995
METHOD ACTING AS A PSYCHO

308
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,396
-Good one.
-Anywhere, anytime.

309
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,632
But it's like
blowing your nose on the street.

310
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,634
-Now, you can go.
-Okay.

311
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,701
FINALLY, THE LONG-AWAITED DAN CHEN'S TURN

312
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,637
REVVING UP

313
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,140
WHAT WE SAW EARLIER

314
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,108
That's too plain.

315
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,909
-No, it isn't.
-It's a plain villainous laugh.

316
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,545
-It was good before.
-What's wrong with him?

317
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,414
You need to have some variation.

318
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,050
I don't have any funny ideas.

319
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,487
THE SENIOR COMEDIAN BACKS HIM UP

320
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,690
WE HOPE THE VIEWERS CAN LAUGH LIKE THIS

321
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,427
-Wow! The fish are jumping around here.
-What?

322
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,361
There are fish?

323
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,863
You can see crabs and fish jumping.

324
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,731
Let me go and get
my fishing rod from the car.

325
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,433
Oh, my goodness. Jin-kyung.

326
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,634
Then, shall we go?

327
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,869
-Let's go.
-Okay. Let's go.

328
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,137
HEADING TO GAU-DO

329
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,309
GANGJIN BAY ECOLOGICAL PARK
GAU-DO SUSPENSION BRIDGE

330
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,280
TRANSPORT CAR FOR EXILE IS ON THE WAY

331
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,848
Wow! The rice fields are beautiful.

332
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,750
-Wow.
-Wow. And those mountains.

333
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,987
You know what's so charming
about Jeolla-do?

334
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,257
-The mountains are like hills.
-They aren't tall.

335
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,625
It's easy on the eyes.

336
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,126
Gosh, it's so nice.

337
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,829
-Isn't it so nice to get out of Seoul too?
-Yeah.

338
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,799
Make an acrostic poem
with Gangjin, Sae-ho.

339
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,501
I don't want to be funny today.

340
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,602
Whatever.

341
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,804
Work hard.

342
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,205
I'll give it a try.

343
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,273
Gang.

344
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,974
In Gangjin.

345
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,643
Jin.

346
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,411
Jin-kyung will meet a man.

347
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,379
Gosh.

348
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,613
SNORTS

349
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,748
I'll go. Gang.

350
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,649
-Gang.
-Gang.

351
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,417
I want to meet a man from Gangjin.

352
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,552
-Jin.
-For real, Jin-kyung.

353
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,488
SATISFIED

354
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,391
Today's goal is
finding a boyfriend for Jin-kyung.

355
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,325
Yeah.

356
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,428
She said she's going to sign up
for a matchmaking agency.

357
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,429
Sorry.

358
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,897
SHE MAY NOT HAVE TO SIGN UP

359
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,966
Everyone, watch out.

360
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,136
-We are entering…
-It's the coastal road.

361
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,705
…the coastal road!

362
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,507
Make some noise!

363
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,043
MAKE SOME NOISE

364
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,645
This is definitely worth a visit.

365
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,447
-It's so pretty.
-Awesome.

366
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,283
Wow. It feels so good to be here.

367
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,219
It's so picturesque.

368
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,721
-Driving is a bit dangerous here.
-Why?

369
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,089
The scenery is distracting.

370
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,457
STEALING THE SPOTLIGHT

371
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,592
Look to your right.

372
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,827
You'll snap right out of it.

373
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,596
BRINGS YOU TO YOUR SENSES

374
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,197
Gosh, you really scared me.

375
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,066
While we enjoy the coastal road,

376
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,935
can you read this poem
with your awesome voice, Woo-young?

377
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,504
This is Gift by Poet Na Tae-joo.

378
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,507
Gift by Na Tae-joo.

379
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,245
"The greatest gift I received
under the sky is today."

380
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,348
"With your soft voice,

381
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,783
smiling face,

382
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,618
and the humming of a tune,

383
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,387
it is a happiness
that is like embracing the entire ocean."

384
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,022
Gosh, I love it so much.

385
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,225
Once a day, after I get up,
I read Poet Na-Nat-Na Tae-joo's poem

386
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,994
as I start the day.

387
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,895
PFFT

388
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:17,930
Whatever, man.

389
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,733
-Stop being funny.
-I'm serious.

390
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,434
I don't get why you're laughing.

391
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,270
-Why is it funny?
-That's hilarious.

392
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,405
-That's the funniest thing you said today.
-What?

393
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,340
-It's just funny.
-But you know,

394
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,177
if you start the day by reading the poem

395
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,646
-of Poet Na Tae-joo--
-It's so pretty.

396
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,581
Jin-kyung, you're so pretty.

397
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,883
No one is listening to me.

398
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,985
OKAY, READ MANY POEMS, SAE-HO

399
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,887
Lalala soda pop

400
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,124
Why was this bent?

401
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,627
Hey, you'd better
take care of that camera.

402
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,164
Why did you bend it?
What were you trying to film?

403
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:53,999
Why was it looking down?

404
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,336
It has just been filming you down there.

405
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,938
It was like this.

406
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,272
Why were you filming that?

407
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,974
Well, we came all the way to Gangjin.

408
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,410
-We should show them something spicy.
-Stop.

409
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,545
Be quiet, all of you.

410
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,680
Something spicy?

411
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,648
We can't use any of our dialogue.

412
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,584
THEY ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF EXILE
WORRYING ABOUT THEIR DIALOGUE

413
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,587
GETTING OUT OF
THE PRISONER TRANSPORT VEHICLE

414
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,055
Gosh, the coastal road

415
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,858
was really nice.

416
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,693
It felt great driving on it.

417
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,128
-Wow.
-Wow! Look at that.

418
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,130
Are we crossing that?

419
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,899
What's that?

420
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,267
To get to that island,

421
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,002
-you must cross a bridge.
-By foot?

422
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,771
That bridge is about 900 meters.

423
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,839
Gosh, it's long.

424
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,007
MUST WALK ALMOST 1 KM TO GET TO GAU-DO

425
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,544
-Nice.
-Hey, it's shaking.

426
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,247
-It's shaking.
-This is going to be fun.

427
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,915
-Hello.
-Hello.

428
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,783
THE STAFF LET THE EXILES RIDE THE JET BOAT

429
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,120
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

430
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,222
-Bye.
-Such beautiful scenery.

431
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,627
Gosh, it's fast!

432
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,195
ALTHOUGH IN EXILE
THEY MUST CONVEY THE CHARM OF GANGJIN

433
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,196
It's nice and cool.

434
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,998
-It's really nice and cool.
-Let's go.

435
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,899
Isn't it refreshing?

436
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,003
ANYWAY, THEY HAD THEIR REASONS

437
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,240
THEY HEAD TO GAU-DO
AS THEY CUT THROUGH THE WATER

438
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,609
Hey, it's the bridge!

439
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,744
Awesome.

440
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,012
GAU-DO

441
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,515
REFRESHING

442
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,122
HAND GOES UP

443
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,723
-We're turning.
-We're turning.

444
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,624
Hold tight.

445
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,892
-We're turning.
-We're turning.

446
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,793
We're turning.

447
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,132
DRIFTING

448
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,934
Turn!

449
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,603
Isn't it awesome?

450
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,305
THIS IS SO FUN

451
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,407
-One more time!
-Yeah!

452
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,476
-One more time!
-One more time!

453
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,312
-Here he goes.
-One more time!

454
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,580
Let's go. Let's go!

455
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,416
ENJOY THE ENDLESS DRIFTING IN GAU-DO

456
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,120
That's cold!

457
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,125
FORGETTING THAT THEY'RE BEING EXILED,
THEY SMILE FROM EAR TO EAR

458
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,994
I'm all wet!

459
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,996
We're such a mess now.

460
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,131
Are all of us in the frame?

461
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,434
If we sit like this,
are we all in the picture?

462
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,204
SAY CHEESE

463
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,475
#GANGJIN #GAU-DO
#5 VILLAINS #BEING EXILED

464
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,911
THE 5 VILLAINS ENTER GAU-DO

465
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,245
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

466
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,214
How's my angle?

467
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,884
-He must have lost his mind.
-He's something else.

468
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,420
He's in such good shape in the beginning.

469
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,789
-Don't you go complaining…
-Jin-kyung, how do my eyes…

470
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,391
-…in the evening.
-…look on the screen?

471
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,826
How do my eyes look on-screen?

472
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,961
Why are you so hyper today?

473
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,330
-Good. It's good.
-Why are you in such a good mood?

474
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,101
-I want to walk with you.
-He's so excited.

475
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,003
Hey, Joo Woo-jae!

476
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,672
Gosh. What do we do with that guy?

477
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,807
I bet he was so bad as a kid.

478
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,176
I love you, Gangjin!

479
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,078
I can't live without Gangjin!

480
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,546
He's acting crazy. What's up with him?

481
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,615
Did he eat something strange by himself?

482
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,852
I think he got very excited
after that boat ride.

483
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,022
BURNED OUT SOON ENOUGH

484
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,525
Man, it would be nice
to live here for a month.

485
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,694
-For real, Sook.
-It's so nice here.

486
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,963
It's so nice and tranquil.

487
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,332
I bet it'd be perfect for making music.

488
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,100
-It's so quiet.
-Yeah.

489
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,201
It's perfect for mixing.

490
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,039
THE PROBLEM CHILD TAKES OFF AGAIN

491
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,809
THERE MUST BE A REASON
YOU'RE ACTING THIS WAY

492
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:27,980
Are you okay?

493
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,681
I know you aren't that energetic.

494
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,153
Thank you so much
for inviting us to Gangjin.

495
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,721
Thank you so much.

496
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,823
-Don't you feel recharged?
-For real.

497
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,358
I've been so busy mixing lately.

498
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,026
THAT DARN MIXING

499
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:41,927
Seriously,

500
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,631
I didn't get a chance
to come so close to nature.

501
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,100
How could I dream of getting on a boat?

502
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,568
It's so dreamy.

503
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,806
The exile of villains
from around the world

504
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,207
continues on.

505
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,343
Even within Gangjin,

506
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,046
various recreational activities
are specialized

507
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,848
-here on the island of Gau-do.
-Oh, Gau-do.

508
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,183
GAU-DO

509
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,185
A MONORAIL THAT
GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN PEAK

510
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,419
AND AN EXHILARATING ZIP LINE

511
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,388
PADDLE WHILE STANDING

512
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,559
ON THE STAND-UP PADDLEBOARD

513
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,361
EVEN JET BOATS
THAT CUT THROUGH THE SEA BREEZE

514
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,599
A variety of sights
and activities are prepared.

515
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,603
But since you are exiles,

516
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,639
you're going to reflect
on the crime you committed

517
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,408
rather than have fun.

518
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,577
We will now have

519
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,079
written apologies that someone else wrote.

520
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,815
A written apology is written by the person

521
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,517
-who committed the wrong.
-Yes.

522
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,019
-You reflect on what you did.
-But you're so close…

523
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,621
-Yes.
-…you spent some time together,

524
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,323
and you may know about

525
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,458
one another more than yourselves,

526
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,361
so you are going to
write a written apology

527
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,230
for someone else, instead of your own.

528
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,032
In other words, A will write
a written apology for B

529
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,603
and B will read that apology themselves.

530
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,006
Do you know the cangue
that Chunhyang had to wear?

531
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,907
-Yes.
-Yes.

532
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,642
We prepared a cangue.

533
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,444
-You prepared a lot.
-What for?

534
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,246
Whoever's reading the apology

535
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,314
must come to the side and read it

536
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,949
-while wearing a cangue.
-Okay.

537
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,218
So after reading the written apologies,

538
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,187
the staff will cast their votes

539
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,056
on whose written apology
touched their heart the most.

540
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,291
We'll rank everyone.

541
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,260
Then, we're going to eat after this.

542
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,895
I'm hungry.

543
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,264
The menu we prepared is sea bass.

544
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,598
-Raw sea bass.
-Raw?

545
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,799
Also, sea bream.

546
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,767
-Sea bream.
-Gosh.

547
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,536
And then, spicy rockfish stew.

548
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,204
I love fish stew.

549
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,438
Then, some raw fish bibimbap

550
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,140
and small octopus bibimbap.

551
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,575
We've prepared these things.

552
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,743
HOWEVER

553
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,581
The person who wrote the worst apology
and the person to whom the apology is for.

554
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,149
-Those two…
-Yes.

555
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,252
…will only get white rice and kimchi.

556
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,820
-I bet Gangjin's kimchi is good.
-Yeah.

557
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,023
-I bet the ripe kimchi is amazing.
-Good enough.

558
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,291
How is the last place decided?

559
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,092
-He said the staff will vote.
-They'll vote.

560
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,327
-Oh, I see.
-Listen for once.

561
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,495
Stop thinking about mixing.

562
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,063
I'm becoming like Jin-kyung.

563
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,599
COUPLES TAKE AFTER ONE ANOTHER…

564
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,601
We've prepared a lot of paper.

565
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,870
-Can we write multiple pages?
-Yes, you can.

566
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,438
Would you like more paper?

567
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,873
-Give me a couple more.
-Okay.

568
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,974
Give Woo-jae two more.

569
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,709
How many are going to write for?

570
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,444
Just two more please.

571
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,745
HOW MANY IS HE GOING TO WRITE FOR?

572
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,014
CAREFULLY WRITING DOWN

573
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,983
WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MUST REFLECT ON

574
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,385
HE'S WRITING WHILE HIDING

575
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,287
GIGGLING

576
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,657
WHOSE WRITTEN APOLOGY IS HE WRITING?

577
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,328
THE WAY THEY ARE CONCENTRATED

578
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,164
IS LIKE A SCENE FROM A CRIME MOVIE

579
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,603
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'LL DO
SOMETHING BAD ON THEIR COLLEAGUE'S APOLOGY

580
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,708
DISCOVERS SOMETHING

581
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,610
WHAT IS THIS?

582
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,145
LAUGHING

583
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,180
-Did you see it?
-What?

584
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,048
Did you see this?

585
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,519
EVEN WOO-JAE, WHO WROTE MULTIPLE PAGES,
SUBMITTED THE PAPERS

586
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,556
FINISHED WRITING THE WRITTEN APOLOGIES

587
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,758
NOTICE

588
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,795
THE WRITTEN APOLOGIES CONTAIN
A LOT OF FALSEHOODS, SLANDER, MOCKERY,

589
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,897
AND EXAGGERATION
AS IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE

590
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,201
HERE BE THE CRIMINAL

591
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,969
-Everyone.
-Yes?

592
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,704
Thanks for writing the written apologies.

593
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,873
You know, someone wrote multiple pages.

594
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,408
Do you see those?

595
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,310
Someone wrote apologies
for multiple people.

596
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,378
Why did you write so many?

597
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,213
-He wrote four.
-Why?

598
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,715
If they stop reading it…

599
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,484
-Yes?
-…they should be punished.

600
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,186
If they stop, change the content,

601
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,389
-or skip over any.
-You can't make it up.

602
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,324
They lose their chance to eat.

603
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,793
You have to read exactly what is written.

604
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,795
Read exactly what's written? What?

605
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,664
Read exactly what's written.

606
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,068
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

607
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,337
You have to read exactly what is written.

608
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,672
HE KEEPS INSISTING

609
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,274
It's written about Jang Woo-young
by Cho Sae-ho.

610
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,676
BY CHO SAE-HO, ABOUT JANG WOO-YOUNG

611
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,479
GIGGLES

612
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,547
LAUGHS

613
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,815
LAUGHS

614
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,684
-Why would you…
-What is it?

615
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,851
Written…

616
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,120
WHAT ON EARTH COULD IT BE?

617
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,656
"Written Opology."

618
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,225
"Written Opology."

619
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,195
WRITTEN OPOLOGY

620
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,631
He didn't know the spelling of apology?

621
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,999
He didn't know.

622
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,737
"I didn't even receive
proper elementary school edoocation."

623
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,774
"I am surry."

624
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,576
"I am miss…"

625
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,545
"I am missing."

626
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,649
-"I am Jang Woo-young."
-He's missing? What? Fabric?

627
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,784
-Gosh.
-Show them.

628
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,220
You know, it sounds like a child…

629
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,889
-You wrote it like I was stupid.
-"Opology."

630
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,760
I internally incorporated many things.

631
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:42,794
What? No, you didn't.

632
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,996
You just made me sound dumb.

633
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,631
Just accept it.

634
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,800
Come on. It isn't real.

635
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,236
This apology this time
was written by Woo-jae.

636
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,705
SURPRISED AS SOON AS THEY SEE IT

637
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,974
Come on, Woo-jae.
He must have lost his mind.

638
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,442
You have to make it sound real.

639
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,244
Are you insane? I can't read this!

640
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,414
-Who cares? It's your life, not mine.
-He's crazy.

641
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,282
WHAT IS THE SECOND ONE ABOUT?

642
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,451
"Hello, I'm Woo-young of 2PM."

643
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,186
"I am sorry."

644
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,855
"I worked as a beast-like pop idol,

645
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,524
but I was an actual beast."

646
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,426
CHOKING UP

647
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,861
-Keep going.
-Keep reading.

648
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,097
"One, two, three, four women."

649
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,900
"It's hard to even remember their names."

650
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,470
"But I have become
a different person now."

651
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,139
"I like living a simple life."

652
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,573
"I don't like complicated things."

653
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,409
"Simple, simple dance."

654
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,144
"Just simple dance."

655
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,079
"Casually, casually."

656
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,148
"Just so, just so."

657
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,382
That must be his style

658
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,050
-to date casually.
-"I just want to

659
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,552
go on casual dates."

660
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,520
THE LYRICS PORTRAY HIS LIFE

661
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,555
PATIENCE

662
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,458
"I apologize for how I was.
Please forgive me."

663
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,627
"If you forgive me,
I'll treat you to a meal."

664
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,262
Geez.

665
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,263
"Zero, one, zero…"

666
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,499
COOLLY REVEALING HIS PHONE NUMBER
PROTECTING WOO-YOUNG'S PRIVACY

667
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,735
Please bleep those out.

668
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,337
He wrote my real phone number!

669
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,506
"Call me on this number."

670
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,408
-Casually.
-Casually.

671
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,510
-I just casually met them?
-Yeah.

672
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,345
That's accurate.

673
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,346
Are there any more?

674
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,281
There's one more.

675
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,916
-Really?
-Another one? He's popular.

676
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,285
I feel more wretched since it's raining.

677
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,886
UNMISTAKABLY A BIG-TIME CRIMINAL

678
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,621
-You really look like a criminal.
-"Sorry."

679
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,789
"Please forgive me."

680
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:21,560
This written apology about Woo-young
was written by Sook.

681
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,562
-Yeah, it's mine.
-You did, Sook?

682
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,666
"Hello, I'm the youngest member
of Screwballs, Jang Woo-young."

683
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,836
"I have reflected on lying a lot."

684
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,171
"When the members asked me to hang out,

685
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,640
I said I couldn't make it
as I was in the middle of mixing."

686
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,275
"It wasn't a lie."

687
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,413
"I have been mixing soju and beer
with my girlfriend every day."

688
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,414
HIS GF MUST LIKE TO MIX DRINKS

689
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,317
"Lastly, my new single is
called Think Too Much."

690
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,319
"Actually, what was omitted after that was

691
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,588
Think Too Much about Girlfriends."

692
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,223
"Please listen to my song a lot."

693
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,458
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HEARTFELT CONFESSION

694
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,193
-Hey.
-This one's real.

695
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,362
We even promoted your songs for you.

696
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,331
-I did Simple Dance.
-And Think Too Much.

697
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,666
I'm touched by that, but it sounded

698
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,335
-too real.
-Sorry it's too realistic.

699
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,669
Just casually.

700
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,705
Next up is Woo-jae.

701
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,573
This was a nice idea, guys.

702
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,142
It briefly made me reflect on myself.

703
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,178
Briefly though.

704
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,883
Sae-ho wrote an apology
on behalf of Woo-jae.

705
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,619
Please read…

706
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,556
Please read while noting
what's in the parentheses.

707
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,658
LAUGHING

708
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,227
HE BURSTS OUT LAUGHING
AS SOON AS HE SEES IT TOO

709
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,031
"Hello. Even saying a greeting is luxury."

710
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,233
"My name is Joo Woo-jae."

711
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,202
There's so much stuff on there.

712
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,538
It says I should get up
and do a 90-degree bow.

713
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,572
Can you lift this?

714
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,907
-Okay.
-Let me help you.

715
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,475
-Like this?
-Yes.

716
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,409
STANDING AWKWARDLY

717
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,677
You'll do it standing?

718
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,578
Bow.

719
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,313
BOWING LOW

720
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,814
-He's bowing?
-Oh, he's bowing.

721
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,849
CRIMINAL WOO-JAE GREETS YOU

722
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,585
HE'S A RATHER POLITE CRIMINAL

723
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,156
"You can just call me a brat."

724
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,959
"I have nothing to brag about,

725
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,695
but I have acted very conceited."

726
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,564
"I may think they're older

727
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,833
and I would act like I am
treating them as persons older than I."

728
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,702
You mean, "than me."

729
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,537
STAMMERING

730
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,006
-You use "than I" when you are--
-Get on with it.

731
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,374
-Just read it.
-Read it already.

732
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,976
-Come on.
-Geez.

733
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,778
-This is why…
-Geez.

734
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,980
"Deep down, I have been
looking down on them."

735
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,815
"There's no need to
even mention Woo-young."

736
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,183
Seriously.

737
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,385
"When I joined Screwballs,

738
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,621
I simply had studied simply more than…"

739
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,790
Geez. He wrote "simply" twice.

740
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,124
POUT

741
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,193
"So I behaved badly
because I was stuck-up."

742
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,695
"Come to think of it,

743
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,197
I was the one
who had the most complaints."

744
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,765
"I am sorry about that."

745
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,434
"It's not that I didn't have the energy."

746
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,070
"I just wanted to finish filming
and get--"

747
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,273
What? Read it again.

748
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,708
TOO ASHAMED TO EVEN LIFT HIS HEAD

749
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,310
-Energy?
-"It's not that I…

750
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,912
It's not that I didn't have the energy."

751
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,015
"I just wanted to finish filming
and get paid."

752
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,183
"I am sorry about that."

753
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:02,120
"As an entertainer, I must
provide laughter in an enjoyable way."

754
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,623
"In that aspect, I hold
Sae-ho in high regard."

755
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,126
"How can he be so funny?"

756
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,630
"And whenever I looked in the mirror,
I thought I looked so cool

757
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,065
when I am not really that great."

758
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,767
"I'll refrain from doing that."

759
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,135
You need to choke up a little.

760
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,139
"I am thankful for being able to
shoot this show with them."

761
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,476
"I will be polite to the older members

762
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,244
and…

763
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,646
I'll take care of our youngest."

764
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,880
APOLOGIZING FOR HIS PAST IN TEARS

765
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:32,350
"I will always smile on set."

766
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,818
"That brat!"

767
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,053
THAT BRAT!

768
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,956
"Whenever we are
shooting our show from now on,

769
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,492
I'll be a brat for being with them."

770
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,093
I mean,
"I'll be thankful to be with them."

771
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,829
"Get up and bow…"

772
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,197
DO A 90-DEGREE BOW AS AN APOLOGY

773
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,399
Look forward.

774
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,570
HUMBLY EXPRESSES HIS REPENTANCE

775
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,672
Thank you.

776
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,373
You read it well.

777
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,574
-You did so well.
-Nice.

778
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,843
-Did I read it in the right tone?
-You did.

779
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,045
-I read it well?
-Yes.

780
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,647
It was a meaningful time.

781
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,748
-It was meaningful.
-Of course.

782
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,183
It's because…

783
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,552
-It makes you think.
-Yeah, it makes you think.

784
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,021
You know, I was kind of worried

785
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,223
that there would be a lot of falsehoods.

786
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,460
But when the falsehoods go down,
the level of shame…

787
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,928
SHAME INCREASES
WHEN CLOSER TO THE TRUTH

788
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,229
…goes up.

789
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,364
Keep it light.

790
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,465
I feel shame.

791
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,866
You wouldn't if you just read it.

792
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,234
But if you read it with this on,

793
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,669
-you feel that way.
-Right.

794
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,004
You're kneeling too.

795
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,272
CHUNHYANG'S CANGUE:
SELF-REFLECTION EFFECT

796
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,574
Jin-kyung, please wear the cangue.

797
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,609
Jin-kyung looks really exotic.

798
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,912
You look really exotic.

799
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,247
-Well, she is…
-You look good in it.

800
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,516
IT JUST HAPPENS
TO START DRIZZLING

801
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,286
SHE LOOKS SOMEWHAT CREEPY

802
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,220
BY WOO-JAE
ABOUT JIN-KYUNG

803
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,856
It wasn't hard to write Jin-kyung's.

804
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,924
Why is it so long?

805
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,226
It's so long.

806
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,728
He wrote with determination.

807
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,630
SHE LAUGHS AS SOON AS SHE SEES IT

808
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,599
-Gosh, but she is…
-Read it, Jin-kyung.

809
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,468
-This is insane.
-It's like a music video.

810
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,670
"Hello, I'm Hong Jin-kyung."

811
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,704
"Currently…"

812
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,807
This may sound familiar to you, Sook.

813
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,009
This looks very familiar.

814
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,612
"Currently, I'm on
an overseas business trip."

815
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,415
"Currently, I'm on
an overseas business trip."

816
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,819
FEELING DIZZY

817
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,387
Do you not want to eat, Jin-kyung?

818
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,056
Read it already.

819
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,125
"Due to the time difference,

820
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,994
I just checked the Internet."

821
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,131
-"I deeply regret this late apology."
-You can't use her real apology.

822
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,166
"When I woke up this morning…"

823
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,567
REALITY IS HARD TO FACE

824
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,436
I didn't realize Woo-jae
was capable of this.

825
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,272
They said I should bring an apology.

826
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,774
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

827
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,741
She won't get to eat.

828
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,576
"I saw that I had so many missed calls."

829
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,345
Gosh, Woo-jae.

830
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,881
-You're so witty.
-I just used an existing example.

831
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,816
-You're so witty.
-He really is smart.

832
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,920
"The photos from my feed were taken
at a store in Stockholm two days ago."

833
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,622
I WANT TO CRY

834
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,024
THE WRITER AND READER OF THE APOLOGY
CANNOT LIFT THEIR HEADS

835
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,426
I MAY BE SMILING BUT I'M CRYING INSIDE

836
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,262
Jin-kyung, just stop.

837
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,963
Just stop.

838
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,998
Stop reading that.

839
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,400
-The real apology is at the bottom.
-Yeah.

840
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,471
You can read the rest
on Jin-kyung's Instagram account.

841
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,206
The one in the back is the real apology.

842
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,275
"Hello, I'm Hong Jin-kyung."

843
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,209
BURSTING OUT LAUGHING

844
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,777
What is it?

845
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,779
THE JOKER IS LAUGHING MANY TIMES TODAY

846
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,881
You are ruthless, Woo-jae.

847
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,285
"We decided to get back together."

848
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:21,786
"I'm sorry."

849
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,754
What the heck?

850
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,324
BE HAPPY, MS. JOKER

851
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,461
REVEALING HER NUMBER TOO

852
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,230
-Her number?
-Gosh, this is so annoying!

853
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,333
"If there is anybody who would
like to whisk me away,

854
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,534
call me on this number."

855
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,404
CONGRATULATIONS
JIN-KYUNG PUBLICLY SEEKS FOR BOYFRIEND

856
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,372
Gosh, this is just insane.

857
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,640
That was hilarious.

858
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,576
Thanks to Woo-jae,

859
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,845
I was able to
reflect on my sins yet again.

860
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,013
I would like to apologize once again.

861
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,684
-They created a moment to reflect.
-It was too good of an idea to not use.

862
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,885
-Right.
-Nice.

863
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,588
-You're up, Sook.
-Is it me?

864
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,922
Jin-kyung wrote hers.

865
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,524
-Jin-kyung wrote it?
-Yes.

866
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,960
That is kind of unexpected.

867
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,630
What? Why is it so long?

868
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:07,932
-Gosh.
-"Hello."

869
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,835
-"I'm Kim Sook."
-She put so much effort into it.

870
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,870
It's so long.

871
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:16,808
"Today, I'd like to open up to you about
a story of mine that I've kept hidden."

872
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,345
"Some of you may have already noticed."

873
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,280
"Yes, it's true."

874
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,015
"I haven't been able to quit smoking yet."

875
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,752
Darn, I was going to write that.

876
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,655
"Whenever I claimed that
I didn't smoke on television,

877
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,058
I felt guilty
and wanted to confess honestly."

878
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,194
I knew I smelt nicotine patches on her.

879
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,362
Yeah.

880
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,364
"I am sorry."

881
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,566
"When the shoot goes well
and I'm not stressed,

882
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,967
I would go for a puff

883
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:43,968
after each meal."

884
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,506
"I survive with just three cigarettes."

885
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,310
"Honestly, whenever
I blow away all my worries

886
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,545
-and troubles with cigarette smoke…
-It's so long.

887
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,847
…I truly think

888
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,815
there's nothing quite like it."

889
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,285
She filled two pages.

890
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,719
"But from now, I, Sook,

891
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,322
promise to only smoke

892
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,692
just one cigarette after each meal."

893
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,763
"Also, since I'm making apologies,
let me add one more."

894
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,131
"Actually, not too long ago…"

895
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:14,599
BITTER LAUGHTER

896
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,934
Who wrote this?

897
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,969
"Someone proposed to me."

898
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,573
"It was neither
Gu Bon-seung or Yoon Jung-soo."

899
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,975
"It was my first love."

900
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,077
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

901
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,145
Who is it?

902
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,582
"My first love that was in prison

903
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,418
was released not long ago."

904
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,054
Isn't this a real story?

905
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,457
"And he officially proposed to me."

906
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,559
-Gosh, this is insane.
-It finally came true though.

907
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,695
"I hid this fact

908
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,531
as I was blinded
by the concept of the show

909
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,133
and acted like I was having a fling
with Mr. Gu Bon-seung."

910
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,302
"I felt guilty about this as well."

911
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,637
"I'd like to apologize for that."

912
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,206
"On the show, I pretended to
be the girl crush type

913
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,008
and acted like I wasn't
interested in men."

914
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,109
"But actually,

915
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,978
I am crazy about men."

916
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,780
THAT'S WHY HER SCANDALS NEVER CEASED

917
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,849
"I haven't moved in yet

918
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,151
with my first love who was in prison,

919
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,154
but I'll let you know as soon as
I have some good news to share."

920
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,824
"Please believe me just this once."
Who wrote this?

921
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,159
-The detail.
-She put effort into it.

922
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,829
Since she had written an apology before,

923
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,297
it was well composed.

924
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,999
Yes, it was structured very well.

925
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,133
Definitely different.

926
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,935
Gosh, you're scary.

927
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,537
It's scary when they know your past.

928
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,605
There's another one?

929
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,242
"I cannot be satisfied with just one man."

930
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,979
"I have a special preference
for various dialects in men."

931
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,147
Is that all?

932
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,616
SHORT BUT POWERFUL APOLOGY

933
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,352
-All right. Since it's raining a lot now…
-Yes.

934
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,687
…let's move inside and continue.

935
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:43,888
-Okay.
-Okay.

936
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,391
That was so funny.

937
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,625
TO AVOID THE GENTLY FALLING AUTUMN RAIN

938
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,461
THE MEMBERS GO TO A RESTAURANT

939
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,696
Our seats aren't decided yet?

940
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,097
They aren't assigned yet?

941
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,298
The voting has ended.

942
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,300
We can't just pick a seat and sit then.

943
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,435
Just sit anywhere…

944
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,336
THE VOTES WILL DECIDE THEIR MEAL

945
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,471
Look at what's in front of you.

946
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,241
There's raw sea bass, sea bream,

947
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,910
spicy rock fish stew,
grilled fish, raw fish bibimbap,

948
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,812
-and small octopus bibimbap.
-It looks so good.

949
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,816
I want to mix the sea squirt with my rice.

950
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,485
So our staff finished voting.

951
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,155
We have the ranking
from first place to fifth place.

952
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,689
-As we said before…
-That's right.

953
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:23,528
…the person in last place
and the person who wrote that apology

954
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,963
will just eat rice and kimchi.

955
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,898
Got it.

956
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,466
-Jin-kyung wrote well.
-I'm not sure.

957
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,234
Jin-kyung wrote a good apology.

958
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,936
"Actually, I am crazy about men."

959
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,772
THE JOKER SHOWED SHE WAS
AN EXPERIENCED APOLOGY WRITER

960
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,140
Woo-jae's wasn't bad either.

961
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,076
"Finish filming and get paid."

962
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,511
SAE-HO MADE THE BRAT WOO-JAE FEEL SHAME

963
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,914
Woo-jae's wasn't bad either.

964
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,582
Let me tell you the final result.

965
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,217
I think Woo-jae will definitely eat.

966
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,685
The winner is,

967
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,720
the person who touched
their heart the most…

968
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:50,755
Me, me, me.

969
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:51,956
Congratulations, Woo-jae.

970
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,660
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

971
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,727
What are you about to do?

972
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,896
BOWING DEEPLY

973
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,898
HE MUST HAVE FELT A LOT OF REMORSE

974
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,234
He can end up in last place too, can't he?

975
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,203
Of course. Someone is in last place

976
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,106
and if Woo-jae wrote
that person's apology,

977
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,907
-he just gets rice.
-That's right.

978
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,844
-Oh, that's how it works.
-Woo-jae, you are definitely here!

979
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,312
-You wrote one for everybody.
-But…

980
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,281
I wrote Sae-ho's well.

981
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,182
Didn't I, Sae-ho?

982
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,417
I don't think it was bad.

983
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,651
He wrote his apology well.

984
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,186
-He wrote well.
-Here's second place.

985
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,654
Jin-kyung.

986
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,456
-Hers was good too.
-Jin-kyung.

987
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,959
Jin-kyung, you wrote
Sook's apology so well.

988
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,293
-Yeah.
-Come over here.

989
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,095
Next, third place.

990
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,798
-Kimchi…
-Congratulations,

991
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,934
-Sae-ho.
-Yes, it's me.

992
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,136
3RD PLACE SAE-HO

993
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,303
THANK YOU

994
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,204
Wait.

995
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,340
Hang on.

996
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,610
-Whose did you write?
-Yours.

997
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,811
WAIT A MINUTE…

998
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,079
And I wrote yours!

999
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,816
Hey! I wrote his and he wrote mine!

1000
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,521
OUT OF ALL THOSE,
THEY WROTE EACH OTHER'S APOLOGY

1001
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,090
-We did it!
-Yeah!

1002
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,691
-Let's eat.
-Have a seat.

1003
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,260
-Do we need to hear more?
-Let's eat.

1004
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,794
-That's the exact result.
-Okay.

1005
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,396
That was accurate. Take a seat.

1006
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,864
Thank you very much!

1007
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,533
-It looks good.
-Why'd you write mine?

1008
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,135
Gosh, Sook.
I shouldn't have written yours.

1009
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,005
-How did it end up like that?
-I thought no one would write hers.

1010
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,773
I thought my jokes weren't too bad,

1011
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,742
but I didn't realize they'd go that far.

1012
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,743
Come on.

1013
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,011
I just wanted…

1014
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,379
What is this?

1015
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,814
DESPITE THEIR REGRETS,
ALL THEY GET IS RICE AND KIMCHI

1016
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,283
This is sea bream?

1017
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,250
THE WINNERS ENJOY THEIR FEAST

1018
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,152
Can I have another bowl of rice please?

1019
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,154
Isn't this how you eat raw fish?

1020
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,456
He doesn't know how to eat it.

1021
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,192
He dipped it in chogochujang.

1022
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,726
HE EATS RAW FISH
FOR THE CHOGOCHUJANG FLAVOR

1023
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,529
He doesn't even know
how to eat it properly. Geez.

1024
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,064
What kind of fish is this?

1025
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,699
-Can I have some fish too?
-Sure.

1026
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,671
THEY'RE ABOUT TO DROOL

1027
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,172
They just caught

1028
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,307
the sea bream.

1029
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,675
Basically, yeah.

1030
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,210
It's freshly caught.

1031
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,111
DROOLING

1032
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,813
The sea bream is freshly caught.

1033
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,881
THE FRESHNESS IS INCREDIBLE

1034
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,083
-What kind of fish is that grilled fish?
-It's so good.

1035
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,285
-Sea bream.
-It's sea bream.

1036
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,753
They grilled the sea bream?

1037
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,888
They did.

1038
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,323
-You know--
-Well done.

1039
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,124
Do you have any sesame oil?

1040
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,093
THE SEA BREAM IS GRILLED TO PERFECTION

1041
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,830
GET A GOOD PIECE
OF THE SEA BREAM AND NOM NOM

1042
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,864
GASPS IN AMAZEMENT

1043
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,633
That's sea bream?

1044
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,101
It's so good.

1045
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,505
Slow down, Sae-ho. You'll get sick.

1046
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,007
JANG CHEN INHALES THE SPICY FISH STEW

1047
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,709
-Yeah.
-The soup is awesome.

1048
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,177
Jin-kyung.

1049
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,779
-It's awesome.
-The spicy fish stew is amazing.

1050
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:29,680
GREAT FOR HANGOVERS

1051
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,483
That fish stew looks incredible.

1052
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,319
To be honest, I was

1053
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,522
worried about eating this.

1054
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,926
But Gangjin is different.

1055
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,227
-Geez.
-It's so good.

1056
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:47,198
-I've never had fish that didn't smell.
-Yeah, he asked for a burger.

1057
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,467
He asked for a burger.

1058
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,935
For real, though…

1059
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,036
SCANNING

1060
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,904
-It's so delicious.
-Wait, I have

1061
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,506
small octopus bibimbap.

1062
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,942
-Small octopus bibimbap.
-You can't eat it?

1063
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,176
Can't eat the small octopus?

1064
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,845
No.

1065
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,014
-What about the sea squirt?
-Give it to us then.

1066
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,448
-And the sea squirt?
-I can eat it.

1067
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,650
I'm going to try it.

1068
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,319
HERE, HAVE SOME SMALL OCTOPUS

1069
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,987
HERE, SMALL OCTOPUS
NOPE, JUST CUCUMBER

1070
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,723
-Don't mess with me.
-Pass me a cup.

1071
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,458
Woo-jae.

1072
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,827
Can you not eat cucumbers?

1073
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,963
-Give it to us.
-If you can't eat them…

1074
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,767
What else? Small octopus?

1075
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,801
THE CUCUMBER HAS SMALL OCTOPUS ON IT

1076
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,471
Take some cucumber.

1077
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,407
GIGGLING

1078
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,508
Why is there so much?

1079
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,742
There's too much. Take some.

1080
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,177
RICE TOPPED WITH CUCUMBER?

1081
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,914
THE RICE AND KIMCHI TEAM START EATING TOO

1082
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,784
-Sook, look at the color of the kimchi.
-Is it good?

1083
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,053
-It looks amazing.
-It's different.

1084
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,324
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

1085
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,859
SURPRISED

1086
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,063
THE RIPE KIMCHI MAKES THEIR EYES WIDEN

1087
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,230
What the heck?

1088
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,265
They don't have any.

1089
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,834
They don't have kimchi.

1090
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,303
-Wow!
-You don't have ripe kimchi?

1091
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,539
-It's so good.
-What's the point then?

1092
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,577
THEY'RE IN AWE
AS THEY INHALE THE RIPE KIMCHI

1093
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,113
Look, Javier Bardem eats kimchi well.

1094
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,450
He eats Korean food well.

1095
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,151
It's just what I like.

1096
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,722
It's one of the best kimchi
I had in my life.

1097
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:22,026
It's the best kimchi I had this year.
This is insane.

1098
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,127
The ripe kimchi.

1099
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,096
The kimchi is really good.

1100
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,599
-So this is the flavor of Gangjin.
-They boiled the fish really well.

1101
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,600
WOW

1102
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,304
TAUNTING

1103
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,005
So this is the flavor of Gangjin.

1104
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:35,906
I'D RATHER NOT LOOK

1105
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:36,941
Okay. Look,

1106
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,876
go over there and do a sexy dance.

1107
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,345
Then, I'll give you a piece of sea bass.

1108
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,580
No, the sea bream.

1109
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,581
INNER CONFLICT

1110
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:44,715
You should eat it.

1111
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,250
Sexy dance is no problem for you.

1112
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,053
How about this? We'll see you dance

1113
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,722
and decide whether we'll give you
five seconds, three seconds,

1114
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,591
10 seconds, or 20 seconds.

1115
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,626
HURTING THE BEAST-LIKE IDOL'S PRIDE

1116
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,228
Look here.

1117
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,563
Jang Woo-young of 2PM, dance for us.

1118
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,065
DANCE FOR US

1119
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,366
He is pissing me off.

1120
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,369
-Hey, do a medley of your hit songs.
-Do it.

1121
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,572
BUT I HAVE TO CONSIDER MY PRIDE AS 2PM…

1122
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,208
HERE GOES!

1123
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,476
He's doing it.

1124
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,779
HIS STAGE IS THE RESTAURANT FLOOR

1125
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,547
BUT HIS DANCE MOVES
ARE MORE SINCERE THAN EVER

1126
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,615
Very good.

1127
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,850
ON HIS THIRD SONG ALREADY

1128
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,485
SMILING

1129
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,353
Do Soda Pop.

1130
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,321
Lalala soda pop

1131
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,223
OF COURSE,
HE ENDS WITH LALALA SODA POP

1132
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,959
-"Lalala soda pop" is the best.
-It's the best.

1133
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,094
That's the best.

1134
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,596
I have three options
for the length of time.

1135
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,465
One is 10 seconds,

1136
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,499
another is 30 seconds,

1137
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,802
-and the other one is one minute.
-Okay.

1138
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:38,969
Of one to three, which one?

1139
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,504
-Three.
-Three?

1140
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,773
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

1141
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,008
You get 10 seconds.

1142
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,109
SADLY, YOU GET 10 SECONDS

1143
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,510
-That's enough.
-Just 10 seconds.

1144
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,745
It's longer than you think.

1145
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,013
I gave him a lot.

1146
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,215
FOR 10 SECONDS,
HE CAN GET AS MUCH FOOD AS HE WANTS

1147
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,983
Start off with a fish.

1148
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,884
THIS ONE?

1149
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,085
UNNECESSARILY INTENSE

1150
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,353
Shall we start?

1151
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,023
You don't know when I'll start,
so look at me and go.

1152
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,791
-Try this one.
-Come on.

1153
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,793
-Try this one.
-Come on, man.

1154
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,095
-How about this one?
-Get out of my way.

1155
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,464
Get out of my way.

1156
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,932
Why did he get the perilla leaves?

1157
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,166
Why did he get so many?

1158
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,202
-Time's up.
-Okay.

1159
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,636
-Take the top one out.
-Why?

1160
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,104
-I got it.
-You tried to stop me.

1161
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,506
-Get lost!
-No.

1162
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,408
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1163
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,576
Get lost!

1164
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,977
Darn it. Get lost.

1165
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,314
That's enough from you!

1166
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,782
INTIMIDATED

1167
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,683
You piece of trash!

1168
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,650
SHOULDN'T HAVE TEASED HIM SO MUCH

1169
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,586
I've never seen Woo-young like this.

1170
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,322
-Only you can eat.
-Whatever!

1171
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,289
-Just eat it.
-Not this.

1172
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,158
-I want to share.
-She has to do it too.

1173
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,693
-I already ate a bowl.
-Really?

1174
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,760
Am I eating all of it?

1175
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,332
TAKES A HUGE BITE

1176
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,399
Wow!

1177
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,302
TASTES EVEN BETTER
BECAUSE HE WORKED HARD FOR IT

1178
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,137
Is it good? Which one is good?

1179
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,939
-Sook.
-Is it really good?

1180
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,708
The grease on it is just…

1181
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:51,675
What should I do?

1182
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:56,247
THE BIG EATER AND THE PICKY EATER
ARE ALL IN A TRANCE WHILE EATING

1183
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,581
I need to do something.

1184
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,183
What should I do?

1185
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,418
Want me to teach you Soda Pop?

1186
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,855
Gosh, I want some.

1187
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,323
You know what's annoying?

1188
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,159
If it didn't look good,
I'd just try to be funny.

1189
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,929
-But because I wanted to eat it so much…
-It's so good.

1190
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,531
…it really hurt my pride.

1191
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,301
This is how I'm eating it.

1192
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,936
I REALLY WANT TO EAT IT
I WANT IT

1193
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,070
Wow! The abalone.

1194
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,140
-Sook, hear me out.
-It's so good.

1195
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,575
So as not to embarrass you,

1196
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,978
just ask me, "Woo-jae, do me a favor."

1197
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,914
Pick something you like and ask,

1198
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,315
"Can I have some?"

1199
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,449
Then, I'll give it to you.

1200
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,884
-Really?
-Yeah.

1201
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,888
Even just seeing you ask me politely
will move me to give it to you.

1202
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,256
Woo-jae.

1203
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,224
I KNEW IT, DEAR BROTHER

1204
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,860
I want to eat some abalone.
May I have some?

1205
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,794
No.

1206
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,935
THERE MAY BE A REPORT
OF A MURDER IN GAU-DO

1207
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,369
Where's my oxygen tank?

1208
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:54,905
KOREA'S 99TH PERCENTILE PERSONALITY

1209
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,740
I want to hear your laughter, Sook.

1210
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,142
If you laugh heartily

1211
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,177
and say, "Give me something,"
I'll give you some.

1212
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,546
Just laugh?

1213
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,448
Just laugh and say, "Give me something."

1214
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,951
"Give me some abalone." Then, laugh.

1215
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,385
BARDEM MUSTERS UP COURAGE

1216
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,821
Who are you?

1217
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,590
I'm just a lonesome traveler.

1218
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,924
Give me some abalone!

1219
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,825
HE INTERCEPTS

1220
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,160
No.

1221
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,730
Geez. I was trying to
get up the nerve to do it.

1222
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,932
I was really trying get up the nerve.

1223
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,100
Gosh, darn it.

1224
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,605
Look,

1225
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,174
-I'm just passing by.
-Yes.

1226
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,209
Give me some abalone.

1227
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,378
EVIL LAUGH

1228
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,046
KEEPS LAUGHING

1229
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,282
Give me that abalone!

1230
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,552
Give me some abalone.

1231
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,122
Nice. I'd better give you some.

1232
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,625
SHE GETS THE ABALONE WITH THE HEARTY LAUGH

1233
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,659
It's good.

1234
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,994
THEY EVEN SHARE A PIECE OF ABALONE

1235
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,995
Eat all of it.

1236
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,263
Come on.

1237
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,598
It's so good.

1238
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,833
Come on, Sook.

1239
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,034
HE TAKES A PIECE AS SHE INSISTS

1240
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,337
Come on, man. Are you serious?

1241
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,239
Do you want some more? Want anything else?

1242
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,273
No, I'm fine.

1243
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,509
THE VILLAINS WERE PICKIER THAN EXPECTED

1244
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,144
Can I really just eat now?

1245
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,646
I don't have to beg for it?

1246
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,980
THEY SHARE THE FOOD WITH THOSE WHO STARVED

1247
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,148
-Sook.
-Yeah?

1248
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,150
-They're sharing?
-We don't have to beg.

1249
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,084
SLURPING IT UP

1250
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,554
I have some.

1251
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,556
-You should eat some.
-Okay.

1252
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,426
They're like siblings
that look out for one another.

1253
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,327
POOR BUT CLOSE VILLAIN SIBLINGS

1254
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,228
Where's the sauce?

1255
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,629
-It's here.
-Sook.

1256
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,431
-This one's amazing.
-Which one?

1257
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,433
This one?

1258
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,135
Are you still eating?

1259
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,102
It's awesome.

1260
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,072
You see, Chef Yoon Nam-no said

1261
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,274
it's good if you pour sesame oil on it.

1262
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,609
Yeah, I think I saw that too.

1263
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,610
Pour a lot like this.

1264
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,778
That much?

1265
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,347
Aren't you just eating sesame oil?

1266
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,748
HE WAS A BIT DOUBTFUL

1267
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:45,783
Isn't it awesome?

1268
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,452
HE REACTS ENTHUSIASTICALLY
IT MUST BE GOOD

1269
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,420
It's really good!

1270
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,621
With a spoonful of rice…

1271
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,322
Look.

1272
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,857
Woo-young, try it.

1273
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,759
Do this.

1274
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,361
Hang on.

1275
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,596
1. PUT THE RAW FISH DIPPED IN CHOGOCHUJANG
OVER THE WARM RICE

1276
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,566
2. POUR A LOT OF SESAME OIL OVER IT

1277
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,634
Give it a try.

1278
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,135
HE TAKES A HUGE BITE

1279
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,071
Wow. It's really good.

1280
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:09,873
YUM

1281
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,777
IT'S PERFECT FOR BARDEM AS WELL

1282
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,846
They say you can't
gain weight eating raw fish.

1283
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,549
But you'll gain a lot of weight
if you eat it like this.

1284
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,184
-You'll become a pig.
-It's so good.

1285
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,286
It's so good.

1286
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,855
It's good with the sesame oil on top.

1287
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,457
Even the sesame oil is good.

1288
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:31,161
THE VILLAINS, NOW SATISFIED HAPPY PIGS,
FINISH THEIR MEAL

1289
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,497
ONE HOUR LATER

1290
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,700
Come on. I should be feeling something.

1291
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,269
Yeah, you should be feeling something.

1292
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,406
What is MS? Min-seo?

1293
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,309
Myeong-soo?

1294
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,245
-What could it be?
-Min…

1295
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,986
It's so funny!

1296
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,924
