1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,504
THE FOREST THRIVES UNDER THE CARE OF
THE GUARDIAN DEITY OF THE MOUNTAINS

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,607
FAIRIES' BEATING WINGS
STIR THE PETALS

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,844
AS DANDELION SEEDS
SCATTER ACROSS THE MEADOW…

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,381
THE WORLD OF FAIRY TALES
UNFOLDS ITSELF

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,019
I wonder where the lamp is

6
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,186
DRESS CODE:
FAIRY TALE CHARACTERS

7
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,889
The lamp that grants wishes

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,290
But I…

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,093
Today's an exception
I'm not the magical being of the lamp

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,729
Freed from the inflamed lymph nodes

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,832
I'm Cho-nie, the magical being
of the lymph nodes!

12
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,934
That's my concept for today.

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,403
Hello, everyone.

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,071
I'M CHO-NIE, IT'S A PLEASURE

15
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,474
HE MUST BE PLANNING
TO USE THE LAMP FOR ANOTHER BIT…

16
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,044
Sorry, but…

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,779
-I'm not done yet.
-Hello!

18
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,514
-I'm not done yet.
-Hello!

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,782
-My bit's not over.
-Who are you?

20
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,383
-I need more time.
-I want to stay…

21
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,818
-Wait--
-Shut it.

22
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,520
-Please.
-I want to stay young forever.

23
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,687
Forgive me--

24
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,122
I don't want to grow up.

25
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,624
-Your show--
-What's your name?

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,892
-Your entrance is set--
-Hi.

27
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,527
-I hate to interrupt--
-Get lost.

28
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,162
I want to stay young forever.

29
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,731
-The Aladdin performance isn't--
-We are Neverland!

30
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,000
Excuse me,
but the show Aladdin isn't over yet.

31
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
My gosh!

32
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,135
WHAT'S A LAMP DOING HERE?

33
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,471
HERE COMES CHO-NIE

34
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,605
Did you just fart?

35
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,775
Who is the master of the lamp?

36
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,478
I'll grant you three wishes.

37
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,612
What's your first wish?

38
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,281
Let me think…

39
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,583
Wire me 100 million won right away.

40
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,818
Poof!

41
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,353
Okay, Ms. Kim Sook's vehicle
is parked across the field.

42
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,189
Inside, there's 100 million won in cash.

43
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
It's yours.

44
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,324
-I see.
-Amazing, right?

45
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,059
My purse is filled with bills.

46
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,294
CHO-NIE'S RICH FRIEND

47
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,862
What's your second wish?

48
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,298
I want my new album to be a smash hit.

49
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,532
SOMEONE RUSHES IN

50
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,572
PETER PAN'S ARCHNEMESIS,
CAPTAIN HOOK

51
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,074
You, Hook!
I didn't appreciate you barging in.

52
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,676
I loved that.

53
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,777
Must you do that?

54
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,649
Love it.

55
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,151
HOOK TURNS OUT TO BE PETER'S BESTIE

56
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,053
PETER PAN AND CAPT. HOOK'S DANCE CHALLENGE

57
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,588
Man, he's learned the moves already.

58
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,691
He's a better dancer
than some of the idols.

59
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,792
-Gosh.
-Wow.

60
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,227
-Hello.
-Hello.

61
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,195
Do you perhaps own this plot of land?

62
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,331
Is that it?

63
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,665
AN ELDERLY MAN DRESSED IN WHITE

64
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,601
DOES HAVE THE VIBE OF
THE LAND OWNER

65
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,970
-Is that it?
-Let me take them.

66
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,972
Tell me.

67
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,174
Are these axes perhaps in red and blue?

68
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,912
Look, Hook. Watch it, okay?

69
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,680
It's just that…

70
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,149
One's in gold and the other's in silver.

71
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,551
-You saw them wrong.
-I blame the eye patch.

72
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,886
I couldn't tell the colors.

73
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,787
Let's now begin a color blindness test.

74
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,256
-Hey!
-A color blindness test?

75
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,224
STARTLED

76
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,526
-Sae-ho.
-Yeah?

77
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,795
You have to look out for me,
don't you think?

78
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,131
Help me survive, okay?

79
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,199
But Jin-kyung,

80
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,602
everyone now knows
that you made an honest mistake.

81
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,971
-They were surprised--
-Did you have to bring it up?

82
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,973
Don't remind the viewers
of the long-forgotten memory.

83
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,341
Jin-kyung--

84
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,846
Someone stole my tarts!

85
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,949
Who dared to take them?
Where are my tarts?

86
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,684
-Just like a scene from a musical.
-Was it you?

87
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,752
Or you?

88
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:06,819
-Gosh.
-Did you take them?

89
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,154
-I didn't.
-Was it you?

90
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,956
-Did you take my tarts?
-Gosh.

91
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,928
Like watching a musical.

92
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,131
I thought you'd loosen up a bit
after hitting the 30th-year milestone.

93
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,499
-What?
-Don't you think so?

94
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,167
-It's the opposite.
-Really?

95
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,903
-I have to plow on, even harder…
-Where do your eyes end?

96
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,772
I love how colorful our costumes are.

97
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,106
If I may…

98
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,243
-Shall we present our inspirations?
-Good idea.

99
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,845
My inspiration is the Queen of Hearts

100
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,814
from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

101
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,482
Oh, the Queen of Hearts.

102
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,017
Why does he look so frail anyway?

103
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,019
-I guess I do.
-You look too weak to be Captain Hook.

104
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,488
Peter Pan could
probably take me in a fight.

105
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,825
Our Captain Hook
must've starved himself on his ship.

106
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,627
I shall conquer the sea

107
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,861
and take Peter Pan down!

108
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,096
Oh, now I see it.

109
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,598
-Did you plan together?
-About Peter Pan,

110
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,666
what does Captain Hook do to Peter Pan?

111
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,369
-Does he mistreat the kid?
-Why don't they get along?

112
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,071
Let's bury the hatchet, then.

113
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,640
All right. But if you ask me,
you probably started it.

114
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,841
Let's be good friends.

115
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,076
I bet Peter picked a fight.

116
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,477
Let's have a meal together.

117
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,180
We made our peace.
Captain Hook and I get along fine now.

118
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,015
-Next.
-Who's next?

119
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,850
-Please introduce yourself.
-Okay. Hello.

120
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,485
-I want to stay…
-In Everland?

121
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,586
Well, yeah.

122
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,288
Aren't you a staff member there?

123
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,522
-At Amazon Express?
-It's Neverland.

124
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,590
Amazon Express?

125
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,925
Can you do the dance for us?

126
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,361
AMAZON EXPRESS INSTRUCTION SONG
SCREWBALLS' VERSION

127
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,462
Expect water splashes

128
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,163
-From front and back
-I'm from Neverland.

129
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,832
Your socks will get drenched

130
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,300
Your pants too

131
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,168
We're in the Amazon

132
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,536
We're in the Amazon

133
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,071
This isn't it, guys.

134
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,440
-Amazon
-You got the wrong idea.

135
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,075
-No, we didn't.
-Okay.

136
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,543
Hi, I'm Amazon.

137
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,413
-How hilarious.
-Can you introduce yourself?

138
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,348
I'm a boy who doesn't want to grow up.

139
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,484
I'm Peter Pan,
the boy who wishes to stay young.

140
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,287
I had no idea Woo-jae
would dress up as Captain Hook.

141
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,956
I didn't think
anyone would choose Peter either.

142
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,794
You'll probably find
my character very familiar.

143
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,329
-It's--
-I have the answer.

144
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,830
-Yes?
-You're Nol-bu.

145
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,565
-What gave you that idea?
-Aren't I right?

146
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,668
-Are you the Deity of Dongmyo Market?
-I'm afraid not.

147
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,935
-Smurf?
-No.

148
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,337
-Really?
-Rat from Kong-jwi and Pat-jwi?

149
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,405
That's incorrect.

150
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,840
WHAT KIND OF INSULT
WILL JIN-KYUNG THROW AT HIM?

151
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,208
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,410
-It's just…
-We understand.

153
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,513
I'm too rueful to come up
with clever lines just now.

154
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,882
My mind is filled with regret.

155
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,485
I'm the magical being of lymph nodes,
who recently had surgery on them.

156
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,888
NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY,
JIN-KYUNG CAN'T EVEN SMILE

157
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,523
-My lymph nodes--
-Stop bringing them up.

158
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,757
Can you even recall my surgery?

159
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,426
WHINING EVEN AS JIN-KYUNG
SHARES HER DISTRESS

160
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,794
-Her heart's shattered.
-Oh, right.

161
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,162
Learn to read the room.

162
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,397
-Don't be such a baby.
-Who'd be hurting more, you or me?

163
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,566
-Are you a monk?
-I'm the guardian deity of mountains.

164
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,901
Oh, the guardian deity.

165
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,102
You're so quiet today.

166
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
Did something happen?

167
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,538
Not at all.

168
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,139
Why do you stick to white clothes lately?

169
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,207
DARN IT

170
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,842
Let me break it down for you.

171
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,645
On today's shoot,

172
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,880
-I may zone out a few times.
-Let's be understanding.

173
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,782
I may seem distracted sometimes,

174
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,317
but those moments

175
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,954
are when I'm overcome
by regret and remorse.

176
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,356
Such moments come and go these days.

177
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,891
-Please be understanding.
-She's all about a black-and-white look.

178
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,395
I'll try to bring my energy level up.
I do sincerely apologize.

179
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,798
Sook and I decided to support you
through our costume choices…

180
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,334
-That's right.
-…one in blue and the other in red,

181
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,636
-with no room for confusion.
-Exactly, with stark contrast.

182
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,904
-Don't worry.
-We're being neutral.

183
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,507
We only prepared these costumes
since the election is behind us.

184
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,743
She's had a sleepless week.

185
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,810
A REMORSEFUL WEEK

186
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,980
Today's dress code
is characters from fairy tales.

187
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,984
Let's say you could enter the world
of a fairy tale you favored as a child.

188
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,220
Is there a character you'd like to meet?

189
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,287
My answer is Pat-jwi.

190
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,589
-Pat-jwi.
-May I ask why?

191
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,790
Is she the good girl?

192
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,858
-Yeah.
-That's Kong-jwi.

193
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,059
-Is Kong-jwi the good one?
-Yeah.

194
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,494
-Pat-jwi…
-Kong-jwi's the kind one.

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,561
Kong-jwi's the kind girl.

196
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,963
Whichever girl Sook ends up meeting,

197
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,465
she's sure to think
Sook is stronger than her.

198
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,301
I won't sit back and accept abuse.

199
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,437
-Look at her fist.
-She's not working me to the bones.

200
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,671
-Just look.
-I won't wait around

201
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,174
for a toad to come help me
fill up the water pot.

202
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,676
Parts where Kong-jwi gets bullied
made me so sad as a child.

203
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,412
-You found them upsetting?
-Yeah.

204
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,881
I'd like to meet the Beast
from Beauty and the Beast.

205
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,282
The Beast. Wait.

206
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,350
He's right here.

207
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,484
THE BEAST

208
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,721
Who do you want to meet, Jin-kyung?

209
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,325
If I could travel across time and space
to meet someone,

210
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,161
I choose…

211
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,997
-myself before June this year.
-Oh, come on!

212
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,265
…is myself before June this year.

213
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,833
I WANT TO TURN BACK TIME

214
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,468
-Seriously, Jin-kyung?
-I mean it.

215
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,670
-But I'm not kidding.
-Stop it, okay?

216
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,572
-Must you bring it up?
-She's a true professional.

217
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,240
I need to tell her something.

218
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,742
-To myself, I mean.
-Like what?

219
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,011
I'll tell myself
to stay holed up in my home.

220
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,748
-She should just stay put at home.
-Without doing anything?

221
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,349
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

222
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,717
If only you had answered the phone.

223
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,954
-We kept calling, you know.
-I hear you had 80 missed calls.

224
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,323
I've been wondering.
How many missed calls did you get?

225
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,624
More than 80, I hear.

226
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,893
Isn't Director Park 78 of those calls?

227
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:45,631
I hear when Jin-kyung finally woke up,
he thought a war broke out in Korea.

228
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,033
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE

229
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,201
All those 80 or so calls

230
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,536
came from all walks of life…

231
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,672
THIS GUY INCLUDED

232
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,974
…including my manager, a designer,

233
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,443
a model, a comedian, and a singer.

234
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,013
People in various industries
and diverse age groups called me.

235
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,783
I had callers ranging from teenagers
to octogenarians,

236
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,119
from my daughter Ra-el's friends
to my mother's friends.

237
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,256
We even reached out
to the hotel you were staying in.

238
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,359
They did it to learn the number
of the room you were staying in

239
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,261
and called the landline,
but you were sound asleep.

240
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,063
-Yes, even that plan failed.
-Exactly.

241
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,933
By the way, Jin-kyung,
you earned my respect on one point.

242
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001
My gosh.

243
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,202
WHAT CAN THAT BE?

244
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,137
-You sleep like a baby.
-Jin-kyung does that, yeah.

245
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,173
-She's a sound sleeper.
-Sure.

246
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,274
That's why she's so tall.

247
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,142
You grew up to be tall for a reason.

248
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,512
You should do a commercial
for your bed brand.

249
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,015
-"Peaceful nights guaranteed."
-I wonder what the brand was.

250
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,584
-Tell us.
-I want to know about your duvet

251
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,952
and your pillow too.

252
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,554
I'm dying to know.

253
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,556
Maybe it's your costume,

254
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,991
but you do look thinner, Jin-kyung.

255
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,559
From the stress, I presume.

256
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,595
Why waste good food on me?

257
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,130
OH, DEAR

258
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,066
-What can we say when you go so far?
-Don't do that.

259
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,668
Why waste fine water and rice?

260
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,736
I deserve none of them.

261
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,538
I honestly feel that way.

262
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,973
Didn't you have some snacks
in your car earlier?

263
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,041
Let me check just in case.

264
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,509
I think she did have some.

265
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,111
I saw her brush some crumbs off.

266
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,746
I noticed them too.

267
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,481
Are you skipping lunch, Jin-kyung?

268
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,784
We'll see about that.

269
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,153
-Let's see.
-Sure, eat if you're hungry.

270
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,422
She's lost so much weight.
She's skin and bones.

271
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,391
Our theme for today

272
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,327
is to survive as characters
from fairy tales.

273
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,864
Become figures from fairy tales
and overcome various trials and hardships

274
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,300
to complete your own fairy tales.

275
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,670
You must win the games
to secure the dishes for your lunch.

276
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,038
All of them are group games.

277
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,340
But we've never won in a group game.

278
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,676
If any of you slip up,

279
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,278
all of you may have to go hungry.

280
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,616
Now, please come and see
the prize of the first game.

281
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,151
-Braised short ribs.
-Seafood hot pot?

282
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,452
Dang, it's short rib soup.

283
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,087
-Short rib soup?
-It looks so good.

284
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,188
Short ribs are huge.

285
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,692
Your first game's prize
is the braised short ribs.

286
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,226
It's my favorite.

287
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,697
The first fairy tale
is well known across the globe.

288
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,266
This classic has been adapted
into a film and a musical.

289
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,601
-Is it Aladdin?
-Introducing…

290
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,369
The Wizard of Oz.

291
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,906
In The Wizard of Oz,
Alice finds herself in a strange land.

292
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,374
THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WORKS

293
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,178
Dorothy, the protagonist,
gets swept up in a powerful tornado…

294
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,280
-So Dorothy's the lead.
-…and reaches the land of Oz.

295
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,749
So it has nothing to do
with Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?

296
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,817
Hold on.

297
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,418
DOROTHY AND ALIVE HAVE NEVER MET

298
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,486
Where does she appear?

299
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,822
-Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?
-Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

300
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,658
She rules over the trumps, right?

301
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,360
"Trump"?

302
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,594
-Aren't I right?
-You're right.

303
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,795
-As in trump cards.
-Yeah.

304
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,265
RESTLESS AT THE MENTION OF "TRUMP"

305
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,002
-You got it right.
-I wasn't talking about the person.

306
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,536
I meant the deck of cards.

307
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,038
Let's steer clear of politics.

308
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,240
How else can I talk about the trump cards?

309
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,242
-Don't talk about the president.
-But the cards--

310
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,778
Why would you mention that keyword, Sook?

311
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,146
I only meant the US president,

312
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,749
-President Trump.
-That's fine. It's the US politics--

313
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,486
TODAY'S THEME IS "FAIRY TALE"

314
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,288
In The Wizard of Oz,
a powerful tornado carries Dorothy

315
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,224
to the land of Oz.

316
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,894
Dorothy then befriends the Tin Man,
the Scarecrow, and the Lion.

317
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:06,132
During their adventure together,
the friends overcome their weaknesses,

318
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,433
discover new abilities,

319
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,669
and learn the meanings
of friendship and teamwork.

320
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,736
Right.

321
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,572
I remember the Lion being very timid.

322
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,107
Doesn't he turn out to be sweet?

323
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,044
The Tin Man is missing
his heart or something, right?

324
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,113
We prepared three games
based on the three characters

325
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,115
from The Wizard of Oz.

326
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,984
The Tin Man would love the first game

327
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,319
as he wishes to have a heart
and feel emotions.

328
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,589
It's called "Emotional Animal Quiz."

329
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,558
-"Emotional Animal Quiz"?
-That's a new one.

330
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,928
You'll be presented with a keyword
of an animal experiencing an emotion.

331
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,397
Use body language

332
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,401
to let your teammate know
the animal and the emotion.

333
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,270
"IS IT AN ANGRY SKUNK?"
YOU HAVE 100 SECONDS

334
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,005
Let's decide the order.

335
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,273
Who wants to kick it off?

336
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,041
The person at the end matters most, no?

337
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,376
-Woo-jae.
-I'll make the guesses.

338
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,344
-We need you there.
-Do that, Woo-jae.

339
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,846
-The first to go…
-You do it, Sae-ho.

340
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,147
-…should be Sook.
-Okay.

341
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,415
-I'll go after her.
-Good idea.

342
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,784
That's settled, and you correct
the course after Jin-kyung.

343
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,386
Dang, the course correction?

344
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,388
Okay, if Jin-kyung gets us off course…

345
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,057
Me after Jin-kyung?
I might not be able to correct our course.

346
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,125
What if I do that?

347
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,359
HER POSITION IS THE ISSUE

348
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,228
-Jin-kyung.
-Turn around.

349
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,296
She's staring at the keyword.

350
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,363
SHE TAKES THE FINAL SPOT

351
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,632
Copy the other person exactly,
down to their expression.

352
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,800
Okay. Let's speed things up.

353
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,635
Ready.

354
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,703
Set.

355
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,971
"EMOTIONAL ANIMAL QUIZ" BEGINS!

356
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,841
ANNOYED SCORPION

357
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,008
SCREAMS

358
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,611
Damn it. I can't believe it!

359
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,546
-Oh, I got it.
-What the heck?

360
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,614
I can't wait.

361
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,817
-Hey!
-Exactly.

362
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,787
ARE THEY GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION?

363
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,692
Hey, you!

364
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,128
Unbelievable. Hey!

365
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,330
-Is the answer an angry scorpion?
-Yeah!

366
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,631
It's pretty close.

367
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,666
Hey!

368
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,901
HMM

369
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,737
-Oh!
-She got it.

370
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,206
It's an excited crane.

371
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,642
-Why the crane?
-The crane, really?

372
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,877
-That's incorrect!
-Turn around!

373
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,944
IMPATIENT CRAB

374
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,013
-You interpreted it as excitement?
-An angry scorpion.

375
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,883
-What do I do?
-Hey, you should've given me a heads-up.

376
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,418
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

377
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,454
-Hurry!
-What?

378
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,522
Come on!

379
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,823
Quickly!

380
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,625
Hurry! I don't know what to do!

381
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,826
Let's get a move on!

382
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,894
Come on!

383
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,961
Hey, hurry up!

384
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,029
-Go on!
-A restless crab?

385
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,798
-Yeah, that's it.
-Okay.

386
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,865
Quick!

387
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,300
THE IMPATIENCE IS OBVIOUS

388
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,135
AND THE GESTURE
CAN ONLY MEAN ONE ANIMAL

389
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,370
We have no time to lose!

390
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,671
An impatient seagull.

391
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,406
-Goodness.
-Are you for real?

392
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,507
Why the seagull?

393
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,975
Doesn't this gesture scream a crab?

394
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,379
Wait a second.

395
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,680
BEWILDERED HORSE

396
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,215
Can we shuffle up the order now?

397
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,051
-Okay.
-What?

398
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
Right, got it.

399
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,529
Oh, man.

400
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,597
HUH?!

401
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,866
WHAT DO I DO?

402
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,367
WATCH ME NEIGH-HI-HEH

403
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,536
NIEGH-HI-HEH

404
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,605
WITH A LIBERAL DASH OF DRAMATICS

405
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,340
IS IT A CRAZY HORSE?

406
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,408
This is tricky.

407
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,642
Dang it. We're screwed.

408
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,911
Come on. We did fine.

409
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,447
TRUST ME, I GOT YOUR BACK

410
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,616
A LONG HORSEY FACE

411
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,352
I THINK I GET IT…

412
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,990
A horse in breeding season.

413
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,692
A horse in breeding season.

414
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,062
Incorrect.

415
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,130
TAKE A GUESS WITH THE CAST

416
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,198
What was the emotion?

417
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,333
This is pretty fun.

418
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,202
STRANGELY DISTASTEFUL

419
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,937
I think I got it!

420
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,005
-Hey.
-What?

421
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,682
THE ANSWER

422
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:48,087
IS AN EXCITED SNAKE

423
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,190
SNORTS

424
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,396
SLITHERING

425
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,531
SLITHERING

426
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,900
A lizard in mating season.

427
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,035
-Mating season again?
-That's incorrect.

428
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,703
Your time is up.

429
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,872
-Just a minute.
-Why the fixation on mating season?

430
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,973
-It was suggestive.
-Look.

431
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,575
You don't have to answer, Jin-kyung.

432
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,111
Woo-young and Woo-jae,
what did you think this meant?

433
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,646
-An angry scorpion.
-An ostrich.

434
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,781
Wait, an ostrich.
I thought it meant an ostrich.

435
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,882
-It's a scorpion!
-Obviously.

436
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,050
An angry one at that.

437
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,118
Sae-ho!

438
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,120
-This is how you mimic a scorpion.
-Like this.

439
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,421
-Oh, that's true.
-I suppose.

440
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,023
-This is an ostrich.
-Of course.

441
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,691
You should kick us off, Woo-jae.

442
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,526
-You're all hopeless.
-Hey.

443
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,795
-You're next, Jin-kyung.
-It'd be better for you in the middle.

444
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,864
You should stand next to Woo-jae.

445
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,465
Why don't you make the guesses, Sook?

446
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,800
-That's a good idea.
-Okay.

447
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,635
By the way,
the keywords are too difficult!

448
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,238
What do you suggest we do
with "bewildered horse"?

449
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,739
That's your responsibility, dude.

450
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,207
Why don't you give it a shot?

451
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,644
What's that supposed to be?

452
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,246
-What the heck?
-I look bewildered, no?

453
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,048
-All right.
-Good luck, Sae-ho.

454
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,416
-Okay.
-Ready.

455
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,917
Let's do this, Team Screwballs!

456
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:52,985
Set.

457
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,853
MELANCHOLY COW

458
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,622
-Good luck, Jin-kyung.
-You've got this.

459
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,957
Just copy what Woo-jae's doing.

460
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,158
We need an exact copy.

461
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,259
Do whatever he's doing.

462
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,829
FOCUS, I'M A MELANCHOLY COW

463
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,131
MR. TIN MAN TRIES TO CHANNEL MELANCHOLY

464
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,335
MOO

465
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,370
WITH MELANCHOLY

466
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,638
Moo.

467
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,406
HMM…

468
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
Moo.

469
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,511
Moo.

470
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,579
A SIGH-LAUGH

471
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,950
Moo.

472
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,486
THE TONGUE ACTION
NOW HAS THE CENTRAL POSITION

473
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,022
Do it. Come on.

474
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,090
Let's see it.

475
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,295
Moo.

476
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,563
Gosh, I'd say…

477
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,098
-Are you sad?
-Moo.

478
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,599
-I guess that's sadness.
-Moo!

479
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,301
It sounds so creepy.

480
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,838
MOO!

481
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,574
WHAT THE HECK

482
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,778
MOO… DY?

483
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,946
Take a guess, quick.

484
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,647
WAUGH, WAUGH

485
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,516
-Take a guess, quick.
-That gives me too many options.

486
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,551
A sad cow.

487
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,754
-That's incorrect.
-It's pretty close, come on!

488
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,055
Seriously, it was close enough.

489
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,623
What was the answer?

490
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,858
What on earth?

491
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,695
Please, Jin-kyung.

492
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,063
Jin-kyung?

493
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
Please…

494
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,267
TAKE A GUESS WITH THE CAST

495
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,102
Why is it so quiet?

496
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,637
WHAT THE…

497
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,341
Why the silence?

498
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,779
THERE'S AN ANIMAL
THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS?

499
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,314
But what about the emotion? What is it?

500
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,784
SCUTTLING AWAY

501
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,419
What about the emotion?

502
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,087
I don't like the vibe I'm getting.

503
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,155
Show it to me.

504
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,658
He's gone insane.

505
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
He has, hasn't he?

506
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,797
-What?
-This is what he did.

507
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,864
This?

508
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,967
And what's the animal?

509
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,836
I HAVE NO IDEA

510
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,204
-Oh, I got it.
-What is it?

511
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,339
An ostrich in mating season.

512
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,141
You got the animal, at least.

513
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,209
It's still incorrect.

514
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,277
What on earth?

515
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,511
Let's begin again.

516
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,146
What was this for? Why cover the crotch?

517
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,981
Let me explain.

518
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,049
Why cover this area?

519
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,684
I couldn't find other ways to express it.

520
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,920
-What was the keyword?
-Embarrassed ostrich.

521
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,822
-Embarrassed?
-You could've shielded your face.

522
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,424
Yeah, an embarrassed person
covers up their face.

523
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,226
-Like this.
-If you cover up the crotch…

524
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,727
What are we to make of that?

525
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,796
I'm unleashing my power now.

526
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,298
-Go ahead.
-I took my wig off.

527
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,500
You can take my place, Woo-jae.

528
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,568
Yeah, go ahead.

529
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,036
Where do we place Jin-kyung, though?

530
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,705
Can we play the game without her?

531
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,441
Hold on.
Don't you need your stylist, Woo-jae?

532
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,509
You're good.

533
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,910
I'm a total macho, so I'm good.

534
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
What was that?

535
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,714
-A total macho.
-A tricky match?

536
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,117
A man with a totally disgusting manner.

537
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,918
A MAN WITH A
TOTALLY DISGUSTING MANNER

538
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:40,986
I'm the real tough guy.

539
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,088
-Ready.
-Let's go, guys!

540
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,590
-All right.
-We've got this.

541
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,992
??? CHICKEN

542
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,894
This is just… Oh, man.

543
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,968
THRUST, THRUST

544
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,272
CHOO-CHOO

545
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,340
CHOO-CHOO?

546
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,407
OKAY FOR NOW

547
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,475
Are you ready?

548
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,747
That's it?

549
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,021
WHAT EMOTION DOES THAT CONVEY?

550
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,723
-Take a guess.
-I wonder what that is.

551
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,458
-It's a tough one.
-I guess…

552
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,426
A chicken selling skewers?

553
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,961
Is it a choosy chicken?

554
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,062
IT'S A SHADY CHICKEN

555
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,864
Isn't my answer close?

556
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,099
Okay, let's roll.

557
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,267
SENTIMENTAL PIG

558
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,603
VERY REALISTIC OINKING

559
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,073
WITH A LITTLE SPLASH OF SENTIMENTALITY

560
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,876
-Oh, okay.
-All right.

561
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,545
GRUNT, GRUNT

562
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,784
Add sentimentality.

563
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,852
Make it sentimental.

564
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,020
Woo-young, add a longing look.

565
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,087
I can't believe this.

566
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,892
TIME TO USE HIS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
AS AN IDOL

567
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,127
What is he looking at?

568
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,361
I got the idea.

569
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,429
DOES HE HAVE RHINITIS?

570
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,734
You sound like you're coughing up phlegm.

571
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,169
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

572
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,609
That's it. There you go.

573
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,645
Sentimental…

574
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,147
Noh Joo-hyun, no. A sentimental pig.

575
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,582
-Okay.
-That is correct!

576
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,717
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT KEYWORD
WITHOUT HESITATION

577
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,120
INDIGNANT ORANGUTAN

578
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,457
ME? YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

579
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,925
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG

580
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,461
OKAY, I GOT IT

581
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,031
PLEASE BELIEVE ME,
IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING!

582
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,842
I don't get it.

583
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,043
I honestly don't.

584
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,914
-An indignant monkey.
-My gosh.

585
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,616
-You have to allow it.
-An indignant chimpanzee?

586
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,750
It's close enough to orangutan.

587
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,851
An indignant orangutan!

588
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,919
Okay. That's correct.

589
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,321
Your time is up.

590
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,658
-He told the others the sentimental pig.
-Wait.

591
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,993
-Who did?
-Director Park.

592
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,562
-What was that?
-Did you say the keyword

593
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,763
"sentimental pig" out loud?

594
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,064
Of course not.

595
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,768
What? Wait, I couldn't hear clearly.

596
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,104
Did Sae-ho tell you "sentimental pig"
during the game?

597
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,905
No way. Why would I do that?

598
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm not a nutjob.

599
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,175
-Add sentimentality.
-Why would I?

600
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,111
-He didn't tell me.
-Your track record wouldn't agree.

601
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,245
-No way.
-Who says so?

602
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,580
You saw me say it? I see.

603
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,714
-Who saw him do it?
-Well…

604
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,383
I was denying everything, dude.

605
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,487
THE TRICKSTER DUO
HAS A COORDINATION ISSUE

606
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:33,058
Including the one you got by cheating,
you had two correct answers.

607
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,760
-Unfortunately--
-Rather than cheating,

608
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,228
let's call it a cutesy trick.

609
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,164
-I didn't think Sae-ho would…
-Why did you cheat, though?

610
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,333
You failed the challenge
of Emotional Animal Quiz.

611
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,270
We have two other games

612
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,139
as well as great dishes lined up.

613
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,473
-Don't lose spirit just yet.
-Okay.

614
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,541
Let's get going.

615
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,842
-Okay.
-Let's go.

616
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,813
WILL THEY BE ABLE
TO WIN THE NEXT GAME?

617
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,848
The inspiration behind the second game

618
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,984
is the brainless Scarecrow.

619
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,052
The brainless Scarecrow?

620
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,388
They must've prepared something difficult
considering this talk about the brain.

621
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,456
I'll give you the rundown.

622
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,824
It'd be perfect for the Scarecrow

623
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,393
who craved wisdom
to make up for the lack of a brain.

624
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,996
This is "Five-Level Math Quiz."

625
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,298
MATH, YOU SAY?

626
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,833
SHIVERING

627
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,501
A DEEP SIGH

628
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,203
I gave up on math long ago.

629
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,305
You're testing our math skills?

630
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,474
-Woo-young's no good either.
-Totally.

631
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,110
He recently asked for a reservation
at one of my favorite haunts.

632
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,213
So I asked about the size of his company.
He said, "Two stylists, two managers,

633
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,381
and four artists."

634
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,116
"In total, that's 15 people."

635
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,184
Need I say more?

636
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,186
Can you believe he threw me
under the bus to get a laugh?

637
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,454
You can't even do simple sums?

638
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,888
WOO-YOUNG HAS A FACE
TO KEEP AS AN IDOL

639
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:37,956
BUT IT WAS FUNNY

640
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,057
"So how many in total?"

641
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,726
"Wait, um… Fifteen!"

642
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,828
WHAT'S WITH HIM?
CRACKING UP

643
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,063
-It's funny.
-Here's the answer. A stuttering pig.

644
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,399
-Oh, that is correct.
-All right.

645
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,402
This will be another group game.

646
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,204
Ranging from Level One to Level Five,

647
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,941
five math quizzes of varying difficulty
will be presented to you.

648
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,043
-Okay.
-Level One is the easiest,

649
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,846
-while Level Five is the hardest.
-Okay.

650
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,981
Please solve all five quizzes

651
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,918
-within the three-minute time limit.
-It's 276,000 won.

652
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,421
Can my neighbor help out
if I fail to solve the quiz?

653
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,956
If you're stuck…

654
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,991
-Can I take a pass?
-…you can leave it to the next person.

655
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,793
-Okay.
-Then, it becomes their responsibility.

656
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,129
-We have Woo-jae anyway.
-Woo-jae can handle whatever.

657
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,663
Toss me all your questions.

658
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,731
THEIR TRUSTED CRUTCH

659
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,299
Toss me all your questions.

660
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,634
SPEAKING OF WOO-JAE…

661
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,471
HE'S A GIFTED MATHEMATICIAN

662
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,807
EVERY FIBER OF HIS BEING SCREAMS
THE NATURAL SCIENCE TRACK

663
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,676
SOLVING A TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTION
WITH MENTAL MATH

664
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,811
How is it 400?

665
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,046
MR. HOT BRAINIAC OF SCREWBALLS

666
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,116
I do feel shy admitting to this,

667
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,786
I tend to act dumb on shows
to make things more fun,

668
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,554
pretending like I can't solve questions.

669
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,922
I'll crack the Level Four quiz

670
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,158
and leave you the glorious Level Five one.
Isn't that neat?

671
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,225
You can take Level Five.

672
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,293
That won't be as fun.

673
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,395
-If I solve Level Five--
-We'll laugh for you.

674
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,596
Forget it. It won't be fun.

675
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,198
Show the world how smart you are.

676
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,733
There's no need, though. I'm good, Sook.

677
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,002
I don't know how good you are,

678
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,870
-but I did work on math too.
-Right.

679
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,940
So, y equals 2x plus 6.

680
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,742
STARTING FROM LINEAR FUNCTIONS

681
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,610
Great job. We're done
with the linear functions.

682
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,645
ALREADY?

683
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,413
If y equals -2x²,

684
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,949
the graph with the same shape
will be placed down here.

685
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,217
MASTERED THE QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS

686
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,452
That's the basics, right?

687
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,021
You got the inscribed angle right
and all others too.

688
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,222
PERFECT SCORE ON MIDDLE-SCHOOL GED

689
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,458
REAL STUDY KING, JIN-KYUNG

690
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,792
Do you want to handle Level Five?

691
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,661
Oh, no. I'll take Level Four.

692
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,596
For your information, Level Five quizzes

693
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,765
were written by Mr. Chung Seung-je,
the famous instructor.

694
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,367
You can take Level Five, then.
I'm not acquainted with Mr. Chung.

695
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,236
How is that relevant?

696
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,038
Does your math ability
depend on friendship?

697
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,406
Let's just give it a go.

698
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,774
-You'll take Level Five.
-No can do.

699
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,676
-Just this once.
-Sook, that'd be too difficult.

700
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:38,944
-Please spare me.
-Take Level Five.

701
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,113
We can show you what the dish is.
Why don't you reconsider after that?

702
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,348
-Yeah!
-Please bring it in.

703
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,552
THIS TIME, IT'S THIS GORGEOUS
BRAISED SPICY CHICKEN

704
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,720
Can we have some shaved ice?

705
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,855
THE DIRECTOR CRACKS UP

706
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,591
-We'll throw that in if you win the game.
-Okay!

707
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,728
Can you tell us the school level
equivalent to the Level Five quizzes?

708
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,963
Please explain it to Woo-jae.

709
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,397
Frankly, Level Five ones are difficult.

710
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,066
-Hear that, Woo-jae?
-He should handle them.

711
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,634
I'll take Level Three questions.

712
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,702
Let's rearrange the seats.

713
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,804
From Woo-jae's current seat
to Woo-young's current seat,

714
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,739
the difficulty of the quizzes
will increase.

715
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,207
BUT
ONE DISPUTE HASN'T BEEN SETTLED

716
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,275
Come on, Sook!

717
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,377
You did better than I.

718
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,745
What do you mean? I was…

719
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,046
Decide by Rock-Paper-Scissors.

720
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,816
-Back in my time, kids didn't learn math.
-I didn't even attend school.

721
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,984
I didn't attend any, okay?

722
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,686
You snooze, you get Level Two.
Rock, paper, scissors.

723
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,089
WOO-YOUNG WINS

724
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,690
ALL RIGHT!

725
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,726
I had the military drill
in my curriculum, okay?

726
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,961
I don't even know what that is, Sook.

727
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,096
AT ANY RATE, IT'S ALL SETTLED

728
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,697
Honestly, I'm no good at all.

729
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,566
Pretty please…

730
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,067
Division takes precedence, right?

731
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,137
They'll probably give you
a simple multiplication.

732
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,605
IF YOU SAY SO…

733
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,873
Let's do this.

734
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,175
-Toss it over if you feel unsure.
-Okay.

735
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,244
What if I end up
saddled with all five quizzes?

736
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,412
-That could happen.
-Ready.

737
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,613
IT WEIGHS DIFFERENTLY ON EVERYONE

738
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,848
-Set.
-Work hard.

739
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:50,916
THEY ONLY HAVE 3 MINUTES

740
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,651
Go. Here's Level One.

741
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,453
-Eighteen.
-That's correct.

742
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,088
BREEZING THROUGH

743
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,524
-Here's Level Two.
-You had to push it that far?

744
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,426
What is that?

745
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,794
I'm taking a pass.

746
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,096
-What is that? I'm taking a pass.
-Really?

747
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,665
-Really?
-Yeah.

748
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,999
The answer is five.

749
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,501
-That's incorrect.
-Fifteen, then.

750
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,936
That's incorrect.

751
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,537
Solve it properly.

752
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,439
What's that anyway?
I've never seen anything like it.

753
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,274
-Why is one-third down there?
-What's that about?

754
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,909
-Forty-five.
-That is correct.

755
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,945
What does that mean?

756
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,079
A FRACTION OVER A FRACTION?

757
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,380
LEVEL 3 QUIZ

758
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,015
I have to figure out the x, correct?

759
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,084
HURRIEDLY STARTS TAKING A MEMO

760
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,590
HIS GAZE STARTS TO WANDER

761
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,657
Well…

762
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,759
Just a second. So that's ten.

763
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:35,894
Take a pass.

764
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,495
You can solve it with mental math, no?

765
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,130
TEARS

766
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,433
LEVEL 3 QUIZ
IS PASSED ON TO JIN-KYUNG

767
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,002
I RECEIVED THE PERFECT SCORE
IN THE MIDDLE-SCHOOL GED

768
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,238
SOLVES THE QUIZ WITHOUT HESITATION

769
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,474
Two and five.

770
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,642
That is correct.

771
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,710
My gosh.

772
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,311
One, two, three…

773
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,279
LEVEL 4 QUIZ

774
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,081
FIND THE NUMBER OF SHORTEST
PATHS BETWEEN A AND B

775
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,916
WHAT IS THAT?

776
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,920
A SUDDEN SPIKE IN THE DIFFICULTY

777
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,955
One, two, three. One, two, three…

778
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,423
Twelve.

779
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,058
-That's incorrect.
-I'll take a pass.

780
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,126
CRACKS UP

781
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,229
She gave up much quicker than I expected.

782
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,964
We're passing questions around.

783
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,067
THE LEVEL 4 QUIZ IS
NOW IN WOO-JAE'S HAND

784
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,269
FIND THE NUMBER OF SHORTEST
PATHS BETWEEN A AND B

785
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,437
"Shortest paths"?

786
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,277
-Ten.
-That's correct.

787
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,646
SO COOL

788
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,248
ANY SHORTEST PATHS
INCLUDE 3 STEPS TO THE RIGHT

789
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
AND 2 STEPS UP

790
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:35,053
AS SUCH, THE ANSWER IS 10,
FROM 5! DIVIDED BY 3! AND 2!

791
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,287
THEY'VE MADE IT PAST LEVEL 4

792
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,622
So, give us the last one.

793
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,460
FIND CONDITIONS THAT MAKE
A SQUARE ROOT A NATURAL NUMBER

794
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,528
We're all set.

795
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,597
Stay tuned for the Joo Woo-jae Show.

796
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,565
N IS A NATURAL NUMBER
THAT MAKES 108/N A NATURAL NUMBER…

797
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,335
I have to sum up all natural numbers
that meet the criterion?

798
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,872
HE STARTS SOLVING THE QUIZ RIGHT AWAY

799
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,040
What are natural numbers?

800
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,075
-Numbers out in the wild?
-Yeah.

801
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,110
Oh, are they the numbers
that only have two divisors?

802
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,645
-Yeah.
-Like seven, for example.

803
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,080
We only need to keep dividing the number.

804
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,148
THOSE ARE PRIME NUMBERS

805
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,017
DESPITE THE INTERRUPTIONS
FROM THE MATH IDIOTS

806
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,420
WOO-JAE KEEPS WORKING ON THE QUIZ

807
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,888
Sum of the natural numbers, right?

808
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,222
-I have the answer.
-Let's hear it.

809
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,290
It's 138.

810
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,825
That is incorrect.

811
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,561
Really? Just a second.
Oh, right. There's more.

812
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:20,632
HE PUTS HIS THINKING CAP
ON ONCE MORE

813
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,501
THIS IS DIFFICULT

814
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,604
EVEN WOO-JAE SEEMS UNSURE

815
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,606
-Is it 150?
-That is correct.

816
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,974
-The answer's 150?
-Yes.

817
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,643
SOLUTION TO THE QUIZ
THAT EVEN TROUBLED WOO-JAE

818
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,712
108/N MUST BE A SQUARED NUMBER
TO MAKE 108/N A NATURAL NUMBER

819
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,647
FOR 2²×3³/N TO BE A SQUARED NUMBER

820
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,083
N MUST BE 3, 12, 27, OR 108
THE SUM OF POSSIBLE NS IS 150

821
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,586
WOO-JAE INITIALLY ANSWERED 138
BECAUSE HE HAD MISSED 12

822
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,621
AT ANY RATE,
THEY TIMED OUT AND FAILED

823
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,457
DISAPPOINTED

824
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,460
I missed 12
because I got the division wrong.

825
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,328
It's such a shame.

826
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,597
Normally, Woo-jae
could solve it in his sleep.

827
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,599
Not exactly. I need some time too.

828
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,534
Let us try one more time.

829
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,802
-Would you like another round?
-Yes.

830
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:58,903
-One more, then.
-Okay.

831
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,172
It seems an apology is in order.

832
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,240
I underestimated you

833
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,975
and narrowed down my scope of thinking.

834
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,711
At any rate, I got it now.

835
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,080
Will we continue to get math quizzes?

836
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,416
In that case, I'm taking off for the day.

837
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,484
SIT BACK DOWN

838
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,585
Let's have another run.

839
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,286
-Here's an extra set for you.
-All right.

840
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,122
Give us this extra set of five quizzes,

841
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,124
-and we'll make history.
-Let's do that.

842
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,325
…and we'll make history.

843
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,127
-Okay.
-Let's do that.

844
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,928
All right. I somehow feel like we can win.

845
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,231
-Here goes.
-What if they made things more difficult?

846
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,233
-Ready.
-Please don't make me…

847
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,701
-Set.
-…solve a quadratic equation.

848
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,769
Go.

849
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,771
SO IT BEGINS

850
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,241
A SETBACK FROM THE START

851
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,909
-What's that supposed to be?
-Take a pass.

852
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,111
Why is there
an exclamation mark next to four?

853
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,546
What the heck is that?

854
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,682
FACTORIAL

855
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,418
What's that supposed to be?
I've never seen anything like it.

856
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,053
-Hurry.
-I'm taking a pass.

857
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,121
Me too.

858
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,723
-Sixteen.
-That's incorrect.

859
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,091
-What?
-For the mystery number.

860
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,726
That's for Level One?

861
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,161
-Just take the pass.
-Is it four?

862
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,228
-Take the pass.
-Four.

863
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,663
-And we did.
-It's 24.

864
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,731
That is correct.

865
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,866
-I don't get it.
-Why? And how is that for Level One?

866
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:02,934
THANK GOODNESS FOR WOO-JAE

867
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,068
ANYWAY…

868
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,070
Woo-jae has to
solve all the remaining questions.

869
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,706
WOO-JAE PROMISED TO WRITE HISTORY

870
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,511
BUT THE MULTIPLE PASSES
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WHAT HE HAD IN MIND

871
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,046
WOO-JAE MAY BE BRIGHT

872
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,448
BUT COULD HE SOLVE ALL 5 QUIZZES
WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT?

873
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,550
LET'S TACKLE LEVEL 2 FIRST

874
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,685
-One.
-That is correct.

875
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,953
X MINUS Y IS 2,
AND X² PLUS Y² IS 34

876
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,621
IF X AND Y ARE NATURAL NUMBERS,
WHAT IS X PLUS Y?

877
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,590
WOO-JAE'S MIND

878
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,791
Three and five.

879
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,793
-Eight.
-That's correct.

880
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,461
YOU'RE AMAZING, WOO-JAE

881
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,663
REACHED LEVEL 4 IN NO TIME

882
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,833
A total of eight teams
in an all-play-all tournament?

883
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,669
Why go through the hassle
instead of a regular tournament?

884
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,971
HEH-HEH

885
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,840
Could "Yangju" be a hint?

886
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,208
Not at all.

887
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,411
HOW MANY TOTAL GAMES IF 8 SOCCER TEAMS
PLAY A MATCH AGAINST EVERY OTHER TEAM?

888
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,745
I have the answer.

889
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:48,847
It's 28.

890
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:49,914
That is correct.

891
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,284
THE FOLLOWING COMBINATION CALCULATES
THE SELECTION OF 2 TEAMS OUT OF 8

892
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,587
AS SUCH, THE ANSWER IS 28 GAMES

893
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,223
WHEN SOLVING THE QUIZ WITHOUT THE FORMULA

894
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,526
LEAVE OUT GAMES ALREADY COUNTED

895
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,128
All right. So, how did we do?
Do you have more quizzes?

896
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,064
That's the quiz in Woo-jae's chosen level.

897
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,399
ALSO WRITTEN
BY THE FAMOUS MR. CHUNG SEUNG-JE

898
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,934
Dang it.

899
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,936
They're determined
not to feed us, all right.

900
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,504
-May I?
-You want this?

901
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,672
WHAT COULD IT BE ABOUT?

902
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,609
THERE ARE THREE COORDINATES:
A(0,A), B(2,0), AND C(4,6)

903
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,578
FIND THE CONSTANT "A" THAT MINIMIZES
THE SUM OF THE LENGTHS OF AB AND AC

904
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,182
HYPER-FOCUSED

905
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,652
WILL HE BE ABLE TO
SOLVE THE FINAL QUIZ TOO?

906
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,555
THE TIMER HAS HIT THE 2-MINUTE MARK

907
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,258
THE CONSTANT THAT MINIMIZES
THE SUM… THE THREE COORDINATES…

908
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,229
Huh? I have the answer.

909
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,497
-Huh? I have the answer.
-Yes?

910
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,865
Let me just put it out there.

911
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:41,933
Two.

912
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,835
That is correct.

913
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,138
-That is correct.
-It's a success.

914
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,206
WOO-JAE DID IT

915
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,607
ONLY 17 SECONDS REMAINED

916
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,042
Okay, give us lunch.

917
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,011
WOO-JAE PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE

918
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,013
-Gosh, I'm surprised we made it.
-Seriously.

919
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,447
How did you crack it anyway?

920
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,715
-Tell us.
-I'll explain it to you.

921
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,783
Okay!

922
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,885
The sum has to be minimized, right?

923
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,287
None of the other stuff mattered.

924
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,922
-The minimum.
-Forget them.

925
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,724
We're adding the lengths
of these two lines.

926
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,092
If the sum is to be minimized…

927
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,527
We'll move this… Look closely.

928
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,398
Let's mark a dot in a spot that'd create
a perfect symmetry about the y-axis.

929
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,200
Connect it to Point A,
and it'd look like this, right?

930
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,370
THE LENGTHS OF THE YELLOW LINE
AND THE GREEN LINE ARE THE SAME

931
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,906
For the entire length
of this green line to be minimized…

932
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,175
-It should be two.
-…the green line should be straight.

933
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,411
-What?
-Excuse me?

934
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,578
So, it's two, right?

935
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,780
So what?

936
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,316
It's too hot. Make it brief.

937
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,018
Only when these two lines
form one straight line together,

938
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,254
-their sum is minimized, right?
-Sure.

939
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,190
Try minimizing Jin-kyung's distress first.
She's getting heat exhaustion.

940
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,425
Remember the symmetry about the y-axis.

941
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,993
Forget about A.

942
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,829
The heat's getting to Jin-kyung.
Think about helping her first.

943
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,698
All right, smarty-pants.

944
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,132
-Good for you, dude.
-Yeah.

945
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,301
-We need the y-intercept.
-White patterned rice cake?

946
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,003
With the y-intercept…

947
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,072
Patterned rice cake is really…

948
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,239
-It tastes amazing.
-Totally.

949
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,342
-It's a must.
-The chewy texture makes it my favorite.

950
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,810
I recommend dipping it in honey

951
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,778
-before taking a bite.
-I love it.

952
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,846
SINCE NO ONE IS INTERESTED

953
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,514
WE'LL ADD THE EXPLANATION OURSELVES

954
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:09,454
SET A C' THAT WILL MAKE THE LENGTH
OF AB+AC THE SAME AS THAT OF AB+AC'

955
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,155
STRAIGHT LINE BC' MINIMIZES THE LENGTH

956
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,524
THE SLOPE "M" OF BC' IS -1,
AND ITS FORMULA IS: Y=-X+2

957
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,960
SINCE A(0,A) IS ON THE LINE
A=-0+2

958
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,363
AS SUCH, THE ANSWER IS 2

959
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,232
At any rate, the y-intercept
under the situation is two.

960
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,900
To be exact, the coordinate is (0,2).

961
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,335
Let's give him a hand.

962
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,436
-That's two.
-How cool is that?

963
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,171
Joo Woo-jae!

964
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,940
A BELATED CHEER
FOR THE SMARTY-PANTS

965
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,876
Now, let's move to the next site
for the final game.

966
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,678
ONE DISH SECURED SO FAR

967
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,812
Gosh, the spicy braised chicken.

968
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,848
-What do we do next?
-What?

969
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,316
-What's our next task?
-Keep doing your thing.

970
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,384
-Got it.
-Okay.

971
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,786
The final game of our special triathlon
based on The Wizard of Oz

972
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,254
-reflects Dorothy's journey.
-I see.

973
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,422
Remind me who she is.

974
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,024
She's the central figure.

975
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,091
The Wizard of Oz

976
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,361
opens with Dorothy
finding herself in the land of Oz.

977
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,997
I have told you this earlier,
but she only lands there

978
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,100
because she gets swept up
in a very powerful tornado.

979
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,403
That's how we came up
with "Beat the Tornado."

980
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,804
We'll be facing strong winds, then.

981
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,774
STAND-IN FOR THE TORNADO

982
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,209
Sure, you found a seemingly fine pretext.

983
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,345
But this is a pure dumpster fire.

984
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,313
The machine here

985
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,449
makes you look your worst.

986
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,517
-Really?
-You bet.

987
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,453
We prepared the fan
to battle the hot weather.

988
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,821
Okay, we could use some wind.

989
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,457
-Try to be optimistic, okay?
-Why are you so pessimistic today?

990
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,691
-Because--
-We're on a variety show.

991
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,393
Get your energy level up, will you?

992
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,896
As I said, we're on a variety show.

993
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:25,963
AREN'T WE ALL PROFESSIONALS?

994
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,465
Way to let us know she's feeling better.

995
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,000
Make sure to use the footage from earlier.

996
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,769
I thought I'd get excluded
from today's shoot.

997
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:32,837
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

998
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,905
SHE WAS LISTLESS TWO HOURS AGO

999
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,407
As I said, we're on a variety show.

1000
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,875
THE 33-YEAR VETERAN RECOVERED QUICKLY

1001
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,277
What do you think you're doing?

1002
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,578
Make some effort, will you?

1003
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,047
You just knocked and opened up the door.

1004
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,949
-You think your feelings matter so much?
-Understood?

1005
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,984
-Are we clear?
-No, not at all.

1006
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,219
-I'm sorry.
-No?

1007
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,587
-My bad.
-What?

1008
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,189
-Was that a challenge or not?
-I apologize.

1009
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,457
It wasn't. I'm sorry.

1010
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,058
She sounds so desperate.

1011
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,227
-So that wasn't a challenge?
-No, it wasn't.

1012
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,495
A PROFESSIONAL KNOWS WHEN TO GROVEL

1013
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,097
The message of The Wizard of Oz

1014
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:02,133
is that friends can help you
overcome any difficulties.

1015
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,068
-In this spirit, you'll play a group game.
-All right!

1016
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,270
You'll each take a turn
to wear a parachute.

1017
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,306
Once you've worn the parachute,

1018
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,874
wait at the starting line.

1019
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,344
When we give the signal,
charge toward the high-powered fan

1020
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,780
and take a bite from the Onion Ring chips
tied to the fan by a thread.

1021
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,282
All five of you

1022
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,885
will be given one minute
to complete the challenge.

1023
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,421
-Do all of us have to succeed?
-Of course.

1024
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,590
-Do your lymph nodes bother you?
-No, not at all.

1025
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,492
I can handle the activity now.

1026
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,026
Must all five of us succeed to win?

1027
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,662
-Could you finish all five chips alone?
-You bet I could.

1028
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,731
Does that mean one person
can do more than their due?

1029
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,801
We can win
if the first person eats all five chips.

1030
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,237
I've had enough experience
with this game, you see.

1031
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,671
You could say I'm a strong contender.

1032
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,106
My lymph nodes have improved too.

1033
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,341
I can eat all five chips.

1034
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,809
-You can go last, then.
-All right.

1035
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,178
I'll now show the dish you can win.
Please bring it in.

1036
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,747
I want something tasty.
I like our chances with this game.

1037
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,215
In fact, I'm sure we'll win.

1038
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,850
What's that? Pizza?

1039
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,185
It's flat. Maybe it's pancakes.

1040
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,353
I was right.

1041
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,454
Pancakes and acorn jelly.

1042
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,322
-Gosh, they look so good.
-We've got to have them.

1043
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,625
Look, a potato pancake. It's my favorite.

1044
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,792
My gosh.

1045
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,061
I want a pair of gloves
so I can eat them with my hands.

1046
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,364
-Can we sample it?
-Let me take a whiff.

1047
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,300
It smells amazing. My gosh.

1048
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,568
Gosh, let's do this!

1049
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,037
JUST A WHIFF, AND THEY'RE MOTIVATED

1050
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,972
Let's go. We've got this.

1051
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,707
Shall we decide on the order, then?

1052
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,009
First, Peter Pan.

1053
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,310
Make sure to eat two chips.

1054
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,212
-Next up is you, madam.
-Me?

1055
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,514
Then, Woo-jae, the Guardian Deity,

1056
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,715
and I.

1057
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,884
-I'll polish off all the leftovers.
-Good.

1058
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,452
Please come and collect the parachutes.

1059
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,887
They're on the larger side.

1060
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,123
They're not like the ones
I'm familiar with.

1061
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,424
Wear it like a backpack.

1062
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,692
DID HE STAY IN THE LAMP TOO LONG?

1063
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,160
Here. Try it on.

1064
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,297
-It's best to tighten the straps.
-You ran simulations, didn't you?

1065
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,665
-Of course.
-Okay.

1066
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,403
ABOUT 80% OF OUR MEETINGS
ARE SPENT ON RUNNING SIMULATIONS

1067
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,072
CREW MEMBERS OF ALL GENDERS AND
AGES PARTICIPATE IN THEM TOO

1068
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,209
I'm just concerned
I might end up in Yeouido.

1069
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,977
If you do succeed at getting there,

1070
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,613
they should study this
as a new means of transportation.

1071
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,682
-They totally should.
-Like the Hangang River Water Taxis.

1072
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,749
SERIOUS BUT USELESS CHAT

1073
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,986
Sook, you won't be taking
your turn right away.

1074
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,922
Could any of you hold her parachute
like the train of a wedding gown?

1075
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:05,990
-Oh, I could…
-Ms. Bride.

1076
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,625
-Yes?
-Ms. Bride.

1077
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,693
Wait, are you the groom?

1078
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,761
SOLID AS A WALL

1079
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,963
Are you the mother of the bride?

1080
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,030
Oh, sure.

1081
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,532
Wait, no. I'm the bride.

1082
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,633
You're her mother, right?

1083
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,701
I'm the bride.

1084
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,203
-Aren't you my groom?
-No, I'm not.

1085
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,871
I'm the host today.

1086
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,306
-Are you sure?
-I am.

1087
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,342
But I was sure you were my groom.

1088
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,977
Gosh, we'd be in so much trouble then.

1089
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,044
THE GAME BEGINS

1090
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,179
Good luck!

1091
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,414
I'm pretty hungry, you see.

1092
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,817
If it ends quicker than you thought,
please understand.

1093
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,118
Wrap it up for us, Woo-young.

1094
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,521
All right. I'll do what I can.

1095
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,257
Ready.

1096
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,192
Set.

1097
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,094
BOTH PETER PAN
AND THE FAN ARE READY

1098
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,161
Set.

1099
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,796
HANG IN THERE, ONION RING CHIPS

1100
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,565
You can do this.

1101
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,533
GO

1102
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,605
You can let go now, Sae-ho!

1103
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,673
I DID THAT LONG AGO

1104
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,907
-Let go, Sae-ho!
-Are you for real?

1105
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,309
-Go!
-Get moving already.

1106
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,644
Make your way.

1107
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,812
Did you let go?

1108
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,814
WHY CAN'T I MOVE FORWARD?

1109
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,983
Stop messing around, okay?

1110
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,386
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE'S MESSING AROUND

1111
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,087
I'm so hungry!

1112
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,224
He's messing around, isn't he?

1113
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,326
It does look that way.

1114
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,531
DETERMINING HE'S FAKING IT

1115
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,967
You'd think he's in a war film.

1116
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,602
-Stop fooling around!
-What's with you?

1117
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,936
IS THE WIND TOO STRONG?

1118
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,171
ADJUSTS THE WIND LEVEL

1119
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,506
This is your shot!

1120
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,740
IT IS INDEED YOUR CHANCE

1121
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,875
-Take it!
-Dang it!

1122
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,978
I REFUSE TO BE SHIPPED OFF
TO NEVER LAND WITHOUT A FIGHT

1123
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,681
WHAT SHOULD WE DO
WITH THAT HOPELESS KID?

1124
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,616
I'M ALMOST THERE!

1125
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,117
NO, YOU'RE NOT

1126
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,419
FORGET IT, GET BACK THERE

1127
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,054
HIS HAT IS SWEPT OFF

1128
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,955
A RATHER WRETCHED SIGHT

1129
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,223
What's the matter with him?

1130
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,625
OKAY, I'LL DIAL IT BACK DOWN

1131
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,061
Seriously, what are you doing?
It isn't funny at all.

1132
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,096
-This is it!
-Move in!

1133
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,764
THE PARACHUTE
ISN'T PULLING HIM BACK

1134
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,735
THE WORLD OUTSIDE NEVERLAND
IS HARSH ENOUGH TO CAUSE DRAMATIC AGING

1135
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,303
OPENS WIDE

1136
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,139
WILL HE SUCCEED AT LAST?

1137
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,774
WHISTLE

1138
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,843
Wait, he did it. He ate a chip.

1139
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,713
UNFORTUNATELY, PETER PAN TIMED OUT

1140
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,214
My answer is Onion Ring.

1141
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,750
Don't mess around, Woo-young.

1142
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,019
Seriously, you were awful.

1143
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,855
Your stunt ate up the time.

1144
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,490
Why, you little…

1145
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,425
I'll be watching you lot.

1146
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,693
Sure, we'll see.

1147
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,730
What was he thinking?

1148
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,765
-What's your problem?
-Dang it.

1149
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,833
MUSCLE LADY ON HER WAY

1150
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,134
Our chances look super bleak.

1151
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,435
Damn it.

1152
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,503
I SHOULD'VE KICKED US OFF

1153
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,973
READY TO TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE

1154
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,708
Huh?

1155
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,944
I recognize that warrior
from the movie 300.

1156
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,013
I don't get why Woo-young
struggled so much.

1157
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,081
PROUD AND STRONG

1158
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,750
I bet she's from a line of strong folks.

1159
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,252
I can't believe
how weak the youngsters are.

1160
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,755
ENERGY AND DRIVE COURSE THROUGH HER BODY

1161
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:51,822
Let's go.

1162
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,125
Was the wind that strong?
Did it overpower you that badly?

1163
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,193
Remember how my feet
slid backwards like this?

1164
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,261
Ready.

1165
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,496
Watch and learn from Sook.

1166
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,832
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE CAN CAUSE TORNADOES

1167
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,967
-You can do this!
-Do it!

1168
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,535
-Wait for me, babe.
-Sure thing!

1169
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,370
ON APRIL 8, 2025 DURING
THE WOMEN'S LIPSTICK GAME…

1170
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,805
You don't stand a chance.

1171
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,141
-Oh, man!
-What on earth?

1172
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,942
AGAINST EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS

1173
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,445
THIS LADY GOT AHEAD OF
THE FRONT-RUNNER

1174
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,215
A NATURAL BORN ATHLETE
KIM SOOK

1175
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:19,850
My muscles grow on their own.

1176
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,918
STILL GROWING EVEN NOW

1177
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,787
To tell you the truth, these sleeves…

1178
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:23,854
aren't puffed by design.

1179
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,922
HER ARMS ARE THAT JACKED

1180
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,224
HER SHOULDER MUSCLES
GOT MORE DEFINED

1181
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,392
Set.

1182
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,961
GO

1183
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,563
RIGHT ON CUE

1184
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,333
SHE LAUNCHES HERSELF
TOWARD HER TARGET

1185
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:38,869
HALTS

1186
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,538
HEIGH-HO, OFF I GO

1187
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,406
THE WIND STALLS HER FOR A MOMENT

1188
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,041
BUT HER MUSCLES HELP HER PULL THROUGH

1189
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,776
TAKES A BREATHER

1190
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,244
AND CHARGES

1191
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,780
Just a chip!

1192
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,915
You're almost there!

1193
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,451
CAN SHE SUCCEED THIS EASILY?

1194
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,721
SO CLOSE,
BUT NOT QUITE CLOSE ENOUGH

1195
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:02,193
THE PARACHUTE IS NO MATCH FOR HER,
BUT THE ONION RING CHIPS ARE TROUBLE

1196
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,994
WILL SHE BE SWEPT AWAY?

1197
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,629
NOT WITH HER STRONG CORE MUSCLES

1198
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,400
EAT US IF YOU CAN, WE DARE YOU

1199
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,437
THE "TANTALIZING" ONION RING CHIPS
ARE CAUSING BLOOD PRESSURE SPIKE

1200
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,806
FLOPS

1201
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,874
FALLS ON THE GROUND

1202
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,745
FORCED TO GIVE UP
DUE TO BLOOD PRESSURE ISSUES

1203
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,514
Is this for real?

1204
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,583
Are you saying it's this difficult?

1205
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,351
Dang, this is tough.

1206
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,320
-So it's rough.
-Even a bite is hard.

1207
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,921
Especially because we can't use our hands.

1208
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,690
I'm so ticked off.

1209
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,893
Sook, you dainty little thing.

1210
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,261
-Show her how it's done, Woo-jae.
-Geez.

1211
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,563
Can you take a jump and fly away, Woo-jae?

1212
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,333
He looks like he runs this business.

1213
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,400
Hello.

1214
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,468
A QUICK CAREER PIVOT

1215
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,669
Gosh, sir.

1216
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,438
-Please take good care of him.
-Sure.

1217
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,106
I won't be wearing them.

1218
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,208
-You can take them away.
-You're not wearing gloves?

1219
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,143
HE'S STILL POSTURING
AFTER SEEING 2 COSTARS FAIL

1220
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,545
We're all set.

1221
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,779
OKAY, I'M READY

1222
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,847
Crouch down, Woo-jae.

1223
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,782
NOT THAT WE HAVE HIGH HOPES

1224
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,652
BUT WE'LL WATCH HOW HE FARES

1225
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,088
Set.

1226
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,991
JUST IN CASE, THE WIND IS SET AT HIGH
GO

1227
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,959
CLOSING IN ONE STEP AT A TIME

1228
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,463
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY,
HE MARCHES ON PEACEFULLY

1229
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,498
WHAT'S THIS?
WHY DOES IT FEEL SO LIGHT?

1230
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,700
Keep going. Go on!

1231
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:20,070
MR. SKELETON PRESSES ON
WITHOUT STUMBLING

1232
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,939
You're doing great!

1233
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,007
BETTER THAN THIS GUY

1234
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,675
THAT'S MY BUDDY OVER THERE!

1235
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,479
Go on. Move onward.

1236
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,947
PRESSING ON

1237
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,217
DESPITE THE MOMENTARY SETBACK,
HE'S REACHED HIS GOAL SAFELY

1238
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,220
This is it! It's your moment!

1239
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,857
JUST ONE BITE…

1240
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,058
Take a bite!

1241
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,661
Eat it!

1242
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,229
Use your tongue!

1243
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,730
TRIES AGAIN

1244
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,098
Eat it!

1245
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,266
Use your tongue!

1246
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,902
OPEN WIDE FOR A BIG BITE

1247
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,772
Bite down. He ate one.

1248
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,839
-He did?
-He had one.

1249
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,274
-He ate one.
-Really?

1250
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,711
DESPITE HIS EFFORTS…

1251
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:04,181
HE TOO IS FORCED TO GIVE UP

1252
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,917
The wind must be super strong.

1253
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,020
If you ask me, we'll have to…

1254
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,722
wrap things up for today soon.

1255
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,557
He's done his best.

1256
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,926
-You can reach the fan somehow…
-Yeah?

1257
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,028
…but getting those snack pieces
is no joke.

1258
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,496
Yeah, if only we could use our hands.

1259
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,633
We have someone who looks like
she might actually fly away to the heavens

1260
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,101
wearing the parachute here.

1261
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,670
Please do us a solid,
Guardian Deity of Mountains.

1262
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,405
Surely this can't be that difficult.

1263
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,308
-Turn on the fan!
-Ready.

1264
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,676
Crouch down low, okay?

1265
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:33,744
Set.

1266
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,812
SHE WEATHERED A STORM RECENTLY

1267
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,014
GO

1268
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,450
THE FAN IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON

1269
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,951
SWAYS

1270
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,187
WOBBLES

1271
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,356
ONWARD!

1272
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,960
RUSHES FORTH ENERGETICALLY
AFTER A MOMENTARY FALTERING

1273
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,162
EVERYONE SO FAR
HAS DONE BETTER THAN HIM

1274
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,998
ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS EATING AN ONION RING CHIP

1275
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,199
DID SHE JUST STUMBLE?

1276
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:03,207
FLUNG AWAY BY
THE GALE OF THE TORNADO

1277
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,442
HEH

1278
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,543
-Are you okay?
-Jin-kyung.

1279
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,979
Surely this can't be that difficult.

1280
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,714
EVERYONE HAS A PLAN
UNTIL THEY END UP LIKE THIS

1281
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:11,782
Jin-kyung!

1282
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,083
-Are you okay?
-Jin-kyung.

1283
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,452
-Are you all right?
-Hey.

1284
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,954
Camera Crew! Are you still catching this?

1285
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,789
-Great.
-Jin-kyung.

1286
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,457
I'm sorry to ask,
but you have some time left.

1287
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,892
Can't you please get back up?

1288
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,093
Turn the fan back on.

1289
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,963
Can I get the 30 seconds of her time?

1290
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,031
It's a real challenge.

1291
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:30,734
When the wind hits the parachute properly,
it feels like someone's yanking you back.

1292
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,270
Jin-kyung, do you know
what I'm envying right now?

1293
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,139
-That fall looked amazing.
-It was funny.

1294
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,206
Hilarious, even.

1295
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,509
SHE ALWAYS STRIKES GOLD ON VARIETY SHOWS

1296
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,478
Honestly, the fall
created a great spectacle.

1297
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:42,713
GENIE HAS TO EAT ALL 5 CHIPS NOW

1298
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,416
So, I'm getting the 30 seconds
from Jin-kyung's turn.

1299
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,584
Are we calling it a success
if I finish three chips or what?

1300
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,853
How many pieces does he have to eat
for us to get lunch?

1301
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,622
Eating a single chip is a struggle.

1302
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:53,457
Eat two chips and save your face.

1303
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,525
-Two chips?
-Okay.

1304
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,592
He does have a face to save.

1305
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,394
Show them what you've got, Sae-ho.

1306
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,796
He can be decisive when he wants to be.

1307
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,064
-Show them.
-We're counting on you.

1308
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,565
You're our only hope, Sae-ho.

1309
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,033
Can I tackle him?

1310
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,670
I have no reason, though.
I just feel like doing it.

1311
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,472
Oh, come on.

1312
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,640
-Don't do it.
-What?

1313
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,241
I'm all set!

1314
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,444
-Would you like some protective gear?
-Take them away.

1315
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,511
Sell them if you want.

1316
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,013
Try the secondhand markets.

1317
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,115
-Ready.
-I hope you're ready, sir.

1318
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,750
-Okay!
-Set.

1319
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,985
GO

1320
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,121
MOVING SWIFTLY

1321
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,723
Looking good!

1322
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,424
NO FOOLING AROUND THIS TIME

1323
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,492
Looking good!

1324
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,560
RUSHING OVER TO THE FAN

1325
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:30,661
AS SOON AS HE REACHES HIS GOAL

1326
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,729
See it through!

1327
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:32,796
HIS MOUTH OPENS WIDE

1328
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,299
COME ON IN

1329
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,000
FLIES OFF

1330
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,135
DOESN'T EVEN NOTICE IT

1331
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,603
Focus!

1332
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,507
WILL HE SUCCEED AT BITING THE STRING?

1333
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,808
Focus!

1334
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,577
THE IDEA IS TO HOLD THE STRING
TO GET THE CHIP

1335
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,112
Focus!

1336
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,048
BUT THE STRONG WIND IS MAKING IT HARD

1337
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,650
He's close. So very close.

1338
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,718
You're nearly there.

1339
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,488
MANAGES TO BITE DOWN ANOTHER STRING

1340
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,227
THAT COUNTS AS ONE, RIGHT?

1341
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,130
1 CHIP ACKNOWLEDGED

1342
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:07,998
One down.

1343
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,833
OPENS HIS MOUTH EVEN WIDER THIS TIME

1344
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,735
Take the one on the side!

1345
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:16,573
HIS HUNTING ABILITY
EXCEEDS YOUR WILDEST IDEAS

1346
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,979
ATTACK OF SAE-HO
(ONION RING'S POINT OF VIEW)

1347
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,182
THE ONION RING CHIPS THEN RECALLED

1348
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,585
THE TERROR OF BEING RULED BY THE HUMANS…

1349
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,420
CHORTLING

1350
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,158
…AND THE HUMILIATION OF
BEING TIED TO THE FAN ON STRINGS

1351
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:39,496
THE RUTHLESS POT OF DESIRE
THREATENING THE SNACK CHIPS

1352
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,398
He can't reach that high up!

1353
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,968
He can't reach it.

1354
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,204
THE SOLE REMAINING CHIP
SWINGS UP TOO HIGH

1355
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,106
-It's too far up.
-Jump!

1356
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,340
Jump!

1357
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,643
ABOUT A 20-CM DIFFERENCE

1358
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,977
YOU WANT ME TO JUMP?

1359
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,412
I COULD JUST USE MY HAND!

1360
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,283
THINKING A JUMP WOULDN'T CUT IT,
HE USED HIS HAND TO SNATCH THE SNACK

1361
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,652
THE CREW IN THE BACK DIDN'T CATCH THAT

1362
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,224
MANAGED TO BITE THE ONION RING CHIP
BEFORE IT FELL TO THE GROUND

1363
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,659
That counts, right?

1364
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,495
THAT CONCLUDES THE GAME

1365
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,563
That should count.

1366
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:13,997
-Just a minute.
-Give it to him.

1367
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,699
You should make some allowances.

1368
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,768
He's only 160 cm tall,
but the chip was at the 180 cm point.

1369
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,936
-He's right.
-Give it to him.

1370
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,871
Come on, make allowances.

1371
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,639
-He's only 160 cm tall.
-Give it to him, okay?

1372
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,741
-How could he reach the 180 cm point?
-Let it count.

1373
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,411
Honestly, it felt like
I got slapped in the face.

1374
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,279
I'm not exaggerating.
It does feel that way.

1375
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,715
Dude, you should get your hair styled
by the fan from now on.

1376
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,483
Your hair's standing up fine.

1377
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,551
It's not so bad, right?

1378
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,053
-It's great.
-You look younger.

1379
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,521
-All right.
-Great styling.

1380
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,589
So, how many did he eat?

1381
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,190
-He had two chips.
-And?

1382
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,625
He took 54 seconds. It's a success!

1383
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,428
54 SECONDS, A SUCCESS!

1384
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,495
Let's eat.

1385
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,764
The closer I got,
the harder the wind blew.

1386
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,199
You didn't win the braised short ribs.

1387
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,567
-Give us another shot.
-One more shot.

1388
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,536
Why don't you play for the team, Sook?

1389
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,971
-For the braised short ribs.
-You ready?

1390
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,305
-You bet.
-Let's do it.

1391
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,407
-So, how about it, Sook?
-Okay!

1392
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,809
I could take your place.

1393
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,110
YOU, REALLY?

1394
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,478
I think I have a better shot than you.

1395
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,846
But I got really close to the fan.

1396
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,216
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but are you changing the strings too?

1397
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,253
Sae-ho licked and sucked on them.
Could you please change them?

1398
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,154
I'm afraid that's not possible.

1399
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,456
Damn it.

1400
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,893
STRIDES TOWARD THE CREW

1401
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:20,464
IS IT PERHAPS TO VOICE CONCERN
ON BEHALF OF SOOK?

1402
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,132
Do you have an extra bag of Onion Ring?

1403
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:24,801
Did you finish it?

1404
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:30,073
ABASHED + ANNOYED + DISAPPOINTED

1405
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,509
Why did you get only two bags?

1406
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,544
You should've gotten more.

1407
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,447
But two bags probably held
more than enough chips.

1408
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,548
HOW MANY ROUNDS DO YOU WANT?

1409
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,018
REAL LAST GAME

1410
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,185
Braised short ribs.

1411
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,655
-You promise to give us ribs, right?
-Of course.

1412
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,822
-Sook.
-What?

1413
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,157
You should take a few steps back.

1414
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,660
before taking a bite.
Huh? What do you mean?

1415
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,194
-Take a few steps back.
-Dang it.

1416
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,562
Can't I just start from here?

1417
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,631
THEY'RE ON THE SAME TEAM

1418
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,367
-Must you be a stickler for the rules?
-Ready.

1419
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,435
ALL SET AND READY

1420
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,503
Set.

1421
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,371
Let's do this!

1422
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,377
SETS OUT WITH A DETERMINED LOOK

1423
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,247
STAGGERS

1424
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,049
She's standing her ground.

1425
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,319
They've turned the wind at a higher speed.

1426
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,788
THE STRONGEST WIND
FOR THE STRONGEST PERSON

1427
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,089
MARCHES ON
USING ALL OF HER STRENGTH

1428
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,390
You're making good progress, Sook!

1429
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,491
You're doing great!

1430
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,060
You're almost there.

1431
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,528
Just a few more steps.

1432
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,396
REACHED THE HIGH-POWERED FAN IN NO TIME

1433
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:31,468
APPROACHES THE STRING
THAT SAE-HO DID HIS THING EARLIER

1434
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,172
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SECURE
BRAISED SHORT RIBS SO EASILY?

1435
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,076
NOM

1436
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:46,483
SUDDENLY, AN ONION RING CHIP
DASHES TO HER EYE AND NOT HER MOUTH

1437
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,786
Get back up there. You can still do this.

1438
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,689
WITNESS THE MIGHT OF A MERE CHIP

1439
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:54,958
DÉJÀ VU?

1440
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,827
Get back up there. You can still do this.

1441
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,095
You can still succeed!

1442
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,529
FAILED

1443
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,264
I know you have it in you!

1444
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,003
It's Auntie Omakase.

1445
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,070
LONG TIME NO SEE

1446
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,472
It's Auntie Omakase!

1447
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,207
Goodness, ma'am.

1448
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,342
Here we go.

1449
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,044
Oh, dear.

1450
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,447
PUT YOUR WIG BACK ON WHEN YOU GET UP

1451
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,149
She was so close to succeeding, though.

1452
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,217
I almost ate the chip.

1453
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,284
So close.

1454
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,387
-How did the lipstick get on her forehead?
-This time…

1455
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,155
What, my forehead?

1456
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,857
-What's that?
-It's a lipstick stain, right?

1457
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,593
It's a shame,
but your last attempt was a failure.

1458
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,129
-Let's give Woo-young one final shot.
-Yeah, just one last time.

1459
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,463
IS IT NECESSARY, THOUGH?

1460
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,432
What's the matter with him?

1461
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,300
-Let's break for lunch.
-All right.

1462
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,935
Can I have the Onion Ring?

1463
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,437
-The Onion Ring.
-Sure.

1464
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,505
It's my favorite.

1465
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,106
CLAIMS THE REMAINING ONION RING

1466
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,609
Thank you, everyone. Great work, guys.

1467
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,144
Good job, everyone.

1468
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,211
MUNCH

1469
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,547
One hour later…

1470
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,492
Sae-ho, you…

1471
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:07,431
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHUNG SEUNG-JE
FOR HIS HIGH-QUALITY MATH QUIZZES
