- Is it that bad? - No, it's not that.

I just think that it might be a bit difficult to understand.

Science fiction isn't an easy genre after all.

The fictional world of "The Beginning of Men"...

70
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,910
is a complicated one.

71

Then what do we do?

72
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,079

73
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,550

Go over it, and we'll talk again.

There's a lot to explain in the beginning,

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,588
so I admit that it's quite complicated.

79
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,060
But that will totally change as the story progresses.

80
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:52,899
You think so?

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,399
Yes, I know so. As always, I'm confident about this one too.

82

But he's super popular these days.

98
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,209
Because of his looks.

99

I know. Every TV show he's on becomes a hit.

100
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,550
If we reject this, he'll probably go to a different platform.

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,259
She must want to hear you say, "Congratulations."

167
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,590
And she deserves to hear it,

168
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,799
but she was busy avoiding you as if she had done something bad.

169
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,898
Mom's right. If I got a job at Neon,

170
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,138
you'd put up a banner...

171
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,500
and dance around in excitement.

172
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,679
- But still, I'm... - Ma Eum did nothing wrong.

173
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,609
She should live her life the way she wants to...

174
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,950
as she is an adult now.

175
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,028
Are you all right?

176
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,860
Oh, I've been a little sleep-deprived.

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,899
My deadline was today.

178
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,399
I've sent the first three episodes to Mr. Kwon.

179
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,039
That's so fast!

180
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:07,509
Everything's going smoothly now that you aren't working with me.

181
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:11,840
No, don't say that. I was clueless back then.

182
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,440
No, that's not true.

183
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,610
Honestly, don't beat yourself up.

184
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,519
That's why I wanted to take you out for dinner.

185
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm grateful to you, and I feel like I owe you an apology too.

186
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,730
But I never once had a chance to tell you.

187
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,360
Come on. Don't think like that.

188
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,470
Could I order another pizza?

189
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,229
- Yes. - Great, thank you.

190
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,839
Excuse me. Could we have the menu?

191
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
(Producer Kwon Young Bae)

192
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,980
Don't worry. Answer it.

193
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,549
Great, thank you.

194
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,980
Hello, Mr. Kwon. Is there a problem?

195
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,548
No, it's not a biggie.

196
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,419
Just the female lead's hair. It has to be long and straight.

197
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,359
- Sorry? - They've just finalized casting...

198
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,100
for the web drama based on this webtoon.

199
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,729
But actress Yoo Jung, who's known for her long, straight hair,

200
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,200
got the lead role.

201
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,939
The characters in the webtoon should look like the actors...

202
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,308
for consistency's sake. That way, it'll help generate more buzz,

203
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,340
which will be good for you. You know?

204
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,950
So I have to scrap it and draw everything again from scratch?

205
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,778
No. Why would you do that?

206
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,788
You just need to change her hair. That's all.

207
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,749
It won't take long.

208
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,019
Well, it's not that simple.

209
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,559
I've already finished coloring everything, so how...

210
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,859
Anyway, it's already been decided. So please hurry.

211
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,099
The deadline isn't changing.

212
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,799
Sorry? It's in a couple of days.

213
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,409
A real pro must be able to handle these things. Don't be late.

214
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,610
Wait, Mr. Kwon!

215
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,019
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

216
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,888
- I have to scrap the whole thing. - Sorry?

217
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,690
The file I sent.

218
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,190
I have to draw everything again from scratch.

219
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,200
What do you mean?

220
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,570
Exactly.

221
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,899
He shouldn't have approved it right away.

222
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,169
Are you all right?

223
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,240
I'm really sorry, but I think I should rush home.

224
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,508
I can't sit here and eat because I feel so anxious.

225
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,548
Yes, of course. Go home and work.

226
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,220
Thank you for understanding.

227
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,888
- Is this it? Nice. - Yes.

228
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,730
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

229
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,940
Good morning.

230
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
- Hello. - Good morning.

231
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,508
Gosh, you scared me.

232
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,809
What is it? Do you have something to say to me?

233
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,980
Yes.

234
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,690
Really?

235
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:13,820
Follow me.

236
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,399
What's up, first thing in the morning?

237
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,539
I met Goo Seul A yesterday.

238
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,869
Why did you meet my artist?

239
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,809
Oh, we just met up to have dinner together.

240
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,309
But I happened to overhear her talking on the phone with you.

241
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,009
What about it?

242
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,950
You suddenly told her to change the character and redraw everything.

243
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,720
Don't you think it's too harsh?

244
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,558
It's not like I did it because I wanted to.

245
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,659
Following the actors' images will help boost the sales of the webtoon.

246
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,699
Even so...

247
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,528
The details of the character were already confirmed.

248
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,099
If you tell her to change and redraw what was already confirmed...

249
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,940
That's how it's done in this industry.

250
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,609
We often have to change things...

251
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,940
hundreds of times to make sure the webtoons will sell better.

252
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,710
- I know, but even so... - Producer On.

253
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,808
Goo Seul A is my artist, so I'll deal with her.

254
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,579
Are you trying to lecture me now?

255
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,178
Did she ask you to have a word with me?

256
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,719
- No. It's not that, but... - If that is not the case,

257
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,489
stop overstepping your bounds.

258
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,519
You are not her spokesperson.

259
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:23,490
Tell her to come to me if she's got something to say. Okay?

260
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,700
What a way to ruin my morning.

261
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,740
Isn't Mr. Kwon so mean?

262
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,309
(Na Gang Nam)

263
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,648
Yes, he is mean indeed.

264
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,080
Just like On Dumpling a few weeks ago.

265
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,788
- Sorry? - You told me...

266
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:50,249
to change the entire episode on the day of the deadline,

267
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,690
listing all sorts of reasons.

268
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,090
You were so stressed out that day.

269
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,999
I only did that because I knew you'd pull it off.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,529
Oh, and Goo Seul A can't?

271
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,070
Are you belittling a rookie artist?

272
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,069
No, that's not what I meant.

273
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,340
I'm sure she can pull it off too.

274
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,378
She'll have to deal with it all the time.

275
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,539
Look at me.

276
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,548
Even as a top-tier artist,

277
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,950
I get told by a rookie producer to change things.

278
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,518
Are you still upset with me because of that incident?

279
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,620
Yes.

280
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,090
I tend to hold a grudge for a long time.

281
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,190
Please forgive me.

282
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,460
But you see...

283
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,628
When talking to an artist as a producer,

284
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,039
you should never bad-mouth another artist or producer.

285
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,768
Artists think that all the producers are in cahoots.

286
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,179
So I can't relate to you when you bad-mouth another producer to me.

287
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,808
To me, you producers are all the same.

288
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,049
You're right.

289
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,990
I dug my own grave.

290
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,620
Anyway, I guess Mr. Kwon hasn't changed one bit.

291
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,029
But then again, he's always been notorious for it.

292
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,329
- "Notorious"? - You didn't know?

293
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:09,470
Everyone calls him "Rookie Artists' Grave".

294
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,538
Everyone who works with him either disappears after just one project...

295
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,069
or gets all messed up.

296
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,940
You can go home now.

297
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,450
Dong Hee. Im Dong Hee.

298
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,460
Dong Hee.

299
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:35,190
- Dong Hee. - Sir, what's the matter?

300
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,130
It's gone again.

301
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,269
(Copy Ctrl-C, Paste Ctrl-V)

302
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,700
Oh, no. Is it actually gone?

303
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,479
Sir. Thankfully, I found a backup file.

304
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,619
Really? What a relief. My goodness.

305
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,190
Oh, Mr. Seok Ji Hyeong. You're here too.

306
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,160
Yes, sir.

307
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,069
I'm here because...

308
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,869
we're halfway through the saved files.

309
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:23,240
What? Already? My gosh.

310
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,809
This is scarier than seeing my bank account running dry.

311
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,579
He'll get back to his normal pace very soon.

312
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:33,649
He even cut down on sleep...

313
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,719
to get used to using the tablet.

314
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I see.

315
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:40,959
Oh, dear. Is it an act of reckless bravado at this old age?

316
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,700
Not at all, sir. It's so inspiring that you're challenging yourself.

317
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,429
Should I come here every day to help you out?

318
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,500
No, there's no need.

319
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,139
All my life, I nagged everyone...

320
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,769
to always meet their deadlines.

321
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,309
But it's not easy.

322
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,868
Lee Woo Jin's "Full Count"...

323
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,368
got great feedback internally and externally as well,

324
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,710
so we can go ahead and publish it if given the opportunity.

325
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,640
I see, okay. I'll bring it up at the next meeting.

326
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,279
Well, how's it going with Sin Dae Lyug?

327
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,319
Producer On?

328
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,150
What's the latest on Sin Dae Lyug?

329
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,960
Oh, right.

330
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,558
He's still working on the storyboards.

331
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,058
His drawing skills have improved,

332
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,829
so he's working on the pen touch at the moment.

333
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,699
I'm trying to get him to finish the first episode...

334
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,368
so it can be reviewed.

335
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,430
Okay, sounds good.

336
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,269
Thanks.

337
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,609
Are you worried about something?

338
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,579
Yes, Goo Seul A.

339
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,419
I'm so worried about her.

340
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,190
That's why I was distracted during the meeting.

341
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,859
I think I've figured out what your weakness is.

342
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,259
What?

343
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,858
You did this with Sin Dae Lyug too.

344
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,069
You get too emotionally invested in the artists.

345
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,599
It's good that you're passionate about your job,

346
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,109
but you could end up getting hurt.

347
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,410
Right, agreed.

348
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:45,149
However, Mr. Kwon could've been more thoughtful...

349
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,950
and considerate toward her.

350
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,689
You see, Mr. Kwon treats rookie artists...

351
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,220
like disposable commodities. That's what bothers me.

352
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,059
I'm not exactly fond of Mr. Kwon either,

353
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,199
but there are artists like Pomme...

354
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,029
who debuted under his guidance and have made it to the top.

355
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,690
(Enjoy the last flowers on Earth.)

356
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,000
(Sorry, I have an important project.)

357
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,299
(What do you do?)

358
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:07,500
(I'll tell you later.)

359
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,068
I think we should soften the colors a bit.

360
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,670
And the distance between the characters in the next scene...

361
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,269
Hey. No. Don't read that.

362
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,480
Did you draw that?

363
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,880
Yes. I'm going to submit it to a contest.

364
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:24,920
I see.

365
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,920
How much of it did you read?

366
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,750
Most of it.

367
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:38,130
Was it that bad? That you won't even tell me what you think?

368
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,329
No. You just didn't ask me for feedback.

369
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,400
How was it?

370
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,440
I thought...

371
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
it was good.

372
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:57,149
I liked it because it was different from other webtoons.

373
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,220
Really?

374
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,650
Thank you.

375
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,220
But hearing that you like it is making me feel nervous.

376
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,730
What if I don't get picked again?

377
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,799
Why do you always say that?

378
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
- What? - You always sell yourself short...

379
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,740
and speak negatively about yourself.

380
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,838
My gosh. You're trying to lecture me now.

381
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,640
Right. Good for you.

382
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,380
If you make a debut before me, hire me as your assistant.

383
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:37,019
I will hire you as my assistant.

384
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,619
Hey, he was joking.

385
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,460
Even if it's a joke, you shouldn't say things you don't mean.

386
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,670
Words are very powerful.

387
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,009
When my grandfather was sick, I took care of him by his side.

388
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,039
And one day, he said, "I'm good now."

389
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,279
"It's all over."

390
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,250
Something I hadn't seen before...

391
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,880
exuded from my grandfather.

392
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,759
Maybe, it was a spirit from his words.

393
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,589
The day after it had come out of my grandfather,

394
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,930
he died.

395
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,039
If you say negative things, they come true...

396
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,339
like you've been cursed...

397
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,579
by your own words.

398
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,589
Ms. Goo?

399
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,960
Hello, Ms. Goo. What's this about?

400
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,470
I'm sorry. But Mr. Kwon wouldn't answer my calls.

401
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,970
It's okay. How can I help you?

402
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:01,499
When I was changing the main character's hairstyle,

403
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,970
the order of scenes changed from before.

404
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,039
I was wondering if that would be a problem.

405
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,650
I see.

406
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,548
I think it would be okay...

407
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,149
as long as it doesn't affect the plot.

408
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,890
I'll ask other producers just in case.

409
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,119
I'm so relieved.

410
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,690
Your answer gave me a sense of assurance.

411
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,160
I feel relieved to keep working on this.

412
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,769
Ms. Goo. You're okay, right?

413
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,140
I think the schedule is too tough on you.

414
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,710
I don't have any choice.

415
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,109
I have to keep my promise.

416
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,579
Okay. Thank you.

417
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,670
It's okay. I can do it.

418
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,098
(That's so funny.)

419
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,709
(I'm surprised.)

420
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,109
(I'm so happy.)

421
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,950
Mr. Goo.

422
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,819
Did you email our team's data through your personal email?

423
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,650
Pardon?

424
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,829
The security team called me.

425
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,098
When internal data is attached to an email...

426
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,538
without including the team leader...

427
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,099
or the security manager in the email,

428
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,740
the security team gets an alert.

429
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,380
They called me about what they monitored.

430
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,450
I see.

431
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,319
I did that to look over the files at home after work.

432
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,559
I didn't know it was against the security protocol.

433
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,859
I'll be more careful.

434
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,829
You shouldn't work too much. You need to take a break too.

435
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,700
Okay.

436
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,970
On that note... Here.

437
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,809
Gosh.

438
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,479
What's in the box?

439
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,910
Pomme's comic books.

440
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,778
We'll need them for the signing event.

441
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,249
Bring them to her and get her to sign every single one.

442
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,818
- All of them? - Yes.

443
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,019
How many are in there?

444
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,960
A hundred books.

445
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,200
I'll go with him.

446
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,768
With him?

447
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,109
Yes. I can carry the box.

448
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:01,710
Is that so? Okay.

449
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,809
Then leave the signed books...

450
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,249
with the courier from the publishing company.

451
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,789
After that,

452
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,818
- you can go home. - Go home?

453
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:14,819
Yes! Thank you! Nice.

454
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:30,940
Let's go.

455
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,309
Let's go. I got this.

456
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,019
Give me that.

457
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,049
I'm good.

458
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,719
But still.

459
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,089
If you carry the box by yourself, you'll make me feel bad.

460
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,690
You don't have to feel bad. We're just going to her house.

461
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,559
Gosh. Let me carry that.

462
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm a man too.

463
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:57,130
Sure.

464
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,109
- It's... - Pretty doable, right?

465
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,338
What? Yes.

466
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,440
All right then.

467
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,349
- Let me know if you need help. - Okay.

468
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,028
Gosh. This is where Pomme lives?

469
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,359
A top webtoon artist is indeed different!

470
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,930
All right. I'll carry it now. I'm serious. Give me that.

471
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,298
No.

472
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:33,470
Come on.

473
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,940
Thanks for carrying the box.

474
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:43,849
She always makes me feel less of a man.

475
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,220
Wait up.

476
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,769
- You can put it there. - Thank you.

477
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,650
You didn't come alone today.

478
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,019
Right. Hello. My name is On Ma Eum.

479
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,650
We've met, right? It's nice to see you again.

480
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,519
- So you remember me. - Of course.

481
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,389
Do you want some drinks? Coffee or soda?

482
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,430
A cold cup of water would do for me.

483
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,190
- Same here. - Okay.

484
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,480
- Here. - Thank you.

485
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,950
This is so cool.

486
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,179
Isn't that the water purifier that makes ice too?

487
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,288
It is.

488
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,019
It is definitely convenient.

489
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,890
My family thought about buying one too. It's really nice.

490
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,329
You had a package in front of the door.

491
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,058
- They sent me a new one. - Pardon?

492
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,699
I ordered a small air purifier a while ago.

493
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,299
I got a text message and a photo that the package arrived.

494
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,509
But when I got home, the package was gone.

495
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,939
Did someone steal it?

496
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,069
I'm not sure.

497
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,609
I just reported it missing. And I finally got it.

498
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,308
I've already bought a new one.

499
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,548
You should return it.

500
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,278
That's a hassle too.

501
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,980
If you guys need it, you can take it.

502
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,890
She's so cool.

503
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,490
Should we take out the books?

504
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,259
(Pomme)

505
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,269
I'm done.

506
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,670
Gosh. My hand hurts.

507
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,179
A hundred copies? Don't you think it's too much?

508
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,449
Sorry, I'll tell them we shouldn't give out so many next time.

509
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,349
That's okay. The more we give out, the better.

510
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:02,890
Oh, one more thing.

511
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Here.

512
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,230
I brought this product placement proposal and the product for it.

513
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,359
Go over it and let me know what you think.

514
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,769
Oh, it smells nice.

515
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,900
I'll go over the proposal.

516
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,910
Pomme, you're very sweet.

517
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,839
Right? Not like what they told you at work.

518
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,450
Pardon me? At work?

519
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,650
Sorry. No, what?

520
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,549
I'm not fishing for info, so don't worry.

521
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,990
I know what people say about me.

522
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,359
I'm sweet to you because I think you're cute, Ma Eum.

523
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,230
- What's with that chuckle? - What's with that chuckle?

524
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,900
Oh, I was just...

525
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,239
What was funny? That she said I was cute?

526
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,569
Or that she finds me friendly?

527
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,068
Both?

528
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,309
- What? - What?

529
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,189
There's definitely something.

530
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,190
I mean, I don't see why it has to be done.

531
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,260
I know. Why did the two of them...

532
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,369
Who are you talking about?

533
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,239
- Who were you talking about? - What the...

534
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,069
Heo Kwan Young! I've been talking about him all night.

535
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,279
Clearly, you weren't listening. I'm amped.

536
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Oh, sorry. But come on!

537
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,948
Don't use abbreviations. It doesn't suit you.

538
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,349
This isn't an abbreviation. It's what youngsters say these days.

539
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,589
I bet you're amped to hear me talk like a youngster.

540
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,189
You must be annoyed. Do you want to punch me?

541
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,819
But you can't because I'm older.

542
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,530
What can you do? Too bad.

543
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,159
Sucks to be you.

544
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:52,900
Sure.

545
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,670
Who were you talking about?

546
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,739
Who? Who could it be?

547
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,409
Who? Tell me.

548
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,070
About Pomme.

549
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,409
She's full of surprises.

550
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,079
Why do you say that?

551
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,948
She seems cold at times,

552
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:15,519
but I think she has such a warm heart.

553
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,550
I think her cats are rescue cats.

554
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,559
What's that?

555
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:24,989
Stray cats that have been rescued.

556
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,760
Although she didn't say anything about it.

557
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:31,429
There are so many things you can't tell by just looking at someone.

558
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Right?

559
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,139
And Pomme could make her debut thanks to Mr. Kwon.

560
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,079
Exactly.

561
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,650
Goo Seul A's choice must've had a meaningful reason behind it too.

562
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,650
Just like the meaningful reasons I have for every choice I make.

563
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:53,019
Gosh, this is hard.

564
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,360
Is it because I grew up an athlete?

565
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,530
Or is it because I'm still too young?

566
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,900
I feel as though I'm finally beginning to understand the world.

567
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,070
Me too.

568
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,638
Just as I begin to feel that I'm getting the hang of it,

569
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,239
I'm confused again.

570
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,868
I can't figure out the answer.

571
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,439
Even you, Mr. Smarty-pants?

572
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,610
Come on. Getting good grades doesn't always mean you're smart.

573
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,250
Sometimes, I'm plagued by useless thoughts.

574
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,389
You can use me when you're frustrated.

575
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,420
You may not believe me, but I'm a great listener.

576
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,489
Let's help out each other since we're in this together.

577
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,280
Are you okay? That must've scared you.

578
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,210
What? Yes.

579
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,718
What about you? Are you okay?

580
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,250
Yes, I'm fine.

581
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,320
You're totally fine?

582
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,090
Yes.

583
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,190
I see. I'm glad you're okay.

584
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,469
My gosh. Some delivery guys drive so dangerously these days.

585
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,710
I know.

586
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,510
I'm going to have a beer before I go to bed.

587
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,280
You probably have no idea how nice it is.

588
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,949
No.

589
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,119
A life without alcohol must be so boring.

590
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,130
Bye!

591
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,698
I feel bad that I got dropped off first.

592
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,869
You live closer. Of course, you should be dropped off first.

593
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:53,079
Your place is so nice too.

594
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,880
Get home safely.

595
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,480
Bye.

596
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,780
Let's get going.

597
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:02,320
Bye!

598
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:43,090
(Friday, July 29)

599
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,829
("More Than Girls")

600
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:54,199
(Yeo Eum will be here soon.)

601
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,510
I thought it was stupid to cry and laugh...

602
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,510
while reading comics...

603
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,409
because it won't change your reality...

604
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,820
that you have to face.

605
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,089
Oh, this is how it changed.

606
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,530
This is... I should ask about this.

607
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,469
This revised version is much better.

608
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,590
I'm glad we changed this.

609
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,320
- Hello. - Hello.

610
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,129
I was in the area and wanted to stop by to see Ms. Goo.

611
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,960
Yes, of course. She's in her room.

612
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,329
- I got this for you. - You didn't have to do this.

613
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,869
Ms. Goo. It's me, Producer On. Can I come in?

614
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,349
Ms. Goo?

615
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,460
Ms. Goo.

616
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:30,929
Ms. Goo?

617
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:40,039
Ms. Goo.

618
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,739
Ma'am!

619
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:46,948
Yes? My gosh, Seul A! What happened to her?

620
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,618
- Hello, 911? - Seul A!

621
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,119
- Someone fainted. - My gosh.

622
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,788
- She's unconscious. - Oh, no.

623
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:53,989
- Was she okay last night? - Well...

624
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,439
Am I in the hospital now?

625
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,369
You woke up. You had fainted at home.

626
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,479
You're overworked.

627
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,749
You're malnourished, stressed, and sleep-deprived.

628
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,218
What time is it? The deadline is coming up.

629
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,849
No, you can't leave.

630
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,989
The doctor said you needed absolute rest.

631
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,919
No! Then I can't meet the deadline.

632
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,789
If you don't rest now, you'll be bedridden for longer.

633
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:33,230
I'll speak to my colleagues. Don't worry.

634
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,769
At first, I thought I'd just have to change the hairstyle.

635
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,179
I thought I'd be able to meet the deadline if I cut down on sleep.

636
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,050
But once I changed the hairstyle,

637
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,050
I had to change her clothes too.

638
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,360
Because her appearance changed, her movements had to change too,

639
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:05,130
which meant that I had to change the composition and...

640
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,130
I wanted to change everything,

641
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,469
but I did not have enough time at all.

642
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,010
So I kept cutting down on sleep and ended up...

643
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,880
It's okay.

644
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,019
She's been discharged, but she must rest for a few more days.

645
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,749
She's extremely exhausted.

646
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,288
Goodness. I can't believe this.

647
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,119
Is she trying to advertise that she's an amateur?

648
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,299
Aren't we supposed to send it to the web novel and drama team...

649
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,799
by the end of the week?

650
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,729
This means we have to change the schedule.

651
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,269
Why should we change the schedule?

652
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:47,239
We'll replace her.

653
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,039
Mr. Kwon, you're out of line.

654
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,109
- Why? What did I do? - You stole my artist,

655
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,479
so you should at least take good care of her.

656
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,150
I stole her? What are you talking about?

657
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,718
She couldn't work with you, so she chose me.

658
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,888
Besides, since when was she yours?

659
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:07,289
Do you think you own your artists?

660
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,590
That's not the point.

661
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,428
She fainted...

662
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:14,828
because you suddenly changed the character's details.

663
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:17,130
You should've at least been sorry.

664
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,840
Me? Why?

665
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,139
She was the one who agreed to follow the schedule.

666
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,209
And she signed the contract,

667
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,209
which stated that we could go ahead and replace her...

668
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,678
if she failed to meet any of the deadlines...

669
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,579
or didn't abide by the terms of the contract.

670
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,320
You're unbelievable.

671
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,289
Rookie artists aren't some tools you can dispose of.

672
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,130
All webtoon artists sacrifice their health. Don't blow this up.

673
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,900
The company's interest comes first, not hers.

674
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:49,428
The company hired the artist and paid for her work!

675
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:52,499
This is a mutual partnership, not one-sided employment.

676
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,670
That's enough.

677
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,840
Enough. We're having a meeting, not a fight.

678
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,480
You're colleagues. Why are you getting territorial over artists?

679
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,210
Change the schedule.

680
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,679
I know that you want to save up on the finished episodes.

681
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:11,488
But there's still some time before "The Law of Girls" launches.

682
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:13,289
You should push back the deadline first.

683
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,130
Okay?

684
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,960
- Okay. - Finding a new artist is risky too.

685
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,069
And Producer On, you...

686
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,599
I'll talk to her privately.

687
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,099
He'll talk to you.

688
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,820
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:55,599
Producer On.

690
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Yes.

691
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:00,500
Let's go and drink.

692
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:06,210
- Pardon? - What? We can't?

693
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,710
This is considered work too. It's a work meeting.

694
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,280
Sure. That sounds good.

695
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,320
Can I join you?

696
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:19,760
Of course. Let's go.

697
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,260
But Jun Yeong, you can't drink.

698
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,659
He can go and drink some soda.

699
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,730
Then I'll join you too.

700
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,900
Du Hee.

701
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,369
Hey, we should work.

702
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,309
Hurry.

703
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,139
- We'll get going. - Okay.

704
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,440
- Bye. - See you later.

705
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,650
Du Hee, are you that dense?

706
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,320
Why did you lose your temper? It's not like you were perfect too.

707
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,230
Did I...

708
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,730
cross the line that much today?

709
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:02,260
Yes. You crossed the line a lot.

710
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,900
To be honest, the way Mr. Kwon works...

711
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,598
feels too cruel.

712
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,110
Cruel? What does that mean?

713
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,109
Should work have a sense of justice?

714
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,510
Basic work ethics and morals should be maintained at the least.

715
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,719
Mr. Kwon didn't violate basic work ethics or morals.

716
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,719
It's just that he's always playing around that boundary.

717
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,590
So are you saying that it's not a matter of right or wrong,

718
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,059
but it's a matter of someone's preferences?

719
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,760
Yes.

720
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,468
How come you're so generous when it comes to Mr. Kwon?

721
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:40,469
- No. That's not true. - Isn't it...

722
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,169
because Mr. Kwon handles most of the webtoons that make up...

723
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,309
the majority of our team's sales?

724
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,210
I studied...

725
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,179
our team's competitive edge, weaknesses,

726
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,689
and what we should improve to make our team more successful.

727
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,019
I see. Really?

728
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,659
I learned this during my analysis.

729
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,029
Mr. Kwon's webtoons...

730
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,399
are mostly high in sales, and their net profits are high too.

731
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,428
After acquiring original stories that are bound to be successful,

732
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:12,468
he hires low-paying rookie artists...

733
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:15,368
to create hit webtoons. He systemized this pipeline.

734
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,409
Thank you.

735
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,509
And the sales for second publication and overseas sales...

736
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,809
mostly consisted of Mr. Kwon's webtoons as well.

737
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,880
I see. So you know.

738
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,379
But still. He's your superior.

739
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,619
I don't think you should evaluate him like he's your friend.

740
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:33,989
So you're saying it's all about sales and profits.

741
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:37,760
So are you disappointed in the entire team?

742
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,328
Even when...

743
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,269
we get to keep working thanks to all the money he brings in?

744
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:51,570
Mr. Kwon...

745
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,820
wasn't like this at first.

746
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,719
He was just like you when he started.

747
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,659
He also had his passionate days.

748
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,989
I'm Kwon Young Bae from Gingertoon.

749
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,459
- Hello. - Hello.

750
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,199
- I'm here again. - Hello.

751
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,130
Sir, hello.

752
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:22,339
Mr. Kwon. What brings you here on a weekend?

753
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,038
I was passing by and saw a fruit truck.

754
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,409
And I thought about you.

755
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,780
This does resemble you too.

756
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,409
Gosh. You're not handling my webtoon. Why did you do that?

757
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,808
You're an office worker. You should rest on weekends.

758
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,618
Weekends are overrated.

759
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,949
Bringing you to Gingertoon is more important. Don't you agree?

760
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,460
I'll go and cut up the watermelon.

761
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,690
Gosh. This is ripe.

762
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,999
I also brought orange juice...

763
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,170
to help you stay healthy.

764
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,139
Gosh. Thank you.

765
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,569
I feel so taken care of especially now that my deadline is near.

766
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,070
Gosh, don't mention it. Enjoy.

767
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,880
Here.

768
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,049
- This is yours, Young Han. - Gosh.

769
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,809
- Us too? Thank you. - This is for you, Soo Won.

770
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,860
If we sign Mr. Oh, our platform...

771
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,900
Hold on.

772
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:26,900
Do you see that?

773
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,210
Hello.

774
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:34,440
Mr. Kwon, I made a decision.

775
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,078
I'll release my new webtoon on Gingertoon.

776
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,710
So you'll sign with us?

777
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,119
Let's make a great webtoon together.

778
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,280
Of course!

779
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,420
We will. You should do it with me!

780
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,659
I'll go and get on it now!

781
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,590
Yes. Okay.

782
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,129
- Hold on. - Hey, what did he say?

783
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,590
- What happened? - Hey.

784
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:54,499
We did it!

785
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,329
- Did what? - We did it!

786
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,038
We did it? Did what?

787
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,670
We did it! Yes!

788
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,510
I can't picture him that way after seeing how he is now.

789
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:08,940
He was that passionate, so what happened?

790
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,719
Sir!

791
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,050
What do you mean you'll close down our platform? How could you do this?

792
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,760
I jumped through so many hoops to persuade and sign famous artists!

793
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,118
We're finally going to have our chance!

794
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,489
What? You'll close us down?

795
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:23,829
Sir!

796
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,800
So you should have gotten the sales up sooner.

797
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:28,500
You shouldn't have let your team go in the red.

798
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,670
Hey, Heo Kwan Young!

799
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:37,840
Kwan Young. Must you take it this far?

800
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:41,110
We're just asking you for more time.

801
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,050
More time.

802
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:46,980
When will you stop asking for more time?

803
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,989
Until the company goes under?

804
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:58,989
You've had your chances.

805
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,699
This is enough.

806
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,400
Let's go.

807
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,139
Do you know how many readers are on our platform?

808
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:08,969
You didn't make this company!

809
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:11,009
We did!

810
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,570
Young Bae.

811
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,409
All of us worked hard to launch this platform!

812
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:18,150
Mr. Heo!

813
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,820
I'll do better!

814
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,519
Please give us one more chance.

815
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:29,159
Mr. Heo.

816
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,199
Man Chul, this isn't right.

817
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,469
Ji Hyeong, this isn't right.

818
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:43,909
We worked really hard.

819
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:47,840
I'm sorry.

820
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:50,210
I'm sorry.

821
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,280
- Of course, we will refund you. - Yes. I'm sorry.

822
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,419
- We're very sorry. - We just found out too.

823
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,888
- We don't know what to do now. - It hasn't been decided yet.

824
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,589
- That's what we were informed. - We have to see first.

825
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,760
- We'll bring this up again. - Okay.

826
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,360
- Hello? - Yes.

827
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:20,480
I'm sorry, sir.

828
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,880
Are you kidding me?

829
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,249
Do you know what kind of offers I had to turn down...

830
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,250
to switch to Gingertoon?

831
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,289
The platform will close down only after three months?

832
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,230
I'm so sorry. I can't even face you.

833
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,058
It's all my fault.

834
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,169
I will do my best to ensure...

835
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,198
you can release your webtoon on another platform.

836
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,440
I don't want to see your face. Just get out of my studio.

837
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:53,239
- Sir. - Get out of my sight now!

838
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:57,549
You might not know this because you have a steady paycheck.

839
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,649
I have to pay rent for my studio and pay my assistants.

840
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,119
I lose tens of thousands of dollars even if I don't do a thing.

841
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,119
But if your platform gets closed down like this,

842
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,190
I'll have to come up with the damages all on my own!

843
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,788
Let's say that I can release this on another platform.

844
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,499
What about all the expenses that will incur while I wait?

845
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,159
How will you take responsibility for that?

846
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,840
I'm so sorry.

847
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,908
I hired new assistants for the new webtoon.

848
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:31,250
What about them? Should I fire them when I just hired them?

849
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,179
I'm responsible for a lot of people's livelihood.

850
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,719
I'm different from a guy who gets a monthly paycheck from a company...

851
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:43,730
without taking any risks.

852
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,849
In the end, she asked me for a divorce.

853
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:11,619
Hey.

854
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:15,360
Do you know what Mr. Mo said to me?

855
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,360
He said...

856
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,230
I didn't take any risks.

857
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,199
I was a mere office worker with a monthly paycheck.

858
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,869
He said I didn't take any risks.

859
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,239
How is a divorce not taking any risks?

860
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,650
- Hey, Ji Hyeong. - Yes?

861
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,349
What is it?

862
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,360
Did I do something wrong?

863
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:51,989
Have I been living my life wrong?

864
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,760
I...

865
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,399
All I did was to make comics that I wanted to create.

866
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,039
That's all I did.

867
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:05,440
The same goes for you too.

868
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,250
Right.

869
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,349
Luckily, all the webtoon editors from Gingertoon...

870
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,019
were able to switch over to Neon.

871
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:28,230
- But Mr. Kwon... - He became a different person.

872
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,239
Had I known, Ms. Goo...

873
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,710
wouldn't have signed with Mr. Kwon.

874
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:39,969
You think so?

875
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,650
Everyone who worked with Mr. Kwon...

876
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,750
knew about his reputation.

877
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,118
It's just that they all started,

878
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,190
thinking it would be different for them.

879
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,829
Although Ms. Goo didn't know.

880
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,459
No. Even if she knew about Mr. Kwon's reputation,

881
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,400
she might have made the same decision.

882
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,999
- But... - As the assistant editor,

883
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,599
you have to consider the profits for the company.

884
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,038
To be honest, Producer On and other producers...

885
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,379
can focus on specific artists and invest their time...

886
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,578
because Mr. Kwon handles most of the webtoons that make up...

887
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:21,079
the majority of our team's sales.

888
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:24,650
Mr. Kwon does play a big role...

889
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,590
in giving other producers chances...

890
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:30,690
to go after the projects they believe in. Right.

891
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,190
If we don't secure our sales,

892
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,960
we will end up losing a lot more.

893
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,400
Anyway, after that incident,

894
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:44,210
he became a producer who went after successful webtoons and sales.

895
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,679
So he makes sure to go home on time.

896
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,949
He also started to make webtoons based on successful web novels...

897
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,750
after that incident.

898
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,099
(I'm sending you this week's file.)

899
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Guarantee the quality while meeting the deadlines.

900
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,670
That's all I look for in webtoon artists.

901
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,110
Webtoons are products.

902
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,388
I'm going home.

903
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:33,320
- Bye. - Bye.

904
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,159
(August 16, 6pm)

905
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,829
Of course, I know that Mr. Kwon blurs the line from time to time.

906
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:46,070
However,

907
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:50,570
I couldn't just blindly criticize Mr. Kwon.

908
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,239
I don't want...

909
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,210
to face the same end again at Neon.

910
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,389
I didn't know our team had such a painful backstory.

911
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,190
Same here.

912
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,489
Gosh. But I still can't understand Mr. Kwon completely.

913
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,860
I think I do.

914
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,400
When work becomes you,

915
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,730
you're bound to face difficult moments.

916
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,010
Do you think those moments will come to us?

917
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,739
I'm not sure.

918
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,928
(Okay.)

919
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:46,529
(Great. Then...)

920
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:50,629
See? I knew you could do it in a jiffy.

921
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,500
I didn't do it in a jiffy.

922
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:56,469
I finished it only sleeping for two hours a day.

923
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,480
I had to redraw most of the scenes.

924
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:04,409
I see. I know that. Okay. Good work.

925
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,218
We'll go with this character.

926
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:11,219
You can just keep drawing according to the schedule. Okay?

927
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,420
I'll get going then.

928
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,059
Right.

929
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,690
I'm just asking to see if you would be interested.

930
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:21,559
After this webtoon, would you like to do another webtoon?

931
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:24,630
I mean, if you can handle it, you can do both simultaneously.

932
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:29,639
Everyone has already been talking about how great your drawing is.

933
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,868
I'll launch another webtoon based on a web novel.

934
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,139
And they want you, Ms. Goo.

935
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,550
No. I won't do it.

936
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:44,019
Why not?

937
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,349
I'm trying to finish this webtoon because I feel responsible.

938
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,289
And I'm also testing my limit.

939
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,889
But I don't want to continue after this.

940
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,570
I like webtoons.

941
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,639
I don't want to hate them.

942
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,610
And I don't want to hate myself for drawing them either.

943
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:08,010
But when I'm working with you,

944
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:12,179
I can't help but hate the webtoons and myself.

945
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,590
I don't want to go through the same thing with another webtoon.

946
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,500
If this webtoon does well, I'm sure you'll feel different.

947
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,969
Don't make up your mind already.

948
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:34,238
You see, people change their minds.

949
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,710
No. I don't think I'll ever change my mind on this.

950
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,480
After this webtoon,

951
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,809
I want to tell my own story...

952
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,349
even if it takes long.

953
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,190
I'll get going then.

954
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,570
And I would like to communicate only through emails from now on.

955
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:43,809
(Number of New Users)

956
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:51,650
Ms. Goo turned down the offer to draw "Missing Girl".

957
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,308
I thought she couldn't do both simultaneously.

958
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,718
So I told her she could do it after "The Law of Girls".

959
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:56,820
But she still said no.

960
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:01,089
Really? Well, we can't force her.

961
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:05,289
Right. I'll find another talented artist.

962
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,900
- Good work. - Okay.

963
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,000
Mr. Kwon.

964
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,170
Yes?

965
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,969
Thank you.

966
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,638
Why are you suddenly thanking me?

967
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,510
I know how hard it is to be the bad guy on the team.

968
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,050
Because I'm a soft boss, you're taking on that role.

969
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,719
I'm grateful for you.

970
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,749
My goodness. I'm not the bad guy.

971
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,589
I'm just working.

972
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,530
I work and get paid for my work. That's all.

973
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,929
But still. I know how tough it is to be worthy of a paycheck.

974
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:46,269
But maybe, that's the biggest virtue for office workers.

975
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,710
Talk to you later.

976
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:02,480
If you revise that, I think it will be much better.

977
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,050
I'll show you again after I fix it.

978
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,058
Giving other producers chances...

979
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:16,259
to go after the projects they believe in...

980
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,669
It's because Mr. Kwon handles...

981
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,268
most of the webtoons that make up...

982
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:23,599
the majority of our team's sales.

983
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,650
Yes.

984
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:33,210
"The Beginning of Men" has been finalized.

985
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,379
Just like you said, we can build the setting little by little...

986
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,349
for sci-fi webtoons.

987
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,658
- Yes. - Come on. Why don't we try...

988
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:43,489
a dark love story instead of a predictable story?

989
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,488
Like romantic thriller.

990
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,229
Even if the views aren't high at first,

991
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,799
it would be a nice project given the film rights.

992
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,198
As long as the plot is strong, people will pay to read it...

993
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:54,099
even if the views are low.

994
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,388
I'm going home.

995
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,420
- Bye. - Bye.

996
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,219
Good work.

997
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:17,530
Bye.

998
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:24,530
Working for a company isn't about realizing one's dream.

999
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:28,199
And I work for a company.

1000
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,329
(Today's Webtoon)

1001
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:36,639
Ms. On has the talents to be a good producer.

1002
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:40,368
What do you expect from your rookie artists?

1003
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:44,480
Write up a report that shows why webtoons must be on this page.

1004
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,210
Why is Mr. Na here?

1005
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,249
Make sure not to let Mr. Im notice it.

1006
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,649
Sometimes, your goodwill is worse than ill will...

1007
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,519
if you can't be responsible for it.

1008
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,388
Someone has broken my laptop.

1009
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:59,359
I drew the storyline for my webtoon, but it's gone missing.

1010
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,659
All of them, from the beginning to the end!
