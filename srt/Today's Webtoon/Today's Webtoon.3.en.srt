00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:45,109
Which one of them would be good?

12
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,249
Do you have someone in mind?

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,459
Hey, that's intense. Will that be okay?

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,328
This way, she'll learn fast.

15
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,300
It's much better than having a newbie work with a rookie artist.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,828
Okay, then let's do that. I have a meeting to attend.

17
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,169
- See you later. - Okay.

18
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,309
Hello.

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,349
Hey, what's that? Did you get one for me too?

20
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,390
You're so thoughtful. Thanks.

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,690
No problem.

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,130
What's this? It tastes so watery. When did you get this?

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,959
Oh, the ice must've all melted. I'm sorry.

24

Mr. Jang Man Chul and the rest of his team...

25
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,539
will probably be dismissed by the end of this year.

26
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,239
Giving you the impression...

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
of making you an official employee if you worked hard...

28
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,649
They were deceiving you.

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,880
They just hired you to use you for a year and then toss you.

30
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,329
- Ma Eum. - Yes.

31
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,969
If you're not busy right now,

32
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,639
can you help me look for some references?

33
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,299
Oh, sure.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,109
But what is a reference?

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,018
Things we can refer to for info while working on the new webtoon.

36
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,150
Oh, I see.

37
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm forwarding you everything the production company sent.

38
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,819
Sure.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,859
What does "forwarding" mean?

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,399
I'm forwarding their email to you.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,509
Oh, right. Got it.

42
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,319
Ma Eum, can you spare me a moment?

43
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:02,850
Sure.

44
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,059
It's natural not to know such things if this is your first office job.

45
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,629
It's our fault for not telling you anything...

46
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,668
and expecting that you'd pick things up on your own.

47
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,569
No, I should've asked sooner.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,069
I'll go over everything with you today.

49
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,639
If there's anything you don't know, feel free to ask me.

50
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,380
Anything?

51
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,079
Why? What do you want to know?

52
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,160
It's nothing. I'm just...

53
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,289
I'm not sure whether I'm doing a good job.

54
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,930
What are you talking about? You've been doing an excellent job.

55
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,699
Just keep it up. That's all you need to do, okay?

56
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,199
Thank you, Ms. Gi.

57
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,009
I really mean it, you silly goose.

What's that? Your emergency fund?

60

It's a talisman. My good luck talisman.

61
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,359
A talisman?

62
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:16,889
Yes.

63
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,429
You gave me this on the day of my interview.

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,569
Right! But you didn't pass the interview that day.

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,299
Regardless, I got the job and am sitting here now.

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,309
Thanks for thinking of it that way.

67
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,210
I think I'm going to need luck from here on out.

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,609
I can do it!

69
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,220
You can do it.

70
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,090
Right, Ma Eum and Jun Yeong.

71
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,989
Your webtoon artists have been decided.

72
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,989
Ma Eum, let's have a quick meeting.

73
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,530
Jun Yeong, Mr. Kwon will go over everything with you.

74
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,859
I've already sent you everything via our messenger.

She hates it when you call her without texting her first.

78

That's it.

79
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,850
What?

80
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:25,129
I knew it. I must leave this team.

81
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,460
There it is.

What? Is this...

84
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,548
Seriously? Mr. Na Gang Nam is my artist?

85
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,780
- Yes. Are you excited? - Yes!

86
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm a huge fan of "Princess Kumiho"!

87
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,288
This means I'll get to read his work before anyone else does.

88
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,319
This is crazy!

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,260
I'm not assigning you to him so you can be the first to read his work.

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,689
Don't get too excited.

91
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,489
Right.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,628
I'll be sure to give him a level-headed, objective critique.

93
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,330
I'm not asking you to become a cold-blooded critic.

94
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:08,439
Oh, right.

95
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,269
Then I'll assist him to the best of my ability...

96
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,739
I am definitely not asking you to blindly take his side.

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,049
- It's hard, isn't it? - Yes.

98
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,879
That's what this job is like.

99
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,749
Well, then...

100
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,059
What does it mean to be an editor?

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,359
In short.

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,330
It is your job to find the answer.

103
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,030
Oh, me? I see, okay.

104
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,168
Starting next month, you are to send me the answers you find.

105
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,270
One a month. Got it?

106
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,479
Got it.

107
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,209
He's a veteran, so he's usually fine on his own.

108
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,179
But don't let your guard down.

109
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,419
Don't rely on artists too much.

110
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,048
Try to become a producer whom artists can rely on.

111
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,059
Okay?

112
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,789
That's so cool, Mr. Seok.

113
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,728
Right, what did you say?

114
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,199
A producer artists can rely on, right? Okay.

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,699
A producer whom artists can...

116
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,439
My gosh. This is so cool.

Yes.

122
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,978
After Mr. Baek Eo Jin's short break,

123
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:33,320
his drawing quality improved drastically,

124
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,419
so the paid views have increased significantly as well.

125
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,929
He had never missed a deadline in the past,

126
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,129
so the unexpected time-off caused quite the buzz,

127
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,058
which actually helped us promote the platform.

128
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,299
I'm glad to hear that.

129

It'd be great if you could keep this up.

hit a home run in his first at-bat yesterday.

135
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,070
I want to see our rookies hit a home run too.

Your first artist is Pomme, right?

138
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,780
So? Are you excited to work with her?

139
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
No.

140
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,619
No? I knew you'd say that.

141
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,560
Right, everyone says she's difficult to work with.

142
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,029
But nothing happened, right?

143

- Sir. - Yes?

144
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,330
May I speak with you in private?

145
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,600
Now?

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,239
You want to transfer to a different team?

147
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Why? Do you not enjoy the work we do?

148
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,350
- No. - I see.

149
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,720
You've reached such a conclusion in just a month?

150
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,619
I arrived at this conclusion a while ago...

151
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,889
but couldn't tell you sooner.

152
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,690
Is that so?

153
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,989
I'm sad.

154
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,930
I was so excited to have such a competent newbie join my team.

155
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,969
Okay. I'll speak with the HR team and figure out the next steps.

156
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,970
I've already asked them about it.

157
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,809
They said I should ask you to move me...

158
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,509
rather than requesting a transfer myself...

159
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,649
because it'll be faster that way.

160
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,379
I see. You already looked into it.

161
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,090
Which team do you want to join instead?

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,659
The Service Planning Team. If that's not possible,

163
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,389
any other service-related team would be fine.

164
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,330
So you're okay as long as it's not my team?

165
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,899
All right.

166
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:03,040
If that's what you want to do, I'll look into it. But you see,

167
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,840
this isn't a college.

168
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,778
- Pardon me? - You can't transfer...

169
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,449
to a different team like you're dropping a course...

170
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,019
just because you don't enjoy the work.

171
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,690
In any case, all right. I'll speak with the HR team.

172
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,529
Until your transfer is finalized,

173
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,629
please don't tell anyone on the team.

174
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,629
And do your best to complete the tasks you've been given.

175
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,170
Yes, sir.

176
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,909
- Jun Yeong. - Yes.

177
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:46,408
"There's no paradise for you to escape to."

178
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,909
Have you heard of this line?

179
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,649
- No. - Of course, you haven't.

180
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,920
It's from a very famous comic book series.

181
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,229
I was just reminded of it.

182
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,029
Is he trying to say I'm running away?

183
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,180
(Episode 3: There's No Paradise for You to Escape to)

184
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,008
Hello, Mr. Na.

185
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,050
I'm On Ma Eum. We met the other day.

186
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,450
I'll be in charge of your projects from now on.

187
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,350
May I drop by today to say hello?

188
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,359
They said even this spot is...

189
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,489
No, I'm busy today.

190
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,729
Oh...

191
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,580
Gosh.

192
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,449
I guess you're busy trying to wrap it up.

193
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,419
You can do it. I'll be waiting for your draft.

194
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,190
Don't bother me if you know that I'm busy.

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,190
Darn it.

196
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,290
Doors are closing.

197
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,758
I heard you were my producer starting today.

198
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,358
Aren't you coming to my studio?

199
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,399
We need a proper meet-and-greet.

200
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,340
Yes, of course. I should obey your orders.

201
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:32,790
You're here.

202
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,989
Do you mind bringing in all the packages?

203
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh, right.

204
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:42,899
I guess you'll say I'm bossing you around again.

205
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,239
Go inside. I got it.

206
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,259
(Tired, panting, darn it)

207
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,979
Here, drink this. Thank you for your help.

208
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,810
Your place is well-decorated.

209
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,180
I work at least 16 hours a day every single day without a day off,

210
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,320
so I wanted my place to look nice.

211
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,820
That's why I bought that stylish-looking water purifier.

212
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,090
I see.

213
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,089
I don't have time to go shopping,

214
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,158
so online shopping is my only hobby.

215
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,629
It helps me be in tune with the changing seasons.

216
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,758
As for underwear, I can wear it at home,

217
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,200
so I tend to buy them more often.

218
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,970
Although I normally don't wear them when I'm home.

219
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,409
(Pain Relief Patch)

220
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,249
Are you hurt or something?

221
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,850
I have a herniated disk, a herniated cervical disk,

222
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,518
shoulder blade pain, and sciatica nerve pain.

223
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,959
I also suffer from chronic migraines, reflux esophagitis,

224
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,229
De Quervain's tenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

225
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,389
The list goes on, but I'll stop here.

226
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,829
Then shouldn't you stop working?

227
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,738
Most webtoon artists suffer from such chronic conditions.

228
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,300
That tells you how difficult the job is.

229
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,840
(One Bite Cabbage)

230
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,379
(One Bite Cabbage)

231
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,789
You were assigned to me because I requested it.

232
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,859
I always ask for feedback.

233
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,988
- Why? - Mr. Kwon...

234
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,930
always took so long to give me feedback.

235
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,999
I like to have meetings at my place, but not with him.

236
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,169
You could meet him elsewhere.

237
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,170
I don't want to. It's annoying because everyone recognizes me.

238
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,109
I bet you thought I considered myself a superstar.

239
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,039
Seriously, everyone recognizes me and asks to take a picture with me.

240
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,679
Then they'd post it on their social media, tag me,

241
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,850
and write mean things about me.

242
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,819
"She thinks she's pretty. She thinks she's a superstar."

243
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,180
Blah, blah, blah.

244
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,889
I heard the other artists used the messenger to communicate with us.

245
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,330
Why did you call me here for an in-person meeting?

246
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,659
To boss me around?

247
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,460
Because I was lonely.

248
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,170
I have no friends, and I'm not close to other artists.

249
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,139
I mainly chat with my assistant online.

250
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,180
So when else would I get to have a face-to-face conversation?

251
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,609
Is this a hassle for you?

252
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,180
Then I won't ask you to come here again.

253
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,820
No.

254
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,019
If this is a part of my job, I will do my best.

255
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,040
- You don't need to see me out. - It's not that.

256
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,909
Can you take out the boxes on your way out?

257
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,279
I swear.

258
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,190
I will quit no matter what if I can't transfer to another team.

259
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,840
(3 days before the deadline for "Princess Kumiho")

260
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,939
I'm so excited.

261
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,510
I get to read Mr. Na's draft before anyone else!

262
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:29,179
My gosh. I thought the exact same thing.

263
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,089
When I was applying for the webtoon producer position,

264
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,188
I said I applied because I wanted to read webtoons...

265
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,819
before they were published.

266
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,189
- Really? - So I almost didn't get the job.

267
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:42,230
You have to make sure he meets his deadlines.

268
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,760
It won't be easy.

269
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,730
Okay.

270
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,909
- Let's eat some more. - Sure.

271
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,648
Are you keeping an eye on Mr. Na to make sure he meets the deadline?

272
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,419
Yes, I sure am!

273
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,649

Are you making sure Mr. Na is on track to meet his deadline?

276
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,260
Yes, I am.

277
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,629
You have to make sure Mr. Na meets his deadline.

278
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,270
Okay?

279

How come he hasn't sent it yet?

297
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,928
Mr. Na, the deadline is today.

298
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,628
Are you almost done?

299
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,898
I thought I should text you instead of calling because you must be busy.

He's not checking his messages.

He hasn't sent the draft for this week's episode yet?

303
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,218
- Not yet. - You're making sure...

304
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,090
that he's on track to meet his deadline, right?

305
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,118
Yes, of course. The last time I spoke with him,

306
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,629
he said he was working hard to wrap it up.

307
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,199
That's what he said, but...

308
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,669
We have to upload the episode at 11pm.

309

We've run out of his sneak peek episodes too.

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,020
She stayed at hotels in Seoul when she did this in the past.

328
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,590
I checked those hotels but couldn't find her.

329
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,129
My gosh. Where is she?

330
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,969
Do you want to know where I am now?

331
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,270
- Guess where I am. - Ji Han Seul! Where are you?

332
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:55,339
No, Mr. Na! You have to finish the episode first.

333
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,810
Tell them I'm taking a week off!

334
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,250
No, we can't do that.

335
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,218
Mr. Na, you are our main webtoon artist.

336
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,718
If you take a week off,

337
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,789
we'll have a decline in visitors.

338
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,760
Once we lose readers, they won't come back. You know that.

339
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,429
- Hey, seriously! - Mr. Na!

340
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,898
You're a pro, not an amateur.

341
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:26,369
A real pro always keeps his promises.

342
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,609
What do you even know about professionalism?

343
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,709
I do know a thing or two.

344
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,509
To keep my promise as a pro judo player,

345
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,649
I fought until the end of a match with a torn ankle ligament.

346
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,260
- Hi, guys. I'm... - No!

347
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,730
I'll go and find your girlfriend.

348
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:52,329
- What? - Right now.

349
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,698
What? How?

350
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,198
Whatever it takes.

351
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:58,969
I will find your girlfriend before this day is over.

352
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,708
Could you please upload your episode?

353
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,810
I really need to send over the file by 10pm.

354
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,050
We only have a few hours left.

355
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,979
I need to draw more than ten scenes.

356
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,079
No. You have been keeping your throne...

357
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,148
as the best professional webtoon artist...

358
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:15,888
for the past five years.

359
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:18,219
You can do this, Mr. Na.

360
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,759
I can't let you miss your deadline the first week I take over.

361
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,159
Please do this for me. I'm begging you.

362
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:28,500
Fine.

363
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,668
I'll do whatever I can with my assistants.

364
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,899
You'd better keep your promise.

365
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,138
- Pardon? - You promised to bring her back.

366
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,039
You said keeping promises is the most important to professionals.

367
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,009
Yes! I'll go and find her right now.

368
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,619
I'll do my best!

369
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,619
- We can do this! - What...

370
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,659
(Producer On Ma Eum)

371
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,408
I'll head out now.

372
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,810
Okay. Good work today. Bye.

373
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,449
We still didn't get the draft for "Princess Kumiho"?

374
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,219
We'll get it soon.

375
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,858
Ma Eum is at Mr. Na's studio.

376
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,520
Visiting him won't magically give us the draft.

377
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,459
Didn't his girlfriend leave home again?

378
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,729
- Yes. - Why does she always leave...

379
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,969
around his deadline? I'm so sick of this.

380
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,698
Tell him to break up with her already.

381
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,770
It's his personal life. We can't do anything about it.

382
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,408
Man Chul, you should go home.

383
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,709
I'll make sure the episode goes up on schedule.

384
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,179
Do I have your word?

385
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,080
Yes. I'm sure she'll do well.

386
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,090
Okay.

387
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,490
Man Chul, don't worry. Get home safely.

388
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,540
Where am I?

389
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,040
Guess where I am.

390
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,310
I'm at a hotel.

391
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,349
My hotel room overlooks the ocean!

392
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,780
- Isn't this amazing? - Hold on. Pause that.

393
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,319
Look at that, Ma Eum.

394
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,550
You still have sharp eyes.

395
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:34,059
It looks like you can see this hotel from a sashimi restaurant.

396
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,899
Gosh. I can't make out the name of the restaurant.

397
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,269
Come on. Anything? Just give us something.

398
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,770
What? No way.

399
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,540
She must already be at the sashimi restaurant.

400
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,438
I don't know which restaurant this is.

401
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,769
I can't find the sign.

402
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,139
- Many places sell grilled clams. - Wait.

403
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,179
(Haenam)

404
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,020
Hey, type in Haenam, sashimi, and grilled clams.

405
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,320
- Haenam, sashimi, and clams. - Haenam and sashimi?

406
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,359
Hold on.

407
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,760
Were you waiting for me?

408
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,760
How does it feel to meet your first deadline as a producer?

409
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,928
Pomme tends to stick to the schedule.

410
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:13,369
So it probably wasn't hard.

411
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,070
It wasn't.

412
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:19,709
Sir, I wanted to ask you about my transfer.

413
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,310
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

414
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,409
I talked to HR regarding your transfer.

415
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,050
Yes.

416
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,520
They told me I could turn down your request.

417
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,290
So I plan to do that.

418
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,959
- Pardon? - I won't let you transfer out.

419
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,629
Objectively speaking, I'm not helping the team at all.

420
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,829
I don't know anything about webtoons.

421
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,600
I just finished reading the webtoons from Neon.

422
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,939
So you know yourself well.

423
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:09,158
My gosh. Oh, my.

424
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,659
Ma Eum is having a hard time from her first deadline.

425
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,629
I can tell you treasure her a lot.

426
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,259
She tries her best at everything and gives her all to everything.

427
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,830
How could I not adore her?

428
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,600
How come you're not like her?

429
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,868
You tell me you don't know much about webtoons,

430
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,070
but you're not even making an effort.

431
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,480
You just want to transfer out.

432
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,809
I know you're smart.

433
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,648
If you just read famous comic books for an hour or two after work,

434
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,080
you'll catch up pretty fast.

435
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,550
You can read them when you have time at work too.

436
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,600
I asked HR...

437
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,469
if they sent you to my team by mistake.

438
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,368
But they told me it wasn't a mistake.

439
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,609
Then I don't see why I should send you to another team.

440
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,208
I should help you, so you can learn a thing or two.

441
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,840
That will help the company grow.

442
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,179
You should give your all to this team for the time being.

443
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,520
Then you'll see the next step.

444
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:15,448
Nothing is useless in this world.

445
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:18,419
You can even make a tasty dish with leftover side dishes.

446
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,929
I'm not some leftover side dish.

447
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,230
- Pardon? - Give it my all to this team.

448
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,830
Then I'll see my next step.

449
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,270
Are you sure?

450
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,510
What are you trying to say?

451
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,638
I heard that the Webtoon Service Team...

452
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,840
might get disbanded within a year.

453
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,990
Let's say I work hard, but what if the team gets disbanded?

454
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,990
Who will be responsible for wasting a year of my life?

455
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:56,499
Let's forget about me for a moment.

456
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,858
What about Ms. On...

457
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,669
who's giving her everything to join the company officially?

458
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,399
You keep telling me to do my best without a clear future.

459
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:05,770
I don't invest my time in a hopeless gamble.

460
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,209
My goodness. Hey.

461
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,280
Do you think our team is some hopeless gamble?

462
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:15,949
Fine.

463
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,080
Let's say you're right.

464
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,649
Just like you said, I'll get fired if I don't bring up the sales...

465
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:23,319
by the end of this year.

466
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,060
In the worst-case scenario, they might fire all the editors...

467
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:27,959
I brought over.

468
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,669
But what about you? You're not one of them.

469
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,199
You're the only employee who got officially hired by Neon.

470
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,239
Not just an employee,

471
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
but an elite employee the whole company knew about.

472
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,809
If they were to form a new webtoon team...

473
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,639
or acquire another webtoon team,

474
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:48,649
who do you think would lead the team?

475
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:50,919
It would be you.

476
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,618
The company sent you to my team because they want you to learn...

477
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,189
all the tricks up our sleeves.

478
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,889
Don't you get it?

479
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,159
Gosh. I thought you were smart, but you were only book-smart.

480
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,639
Or you're still a little chick who hasn't hatched yet.

481
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,340
Who will be responsible for your hard work?

482
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,349
If you work hard,

483
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,480
your environment is bound to change.

484
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,149
You don't know that thrill yet.

485
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,060
First off, you need to break out of that petty pride you have.

486
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,980
You're not done with the coloring yet?

487
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,549
I'm almost done. I'll send over the ones I finished first.

488
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,679
Sang Kyun, what about the background?

489
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,879
I just need to do two more scenes. I'll send them over in a minute.

490
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,949
Seriously. What's the point of working so hard?

491
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,290
Goodness. Why...

492
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,888
Hey, Ma Eum. The episode isn't ready yet?

493
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,398
Mr. Na said he would send it over on time.

494
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:12,969
Where are you right now?

495
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:15,929
I'm on my way to find his girlfriend.

496
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:17,839
- What? - He kept saying...

497
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,938
he wanted to leave to look for her.

498
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,339
So I'm going to find her on his behalf.

499
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,439
Gosh.

500
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:24,280
Is the episode not ready?

501
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,948
I'll call Mr. Na again.

502
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:28,550
Are you kidding me?

503
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,980
Why are you doing whatever you want?

504
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,919
You should've reported it to me first.

505
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,718
I'm sorry, Mr. Seok.

506
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:40,929
Hey. How are you going to find her at this hour?

507
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,229
You don't even have a car.

508
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,398
I have a scooter.

509
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,330
What? A scooter?

510
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:50,368
Hey, you're going to get yourself hurt!

511
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,698
I'll come back safe and sound!

512
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,909
I'll make sure to bring Ms. Ji back safely.

513
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,179
- Okay. Be careful on the road. - Okay. I'll be back safely.

514
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:04,080
Hello?

No. Not yet.

Hello. I'm a new employee at Neon Webtoon.

My name is Goo Jun Yeong.

- So what? - Mr. Seok couldn't reach you.

530

He asked me to check on you.

531
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,960
Gosh. I got it. I'll hurry up and send it over.

532
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,499
He said you would have to...

533
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,269
send over the file 30 minutes before the upload.

534
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,940
I got it.

535

Here.

536
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,949

I'm sick of it.

590

Don't you think it's too much?

591

I can't even remember when he last took me out on a proper date.

592

- Sorry? - I really hope it ends soon.

Call On Dumpling... I mean, please call On Ma Eum.

603
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,539
- Pardon me? - That brazen dumpling said...

604
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,548
she'd find my girlfriend and bring her back no matter what.

605
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:15,178
I kept my word and met my deadline,

606
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,650
so call and ask Dumpling if she kept her promise too.

607
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:19,650
Okay.

608
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,850

My gosh. Mr. Na is so amazing.

613
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,799
He thought of these details in such a short amount of time?

614
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,500
The quality is on another level.

615

Is it that good?

617
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,770
Yes! It's my favorite webtoon.

618
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,710
You don't want to read it? It's your boyfriend's creation.

619
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,319
That's why I don't want to read it. I get jealous.

620
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,520
Jealous? Of who?

621
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,020
San Ha or whatever her name is. Princess Kumiho.

622

can I please take you home now?

631

632
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,789
that I'd bring you home no matter what...

633
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,989
if he managed to meet his deadline.

634

Yes, I'm with her now.

Yes, we'll head back now.

641
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,350
Yes, she's nodding in agreement now.

Okay, we'll leave shortly.

643

Great. Then promise me you'll never pack up and leave like that again.

Sorry?

You said the editorial department would be dismissed otherwise.

Can we keep our current team if our performance improves?

All right. Then I'll work harder.

Although you'll laugh at me again.

675

Gosh, that isn't how I do things.

683

Had I been the type to only dream of things that I could be sure of,

You could've stayed home today.

708

Well, I was hired because I'm strong and full of energy.

709

I can't take a day off because of this.

Who said that was the only reason you were hired?

711

It was just my guess.

He said he was taking the afternoon off and left.

729
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:23,429
I guess he went to another job interview or something.

730

What? What did you hear?

731
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,310
Isn't it obvious? He has no interest in this company.

732
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,440
Maybe it's our team, not the company.

733
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,210
He probably thought he would work at the head office.

734
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:36,948
Do you think he's disappointed that he got demoted to our team?

735
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:38,519
Why is joining our team a demotion?

736
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,249
I'm saying Jun Yeong might feel it that way.

737

Gosh.

742

Yes.

Yes.

845
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,980
I'll try my best to change my environment.

846

We've been reading the flashback scenes for three weeks.

00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,948
Gosh. Isn't this a prequel to "Princess Kumiho" then?

854
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,879
They are all stuck in time.

At this point,

the plot will trace back to the birth story of Kumiho.

858

On top of that, the flashback scenes are so depressing.

859

She's so mean.

This is a long-term series.

887
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,189

You think that's everything? No!

890

There must be breaks in between. That's easier on the readers too.

that the plot development of "Princess Kumiho" is slow.

910
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,679
But isn't it true that the plot development has been slow?

911
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,448
Mr. Na said that...

912
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:21,189
we needed slow episodes for long-term projects like his.

913
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,548
He said if he only focused on the events,

914
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:23,789
the story would already have been over.

915
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,388
That's what he said.

916
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:28,560
But still. It's not cool to draw flashback scenes for three weeks.

917
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,189
If the next one is another flashback episode,

918
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,759
I won't read it for a while.

919
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,600
I'm sure other reads feel the same.

The number of views...

928
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:28,849
It went down a lot, right?

929
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,519

No.

- What? - Mr. Na...

940
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,089
has been in this industry a lot longer than me.

941
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,658
He's been uploading his story for the past five years.

942
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:10,359
So I don't think I can be as wise as him in this short time.

943
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,259
So just because he's experienced, does it mean he's always right?

944
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,778
People will stop reading his webtoon if he keeps posting...

945
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:27,679
these depressing flashback scenes.

946
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,109
It takes a very long time...

947
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,319
to bring back the readers once they leave the platform.

948

You don't know that, do you?

949
01:02:35,949 --> 01:02:39,289
But instead of pressuring Mr. Na,

950
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,988
we should give him more creative control.

951
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:43,889
But still. You can't let him get lazy!

952
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:52,399
I told you many times...

953
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,040
not to side with the artists all the time, right?

954
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,738
Then the artists will only draw the scenes they want to draw.

955
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:59,880
Not the scenes the readers want to see!

956

957
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,779
is equivalent to the pleasure of the readers.

It's the readers' pockets.

To bring more pleasures to the readers,

963
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:30,969
we must enhance the quality of the webtoon as much as we can.

964
01:03:31,069 --> 01:03:33,279
That's the duty of a producer.

965
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,420
So you still want to get paid when you're not making an effort...

966
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:42,219
and you want people to call you Producer On?

01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:44,960
Is that it?

968
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,560
You assigned a difficult artist to the rookie producer.

01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:36,270
Hey. There's Ma Eum.

981
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:52,560
Are you all right?

982
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,690
Gosh. I'm all right.

983
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,330
Everything Mr. Seok said was right.

984
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,400
I should do well.

985
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:03,229
Actually, Mr. Na wasn't a top webtoon artist...

986
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,269
in the beginning.

987
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,940
It was actually the opposite.

988
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,908
He almost quit a few times in the beginning.

989
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:14,339
And his ranking went down because his plot wasn't as interesting.

990
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,379
Mr. Seok worked together with Mr. Na...

991
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,880
to save this webtoon.

992
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,819
He worked day and night with Mr. Na like a team for the webtoon.

993
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:25,988
But when you took over, you gave him full control.

994
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,659
And he's forced to do it alone.

995
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,330
That probably upset him.

996
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:32,429
Like a team?

997
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,100
I'm going to Mr. Na's studio.

998
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:47,939
Up until now, I thought the webtoon artist...

999
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,679
was an athlete in a match...

1000
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:54,650
and I thought I, his producer, was his cheerleader in the stadium.

1001
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,839
Mr. Na, you're doing great!

1002
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,969
You can keep this pace!

1003
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:18,580
All right.

1004
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:25,850
Great!

1005
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:30,750
Great! You can do it.

1006
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:34,460
Mr. Na, you can do it!

1007
01:06:35,259 --> 01:06:36,730
We're almost there!

1008
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,869
Left, right.

1009
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:48,739
I thought...

1010
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:51,369
it was the artist's long and lonely marathon.

1011
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:54,949
Come on, let's go!

1012
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,589
It had never crossed my mind...

1013
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:08,790
that I should have been running with the artist.

1014
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,489
Actually, it turned out webtoons required us...

1015
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,420
to run the three-legged race as a team.

1016
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:44,360
All right.

1017
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,028
One, two.

1018
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:51,770
- One, two. - One, two.

1019
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:54,270
- One, two. - One, two.

1020
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:21,770
- One, two. - Yes!

1021
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:56,070
Who is this?

1022
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,570
What is it? Come on!

1023
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,780
I would like to ask you to change the episode.

1024
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,310
As if.

1025
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,009
You can't keep going like this.

1026
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,419
Are you kidding me? The episode goes online tomorrow.

1027
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,950
You want me to fix everything?

1028
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:16,820
Yes.

1029
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:23,959
You're a nutjob!

1030
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,310
Please, Mr. Na. Revise Episode 213...

1031
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:38,879
of "Princess Kumiho".

1032
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:58,730
No.

1033
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:01,459
At this moment,

1034
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,530
this is...

1035
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,900
judo.

1036
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:33,200
(Today's Webtoon)

1037
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:37,230
I believe that hard work doesn't betray us.

1038
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:39,999
You're new. You don't know anything. How dare you?

1039
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,638
"Webtoon Camp"?

1040
01:10:41,639 --> 01:10:44,009
- If this doesn't work out again... - I'll take responsibility for it.

1041
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,909
Let's aim for ippon!

1042
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,240
Your drawing skills are amazing.

1043
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:49,709
And I love your style too.

1044
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,879
There was no such thing as a hidden gem in the first place.

1045
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,219
I like you.

1046
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,449
We'll have to see if it finishes smoothly.

1047
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:59,389
I'm saying there's always something happening with this team.

1048
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:01,120
I asked you what you were doing!
