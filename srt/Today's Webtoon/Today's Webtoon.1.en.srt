Breaking news. The 33rd serial disappearance case has occurred.

The recent disappearances of young people in their 20s and 30s...

The situation seems to be getting worse.

Quit messing around. Come out already.

19
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,339

Take off the helmet, will you?

22
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,399
I wanted to see your face. It's been a while.

23
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,630
You're hurting my feelings here.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,039
I guess you're scared.

Don't let little things hurt you.

I wish to never have to see your face again.

You won't have to see me again once you're dead.

No, thank you for thinking of me. This is a great opportunity.

I'm still thinking about it.

But you've fully recovered from the injury.

I still feel...

69

- I'm trying out different things. - Okay.

Today, I'm not here to rush you to meet your deadlines,

89

so please relax and enjoy the night.

90

All right. It's been a year and a half...

since Neon Webtoon was founded.

92

It's all thanks to your amazing webtoons...

93
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:29,839
that Neon could grow this much in such a short amount of time.

100

whose creations made Neon shine even brighter...

101

in the world of webtoons this year.

The categories include Best New Artist of the Year...

103
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,998
This must've cost them quite a bit. What's gotten into them?

104
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:58,868
- The other awards include... - It is Neon, after all.

105
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:01,579
I guess they were criticized for keeping it too simple last year.

106
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,039
Those are the categories.

107

And I even won the Best New Artist Award.

130
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,470
I hope you're not offended.

131
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,999
Everyone knows that you've been drawing comics for over 30 years,

132
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,570
but you made your début as a webtoon artist this year.

133
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,609
I figured I should keep the name of the award to welcome you.

134
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,180
No, I'm elated.

135

It's my first Best New Artist Award in decades.

136
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,590
I thought I'd never get another award of this kind.

137
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,119
I prefer this to the Lifetime Achievement Award.

138

Thank you so much for saying that.

139
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,499
I want to see you make webtoons for the next 30 years.

140
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,029
- I'll do my best. - All right.

141
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,330
I'll be off, then.

142

Get home safely.

143
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:58,988
What?

144
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:00,689
What is this about? What's your problem?

145
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,519
- Come on. - What's going on?

146
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,219
- What? - What's the matter?

147
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,889
Please tell him to leave.

148
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,329
You can't do this here. Please leave.

149
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,599
Hold on. I'm not some weirdo.

150
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,300
He's a stalker.

151
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:12,930
Come here.

152
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,369
- We can talk outside. - Wait, hold on.

I told you that I wasn't some weirdo.

I'm so sorry.

159

Think a little before you act, will you?

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,470
Although I understand that you were trying to do your job.

161
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,700
I apologize.

162
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,310
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,349
- Hold on. Let me just watch this. - Come on.

166

Hey, you're the one who invited me to this party.

167
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,689
I said to come after you finished your draft.

168
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,029
We have to upload it today, but you haven't sent us your draft yet.

169
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay. I'll just stay for some food.

170
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,799
I haven't eaten anything because I had to catch up with everyone.

171
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,469
As if. You were busy staring at the girl group.

172
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,670
You got to watch their performance, so you should leave now.

173
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,039
I'll order something even more expensive and delicious...

174
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,070
and get it delivered to your door.

175
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,710
Seriously. Cut me some slack, will you?

176
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,409
Look.

177
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,819
If you fail to meet your deadline today,

178
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,789
our service will be significantly impacted.

179

From the product placement and web traffic to all the ads...

180
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,889
"Princess Kumiho" is a masterpiece that represents Neon.

181
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,600
And you are the face of Neon.

182
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,569
You said the exact same thing to the other artists...

183
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,540
when you were fawning over them.

184
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,800
I saw everything earlier.

185
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,940
- That's... - Excuse me, Mr. Na.

186
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,139
Can I get your autograph?

187
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,279
- Me? - Yes.

188
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,809
I love "Princess Kumiho". I'm a long time fan.

189
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,479
Here, look. Can I get your autograph right here?

190
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,389
Oh, my. I'm embarrassed.

191
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,590

192
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,800
- What's your name? - My name is On Ma Eum.

193
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,499
On Ma Eum? That's a nice name.

194
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,399
On Ma Eum.

195

196
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,180
I'm really enjoying "Princess Kumiho" these days.

197
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,908
I can't wait to read today's episode.

198
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,279
I'm rooting for you!

199
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,680
Well, I'll leave you two to talk.

200
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,720
- Thank you. - It's my pleasure.

201
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,460
Well...

202
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,029
I should go finish the rest. I'm leaving.

203
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:09,440
Pomme, may I take a picture with you?

204
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,509
Sorry, I'm not really comfortable.

205
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,878
Pomme! You're Pomme, right?

206
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,219
Nice, this is amazing. Wow!

207
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,220
- Oh, my. - What are you doing right now?

208
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,889

209
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,529

210

Guys, have some manners.

211

- I love you! - What are you doing?

212
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,300
What are you doing? You're not an artist, right?

213

What? Who cares?

214
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,040
I already got her on camera.

215
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:41,778
- Hand it over. - This? Here.

216
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,810
Here. Oh, too bad.

217
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,850

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,028

220
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,728
No! My phone, no!

221
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,499
- Hand over the camera. Let go! - No...

222
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,009
Get off of me. Please...

223
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,008
We've deleted all the videos he took...

224
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,580
and will make sure to delete the live broadcast as well.

225
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,249
This is exactly why I didn't want to come today.

226
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,920
Right, I'm really sorry.

227
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,350
We should've tightened on-site security.

228
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,060
Let her know that I'm grateful for her help.

229
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:54,608
Well... Thank you for everything today.

230
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,720
No problem.

231

Pomme wants to do something to express her gratitude.

232

Oh, there's no need. I was simply doing my job.

233

You said you liked webtoons.

If I say the wrong thing, they'll think I'm pressuring them.

It's going to be a mess.

327
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,830
Kids these days don't even watch baseball.

328
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,059
I asked them about their favourite sports teams. Guess their answers.

329
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,260
What did they say?

330
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,070
They named e-sports teams.

331
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,438
Well, e-sports are sports too.

332
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,039
Games aren't sports.

333
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,108
When you play sports,

334
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,438
there has to be physical contact and you have to sweat.

335
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,438
In extreme situations, you have to be out of breath...

336
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:53,050
and pant for air. That's called sports. Come on.

337
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,949

338

347

I wonder if it's judo or wrestling. It might be mixed martial arts.

00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,108
My gosh. Oh, my back!

355
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,509
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

356

- Gosh. Hey. It's judo. - Are you all right?

Gosh. Hey.

358
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,819
- Oh, no. - You did judo, right?

359
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,079
I'm sorry. That just came out. I didn't mean to...

360
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,648
It's all right. How long have you been doing judo?

361
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:43,658
Me? I did judo for 15 years.

362
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,658
I knew it. She just moved instinctively.

- Oh, right. Thank you. - That's yours.

366

I'll buy you Hanwoo.

- But that was good. - Bye.

Hey, are you all right?

370
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,168
Yes, I'm fine.

Yes. It's On Ma Eum. You do remember me.

373

It's hard to forget someone with such good judo skills.

Oh, that?

375
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,249
Wait. Are you here for the interview today?

376
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,490
Yes.

377
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,659
- It's an important day for you. - No, it's okay.

Wait.

Heads or tails?

382
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,270
You're just going to ask me without any explanation? I see.

Okay.

Don't you want to spit out your gum?

You just happened to get lucky until the final round.

413
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,128
Hey, shouldn't you be comforting me?

414
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,569
Think about it. You said that...

415
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,229
kids from prestigious schools and with amazing resumes...

416
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,000
had a hard time getting a job at this company.

417
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,209
You making it to the final round is a miracle in itself. You know?

418
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,908
Neon integrates various kinds of content...

419
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,178
and provides content,

420
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,579
tailored to its customers' needs and preferences.

421
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,509
Through this process, IP-related profits are maximized.

422
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,549
So the structure of the platform has a virtuous cycle.

423
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,849
So I considered Neon as a fast-growing company...

424
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,090
with the most potential to grow, so I decided to apply to Neon.

425
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,919
(Evaluation)

426
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,790

(Korea National Sport University)

428
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,399
I see.

429
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,429
You've been focusing only on judo so far.

430
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:21,529
Yes. That's right.

431
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,740
But she received high scores on personality and aptitude tests.

432
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,169
Ms. On. Why did you apply to our company?

433
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,678
I always listened to the music streaming service...

434
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,810
from Neon when I was going through judo training.

435
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,579
And during my breaks,

436
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,250
I de-stressed by enjoying various works from Neon.

437
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,989
Especially the webtoon from Neon. I had to spend a lot of time...

438
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,118
in the hospital due to injuries.

439
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,060
And the webtoon became a breath of fresh air for me.

440
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,999
Most of the characters from Neon's webtoon are positive...

441
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,260
and exude wholesome energy.

442
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,699
So reading the webtoon helped me get through these rough patches.

443
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:59,368
It made me want to create something that could bring joy to...

444
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:02,339
and spread good energy with other people.

445
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,810
So I decided to apply to Neon.

446
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,749
You said you often used our services.

447
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,718
So to improve our services, if you were to do growth hacking,

448
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,048
what kind of data would you use? What approach would you take?

449
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:17,088
(So he wants me to make an illegal approach?)

450
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,219
Hacking...

451
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,360
Right. I've never done hacking before.

452
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:24,229
If I have to do something like that,

453
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,770
- I'll do my best to learn... - Well...

454
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,210
I see. Okay.

455
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,469
That's not what you meant.

456
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
You never know until they make the announcement.

457
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,349
Here's a thing about you.

458
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,749
When it should've been an easy win for you, you always lost.

459
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,718
But when you were surely going to lose, you won.

460
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,819
You have a weird relationship with Lady Luck.

461
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,258
If you don't pass, just think of it as a sign...

462
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,488
that you have to continue your judo career.

463
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,759
Just do that. Okay? It will be better for you that way.

464
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,868
- Lower. Yes. Around there. - Here?

465
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,338
- Around here? - Yes.

466
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:09,039
- Horizontal or vertical? - Just put it on already. Do it.

467
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,239
- Okay. Horizontal it is. - Gosh.

468
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:13,649
Goodness.

469
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,249
Seriously. Why were you so reckless?

470
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,879
- Think about your age. - Gosh.

471
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,949
Darn it.

472
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,649
I was curious as to...

473
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,559
how fast her instincts would kick in and how intuitive she would be.

474
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,359
Here's a thing about you.

475
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,388
You tend to overly idolize people...

476
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,698
like artists and athletes.

477
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,829
No, I do not.

478
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,198
I just admire those who have surpassed their limits.

479
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:39,040
- Sure, if you say so. - How did you know she did judo?

480
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,238
- I just guessed. - Out of all the sports?

481
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,610
- Yes. - You and your luck.

482
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,250
My, good for you.

483
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,650
So?

484
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,659
Do you think she'll pass?

485
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,359
On... I mean, that judo girl.

486
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,460
I have no idea.

487
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,289
She doesn't have the qualifications...

488
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,560
that the other interviewers would like.

489
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:05,129
But I gave her a perfect score.

490
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,129
Come on. That's too subjective.

491
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,839
How could I not like her? She talked about Gingertoon.

492
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,540
What's your favourite webtoon created by Neon?

493
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,750
I'd say my favourite is "Princess Kumiho".

494
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:24,880
I've been reading it every week since its Gingertoon days.

495
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,150
The main female character, San Ha, is my role model.

496
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,519
Is there anything...

497
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,429
you regret in life?

498
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,759
Well...

499
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:39,830
Enduring too much.

500
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:44,139
I wanted to smile after winning a medal in the Olympics,

501
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,540
so I just held out and endured it all.

502
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,609
But I regret it now.

503
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,009
Is that your way of saying you won't put up with anything...

504
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,480
if you do get a job at Neon?

505
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,379
No, not at all.

506
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,149
I'll continue to be patient and persevere.

507
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,589
After all, that is what I'm best at.

508
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,020
But I don't want to wait until the end to smile.

509
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:10,830
I've learned that it's better to just smile as often as you can.

510
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,029
So I'm trying to smile more and enjoy life.

511
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:23,279
Don't you think she'll do a great job if she joins our team?

512
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,549
But at the moment,

513
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,250
we do need someone who is experienced.

514
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:36,488
You know that a rookie won't be able to fill Producer Jung's shoes.

515
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,158
Experience can be shared, and skills can be taught.

516
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,658
But not everyone has a passion.

517
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,199
That judo girl has an innate passion for the job.

518
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,869
I'd love to groom her for the job.

519
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:51,568
We don't have time for that. Let's be realistic here.

520
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,799
Be realistic?

521

525
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:44,190
I said I'd take you out for lunch.

526
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,060
The food at the cafeteria is good.

527
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:48,130
Thank you for making time for me.

528
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,400
So, what do you want to know?

529
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,170
Oh, the teams.

530
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,639
You interned in the Service Planning Team, right?

531
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,670
- Which team do you want to join? - Service Planning, of course.

532
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,710
It is the most important department in any IT company.

533
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,250
But they don't have any vacant positions now.

534
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,618
By the way, you got a stellar review. They say...

535
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,389
you work hard and have good insight for a newbie.

536
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,689
If I can't join the Service Planning Team,

which team should I apply for?

538
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
They're all great.

539
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,289
They're focusing on Search Services...

540
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,499
and want to grow the shopping team too.

541
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,059
Anything content-related would be good.

542
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,429
Music, videos, games, and so on.

543
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:29,230
There is one exception though.

544
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,339
What is it?

545
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,169
The Webtoon Service Team. Especially the editorial department.

546
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,409
That team is an outcast.

547
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,239

Yes, sir.

557

It's about time you started paying attention to your sales numbers.

It's been three years, right?

562
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,529
- Yes. - I'm sure you still remember...

the promise you made.

564

Will you be able to keep your promise at this rate?

565
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,969
I understand we got a late start,

566
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,879
but I can't let Youngtoon or Papaya beat us.

567

Thank you.

572
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,529
So you need more manpower?

573
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,698
Yes.

574

We're sending a new hire to your team.

575
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,039
One new hire isn't enough...

to cover what an experienced producer used to do.

577
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,850
It's a maternity leave replacement, isn't it?

578
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,879
Then you'll be overstaffed when that person returns.

579
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,249
I'd prefer to have more producers than fewer...

580

There you go again.

581
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,758
You haven't changed at all since your Gingertoon days.

582
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:35,659
You'd just hire people without thinking about efficiency.

583

That needs to change.

00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,139
I see. Okay.

653
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,009
That's not what you meant.

654
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,939
Let me introduce new employees who got assigned to our team.

655
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,909
This is Mr. Goo Jun Yeong. This is Ms. On Ma Eum.

656
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,488
Introduce yourselves.

657
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:36,819
Hello. I'm Goo Jun Yeong.

658
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,730
Is that it?

659
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,899
I'll work hard.

660
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,759
Okay. He'll work hard.

661
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,469
Next.

662
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:50,600
Hello. I'm On Ma Eum.

663
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,499
I'm here on a one-year contract.

664
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,838
I'll do my best to help the team, not inconvenience you.

665
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:55,908
Just like my name.

666
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:57,979
I'll work with all of my heart. Thank you.

667
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,040
Great.

668
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,549
She's eloquent too.

669
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,479
All right. As for Mr. Goo,

670
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,548
he received the highest score in this year's recruitment.

671
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:09,488
And they assigned him to our team.

672
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:11,489
As for Ms. On...

673
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,429
Hire a contract worker.

674
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,630
- For one year. - What?

675
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:21,599
Okay.

676
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,499
Seriously. I made a special request to the management.

677
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,238
She signed a special contract with us,

678
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,380
so she could work with us. She's a special employee.

679
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,379
With that said, the upcoming year will be a very important one for us.

680
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,548
As you have more experience, please help them around the office.

681
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:41,048
And as you're new, do your best to learn from them.

682
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:43,420
- Yes, sir. - Here, Mr. Goo.

683
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:45,519
Start carrying this ID card. That's for our team.

684
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,790
And Ms. On.

685
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,290
(On Ma Eum)

686
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,630
(On Ma Eum)

687
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,698
It even smells good.

688
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,239
- Are you happy? - Yes.

689
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,638
I'll do my best not to disgrace my business cards.

690
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,610
Sure. I couldn't have picked a better one.

691
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,610
Get back to work.

692
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:18,060
For the time being, you can shadow me.

693
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,659
And Mr. Goo.

694
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,759
Right. You can follow Mr. Kwon Young Bae.

695
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,400
Come with me.

696
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,540
Ms. Gi Yu Mi. Mr. Choi Du Hee.

697
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,310
Back us up when we're out of the office.

698
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:37,639
I have to go to a meeting with Mr. Jang. So start now.

699
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,739
- Okay. - Yes, sir.

700
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:41,580
(Goo Jun Yeong)

701
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:50,089
None of them went through the official recruitment process.

702
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,488
There was a platform named Gingertoon.

703
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,028
Their service was forced to close a few years ago.

704
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:55,289
They were on the verge of disintegration.

705
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,929
But Neon bought the entire webtoon platform.

706
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,698
As they joined the market late,

707
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:00,429
Papaya and Youngtoon still have the upper hand.

708
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:02,798
Despite the budget, their sales and web traffic...

709
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,199
aren't that high compared to the other teams in the company.

710
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,408
They've been here for three years.

711
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:10,270
So they must start showing results. And if they can't do that...

712
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,579
Then what about the new employee that gets assigned to that team?

713
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,049
Well, that employee is out of luck.

714
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,449
What should I do?

715
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,589
What can you do?

716
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,588
During my probationary period, I put together some data...

717
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:30,629
to improve the service at the Service Planning Team.

718
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,029
I see.

719
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,069
Then what did it say our team should to do to improve?

720
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,400
We didn't cover this team.

721
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,400
Do you even read webtoons?

722
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,440
Okay.

723
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:47,040
Then sit at your desk...

724
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:49,810
and check the webtoon on our platform.

725
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,150
Okay.

726
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,988
(Today's Webtoon)

727
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:57,219
(By genre)

728
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,159
Goodness.

729
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,000
This is amazing.

730
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,469
Enjoy your meal.

731
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:16,839
Can you eat all that?

732
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,279
Of course.

733
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,210
Good for you, Mr. Choi. She can go to restaurants with you.

734
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:26,350
You know that seniors don't have to buy juniors meals. Right?

735
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,290
Unless the company is buying, we'll split the bills.

736
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,860
Yes, sir.

737
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,230
Aren't you curious about what we do here?

738
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,330
Yes.

739
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,068
We brainstorm ideas, coordinate with webtoon artists,

740
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,399
produce webtoons,

741
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,210
hand-hold the webtoon artists, help them with their lifestyles,

742
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,779
and a lot more.

743
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,580
But as for new employees like you, you just have to do one thing well.

744
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,319
Keeping an eye on their schedule.

745
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,449
- Their schedule? - Make sure they meet the deadlines.

746
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,618
If they miss an episode,

747
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:06,719
the butterfly effect on the platform is pretty big.

748
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:11,199
I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry.

749
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,428
Gosh. Because we missed an episode, we're about to pay the penalty...

750
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:17,339
for the ads and product placement. They are throwing a huge fit.

751
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,239
Goodness.

752
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,440
The ads and sales of the episode would plummet.

753
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,179
And the readers are disappointed that we failed to keep our promise.

754
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,810
So they would jump to other platforms.

755
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,750
And once they jump, they don't come back.

756
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:33,849
Even the hate comments decrease.

757
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,448
The 1,000 hate comments turn into 100 comments.

758
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:38,059
In the end, there would be no comments.

759
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,089
(Empty)

760
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,589
When the butterfly effect gets bigger,

761
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,560
in the worst-case scenario...

762
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,129
(Assistant Editor Seok Ji Hyeong)

763
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,369
Answer your phone.

764
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,400
Gosh. Okay.

765
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,239
Yes, Mr. Seok.

766
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:58,009
A meeting with the webtoon artist?

767
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,849
She told me to ask you about the ultimate end...

768
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,409
of the butterfly effect from missing an episode.

769
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,290
Gosh. I told you guys to get comfortable.

770
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,619
That's the most awkward topic to talk about on your first day.

771
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,060
But then,

772
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,559
that is the most important aspect of our job.

773
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,600
So what is it?

774
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,230
The platform closed down.

775
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,529
What?

776
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,699
It went under.

777
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,169
What?

778
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,110
(Missing an episode means closing down the platform?)

779
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:32,580
Gosh. Oh, my.

780
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,330
Gosh.

781
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:51,959
I can't believe I'll have a meeting with Mr. Baek Eo Jin.

782
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,400
I'm so nervous!

783
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,600
I was a huge fan of "The Dream of the Dragon".

784
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,439
We're here for business, not as his fans.

785
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,440
Don't cross the line.

786
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:03,569
Ms. On. You're not a fan of webtoons anymore.

787
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:05,610
You're a webtoon producer. Got it?

788
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
Yes, sir.

789
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:09,109
Besides, we don't have meetings that often these days.

790
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,880
We mostly talk online.

791
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,089
But Mr. Baek likes to have an in-person meeting.

792
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,059
And what's it called? His previous producer...

793
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,860
is on paternity leave. So he has a new producer now.

794
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:25,130
Then am I the new producer?

795
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:29,199
No. It's me.

796
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:32,540
Right. Yes.

797
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,310
Mr. Jang told me he saw something in you.

798
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,610
I have no idea what it is that he saw in you.

799
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:47,719
Prove to me that I have been wrong.

800
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:49,489
Yes, sir.

801
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:51,719
Okay. Let's do well.

802
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:53,659
Yes, sir.

803
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,429
What is Mr. Baek like?

804
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,699
To put it simply,

805
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:06,969
he's a master.

806
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,109
Ever since his career at comic magazines,

807
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,448
he's been famous for handing over...

808
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:17,179
good quality copies weeks in advance.

809
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,259
Oh, this?

810
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,790
I've never done this.

811
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,629
You can check out all the work you did.

812
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,699
This is interesting.

813
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,429
On top of that, he's such a gentleman.

814
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:38,540
He's extremely talented as well as diligent and reliable.

815
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,139
He can have a long career like this for a reason.

816
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,810
- This way. - Okay.

817
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:03,888
(Tapping)

818
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:06,459
(Drawing)

819
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,929
Young Master Goo!

820
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,130
Lady Hee!

821
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:10,940
What? What are you doing here?

822
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,379
Come in.

823
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,020
("The Eyes of the Dragon")

824
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:56,909
I like the smell of paper and ink.

825
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,650
You can't smell that in other studios, right?

826
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,319
Everyone uses tablet PCs these days.

827
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:05,489
I tried it too. But it was quite challenging.

828
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:09,060
Instead, my assistants digitize my drawings.

829
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,529
I see.

830
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,500
Everything you see over there has been with me for a long time.

831
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,469
I had them ever since "The Eyes of the Dragon".

832
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:23,368
You worked on 1 series for over 30 years.

833
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:25,380
That's truly amazing.

834
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,778
I heard you were training to join the national team.

835
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,809
Yes.

836
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,049
That's more amazing to me.

837
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,049
Gosh, no.

838
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,249
On the day of her interview,

839
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,259
she threw Mr. Jang over her shoulder.

840
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,290
- Mr. Seok. - Gosh.

841
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,730
Of course. Mr. Jang started it.

842
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,730
Can you throw me over your shoulder when we get a chance?

843
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,770
I'm curious as to how it would feel.

844
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,369
Will it wake me up?

845
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,609
Sure. If you want, I can do it anytime.

846
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:00,139
But if we do it on the floor, it might hurt a bit.

847
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:03,508
He's joking.

848
00:58:03,509 --> 00:58:05,778
- Gosh. I'm so sorry! - No.

849
00:58:05,779 --> 00:58:08,118
No. She's a funny girl.

850
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,389
Gosh.

851
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,528
Do you have any questions for me?

852
00:58:14,529 --> 00:58:16,529
I have so many questions.

853
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,929
Well,

854
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,130
as your fan, how's your health?

855
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,969
I'm worried about your health.

856
00:58:27,469 --> 00:58:30,810
I see. Health-wise, I'm okay so far.

857
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:32,980
What worries me more is that...

858
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,610
I might run out of imagination before my body gives up on me.

859
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,749
As for my health,

860
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,549
I just have to be strong enough to pick up a pencil at my desk.

861
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:46,759
Gosh, no.

862
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,400
The ratio of the background from the file you gave me seems off.

863
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,139
No one will know.

864
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,439
Hey, you've been slacking off lately.

865
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,810
How did you figure that out?

866
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,080
I'm quitting soon.

867
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,149
What?

868
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,079
I got a call from a new platform.

869
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,750
They contacted me after reading my webtoon.

870
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:17,888
But still. You should finish this project before you quit.

871
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:21,389
Are you upset? Because I caught a break before you did?

872
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,729
We'll head out now.

873
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,529
We'll come back for another visit, sir.

874
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,298
It was a pleasure meeting you.

875
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:34,068
The pleasure was all mine.

876
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:35,639
I think I've become a bigger fan of yours.

877
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,778
I'll leave a long comment on your work from now on.

878
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,178
Please read them.

879
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:42,980
What? A comment?

880
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,179
Sure. I'll make sure to read it.

881
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,219
Please do! Okay.

882
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:59,460
Hey, you're a webtoon producer. You can't leave comments on there.

883
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:02,769
Right. I forgot about my position again.

884
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,600
And Mr. Baek doesn't read comments.

885
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,069
Why not?

886
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,369
His previous producer told him not to read them.

887
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,210
They might hurt his feelings or distract him.

888
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,278
Then what about feedback from the readers?

889
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:17,678
His producer checked them in advance...

890
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,549
and mentioned them during meetings.

891
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:21,790
I see.

892
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:25,589
What is it? Are you disappointed?

893
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,389
Gosh, no.

894
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:31,899
Well, you see, I think the biggest strength of webtoons is that...

895
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,830
webtoon artists have an outlet to communicate with the fans.

896
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:36,929
Of course, there are hate comments.

897
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,698
But if he were to read...

898
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:41,638
sincere comments from his fans and how much they love his work,

899
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:45,679
I'm sure it would encourage him a lot.

900
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,679
So giving up on that is quite a waste.

901
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:51,048
It's sad. That's all.

902
01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:55,589
I see. So you want to teach the master some new tricks?

903
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:57,219
That's arrogant of you.

904
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:59,790
I'm sorry.

905
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,900
But not everything you said was wrong.

906
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,900
- By the way, - Yes?

907
01:01:11,569 --> 01:01:15,040
- where did I park my car? - In front of Mr. Baek's house.

908
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,810
Gosh. Let's go back.

909
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,879
Shall we visit the next webtoon artist?

910
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,909
Okay.

This is our new producer, Ms. On Ma Eum.

Hello. Right.

918
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,529
- Wait. - Right.

919
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:45,699
Gosh.

- The security guard. - Yes.

01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,508
Hello. My name is On Ma Eum.

922
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,039
I look forward to working with you.

923
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,480
- Sit down. - Okay.

924
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,219
Gosh. What a small world.

925
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:03,519
Did you become a webtoon artist to see me again?

926
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,460
Almost. Yes.

927

I'm Gang Nam, Mr. Popular and Handsome.

930
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:21,100
It's an honour to meet you for the second time. I mean it.

931
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,469

How much longer?

940
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,698
Hey. I'll be done soon.

941
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:49,569
I told you not to come in during my meeting.

942
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,029
Hello.

943
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,138
Come on.

944
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:56,939
- What are you doing? - You must be cold.

945
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,509
- She's an influencer. - What?

946
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:00,809
I hear she has hundreds of thousands of followers.

947
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,250
I see. No wonder. She was so gorgeous.

948
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,250
He's the one to watch.

949
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,150
- Why? - He goes MIA as he pleases.

950
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:14,158
Whenever he does, we have to put his webtoon on hold.

951
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,189
On hold?

952
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,230
It's almost a quarterly event.

953
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,670

It was pretty heavy. But you did a fine job.

958
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:49,759
It's better to draw in the readers instead of starting with a bang.

959
01:03:50,529 --> 01:03:54,400
Placing interesting incidents in the beginning isn't a bad idea.

960

In the end, we have to put it at the readers' eye level.

961

Thank you for your advice, Mr. Baek. I'll work on it again.

01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:39,399
I'm done reading these outdated comics.

982
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,809
These old geezers should just retire.

983
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,838
(These old geezers should just retire.)

984
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,879
How much longer will he keep drawing?

985
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,809
His story expired pretty much. It's so boring.

986
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,609
His main character's face got elongated.

987
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,919
Is his chin getting longer now?

988
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,549
Do we have to listen to this old geezer even in webtoon?

989
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,949
He should have called it with "Soaring of the Dragon".

990
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,960
He shouldn't have come back.

991
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,589
Why did he come back and bring doom to the entire series?

992
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,829
Hey, this is too mean.

993
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,900
He's at the age of doom indeed.

994
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,469
Gosh.

I'll leave a long comment on your work from now on.

Please read them.

998

To those who left hate comments. Do you not have a life?

999
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,369
Hey, you're a webtoon producer. You can't leave comments on there.

1000
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:46,739
Gosh.

1001
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,810
A comment?

1002
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,040
Sure. I'll make sure to read it.

1003
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,810
Gosh. I shouldn't have told him about the comments.

01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:38,588
Gosh, Mr. Baek. Have you been well?

1011
01:07:38,589 --> 01:07:40,420
Why are you calling me this late?

1012
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:45,360
What do you mean?

1013
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,928
Wait. Sir. You know what?

1014
01:07:48,929 --> 01:07:52,369
I'll come to you right now.

1015
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,798
Let's talk in person. Wait!

1016
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,310
No! Mr. Baek!

Sir!

Let's put some on your nose.

1019
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:02,880
What is it?

1020
01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:05,350
Emergency.

1021
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:22,299
Gosh. Why isn't he answering?

1022
01:08:22,829 --> 01:08:24,770
Sir, please go as fast as you can.

1023
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,459
Mr. Choi, get up. It's an emergency.

1024
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:51,859
Get up.

1025
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,860
Gosh. Why didn't you answer your phone?

1026
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:55,230
What's this about?

1027
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,600
Wait.

1028
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,770
What's going on?

1029
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:03,570
Why did he call us to come in? What's the emergency?

1030
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,310
I couldn't understand him. He was so worked up.

1031
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,990
He stutters when he gets worked up.

1032
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,589
Hey, Seok Ji Hyeong! What on earth happened?

1033
01:09:21,219 --> 01:09:22,229
What do you mean?

1034
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,160
Mr. Baek wants to withdraw all the copies he sent us.

1035
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:27,759
What?

1036
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:33,240
He wants to take down all the episodes people paid for.

1037
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:35,969
What on earth did you tell him at his house earlier today?

(Today's Webtoon)

1039
01:10:11,839 --> 01:10:15,410
He's not going to retire like this, right?

1040
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:17,950
To someone who stopped and gave up on everything,

1041
01:10:18,749 --> 01:10:20,919
what would you have said?

1042
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:22,219
Back then,

1043
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,690
I was most grateful to my friends who were as lost as me.

1044
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:27,019
Should we stop the series now?

1045
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,428
- You jerk. - What are you doing?

1046
01:10:28,429 --> 01:10:30,888
You still haven't learned your lesson?

1047
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:32,529
"Cheer up." "Work hard."

1048
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,928
Hearing those words drains more energy.

1049
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,468
I heard that the team might cease to exist by next year.

1050
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:38,570
Then I'll resign.
