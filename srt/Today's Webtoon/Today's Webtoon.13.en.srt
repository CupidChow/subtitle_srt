(What do you do in your spare time?)

(Hyo Jin)

00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,069
(Should I try contacting him?)

17
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:16,379
(Episode 13: Walk Fast So That Your Bad Luck Can't Catch Up With You)

18
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,219
What's up with the article on takeover?

19
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,959
Surprise.

20
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:32,260
I couldn't just rely on your loyalty.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,030
It's my minimum security...

22
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,599
to keep the game going.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,239
Open it.

24
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,250
What's it like in the office?

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,620
I need evidence on why he's doing this especially in times like this.

26
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,719
Everyone's flustered.

27
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,729
They're all busy.

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,230
My surprise gift didn't go to waste.

29
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,969
If we falter now, we'll be giving Heo Kwan Young what he wants.

30
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,539
We're not dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice, are we?

31
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,079
The most important thing is making sure we don't lose any artists.

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,580
Everyone must remember that it is our number one priority.

33
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,318
Right. Not just the artists who are publishing with us at the moment.

34
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,818
Even those who are taking a hiatus or we considered signing with.

35
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,989
Contact everyone and check.

36
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,658
No. Actually, make a list of all the artists...

37
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,629
- and send it to me. - Okay.

38
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,500
The problem is that this will stir things up internally as well.

39
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,569
Perhaps, that is Director Heo's real goal.

40
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,740
Most importantly, we must gain the upper hand at the board meeting.

41
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,369
And in case we fail to negotiate with Mo Young Soo,

42
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,379
we should come up with a plan B.

43
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,819
What should we tell him?

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,990
Seriously, what should we say?

45
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,330
It was nice meeting you, Jun Yeong.

46
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,740
Guys, any ideas?

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,770
What's going on? Did you two fight?

48
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,609
Oh, no.

49
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,550
You guys aren't saying a word. Make up already.

50
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,750
No. We have nothing to fight about.

51
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,659
Oh! Hello, Mr. Oh.

52
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,258
I love his outfit today.

53
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:18,100
I love this kind of pink, cotton candy pink. I love cotton candy.

54
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,129
Hey, Ji Hyeong. Did you...

55
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,769
Ji Hyeong.

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,269
Seok Ji Hyeong.

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,610
Oh, yes.

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,279
What's wrong? Did something happen?

59
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,149
No.

60
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,649
I was just wondering if Mr. Kwon would be okay.

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,860
(Kim Young Sin, CEO of Youngtoon)

62
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,189
Answer it, and spare me a moment.

63
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,930
Okay.

64
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,439
Hello.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,160
I came here because I wanted to talk to you.

66
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,800
How did you know I'd be here?

67
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,199
You always come here when you're not in the greatest mood.

68
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,370
To grab a drink by yourself.

69
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:33,370
I thought we were done. What is there to talk about?

70
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,339
I'm here because there's something I want to hear from you.

71
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,550
Let's split up.

72
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,920
You work all day and all night.

73
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,290
I barely see you even on weekends.

74
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,649
You practically live in your artists' studios.

75
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,720
You only care about your artists.

76
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,620
Your family is practically invisible to you.

77
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,230
- Do you know what today is? - Today is Tuesday.

78
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,399
It's my birthday today!

79
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,269
I'll set you free now.

80
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,239
You love work and webtoons so much.

81
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,970
Enjoy it all you want and work yourself to death!

82
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,909
You have a risk-free job where the company protects you.

83
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,420
You're on salary. My situation is very different from yours.

84
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,040
Say what you need to say and get going.

85
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,439
First of all, I want to apologize.

86
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,310
Cut the pleasantries.

87
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,019
What is it that you want to hear?

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,490
You owe me an apology too.

89
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,860
What?

90
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,060
An apology?

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,930
What's going on? I thought I was just meeting you, Producer Choi.

92
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,939
Four heads would be better than two, you know?

93
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,610
Well, this meeting isn't important now.

94
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,209
Can I really publish my new series with Neon?

95
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,909
What if it suddenly gets shut down...

96
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,049
or bought out as soon as the first episode goes up?

97
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,479
No! No way.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,220
My gosh. Just hearing that scares me.

99
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,589
That article scared me.

100
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,389
I'm not sure if you two know this,

101
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,230
but Gingertoon closed down when I was preparing for my debut.

102
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,100
My gosh. I felt as though the world was collapsing on me.

103
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,208
I was a nobody back then. I was just a rookie artist,

104
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,540
but I managed to survive because a producer took care of me.

105
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,980
Even though he was a rookie producer too.

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,389
Anyway... So whatever happens, I won't really be worried.

107
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,420
But it still took me by surprise!

108
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,629
Why didn't you tell me?

109
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
Was I the only one who thought we were friends?

110
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,529
Mr. Oh.

111
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,769
Mr. Oh!

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,170
I couldn't tell you because I didn't want to worry you.

113
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,009
I'm sorry...

114
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,049
I truly cared for you, always.

115
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,418
We had a one-sided relationship...

116
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,820
where I had to focus all my energy on you.

117
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:41,428
Had I only thought of it as work, I wouldn't have been able to do it.

118
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,029
You see, I liked you as a person.

119
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,730
I admired you as an artist, the artist named Mo Young Soo.

120
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,200
Back then, couldn't you...

121
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,370
Couldn't you...

122
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,840
trust me a little more?

123
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,409
I trusted you!

124
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,549
I did that because I trusted you a lot more than you thought.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,389
Webtoons cannot exist without artists.

126
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,860
But a webtoon artist without a producer...

127
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,529
cannot get his work published.

128
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,340
No one can take responsibility for an artist...

129
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:32,879
whose work can't see the light of day. Even the artist himself.

130
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,450
Back then, I chose you...

131
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,519
as my bridge to the world.

132
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,190
Right, about the company...

133
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,230
I get it. Things happen.

134
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,559
I'm sure there was nothing you could do.

135
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,600
But couldn't you at least...

136
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,600
give me a heads-up?

137
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,440
Just a quick heads-up.

138
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,940
Why couldn't you do that for me?

139
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,759
Mr. Kwon.

140
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,039
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,809
I intentionally said harsh and hurtful things...

142
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,580
when I knew you truly cared about me.

143
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,379
I said you had a risk-free job because you were on salary.

144
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:20,950
I know that is not true.

145
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,460
Bye, I'm off.

146
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,808
- Here. - "Du Hee's restaurant list"?

147
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,909
Oh, this isn't the one. Hold on.

148
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,709
Here, I found it.

149
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,940
(Artist Oh Yoon's ideas)

150
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:50,878
These are the ideas we talked about when we went out...

151
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,419
for food and drinks together.

152
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,120
There were some really good ones.

153
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,220
You organized them?

154
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,460
The ideas we were throwing around as jokes?

155
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,199
Yes, of course. Whenever we brainstormed together like that,

156
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,360
I wrote down everything that came up during our conversation.

157
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,500
Producer Choi.

158
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,138
You really are amazing, sir.

159
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,000
What? "Sir"? All of a sudden?

160
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,308
In any case,

161
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:20,850
this fantasy story is my favorite. The one about high school kids.

162
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,710
- What is it about? - Oh, that one.

163
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,819
A group of high school students survives a plane crash...

164
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,449
during their field trip,

165
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,089
but they wake up in a jungle and realize that...

166
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,658
they've turned into animals.

167
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,288
I think the characters will be interesting.

168
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,990
Cute and funny.

169
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,860
But I think that's about it.

170
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,330
What if you throw in a few twists?

171
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,969
Twists?

172
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,639
A mean bully will turn into a little rabbit.

173
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,240
The weakest student who used to be bullied...

174
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,110
- will turn into a lion. - A lion?

175
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,479
It'll be fun to see the contrast...

176
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,210
between that and their positions in school.

177
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,090
Reverse the food chain. I like that.

178
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,159
What do you think, Mr. Oh?

179
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,389
It's totally...

180
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,490
It's totally my style.

181
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,529
Hop!

182
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,200
I never thought of such a reversal.

183
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,570
It's good. I like it.

184
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,298
What do you think, Producer On? Hop!

185
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,109
- Hop! - Oh. Hop!

186
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,908
Yes, I like it. I think it's great. It's a good idea.

187
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,139
- Brilliant, right? - Yes.

188
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,950
Okay. Then the bully will turn into a rabbit.

189
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,919
Hey, Jun Yeong.

190
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,450
Yes.

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,158
You know, I saw you and Director Heo Kwan Young earlier.

192
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,830
What was that about?

193
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,600
Oh, that. I asked him about the article.

194
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,429
He said it was incorrect. That was that.

195
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,940
"That was that"? It's a serious matter to us, is it not?

196
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,079
But it's not like I can interrogate him about it. He's an executive.

197
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,980
That's true, but it's about the team.

198
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,620
Do you still think...

199
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,289
you're on your own and that the team's issues are separate?

200
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,690
I can't think like that?

201
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,200
When you said...

202
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,600
there wouldn't be a place for me on the team,

203
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,100
I thought you were looking out for me.

204
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,769
But now, I don't know what you're really thinking.

205
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,580
Did you ever...

206
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,679
truly care about the team, even just once?

207
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,719
Sorry. We kept you waiting long, didn't we?

208
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
No, it's fine.

209
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,258
Thanks for everything, guys.

210
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:52,899
I know you have a lot going on, but you made the time to meet with me.

211
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,970
- My gosh, anytime. - Thank you for coming.

212
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,599
Producer Choi, let's meet at my studio around 8pm.

213
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,840
- We'll go over everything again. - Okay.

214
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,970
- Let's do a good job this time. - Yes, for sure.

215
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,909
Oh...

216
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,418
Hello.

217
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:17,919
Good to see you. Take a seat.

218
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,090
Why did you get in touch with me out of the blue?

219
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,029
I figured...

220
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,000
you'd probably had a change of heart by now.

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,169
Are you still not interested in joining our company?

222
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,870
Well...

223
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:41,279
Perhaps, recruiting me wasn't what you were really after.

224
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,080
Was shaking up Neon Webtoon your goal from the get-go?

225
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,289
Either way, choosing us will only do you good.

226
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,990
I read the article this morning.

227
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,529
Yes, I read it.

228
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,970
It's inspiring to see you doing your best for your company.

229
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,500
I will do my best too...

230
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,139
and fight fiercely against Youngtoon.

231
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,240
But, Ms. Kim,

232
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,779
knowing that you are the CEO of Youngtoon,

233
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,879
I expect you to play fair and square.

234
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,889
We will do so as well.

235
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,879
- Mr. Kwon. - Yes.

236
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,549
He said it'd be hard.

237
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,759
He can't take such a risk for the sake of his employees.

238
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,430
Okay, thank you for talking to him. It mustn't have been easy.

239
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,269
The conversation was long overdue. I'm glad I did it.

240
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,069
Well, in any case... We need a new strategy now.

241
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,409
I'm home.

242
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,109
Oh, you're late.

243
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,279
Where did Mom and Dad go?

244
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,219
It's their date night. They went to catch a late-night screening.

245
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,089
My gosh, they're still so in love.

246
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,720
We should step up our game too.

247
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,630
What's wrong? Did something happen?

248
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,369
No, I just feel a little down.

249
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,410
I thought I knew someone very well.

250
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,210
Turns out, I was wrong.

251
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,279
Who are you talking about?

252
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,379
Just someone.

253
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,849
Come on.

254
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,130
Hey, go away! What's with you?

255
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,660
Gosh, you're annoying me. You're so annoying!

256
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,769
(All Recordings)

257
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,970
I met Director Heo briefly earlier in the day.

258
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,210
He didn't admit that he was the one behind the article.

259
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,279
I thought we'd be able to get him this time.

260
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,480
Jun Yeong, I told you to stop.

261
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,019
It was nice meeting you, Jun Yeong.

262
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,359
What's up? What did you want to talk to me about?

263
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,789
I've been...

264
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,160
sending the team's data and reports...

265
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,029
to Director Heo.

266
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,440
Mr. Goo. Did you email our team's data through your personal email?

267
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:42,319
Then violating the security protocols wasn't a mistake.

268
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,190
But...

269
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,190
what is the reason you're telling me this now?

270
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,359
I think Director Heo...

271
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,430
has a cushy relationship with Youngtoon.

272
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,509
I got involved to find out what he's really after.

273
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,039
But if I did anything rash now,

274
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,680
there could be bigger problems for the team.

275
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,720
I want to keep things the way they are so I can gather evidence.

276
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,019
(All Recordings)

277
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,930
Seriously, why are you doing all this?

278
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,740
One of the team's main projects fell through.

279
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,449
They were busy dealing with a lot of things,

280
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,979
so the other projects have been put on hold too.

281
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,880
It's only a matter of time before they fall apart.

282
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,519
Why must you go this far?

283
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,960
Why? Do you think I might have a hidden agenda?

284
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,999
What happened with Gingertoon...

285
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,599
and now this with the webtoon team. Is this really necessary?

286
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,269
I see that you have some funny ideas.

287
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,849
All I do is worry about the company, 24-7.

288
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,578
When I decide to do something, it's because...

289
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,319
it's more beneficial to the company.

290
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,630
(New Recording)

291
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,940
What is the problem?

292
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,779
What's wrong?

293
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,150
Oh. Mr. Na sent a new file,

294
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,289
and something's not right.

295
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,119
What's the problem?

296
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,930
The problem is that I can't figure out what's wrong.

297
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,558
It looks a little empty, but I can't figure out why.

298
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,859
I see. Let me have a look.

299
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,500
(Tae Jun, you must leave at once.)

300
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,440
Oh, I see. He's using fewer colors.

301
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:19,109
Yes, you're right! How did you figure it out right away...

302
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,380
Oh...

303
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,450
Sorry, I went up too close.

304
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,258
Did something happen?

305
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,359
No.

306
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:36,989
Let's have a meeting.

307
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,630
- Come to the meeting room. - Okay.

308
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,900
It's a stressful situation,

309
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,900
but let's all cheer up and get started.

310
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,838
As you all know, we failed to persuade Mo Young Soo.

311
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,839
So the situation really isn't looking good now.

312
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,179
Make sure you pay close attention to the artists you manage.

313
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,179
Ms. Gi, what's the situation now? How's it going?

314
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,048
We've been getting less inquiries from paid subscribers...

315
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,549
since they corrected the article.

316
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,490
There are less comments from people worried about us ending our service.

317
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,818
If everything gets uploaded as per our normal schedule this week,

318
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,389
they'll calm down.

319
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,690
Thank goodness.

320
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,429
Ms. Gi, thank you for your hard work...

321
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,598
Sorry. Artist Yeo Tae Goo is calling.

322
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,929
Okay, you should answer it.

323
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,368
Hey, pick up right away when Yeo Tae Goo calls.

324
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,669
- Hello? - Answer right away.

325
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,268
Artists' calls are very important. Producer Choi, then can you...

326
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,440
I guess he has to take a call too.

327
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,779
It must be an important call from one of the artists, right?

328
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,518
Who else? Right, Na Gang Nam. What's going on with him?

329
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,519
He's busy, so we couldn't have another in-person meeting with him.

330
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,149
But he's been sending all the files for "Princess Kumiho" on time.

331
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,720
Maybe he's just giving excuses to sign with Youngtoon.

332
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,758
I overheard you guys talking about...

333
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,799
how the problem is that you can't figure out what's wrong.

334
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,399
Right.

335
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,569
You have to pay close attention to Na Gang Nam.

336
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,169
Otherwise, we'll have a big problem.

337
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,739
Youngtoon is vying for a chance to steal him.

338
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,279
If we let things slip, we'll lose him.

339
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,778
Right. I'll stay focused and do my best.

340
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,949
Good. You must know what it's like since you used to be an athlete.

341
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,420
You never know what could happen until the game is really over.

342
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,889
Totally.

343
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,189
How's everything coming along with the adaptation of "Weapon Feeb"?

344
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,328
I'm supposed to meet with the production company soon.

345
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,258
I'll meet Director Shin Jae Won that day as well.

346
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,568
I should go with you, but I can't because of what's going on.

347
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,529
Don't worry. Everyone is so busy.

348
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,200
Will you be all right alone?

349
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,838
Since it's a big project, how about you go with Jun Yeong?

350
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,710
No, it's okay. I'll be fine alone.

351
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,518
The budget will be at least 40 million dollars?

352
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,420
Yes. It's only possible because Director Shin will be directing it.

353
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,489
He's very picky when it comes to scripts.

354
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,129
But he was really impressed with "Weapon Feeb."

355
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,660
This was his idea.

356
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,799
He can be a little blunt at times, but he's very open and honest.

357
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,339
- He's waiting inside. - Okay.

358
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,569
Just relax.

359
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:02,609
Okay.

360
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,480
Director Shin, they're here.

361
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,150
Hello, I'm Shin Jae Won.

362
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,819
I'm Sin Dae Lyug.

363
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,559
I'm Producer On Ma Eum from Neon Webtoon.

364
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,358
I'm honored to meet you.

365
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,700
It's nice to meet you, Producer On Ma Eum.

366
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,569
Let's sit down.

367
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:45,318
Mr. Sin, I heard you wanted Producer On...

368
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,349
present at this meeting.

369
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,319
The two of you must trust each other a lot.

370
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,029
Yes.

371
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,429
To me, Producer On is like the Almighty...

372
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,230
We always have a lot of fun when we work together.

373
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,739
It's nice to see.

374
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,869
Thank you.

375
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,469
I think "Weapon Feeb"...

376
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,240
is an amazing masterpiece.

377
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,809
And I'm confident that I can turn it into the best drama.

378
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,450
But there's one thing that worries me.

379
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,420
What happens after that?

380
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,819
You've sketched out the story that comes after that, right?

381
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,768
Yes. It's a story I've been growing in my head for years.

382
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,170
Is that right?

383
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,140
Sick people who are haunted by the fear of death.

384
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,809
And those who care for the ill are exhausted.

385
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,980
They give off some kind of dark energy,

386
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:52,980
and I could see it.

387
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,519
You have a highly imaginative mind.

388
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,190
I didn't come up with it based on my imagination.

389
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:10,430
When I was young, my grandfather was hospitalized for a long time.

390
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,769
I stayed at the hospital to take care of him.

391
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,440
After he passed away,

392
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,440
I picked up a job at the hospital where I had to transport patients.

393
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,509
That was when I got the ideas for the story.

394
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,619
I can see why Producer On...

395
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:33,519
had to come with you today.

396
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,400
Writers' unique quirks help them write better.

397
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,139
To me, "Weapon Feeb" was...

398
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,039
all about what you lack, and I really liked that.

399
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,740
What I lack?

400
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,690
A story about a boy who thought of Feeb as his mother.

401
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,490
I bet that's your personal experience.

402
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,970
I'm sure people can instinctively feel it.

403
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,210
That's why the fear grips them so viscerally.

404
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:48,469
He feels attached to the story and gets immersed in it.

405
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,799
That's probably why you felt that way.

406
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:51,630
Right, Mr. Sin?

407
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,539
What's wrong, Mr. Sin?

408
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,279
Mr. Sin.

409
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,720
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,650
Mr. Sin!

411
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,319
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

412
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,529
Sorry. Mr. Sin!

413
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,180
What an idiot!

414
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,089
Did Mr. Sin leave?

415
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,930
It looks like we should come back another time. I'm sorry.

416
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,549
They keep avoiding each other. How about after that?

417
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,720
Producer Goo.

418
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,289
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,390
Could you say that again?

420
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,059
You know, the love line.

421
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,129
What if...

422
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,769
something happens here that causes them to drift apart?

423
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
No, I don't want that.

424
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,539
- Sorry? - Sorry?

425
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:37,710
Oh, the readers will be sad if they break up.

426
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,079
You must be under a lot of stress.

427
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,750
Things must be pretty tense at Neon these days.

428
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,960
No, it's fine. We'll do our best so you won't have to worry.

429
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:00,029
As they say, adversity makes you stronger.

430
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,368
Whether it's work or your relationship, good things come...

431
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,829
once you overcome a hurdle.

432
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,969
With that said,

433
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,909
if they cry their hearts out at this point in the story,

434
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,309
their love will probably deepen. Don't you think so?

435
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,480
(Breakup)

436
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,630
You crazy punk! Do you want to die?

437
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,429
Do you still think you're on your own and that...

438
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,940
the team's issues are separate?

439
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,569
I can't think like that?

440
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,809
- All right. Get home safely. - You too.

441
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,838
- Thank you for everything. - No problem. Cheer up.

442
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,980
- See you! - See you.

443
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,940
What's with that heavy sigh?

444
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,480
Mr. Seok.

445
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,910
Are things not going well?

446
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,420
What is it? What's the problem?

447
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,789
Everything.

448
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,099
Everything is such a mess now.

449
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,039
- Oh, it's okay. - Just stay still.

450
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,440
I thought we were running together.

451
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,409
Why are you trying to run solo as if you're carrying...

452
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,220
all the weight of the world on your shoulders?

453
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:07,119
Why?

454
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,430
Can I really...

455
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,769
run hand in hand with Mr. Sin? I'm not sure anymore.

456
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,240
When you first met him,

457
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,910
you knew it wouldn't be easy to work with him but still trusted him.

458
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,140
So why are you feeling this way all of a sudden?

459
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:30,250
I'm scared.

460
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,750
Before he met me,

461
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,049
he was just an awkward person.

462
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,589
But...

463
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,490
But what? What about now?

464
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:49,700
I feel like he's in a more precarious situation now.

465
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,539
To the point that I'm not sure if I can handle it anymore.

466
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,008
What if I was too obsessed with helping him progress...

467
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,210
and made his life more precarious?

468
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,379
Could that be possible?

469
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,179
Am I really the kind of producer...

470
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,719
that Sin Dae Lyug needs?

471
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,900
(Han Seul, Na Gang Nam)

472
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,530
Hello?

473
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,510
What?

474
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,510
(Contract)

475
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,710
You have no problems with the contract, do you?

476
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,879
Is there something you don't like?

477
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,380
No. Hold on.

478
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,259
- You're here. - Has he signed yet?

479
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,530
- Not yet. Hurry! - Mr. Na!

480
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,929
Stop.

481
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,939
Why are the two of you here?

482
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Mr. Na.

483
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,098
I really have no idea what's going on.

484
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,239
I called them.

485
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,940
Once you sign a contract for your new work, you'll get busier.

486
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,880
Han Seul, it's not decided yet.

487
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:12,678
This is cheating.

488
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,590
I thought there were no methods off the table in this game.

489
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,649
Neon was just rejected by Mo Young Soo.

490
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,218
I'm sorry, but I don't think we were rejected...

491
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,288
because the article was incorrect.

492
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,989
Really? Then you can be rejected now.

493
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,129
Let's sign the contract, Mr. Na.

494
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,598
What's wrong with all of you? Did you make plans to fight here?

495
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,500
You agreed to work with us on publishing "Cold-blooded."

496
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:39,238
Mr. Na! This isn't a matter to be decided like this.

497
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,550
He's right. We worked together well, didn't we?

498
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,379
Wait a minute!

499
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,618
Mr. Na, how long will you be tied down due to loyalty?

500
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,789
Why don't you start anew with Youngtoon?

501
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,260
Shoot.

502
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,670
Oh, gosh.

503
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,909
- Han Seul. - Mr. Na!

504
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,909
Han Seul's pregnant!

505
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,550
Han Seul is pregnant now.

506
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,348
I'm not going to make more work for myself now.

507
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:28,519
I won't make work for myself, either at Neon or Youngtoon.

508
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,158
Do you mean it?

509
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,570
Yes, I'm serious.

510
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,539
I'm always deceived by you.

511
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,539
Even when I know I'm being deceived,

512
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,940
I can't help falling for it every time.

513
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,579
That's not true anymore.

514
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,780
You have a baby now.

515
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,480
It hurts.

516
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,449
- A baby. - A baby.

517
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:00,218
It's a baby.

518
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,659
Don't cry.

519
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,389
Don't be deceived anymore, okay?

520
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,659
- Wow. - Gosh.

521
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,500
Unbelievable.

522
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,340
So what happens now?

523
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,139
"Cold-blooded" is on hold for now.

524
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,150
The artist seems to regret that too.

525
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,479
I wish Artist Na could use a clone...

526
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,519
and work on both pieces.

527
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,690
I didn't know he would really end up with a child...

528
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,360
and be unable to work.

529
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,130
My goodness.

530
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:41,860
At least we won't have to chase after his girlfriend anymore.

531
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,170
What about Artist Sin Dae Lyug?

532
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,369
Well,

533
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,739
something unexpected came up during our meeting,

534
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,670
so we need to resolve that first.

535
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,650
Nothing's working out easily.

536
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,218
So have all the problems come up now?

537
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,719
Does anyone else have problems left that are going to turn up?

538
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,610
(Seungjin Medical Center)

539
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,659
(Seungjin Medical Center)

540
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:04,710
(Diagnosis: Lumbar degenerative kyphosis)

541
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,780
Yes, it's all right.

542
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:14,019
I think it's best to stop now.

543
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,659
I'm sure Ma Eum noticed too.

544
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,570
Even for telling the truth,

545
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,840
it's all about timing.

546
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,440
I think that timing is now.

547
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,269
Why must you go this far?

548
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,940
I want to be like you, Mr. Seok.

549
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,570
Really?

550
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,909
I'm in charge of Mr. Na Gang Nam?

551
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,579
- Skin? - No, "Feeb."

552
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,219
- Feeb? - Yes.

553
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,760
Here we go.

554
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,889
Wait! Okay.

555
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,760
Ta-da! You're coming back.

556
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,009
I'll do better! Can you please stay?

557
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,280
My gosh...

558
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:20,718
I'm not going anywhere.

559
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,348
Yes, don't leave us.

560
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,219
Yes, I'm not leaving.

561
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,489
Mr. Seok.

562
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:32,800
How do you want a new artist you're in charge of to grow?

563
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:37,198
Regardless of whether his producer or his platform changes,

564
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,969
I want them to forge their own path forward...

565
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,340
using their own strength.

566
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,738
When Mr. Jang told me to do that as homework,

567
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:50,079
I only wrote like two sentences.

568
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,388
Are you going somewhere?

569
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:03,489
I'm going out for work.

570
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,059
- See you later. - See you.

571
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,199
I'm here, Mr. Baek.

572
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,239
Oh, hi.

573
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,480
(Oral medication)

574
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,579
I hear Neon is going through some troubles.

575
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,690
I'm sorry.

576
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,889
As a contracted artist, I'm responsible for some of that.

577
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:10,030
That's not true.

578
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,630
From the time you started "The Dream of the Dragon" until now,

579
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,730
you've always been our greatest strength.

580
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,300
We're the ones who are lacking.

581
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,809
We're just glad that you've been by our side so consistently...

582
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,340
without ever wavering.

583
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,510
So we're very reassured by you.

584
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,968
I'm home.

585
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,000
Ma Eum.

586
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,940
Jun Yeong.

587
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,710
What are you doing here?

588
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:06,150
I have something to say.

589
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,799
I'm home.

590
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,900
Ma Eum.

591
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,840
Jun Yeong.

592
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,610
What are you doing here?

593
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:33,110
I have something to say.

594
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:37,880
Hey, Ma Eum.

595
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,519
Hey! You...

596
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,719
Where am I?

597
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:48,889
How did you get in here?

598
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,889
Gosh. I would like to know that too.

599
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,829
It's you, right? You punk!

600
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,169
- Hey! - What's wrong?

601
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,939
You punk, how dare you come back?

602
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,199
Dad, what are you doing?

603
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,809
Hey, how long have you been tailing my daughter?

604
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,179
That time! That's why you hid in here!

605
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:12,980
I'm not that kind of person.

606
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,590
- How dare you... You punk! - Stop, Dad!

607
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,889
He's a work colleague.

608
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:20,619
What?

609
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,719
You're here.

610
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,159
I heard you were here.

611
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:29,570
But what are you all doing here?

612
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:33,400
Let's go in and eat.

613
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:35,440
So randomly?

614
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,340
Surprise.

615
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,249
This is what we always eat. I just added a spoon for you.

616
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,349
Go ahead and eat.

617
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,150
We need to apologize formally.

618
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:54,159
I'm sorry.

619
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,690
That's all right. It was easy to misread the situation, Father.

620
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,029
"Father?"

621
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,159
What are you then? Mother?

622
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,530
What brings you here today?

623
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,570
The two of you must be very close. Am I right?

624
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,480
Are you two dating?

625
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,449
Are you okay?

626
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,820
No, Dad, that's not it. What are you saying?

627
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,449
Why would you deny it so strongly?

628
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,159
You never know what will happen.

629
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,090
Exactly.

630
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,859
What do you think about my sister?

631
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,360
Everyone, stop saying weird things and just eat.

632
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,570
I like Ma Eum very much.

633
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,769
You just confessed your love, right?

634
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,309
She's a friend I trust.

635
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,649
A friend?

636
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,880
Just a friend?

637
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,649
Yes, just a friend.

638
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,960
Why are you talking like that? You scared me.

639
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,860
Just eat. Gosh.

640
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,529
No. Stop. Why are you taking that out?

641
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,698
- Oh, my. - Nu Ri, bring glasses.

642
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:15,139
- Mom, stop. - Bring the glasses.

643
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,169
Jun Yeong can't drink a drop.

644
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,109
He can't drink.

645
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,339
He can't even have a glass.

646
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,808
That's great.

647
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,549
- He can't drink either! - The four of us can drink.

648
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,109
- Don't forget Dad's glass. - Wait.

649
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,319
No, I don't need my glass.

650
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,550
- Here's yours, Dad. - No!

651
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,218
It's all right. We don't need any.

652
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:35,090
It's all right. No.

653
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,400
You can sit.

654
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,139
That was uncomfortable, right?

655
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,070
No, I came by unannounced,

656
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,939
so I'm happy they welcomed me.

657
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,079
I got to resolve his misunderstanding too.

658
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,880
So what were you trying to say earlier?

659
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,179
Some things were misunderstood,

660
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,590
and some things need to be understood.

661
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,789
The reason I was close with Director Heo Kwan Young...

662
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,929
is that I needed materials for our team.

663
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,800
What?

664
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,769
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

665
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,670
If you'd known, you would've tried to stop me.

666
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:23,969
On Ma Eum loves to protect me.

667
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,579
Are you seriously joking around at a time like this?

668
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,110
Why did you do something so reckless? You're not like that.

669
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,079
Because of you.

670
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,889
It's thanks to you that I was able to stay in the team,

671
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,960
and I wanted to protect the team for your sake.

672
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,159
This is what I wanted to tell you before.

673
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:48,929
A confession about the things I've done...

674
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,670
and the reason behind them.

675
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,779
What are you all doing?

676
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,919
Dad pushed us. Why would you push us?

677
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,549
- Dad, you need to lose weight. - Get out!

678
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,590
Okay.

679
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:16,190
- All right, then. - Have a great time!

680
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,860
My family's a little weird.

681
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,489
(Stop it. I don't like this!)

682
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,360
I think we need to look into the relationship...

683
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,000
between Youngtoon and Heo Kwan Young.

684
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,429
Director Heo...

685
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,138
When we were at Gingertoon,

686
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:11,369
he sold us off, saying it was inefficient to grow our team.

687
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,980
- The biggest candidate then... - It was Youngtoon.

688
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,550
But Ms. Yoon Tae Hee stepped in and made that moot.

689
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,349
We were about to go to Youngtoon, but Neon offered a better deal.

690
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,420
Now Neon is looking into acquiring Youngtoon.

691
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,019
It's too strange to say it's a coincidence.

692
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,719
He's been working to serve the interests...

693
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,030
of one particular company for such a long time.

694
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,590
Exactly.

695
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:36,500
It seemed like they had a special relationship.

696
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,530
I tried to find concrete proof, but I couldn't.

697
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,210
But what are you saying? What were you trying to find?

698
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,879
When Director Heo asked him...

699
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,219
to turn over our materials to him,

700
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,219
Producer Goo acted...

701
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,150
as a double agent and tried to find out their true relationship.

702
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,690
What?

703
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,289
What were you going to do if you got found out?

704
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,658
You knew about this, but you didn't try to stop him?

705
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:08,698
How could you put him in such a dangerous situation?

706
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:11,230
No, I was going at it by myself,

707
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,299
and it was Mr. Seok. who helped me later on.

708
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,300
No.

709
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,139
I'm sorry I didn't tell you right away.

710
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,939
What if we made it public?

711
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,880
Then we can't protect you.

712
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,050
I'm okay with it.

713
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,349
It's not okay.

714
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:34,590
There's no guarantee that we can even damage him by going public.

715
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,190
Proof in mergers and acquisitions is a reasoning battle.

716
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:40,400
It won't be easy to prove that he has a personal stake in it.

717
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,098
Since we've learned of his goal,

718
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:47,400
we can focus on fighting him.

719
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,139
That's why...

720
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:54,940
I thought about alternatives to Mo Young Soo's offer.

721
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:56,780
Alternatives?

722
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,880
Can we make Na Gang Nam the second Mo Young Soo?

723
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,889
You mean, create a company that can publish several of his works?

724
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,590
Like cloning.

725
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,260
What Producer On said was quite inspiring.

726
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,629
If he starts out as a Neon subsidiary,

727
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,530
I think even the higher ups can't make light of this offer.

728
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:22,099
Make Na Gang Nam into Neon's Mo Young Soo.

729
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,309
As a subsidiary.

730
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,710
I think this is the best option you have at this time.

731
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,549
You have many items,

732
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,119
but you always worried about how to finish them.

733
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:41,260
You only have one body, and only so many hours to draw.

734
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,599
Let's see.

735
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,800
Look! These must be socks.

736
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:53,670
They're so cute, aren't they?

737
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,300
That's true, but...

738
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,239
The time you need to prepare for your baby's birth,

739
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:01,839
and the time you need to birth your works into this world,

740
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,179
they're both important to you.

741
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,880
You don't have to give up either one of them.

742
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:10,750
Mr. Na.

743
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:13,889
No, Gang Nam.

744
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:17,329
You can set up a webtoon company,

745
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,729
and you can complete the items you've created...

746
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,760
with other webtoon artists.

747
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:24,969
We'll help you do that.

748
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:29,599
But if you want me to set it up as a Neon subsidiary,

749
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:32,909
you want me to stay with you until the bitter end.

750
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,750
I don't think this is a bad offer for you at all.

751
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:54,929
I'm anxious.

752
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,929
We need Mr. Na,

753
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,269
but there's no reason for him to choose Neon.

754
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,409
That's why we need to come up with those reasons for him.

755
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,309
But at least he showed interest.

756
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,349
Did you talk with Sin Dae Lyug?

757
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,949
Not yet.

758
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,118
We're going to meet today.

759
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:22,960
I see. This is your first meeting after that incident, right?

760
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:25,329
Yes.

761
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,960
Try to talk it out with him.

762
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,500
You've always gotten along with him until now.

763
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:36,539
All right.

764
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,650
Have you eaten?

765
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:59,429
Why aren't you asking me about that day?

766
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:15,739
Some wounds...

767
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,380
are hard to bring up.

768
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:23,380
But if you cover up a wound just because it hurts,

769
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:25,750
it doesn't always heal properly.

770
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,489
It could get infected.

771
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,159
I thought it might be hard to explain in words.

772
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,468
(Crash!)

773
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:14,900
(Why are you crying? You didn't do anything good.)

774
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,139
(Crash!)

775
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,610
No! Stop!

776
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,820
Honey!

777
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,359
(Whirring, thud!)

778
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,960
My life was a series of misfortunes, one after another.

779
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,869
(Thud!)

780
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,170
(Thud!)

781
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:58,010
(Creaking)

782
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,550
(Tip tap)

783
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:16,360
(Tip tap)

784
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,779
(Stay still!)

785
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,150
(Stop it. I don't like this!)

786
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,159
Even my mother left me,

787
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,099
and my relatives took me in...

788
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,429
to make me take care of my grandfather.

789
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:53,900
Mom!

790
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:56,269
Mom!

791
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,940
Don't leave, Mom!

792
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:01,809
Mom!

793
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:11,989
(Whirring)

794
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,630
Once my grandfather died,

795
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,630
I was alone.

796
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:31,510
(Whirring)

797
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:45,750
(Please help me.)

798
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,659
When I met you, I thought...

799
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:56,130
that my childhood scars and misfortunes...

800
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,869
brought me happiness today.

801
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,469
I'm a mess,

802
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,840
but please help me...

803
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:12,980
so I don't become more broken.

804
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,250
If you're beside me,

805
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,550
I feel like I can run away...

806
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,219
from misfortune and unhappiness.

807
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:31,670
(Please help me.)

808
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,420
Mr. Sin,

809
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:52,550
I'm not the Almighty.

810
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,760
I do not have the authority...

811
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,059
nor the confidence to save anyone.

812
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:01,000
Sometimes...

813
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,929
I find it hard to take care of just myself.

814
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,639
Even so,

815
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,980
I want to help you.

816
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,590
I will help you.

817
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,920
With all the power that a single human being may have.

818
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,800
I did that from the start, and I'll continue doing so.

819
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,469
Thank you for reaching out to me.

820
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,730
Will I be able to do well?

821
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:11,400
It's okay if you don't.

822
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:15,239
You just have to do it.

823
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,550
You got this.

824
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,949
I got this.

825
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:43,829
Thank you.

826
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:57,210
I'm sorry...

827
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,219
for leaving so abruptly...

828
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:04,449
that day.

829
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:15,400
It's no problem. I was being rude that day.

830
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,730
If either of you was hurt by me that day,

831
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,739
please find it in your hearts to let it go,

832
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:24,340
so we can work together well from now on.

833

Here.

834
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,320
Mr. Sin, you can sit down.

835
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:42,218
- If we work together again... - In the contract,

836
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:45,259
I saw that Neon will pay for damages that may occur.

837
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,929
Is that all right?

838
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:49,529
That's just a general clause,

839
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,900
so you don't have to worry.

840
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,699
It's been reviewed by the Neon legal team.

841
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:56,669
- All right. - To be honest,

842
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,169
I have some questions...

843
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,179
about your philosophical universe.

844
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:07,050
If we look at this work from another perspective...

845
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,989
- Then I'll see you later. - All right.

846
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,559
What did the director say earlier?

847
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,300
That was something like...

848
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:24,469
"Let's work hard together!"

849
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,400
I see.

850
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,099

Geez, what was that?

01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,480
Read it.

855

What do you think you're doing?

856
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,389
Don't mess with my teammate. Okay?

857
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,599
Is he insane?

858
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:11,550
- Mr. Jang. - Yes, Producer On?

859
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,780
- Is it all done? - Yes.

No problem. I'll be taking off now.

because of the trauma you had in your past?

We should just get rid of the webtoon team.

What happened?

884

So you went to the police station because of Mr. Sin.

Did you bury this on purpose?
