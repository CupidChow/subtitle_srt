(Today's Webtoon)

10
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,369
You applied to that study abroad program a while back.

11
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,738
Didn't they announce the results today?

12
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:08,969
What happened?

13
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,680
I got in, but I'm not going.

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,979
Why not? You said it was an amazing opportunity.

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,349
Aren't they fully covering the tuition fees?

16
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,059
I tried adding up all the living expenses. I don't think it'll work.

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,959
Hey, we're freeloading off Uncle and his family now,

18
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,429
but I have money.

19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,890
You have money? As if.

20
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,670
I can always earn money.

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,829
You should study while you still can, Jun Yeong.

22
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,340
What about you?

23
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,109
When will you go back to school?

24
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,979
Because of me, you haven't graduated and have to keep working.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,709
When you become successful, I'll make you pay me back with interest.

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,549
I'll get really mad at you if you give up on this.

27
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,189
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,560
Why are you sorry?

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,590
Why are you so gloomy? This is great news.

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,959
Cheer up.

31
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,629
Okay.

32
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,799
Come on. We can do this!

33
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,668
- We can do this. - We got this!

34
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,770
We got this!

35
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,370
Even when I last saw my sister at the airport,

36
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,979
I told her to keep it up...

37
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,580
when she was already doing her very best.

40
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,430
Mr. Seok.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,759
I want to ask you something.

42
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,930
Sure, what is it?

43
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,669
Do you know this person?

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,849
How do you know Ae Ri?

45
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,789
Jun Yeong! Wait.

46
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,090
How do you know that man?

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,229
It was him. It was his fault that Ae Ri died.

48
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,680
Mr. Seok!

49
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,620
- Yes. - We're ready for the last round.

53
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,969
- Will you leave us? - No way.

54
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,638
- Would you go to Youngtoon? - No. Why would I go there?

55
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,278
No, I'm sure you would.

56
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,249
- What time is it? - Hey!

Producer On, are we going for another drink?

70
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,290
Another drink?

71
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,719
- Let's go for another drink. - I told you. I can't.

72
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,889
I have to go home to see Ji Woo.

73
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,159
Tell Ji Woo to come and meet you here!

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
Have you lost your mind?

75
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,429
Hey, I'm off.

76

Bye, stranger.

Let's go!

- Everyone is coming, right? - Yes, Du Hee!

87
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,159
Let's go.

88
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,559
- Hey you, Dumpling. - Yes.

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,828
Why are you so drunk?

90
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,128
- I'm not drunk. - You look drunk.

91
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,958
Let's have another drink. All of us, forever!

92
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,128
- Okay, sure. - Everyone has to come.

93
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,328
You see, it's...

94
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,800
- I'm... - Define comics.

- Comics is... - It is my heart.

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,909
It's like ten thousand flowers.

97
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,578
But don't eat ten thousand cakes.

98
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,679
Okay, all right.

99
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,909
Ma Eum, I should take him home.

100
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,009
We'll go for another drink next time.

101
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,249
I'm not sad at all!

102
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,549
There's always a next time.

103
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,790
- Get home safely. - All right.

104
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,388
- Who is this? - Your taxi driver.

105
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,360
Oh, I see. Hello!

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,860
- Hey, your legs. I'll help you. - Okay, my legs...

107
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,568
I'm coming with you.

108
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:35,869
- You are? - Yes.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,539
- Ji Hyeong is coming with me? - Yes.

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,800
Okay. Ji Hyeong is coming with me.

111
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,069
Mr. Seok, I'm so happy that you're staying!

112
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,180
My goodness.

113
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,110
- I'm off. - Bye.

114
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,209
- Bye. - I'll see you tomorrow.

115
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,319
Get home safely!

116
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,859
I should call a taxi too.

117
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Are you that happy?

118
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,529
Yes. It means I can keep working with him.

119
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,239
I want to walk for a bit.

120
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,339
Really? But the taxi...

121
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,239
Oh, do you want to sober up?

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,779
Shall I come with you?

123
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,209
No, it's fine. Get home safely.

124
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,660
Ji Hyeong.

125
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,128
- Ji Hyeong! - Yes.

126
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,758
- Ji Hyeong. - Yes.

127
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,329
I'm sorry, Ji Hyeong.

128
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,069
I'm sorry, I...

129
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,040
This is the second time I'm making you stay. I'm so sorry.

130
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,110
Come on. Don't be like this.

131
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,810
I'm really sorry because...

132
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,050
I keep making you turn down such good offers...

133
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,319
while feeling so bad about it.

134
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,850
I keep making you stay...

135
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,660
I'm sorry...

136
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,829
I decided to stay because I wanted to.

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,579
- It's Yu Na. - Yes, Seo Yu Na.

138
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,950
- Gosh, seriously. - Stop it, will you?

139
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,850
- Cheers, guys. - Cheers!

140
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,159
- Nice. - This is good.

141
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:16,789
- That's Goo Jun Yeong. - What?

142
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,000
- It is him. - It really is Jun Yeong.

143
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,769
- For real? - Hey, Goo Jun Yeong!

144
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,129
What's he doing here?

145
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,440
Goo Jun Yeong. What are you doing here?

146
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,769
I live here.

147
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
Oh, I see.

148
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,450
We didn't invite you because we know you hate reunions.

149
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,620
My gosh, what a coincidence.

150
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,049
When I saw the number, I wondered if it was you.

151
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,019
Do we really need a side job like this at what we currently make?

152
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,860
Jun Yeong, you can let us check out late, right?

153
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,629
Have a good time.

154

156
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,320
Take your cash.

157
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,120
Thank you very much.

Now, tell me, Uncle.

160
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:34,768
Thanks for the food.

161
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,839
On Ma Eum took a huge mouthful.

162
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Yes. My gosh, she's about to take another mouthful...

163
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,909
Do you want to get spanked again?

164
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,850
I guess Ma Eum isn't even hungover.

165
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,720
I must eat to relieve my hangover.

166
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,490
True that.

167
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,220
- Come and have breakfast. - Okay.

168
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,460
I'm done. Thank you for the food.

169
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,559
- Hey, finish your food. - I'm done.

170
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,460
Just finish the rest.

171
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,840
Did you and Dad get into another fight?

172
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,669
No.

173
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,659
(On Ki Bong)

174
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,960
I heard everything.

175
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,889
She kept it. She couldn't even return it.

176
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,700
You were out of line this time, honey.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,299
How do you think she felt in that situation?

178
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,600
Poor Ma Eum. She must've been so hurt.

179
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,870
- Get him some toasted seaweed. - Yes, Mother.

180
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,620
Mr. Seok!

181
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,418
- Gosh, you scared me. - Good morning.

182
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,058
You're full of energy this morning.

183
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,989
Yes, I feel extra energetic today.

184
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,389
I feel energetic enough to go train in the mountains.

185
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,558
- Gosh, don't do that. - Okay.

186
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,628
My goodness.

187
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,269
Oh, hi!

188
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Hello.

189
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,470
Hi, good morning.

190
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,879
- Did you get home safely yesterday? - Yes.

191
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,419
The doors are closing.

192
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,259
By the way, I see that you two have dropped the honorifics.

193
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,028
That's right. We're the same age, so we're friends now.

194
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,799
I see. That's good.

195
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,179
Oh!

196
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,809
- Hello. - Hello, sir.

197
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,678
Oh, my. Hi, Webtoon Service Team.

198
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,548
You guys are early.

199
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,589
Yes.

200
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,018
Anyway, what brings you to our office?

201
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,019
I just wanted to stop by.

202
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,388
I was hoping to have a cup of tea with Mr. Jang,

203
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,128
but he's not here yet.

204
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,428
Oh, I see. I'll let him know that you're here.

205
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,269
It's okay. No need. We go back a long way, you know.

206
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,169
I felt like I had been neglecting your team, so I wanted to drop by.

207
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,869
I want to help you guys as much as I can...

208
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,980
so that the webtoon team can live up to Neon's standards.

209
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,480
Thank you. We'll do our best.

210
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,059
You should do your best too, Jun Yeong.

211
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,529
All right, then. Have a great day.

212
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,870
Oh. Hey!

213
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,039
Have a great day, sir!

214
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,879
My gosh.

215
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,110
Will do.

216
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,110
The doors are closing.

217
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,090
My goodness.

218
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,128
You can head in first.

219
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,029
I want to have a talk with Jun Yeong.

220
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,029
- Oh, sure. - All right.

221
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,070
- Can we talk? - Sure.

222
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,019
We couldn't finish our conversation yesterday.

223
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,059
You and Ae Ri.

224
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,690
How do you know her?

225
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,360
What about you? What was your relationship with her?

226
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,769
We worked together at Gingertoon.

227
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,799
She was a contract employee, right?

228
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,970
The one that was laid off first.

229
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,340
Pretend you didn't see that photo.

230
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,850
Although you probably don't care anyway.

231
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,370
What's up?

232
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,740
It's about Ae Ri from Gingertoon.

233
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,940
- Yes. - Did she have other family members?

234
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,049
From what I remember,

235
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,549
her relatives arranged her funeral.

236
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,279
She had a younger brother.

237
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,490
She lost her parents at a young age and had to take care of him.

238
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,489
He couldn't attend her funeral...

239
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,759
because he was abroad at the time.

240
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,789
I see.

241
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,230
Anyway, why are you asking about her all of a sudden?

242
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,070
Oh, it's nothing.

243
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,080
They were ruthless.

244
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,109
They promised her that they'd give her a permanent position...

245
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,279
and worked her to the bone.

246
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,850
Then as soon as her contract ended, they let her go. My gosh.

247
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,418
Had that never happened,

248
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,320
we wouldn't have lost her like that.

249
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,919
Maybe it would've been different had you not studied abroad.

250
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,179
- Ta-da. - My gosh.

251
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,950
Oh, my. What is all this?

252
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,919
My parents run a sashimi restaurant, you know.

253
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,719
They packed a bunch of things when I said I was visiting you.

254
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,960
My goodness. I told you not to bring anything.

255
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,759
I'm going to eat two bowls of rice today.

256
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,099
My gosh. Have more. You can have three bowls of rice.

257
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,960
Okay!

258
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,329
Hey, how have you been?

259
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,140
I've been well. You look great.

260
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Wow, this is amazing.

261
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,980
The surprise guest is here too.

262
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,109
I'll get the door.

263
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,750
Welcome.

264
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,319
Hi, Dae Lyug.

265
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,390
Hello, sir.

266
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,230
Hey, it's been a while.

267
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,759
Hello.

268
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,400
Don't you have to meet your deadlines? You must be busy.

269
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,309
Ma Eum, aren't you going for lunch?

270
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,240
Oh, I still have a few things to finish off.

271
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,380
You're skipping lunch? That's unlike you.

272
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
Enjoy your lunch.

273
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:30,008
You should eat something.

274
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,649
I guess she's really busy.

275
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,119
- Make sure you eat something later. - Okay.

276
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,349
Let's go.

277
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,720
Am I invisible to them?

278
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,859
Ji Hyeong, let's go for lunch. You're skipping lunch.

279
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:42,630
Hey, wait up.

280
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,670
- Make sure you eat something. - Will do.

281
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,449
Thanks to Dong Hee,

282
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,190
we get to feast on fresh sashimi today.

283
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,588
- Dig in. - All right.

284
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,858
- Thanks for the food. - Okay, let's eat.

285
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,930
Okay.

286
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,900
I'm a huge fan of "Weapon Feeb."

287
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,369
You have to publish a printed version. I want it.

288
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:29,869
Okay.

289
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,309
By the way, did you come all the way here to see me?

290
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,579
You've changed quite a bit.

291
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,880
I wanted to be here.

292
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,089
I missed you.

293
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:52,529
I see. I missed you too.

294
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,809
There you are!

295
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:10,980
You didn't go for lunch?

296
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,619
I waited to have lunch with you.

297
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,250
I don't have much of an appetite. Enjoy your lunch.

298
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:19,089
My mouth always wants food even when I don't have much of an appetite.

299
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,359
Come on. Let's go. The menu looks really good today.

300
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,029
- No, I'm good. - Let's go.

301
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,598
I'm hungry.

302
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm hungry

303
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,369
I'm hungry

304
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,900
All right, let's go.

305
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,069
Okay, let's go!

306
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,589
Hey, the steak is grilled to perfection. Try it.

307
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,230
Isn't it good?

308
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,859
Yes, it's good.

309
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,130
Did something bad happen?

310
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,430
You seem a little down.

311
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,740
I don't know.

312
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,410
Hey, Goo Jun Yeong. Are you having lunch now?

313
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,349
Hello. Are you on the webtoon team too?

314
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,689
Yes. I'm On Ma Eum from the Webtoon Service Team.

315
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,088
We joined the company together.

316
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,089
Really? I don't think I've seen you before.

317
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,558
Oh, the team hired me separately. No wonder we've never met before.

318
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,528
I see. You must be the contract employee on the webtoon team.

319
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:32,660
The former judo player.

320
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,269
Yes.

321
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,099
I guess I'm famous.

322
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,539
If you're here for lunch, just go eat your food.

323
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,068
Hey, are you still mad at me?

324
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:43,809
I did that to help you out.

325
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,980
Everyone always called you a rich boy and fawned over you.

326
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,879
I figured you hadn't had a chance to explain your situation.

327
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,009
I just wanted to help.

328
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,119
Had we known you were managing bookings there as a side hustle,

329
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,089
we would've taken care of you.

330
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,789
But you get to live there for free, so it's a sweet gig. Right?

331
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,460
Thanks for looking out for me.

332
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,859
You all heard that, right?

333
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:09,929
Now, everyone knows thanks to you.

334
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,000
Like you said, I feel much better now.

335
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,250
You guys.

336
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,088
Doing stuff like this only makes you look more insecure.

337
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,089
What?

338
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,660
Just ignore people like them.

339
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,200
Yes, I don't care.

340
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,700
But I can see that you're angry.

341
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,599
Did it not make you angry?

342
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,069
Why did you keep smiling?

343
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,140
It's true that I was hired separately and am on a contract.

344
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,910
I'm working hard for our team.

345
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,949
We'll produce results and show them, so you should...

346
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,079
"Our team"?

347
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,619
Okay. Do you really think there is a place for you...

348
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,490
on "our team"?

349
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,390
- Goo Jun Yeong. - I'm off.

350
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,079
Jun Yeong.

351
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:35,190
- You and Ae Ri... - Yes.

352
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,420
She was my only family and my sister.

353
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,920
Gosh!

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,099
"Our team"?

355
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,799
Do you really think...

356
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,699
there is a place for you on "our team"?

357
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,670
(Lee Eun Young)

358
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,720
Let's have one more match.

359
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,329
Did something happen today?

360
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,299
This is so unlike you.

361
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,839
I don't know why I'm so angry.

362
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,880
Why am I so upset that he said such a thing?

363
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,919
(On Ma Eum)

364
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,450
Hey, are you crying now?

365
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,259
No, I was just wiping off my sweat.

366
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,130
Ouch. Oh, dear.

367
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,970
That's good. That's enough.

368
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,470
Goodness. How much longer will you live like this?

369
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,569
You should be cutting down on work at your age.

370
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,109
But you're working longer hours to learn computer skills.

371
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,548
Of course, your body can't keep up.

372
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,880
It's a tablet, not a computer.

373
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,950
You're laughing?

374
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:49,650
Yes, I am.

375
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,920
Then what? Am I supposed to cry?

376
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,420
- Goodness. You kill me. - Ouch!

377
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,930
- That really hurt. - My goodness.

378
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,058
I'm home.

379
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,099
Ma Eum!

380
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,440
Look.

381
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,299
What's this?

382
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,369
A meme that parodied your webtoon.

383
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,209
Here, they're eaten alive by Feeb...

384
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,880
because they're dreading to go to work on Monday.

385
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,578
It's so funny.

386
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,279
Hey, this is funny.

387
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,919
There are so many different versions going around these days.

388
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,289
(When men feel most attractive)

389
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,950
Oh, right.

390
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,960
Here, you need to see this.

391
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,259
Webtoon Witch.

392
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,430
- What? - "Weapon Feeb" by Sin Dae Lyug.

393
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,630
I can't handle it.

394
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,899
It keeps me on the edge of my seat, and I can't stop reading it!

395
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,969
It really is Neon's hidden weapon.

396
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,739
The biggest charm of "Weapon Feeb"...

397
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,879
is the unpredictable plot filled with twists and turns.

398
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,048
On top of that, the sense of urgency throughout the story...

399
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:27,879
Isn't this cool? This witch is saying nice things for a change.

400
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,689
There is a fine line between a genius and an idiot...

401
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,318
Her reviews are always on point.

402
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,190
When she likes something, she says it's good.

403
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,500
Now, I know. I thought she was just a cyberbully.

404
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,599
I should send this to Mr. Sin.

405
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,268
Hey! What's with you?

406
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,038
- What? - What?

407
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,869
- What? - What?

408
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,009
Sorry.

409
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,150
Gosh.

410
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,480
(You were always trying to tell me that I was a flower too.)

411
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,180
(You were always trying to tell me that I was a flower too.)

412
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,170
(Neon, Kwon Young Bae)

413
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,008
It seems like Mr. Kwon's projects take up a large portion...

414
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:57,140
of the team's sales.

415
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,950
I'd like to view his list of artists and other files.

416
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,720
Oh, those are his personal files.

417
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,220
(Kwon Young Bae, 2022-2023 Tentative Lists of Artists)

418
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,989
Mr. Kwon.

419
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,249
You won't understand a thing, but feel free to go through them.

420
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,190
Go through them and let me know if you have any suggestions.

423
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:46,420
(Chief Editor Jang Man Chul)

424
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,859
Hold on.

425
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,130
- Yes? - Producer Choi!

426
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,629
What's wrong?

427
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,700
They keep coming out in my dreams.

428
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,170
Who?

429
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,369
The main characters of "The Beginning of Men."

430
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,539
They come out in my dreams...

431
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,210
and tell me not to abandon them.

432
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,209
I wouldn't listen to them,

433
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,479
so they drew a gun on me today.

434
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,219
First of all, you should quit playing shooting games.

435
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,490
I can't sleep these days.

436
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,990
Do you really have to upload the last episode today?

437
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,629
You finished the work.

438
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,130
I'll do my best to help you with your next work.

439
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,730
All right.

440
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I'll have to accept it.

441
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,869
I'll come by to see you later.

442
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,609
I have to accept it, right? Producer Choi!

443
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,210
What is it now?

444
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:14,879
Don't you think I have more premature grays now?

445
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,950
Hey.

446
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:20,578
Premature gray hairs, wrinkles, and drinking...

447
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,289
are all correlated to an editor's experience.

448
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,920
Today is the final episode of Goo Seul A's work, yes?

449
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,059
That's right.

450
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:32,099
Season One, which Goo Seul A was in charge of, ends today.

451
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,798
They're both on their last episodes,

452
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,529
but "The Law of Girls" finishes in first,

453
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,970
and "The Beginning of Men" is in... Gosh.

454
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,009
You worked hard, Producer Choi.

455
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm the most jealous of Producer On.

456
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:50,379
- Me? Why? - "Pygmalion Love" was a huge hit!

457
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,019
I'm so jealous.

458
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,779
I'm jealous of you and of Mr. Sin Dae Lyug.

459
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,490
Still, you should congratulate her since it's a win for our team.

460
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,619
That's true. It's a win for our team.

461
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,430
As long as Producer On did well, it's fine.

462
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,630
"Our team"?

463
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,829
Do you really think there is a place for you on "our team"?

464

("Full Count" and "Q-Tweed" collaboration)

465

466
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,429
("Weapon Feeb" and "Moo-dern House")

467
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,799
Do you honestly think this is enough?

468
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,529
To take on Director Heo Kwan Young?

469
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,910
Director Heo is working on completing the Youngtoon merger.

470
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,008
Youngtoon?

471
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,880
If the webtoon team stays in this state,

472
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,779
I have no justification to oppose that either.

473
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,549
After Youngtoon is acquired,

474
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,220
the webtoon team will become redundant. You know that.

475
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,759
I'm someone...

476
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,200
who wants to protect our webtoon service as it is now.

477
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,028
The people I chose to be on the team I created.

478
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:19,839
It would be a disgrace if they were chased out for underperforming.

479
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,240
So give me that justification,

480
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:26,009
the justification to protect the existing webtoon team.

481
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,250
If you can't give me that by the next board meeting,

482
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,250
that will be the end...

483
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,049
of the webtoon team.

484
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,130
I'm seeing you often lately.

485
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,569
You must be working hard.

486
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,269
I have to work hard since you're always helping me out.

487
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,170
I'm not doing enough.

488
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,809
I'll do much more to help you out from now on...

489
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:01,839
in return for all your hard work.

490
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,609
Right.

491
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,549
You can go ahead and leave.

492
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,260
What are you doing at headquarters?

493
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,920
I need to drop off some materials.

494
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,429
Producer Goo.

495
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,510
Go ahead. I'll see you later.

496
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,179
Why won't you let that one go?

497
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,219
I guess I'm just as stubborn as an editor as the artist is.

498
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,590
Are you still doing "Princess Kumiho"?

499
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,260
You said you guys are working on a new project on Youngtoon.

500
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,530
Why aren't you eating enough?

501
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,889
What's wrong with you?

502
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,859
You clearly told me that!

503
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,269
Wait, what are you talking about?

504
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,070
The new short project I started on Youngtoon, "Cold-blooded."

505
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,139
The reactions have been hot.

506
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,079
Of course I know about that.

507
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,349
That's why I said we should extend our work through a spinoff.

508
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,118
I told you that already!

509
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,288
I thought you meant we were doing that with Youngtoon.

510
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,619
The Assistant Editor Jang was saying the same thing.

511
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,499
Of course Mr. Na should work on his spinoff with us.

512
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,929
We did all the groundwork.

513
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,969
What do you mean, you'll take it back by extending it to a long-run?

514
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,800
Try to keep it ethical, all right?

515
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:34,899
Mr. Na already had the manuscript finished from before.

516
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,409
It wasn't something commissioned by Youngtoon.

517
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,840
You must be desperate.

518
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,039
Nothing will change, though.

519
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,209
Don't you know that a tilting ship is bound to sink...

520
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,380
even after what you went through?

521
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,159
Putting that aside,

522
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,199
do you remember Ae Ri?

523
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,000
She worked with us at Gingertoon.

524
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Goo Ae Ri?

525
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:07,340
We hired a rookie some time ago,

526
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,239
and he said he was Ae Ri's younger brother.

527
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,880
I still haven't told Man Chul yet,

528
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,949
but I'm not sure what to do.

529
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:20,449
Hye Mi, what do you think?

530
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:26,619
Why are you asking me that now?

531
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,789
Because we were all on the same team.

532
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,969
What relationship did you two have?

533
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,400
With Mr. Jang?

534
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,409
I dismissed his team at his former company.

535
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:50,909
You should know since you know them,

536
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,150
but it was a very inefficient team.

537
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,050
Did you prepare the materials I requested last time?

538
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,320
I can't give them to you yet.

539
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,230
"Yet"?

540
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,899
If the materials you requested...

541
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,899
are leaked or fall into the hands of a competitor,

542
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,969
it would affect the overall profits of the webtoon team.

543
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,300
Whether it's better to give you such materials or not,

544
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,769
I haven't decided yet.

545
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,340
You haven't decided?

546
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,150
You are making the decision?

547
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,019
Hey.

548
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,849
I'm the one who should make those kinds of decisions.

549
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,920
Could it be...

550
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,659
that you want to back off now?

551
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,230
Because you think this is crossing the line?

552
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,760
In that case,

553
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,570
what about everything you've done until now?

554
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,570
The materials you've already sent me...

555
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,969
are all just as confidential.

556
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,679
Wait.

557
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,179
The security team has the record of it,

558
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,380
so it might be an even bigger problem.

559
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,719
Won't it be a problem for you too?

560
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,419
- What? - How much could I, a new hire,

561
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,929
really lose?

562
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,800
I do think it would be a big problem for the executive...

563
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,030
who ordered me to do that though.

564

(Shopping List: Tissues, toilet paper, toothbrush)

565
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,348
Mr. Sin, the pig trotters here are really good.

566
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,320
Should we just buy one pack to eat as a snack?

567
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,550
Didn't you say you wanted to eat jjajangmyeon earlier?

568
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,860
That's for our meal, and pig trotters would be a snack.

569
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,190
You want pig trotters as a snack?

570
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,559
Is it too much?

571
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,099
Then should we just buy a medium-sized one?

572
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,269
Okay.

573
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,469
Oh, right, I have to buy detergent. Just a minute.

574
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,170
Then...

575
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,880
I'll go buy that.

576
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,650
Oh...

577
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,050
Then please do so.

578
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:13,820
All right.

579
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:21,960
Welcome.

580
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,469
I'd like a medium pack of pig trotters.

581
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,969
The large pack is on sale, so you should buy that.

582
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,210
No, just the medium, please.

583
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
All right.

584
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,480

585
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,280
Sauce?

586
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,320
(Mustard, ssamjang, salted shrimp)

587
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,590
Just give me everything you can spare.

588
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,590
Please enjoy.

589
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,159
Thank you.

598
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,369
the justification to protect the existing webtoon team.

599

608
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,579
I heard a rumor.

609
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,820
It's about Producer Goo Jun Yeong.

00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,610
didn't want you to get hurt,

659
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,380
but I overdid it.

660
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,449
Something must be up, right?

661
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,190
The mood was so serious.

662
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,760
I don't think he's just taking a day off.

663
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,659
Producer On, you haven't heard anything?

664
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,789
That he's moving to a new company?

665
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,500
No, I don't think it's that.

666
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:45,469
These days, didn't Jun Yeong...

667
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:47,469
seem like he had a lot on his mind?

668
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,739
After we went out to dinner, he became somewhat cold.

669
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,280
He's not there too?

670
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,780
No.

671
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:05,750
I'm going to Ae Ri's memorial park.

672
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,659
He might have gone to see his sister.

673
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,199
Anyway, I'll deal with his letter of resignation.

674
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:18,000
I'll call you back.

675
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,900
Did Jun Yeong resign?

676
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,010
She's Jun Yeong's sister?

677
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,750
Ae Ri was someone...

678
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,389
who best knew...

679
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,489
why we had to make webtoons.

680
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,119
(Goo Ae Ri)

681
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:10,889
Hi.

682
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,920
Man Chul used to say...

683
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,090
that whenever he sees Ae Ri happy while reading comics,

684
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,699
he gets clearly reminded...

685
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,699
of why he started working in this field.

686
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,539
Okay.

687
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:30,170
The final upload is done.

688
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:31,809
You all did a great job.

689
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,840
- Well done. - Great job.

690
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:36,549
- Good work, everyone. - It's the best webtoon.

691
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,380
I'm comforted by your webtoon again. Thank you.

692
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:40,079
Great job.

693
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,219
Let's all go home and sleep.

694
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:45,789
Gosh.

695
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,420
You left the first comment today as well.

696
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,129
- You like it that much? - It's so fun.

697
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,260
It was the best as always.

698
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,639
But...

699
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:03,969
we had to let such a person go first.

700
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,250
Due to the situation,

701
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,420
I think extending the contract might be a little...

702
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:19,820
A little hard.

703
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,719
It's all right.

704
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,099
I'm sorry. I know your situation,

705
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,199
but I can't do anything. I feel so bad.

706
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,099
I'll keep watching.

707
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,079
I'll continue to be the reader.

708
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,579
Please continue to make good webtoons.

709
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,189
I'll make sure to call you again...

710
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,219
when things get better, so you can work with us again.

711
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:55,460
I'll do my best to make that happen.

712
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,460
All right. Don't worry.

713
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:02,329
It's not like we'll not meet each other again. I'll be doing well.

714
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:05,929
Thank you.

715
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,409
Why didn't you tell her...

716
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,339
that Gingertoon will close down?

717
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,909
How could I tell her?

718
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,780
She kept her smile saying that she'll stay as a reader.

719
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,150
Give it to me.

720
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:26,690
Ji Hyeong.

721
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,299
I'll make sure to find a company where I can take you all.

722
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,630
I'll protect you guys...

723
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,800
and the webtoons we made.

724
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,769
Ae Ri will come back...

725
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,139
if I ask her to come, right?

726
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,710
- This one too, Ae Ri. - Okay.

727
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,859
(I wasn't doing well.)

728
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,260
(No one was doing well.)

729
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:16,569
Thank you. It made my day.

730
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,070
(A Dazzling Day: Thank you. It made my day.)

731
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:21,440
Still,

732
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,179
Ae Ri kept her promise...

733
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,219
that she will continue being the reader.

734
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:29,719
It was our turn...

735
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:35,090
to keep the promise of taking her back...

736
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,789
and work with her again.

737
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,828
I'm sorry.

738
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:42,098
- Next time. - We're not just asking for help.

739
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,159
Sir.

740
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,199
We want to be of help.

741
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,969
Let's go.

742
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,339
I'm sorry.

743
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,339
We're not asking you to take over immediately.

744
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,440
Why don't you read the report, at least?

745
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:06,519
Shall we get going?

746
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,389
Let's go back again.

747
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,760
Let's go!

748
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,400
I'm coming.

749
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:28,940
Just give us some time. Just five minutes.

750
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,908
It's not something so easy.

751
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:32,779
Please. Just listen to us first.

752
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,949
Director.

753
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:38,119
Please give me some time. I have a plan that will help Neon!

754
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,190
We have no intention of taking over the company.

755
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:47,730
A webtoon department will greatly help Neon.

756
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:50,170
Please give me five minutes. I'll explain everything.

757
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,869
Why did you do that?

758
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,369
You didn't have to kneel.

759
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,239
We didn't do anything wrong.

760
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,809
I said I'll take care of our team.

761
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,819
A company with a size like Neon...

762
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,319
will be able to take care of our members stably.

763
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,550
Seriously.

764
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,319
Hungry people are more desperate.

765
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,988
- But... - If there's someone to feed us...

766
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:17,030
Excuse me.

767
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,869
I'm Yoon Tae Hee, the managing director of Neon.

768
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:30,969
I'd like to talk with you.

769
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,820
Your conditions are to have everyone in your team hired.

770
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,750
Are there six people in your team?

771
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,960
No, there's one more person.

772
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:31,800
It's so great.

773
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,869
I can finally stand to look at our members.

774
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,670
What were their conditions?

775
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:42,239
It's not so easy for them to take all of us.

776
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,078
It's nothing much. You don't need to worry.

777
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:48,119
For our future in Neon! Cheers!

778
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:53,250
Cheers!

779
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:00,329
This is great.

780
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:02,960
I should tell Ae Ri about this.

781
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,099
I didn't see her comments lately.

782
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,340
I should go and beg her.

783
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,969
Yu Mi has great timing.

784
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,139
Yu Mi.

785
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,309
Mr. Jang, what do we do?

786
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,849
What's wrong? Did something happen?

787
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,889
(Goo Ae Ri, Sophia)

788
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,190
So that's when...

789
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,659
Uploading a webtoon episode...

790
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,000
might not mean anything much to someone.

791
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:15,869
But...

792
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:20,239
after that day,

793
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,909
it became something more to us.

794
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,480
It also carries the weight of one person.

795
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,760
If we let Jun Yeong go without him knowing this,

796
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:36,860
it will hurt him a lot.

797
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,230
It will hurt Jun Yeong...

798
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,570
and us.

799
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,710
That's right.

800
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,780
You said you won't run away.

801
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,579
Jun Yeong.

802
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,519
Come back to your place.

803
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:43,829
She wouldn't want you...

804
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,860
to leave like this.

805
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,530
It wasn't my place.

806
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,170
All right. If that's what you think,

807
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,940
come to work one last day.

808
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:04,010
Your sister's belongings are still left there.

809
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,519
We found them when we were moving out of Gingertoon's office.

810
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:11,789
I'll leave them on your desk, so please check them out.

811
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,820
If you still don't want to stay after that,

812
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:18,559
then I'll give your resignation letter a serious thought too.

813
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,199
Did it not make you angry?

814
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:57,369
Why did you keep smiling?

815
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,569
It's true that I was hired separately and am on a contract.

816
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,840
Ma Eum.

817
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:06,070
You remind me of someone I know.

818
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,210
Who?

819
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:09,780
Cheer up. Come on. We can do this!

820
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,179
Let's do this. Let's go!

821
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,879
Let's go! Let's go for it.

822
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,119
We can do this!

823
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,920
There's just someone I know.

824
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,909
(Tomorrow)

825
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,388
(Blaming myself doesn't change anything.)

826
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,059
(The only thing that I can change is my behavior.)

827
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,399
(Nothing will change...)

828
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
(if you stay frightened from the beginning.)

829
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,739
(Life is unpredictable. That's why it's meaningful.)

830
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,309
(You were always trying to tell me...)

831
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:55,050
(that I was a flower too.)

832
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,319
(You were always trying to tell me...)

833
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,759
(that I was a flower too.)

834
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,230
("Flower and Butterfly")

835
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,480
(You were always trying to tell me that I was a flower too.)

836
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,219
It doesn't matter if it's after 100, 1,000, or 10,000 attempts.

837
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,019
A success is a success.

838
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,670
(Can't we stay together?)

839
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:47,969
(You're like my long-cherished dream.)

840
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,969
You're like my long-cherished dream.

841
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,719
We're friends because we can smile when the other is happy.

842
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,039
Whenever I felt like I was falling, I stood upside down...

843
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,610
so that I didn't fall.

844
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,510
Youth is like a blank canvas.

845
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,519
Life changes depending on what is drawn on it.

846
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:54,570
You were always trying to tell me that I was a flower too.

847
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:08,880
Please tell me about it now.

848
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,319
She worked multiple jobs to sustain her family.

849
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,860
She got into the car accident while returning home from work that night.

850
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,488
Had that never happened,

851
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,599
we wouldn't have lost her like that.

852
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:23,260
Gosh.

853
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,000
Maybe it would've been different had you not studied abroad.

854
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:30,909
Life is funny.

855
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,980
Truth hurts the most sometimes.

856
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,449
I wanted to believe that it wasn't because of me.

857
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,920
But actually,

858
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,159
I knew very well that it was because of me.

859
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:01,900
Jun Yeong.

860
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,519
This...

861
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,260
should have been my sister's place.

862
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:25,929
My sister...

863
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,530
It was because of me.

864
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,679
That's not true.

865
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:54,119
That's not true.

866
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:57,630
It's okay.

867
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,179
It's okay.

868
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,869
(Today's Webtoon)

869
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,409
We only have three months left now.

870
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,039
The final round has begun.

871
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:25,349
What can Neon suggest me?

872
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:26,948
Who do you think...

873
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:29,780
can protect you in this situation?

874
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,920
Ma Eum.

875
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,559
Okay. I'll give you another chance.

876
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,129
The price...

877
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,130
Why...

878
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:41,099
What's that article saying?

879
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,400
("Neon Director Heo Pushing Youngtoon Takeover")

880
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,730
This is strange.
