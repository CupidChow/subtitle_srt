(Episode 14: Stars Shine for You)

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,359
Don't center the schedule around yourself.

12
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,460
You don't work on Sunday.

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,500
You won't be there.

14
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,569
Who are you?

15
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,109
Me?

16
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm Sin Dae Lyug's mother.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,549
Mr. Sin Dae Lyug's...

18
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,980
(Stay still!)

19
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,819
mother?

20
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,030
Gosh, given the status of Neon,

21
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,629
your office is quite humble. Isn't it?

22
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,469
Ma'am, why don't we talk over there?

23
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,000
Gosh.

24
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,670
Who is this handsome guy?

25
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:40,939
(Seok Ji Hyeong)

26
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,409
Hello. I'm Producer Seok Ji Hyeong.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,010
He's the assistant editor.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,219
Gosh. You have a high position in the team. Right?

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,180
Well, I wouldn't say that. We're all producers here.

30
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,590
Let us escort you to the conference room.

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,159
- Producer On. - Sure. This way, ma'am.

32
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,400
Oh, my.

33
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,740
- On Ma Eum. - Yes.

34
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,270
- Seok Ji Hyeong. - Yes.

35
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,509
I should try to memorize your names quickly. That's only polite.

36
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,250
My name is Kang Kyung Ja.

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,159
I see. Ms. Kang Kyung Ja.

38
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,759
- What brings you here, by the way? - No.

39
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,360
- Pardon? - Just call me Kyung Ja.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,599
Okay. Kyung Ja.

41
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,469
Or how about Ms. Kyung Ja?

42
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,340
Well, Dae Lyug didn't answer my calls.

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,479
I came here, thinking...

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,610
I might be able to see him here.

45
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,710
Where does Dae Lyug live?

46
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,849
Well, we can't give out personal information. I'm sorry.

47
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,050
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,960
A mother is here to see her son.

49
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,830
Ms. On, do you think I'm some kind of dangerous person?

50
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,759
No.

51
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,969
I think Mr. Sin needs...

52
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:19,370
a bit of time before the two of you meet.

53
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,840
I'll try to set up a meeting when he's ready.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,469
I don't have time to wait.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,580
I've been away from my baby for years.

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,009
Are you asking me to wait longer?

57
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,650
Ma'am. No. Kyung Ja. I understand, but...

58
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,250
You two don't understand how I feel.

59
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,889
And you know nothing about my son either.

60
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,919
Dae Lyug needs me right now!

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,729
If you don't tell me where he is,

62
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,060
do you think I can't find out where he is?

63
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,740
Ma'am.

64
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,639
What's going on?

65
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,009
Gosh. What's wrong with her?

66
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,610
- Hey, stop it. - What should I stop?

67
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,150
She's not what I expected to be Dae Lyug's mother.

68
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:13,360
Sir, what do you think about not telling Mr. Sin...

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,629
regarding his mother's visit here?

70
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,560
Shouldn't we share what happened with him?

71
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,839
Or has he told you about his mother beforehand?

72
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:25,899
No. It's not that.

73
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,009
He's at an important phase.

74
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,639
I'm worried that he might get more sensitive.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,660
To me, "Weapon Feeb" was...

76
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:50,560
all about what you lack, and I really liked that.

77
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,860
What I lack?

78
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,740
A story about a boy who thought of Feeb as his mother.

79
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,550
I gave a lot of thought to your offer.

80
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,160
It's a great offer. It is. But the problem is...

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,759
I don't know anything about running a company.

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,930
I believe that people ought to work in a field they are good at.

83
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,470
That's why I didn't even think about...

84
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,269
running a company even if I had to work ten times harder as an artist.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,480
Could you think about it with an open mind?

86
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,709
As for running the company, you can have a co-CEO.

87
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,709
Right.

88
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,779
- Pardon? - If that's the condition,

89
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,449
I'll be able to accept your offer.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,029
I've been thinking about this for a while.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
It's a great opportunity.

92
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,040
I mean it. And I think this is the perfect time for it.

93
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,740
It always didn't work out.

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
But I guess it didn't work out...

95
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,439
because there was a perfect time for everything.

96
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,019
Mr. Na was willing to try.

97
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,089
We can send him a file...

98
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,589
on how the subsidiary will be set up and operated.

99
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm sure it will be helpful.

100
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,819
Okay. That's great.

101
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,230
Should I put together a proposal?

102
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,930
Gosh. I don't even have to tell you what I need now.

103
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,160
Because we're an awesome team.

104
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,000
Gosh. We just overcame one obstacle.

105
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,370
You guys should pay attention to the other artists,

106
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,300
so they stay with us.

107
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,139
Does anyone else have an update to share?

108
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,379
What did you just say? We are an awesome team?

109
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,110
- What about if we're a bad team? - Because of you?

110
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,110
That's correct.

111
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,149
Goodness. Don't act like you're upset.

112
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,819
Right. Producer On.

113
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,550
Mr. Sin's webtoon is going well, right?

114
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,120
Yes.

115
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,339
You haven't sent me the file yet which is unlike you.

116
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,339
I got worried, so I came by to see if you were doing okay.

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,850
Are you all right?

118
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,879
I can't remember anything.

119
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,589
It's like my head just went blank.

120
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,129
It's okay. We have some files on reserve.

121
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,600
You can take your time and get your pace back.

122
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,160
I've never felt like this before.

123
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,870
You've never had to release an episode every week.

124
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,180
I think getting stuck is a part of the process.

125
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,579
We can find a way to overcome it.

126
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,250
All right. Let's talk about the part you're stuck.

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,949
Okay.

128
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,829
Is it about Mr. Sin?

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,370
Yes.

130
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,170
What do you think is the problem?

131
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,379
Well...

132
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,720
Does it have to do with his mother's visit here?

133
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,659
We should tread carefully on his personal matters.

134
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,659
But getting between the two of them...

135
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,360
might be another matter.

136
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,200
We don't know...

137
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,700
what's the best for Mr. Sin yet.

138
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,039
I got frustrated, so I wanted to seek your advice.

139
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,480
You know well about Mr. Sin too.

140
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,419
I see. This sounds like a pretty big problem.

141
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,320
Do you think so?

142
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,690
When I asked around to other producers, they told me...

143
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,799
it was common for rookie artists to get stuck like this.

144
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,429
That's true.

145
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,070
But that's the problem.

146
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,309
The way Sin Dae Lyug works...

147
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:31,509
is different from most webtoon artists.

148
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,450
Dae Lyug was busy trying to turn his flooding ideas...

149
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,320
into drawing.

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,879
When he's no longer inspired,

151
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,820
finding a way to get inspired again...

152
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,519
Well, how should I put it?

153
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,059
Making that kind of effort would be equivalent to using muscles...

154
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,070
he had never used in his life.

155
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,000
I see.

156
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,210
Let me use the restroom.

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,649
Sir.

158
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,409
Has your back gotten worse?

159
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,720
Oh, I see.

160
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,590
You kept massaging your hands.

161
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,690
You must feel a lot of pain there.

162
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,029
My body always aches, you know.

163
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,179
It looks like you're used to working with your assistants in person now.

164
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,480
And I'm asking for your help lesser too. Right?

165
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,149
Right. It's kind of disappointing.

166
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,649
- Do you mean that? - Totally.

167
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,590
I'm your producer. Isn't it better for our relationship...

168
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,590
if you ask for my help often?

169
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,190
If I wasn't as experienced as reading people,

170
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,730
I would've gotten the wrong idea.

171
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:56,929
What do you mean?

172
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,330
Had I not known you had feelings for someone else,

173
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,230
what you said would have made my heart flutter.

174
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,100
Did you even tell her?

175
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,940
You should tell her soon.

176
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,409
Even I think she's quite attractive.

177
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,850
Gosh. By the way, your webtoon has gotten so much better lately.

178
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,169
One, two,

179
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,210
three, four, five, six,

180
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,080
seven, eight, nine.

181
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,149
What are you doing?

182
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,409
You're here.

183
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,720
There are times I get better ideas...

184
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,090
when I exercise.

185
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
You should tell her soon.

186
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,299
Even I think she's quite attractive.

187
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,970
What's going on? Why is your face red?

188
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,029
What?

189
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,070
No, it's not.

190
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,100
"No, it's not."

191
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,009
Right. Did you sort out Mr. Sin's problem?

192
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,610
That?

193
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,710
I think it will be resolved one way or another.

194
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,980
But I'm still thinking about it.

195
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,779
How?

196
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,250
How?

197
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,919
It's a secret.

198
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,000
Hello?

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,639
Mr. Sin. I'm near your studio.

200
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,039
And I'm bringing someone to your studio.

201
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,919
Who is she bringing?

202
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,700
Hello.

203
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,070
Mr. Sin.

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,710
What brings you here?

205
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,879
Hello.

206
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,379
Mr. Sin. Do you need an assistant?

207
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,090
I heard your news through Mr. Baek.

208
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,529
As soon as he heard, he wanted to help you.

209
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,000
So he came to Seoul right away.

210
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,370
But how could you be my assistant?

211
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I worked under a great maestro...

212
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,710
for ten years, after all. I'm an assistant with many skills.

213
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,570
Are you going to turn me down?

214
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,110
I was about to call you for the next episode too.

215
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,450
If there's a delay, your readers will stone you.

216
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,019
You can't go on a break after that crazy cliffhanger.

217
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,950
That's a crime.

218
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,389
Thank you.

219
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,100
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

220
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,970
Hello. This is Webtoon Witch.

221
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,769
The webtoon I'm going to review today...

222
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,200
- is "Full Count" by Lee Woo Jin. - Wait.

223
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,210
"Full Count" is...

224
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,440
Did I eat too much? Hold on a second.

225
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,909
- Wait. - It's about a love story...

226
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,250
of baseball players.

227
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,620
It's a great romance story, but...

228
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,019
Oh, no. Wait.

229
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,190
I can't hold it. Oh, no.

230
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,789
I'm home.

231
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,559
Oh, no.

232
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:58,100
- Why are we talking about this? - Webtoon Witch?

233
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,870
Surprisingly, this webtoon...

234
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,370
- has been considered... - My, it's "Full Count" this time.

235
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,480
as a coming-of-age story from the beginning.

236
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,710
- Why? It was a story... - What?

237
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,649
about a girl, not a guy, trying out to be a professional player.

238
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,450
The fact that a girl was trying out to be a professional player...

239
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,649
- was very original. - Why is she editing this video?

240
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,350
However, because of the physical difference between men and women,

241
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,659
the main character...

242
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,960
- hits a very big wall. - Hello, Ma Eum.

243
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,860
- Since she's the main character, - Nu Ri.

244
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,500
she begins to grow as a better player.

245
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,070
Why? Because she's our main character.

246
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,039
But all of a sudden...

247
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,269
- Darn you! - Ma Eum!

248
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,309
- Hey. - Wait. I have something to say.

249
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,570
- Hear me out. - You know what I'm going through!

250
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,940
- Hear me out! - Gosh. Unbelievable!

251
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,450
- Wait. - You're Webtoon Witch?

252
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,350
- No. - Hey, you just wait right here.

253
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,990
Hello, Mr. Im. Is there something wrong?

254
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,620
I see. Okay. I'll come over.

255
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,490
Okay.

256
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,659
I'll see you when I come back!

257
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,399
Don't come back!

258
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,840
(Nu Ri's Room)

259
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,539
I don't know how to tell you.

260
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,149
I don't think I can help...

261
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,879
Dae Lyug with his artist's block.

262
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,620
Why not?

263
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,919
Was there a problem when you two were...

264
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,289
working together?

265
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,019
No. It's nothing like that.

266
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:31,100
The problem he has right now...

267
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,230
isn't about his webtoon. I think it's a psychological one.

268
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,840
Can you guess what might be triggering this?

269
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,549
My life was a series of misfortunes, one after another.

270
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,419
I'm a mess,

271
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,159
but please help me...

272
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,000
so I don't become more broken.

273
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,869
If you're beside me,

274
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,769
I feel like I can run away...

275
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,509
from misfortune and unhappiness.

276
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,150
We should tread carefully on his personal matters.

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,390
But getting between the two of them...

278
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,920
might be another matter.

279
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,230
You two don't understand how I feel.

280
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,259
And you know nothing about my son either.

281
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,400
Dae Lyug needs me right now!

282
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,109
Mr. Sin.

283
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,440
Are you having...

284
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
a hard time focusing on your work because of the trauma...

285
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,579
you had in your past?

286
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,880
When you told me what happened,

287
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,089
it felt as if there was unfinished business.

288
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,990
Perhaps, you're struggling now...

289
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,460
because your wound hasn't healed yet.

290
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,529
There is one thing...

291
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,539
I would like to ask her.

292
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,410
I want to ask her why she did that to me.

293
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,119
Mr. Sin.

294
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,289
Are you interested in meeting your mother?

295
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,289
No.

296
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,660
It appalls me just to even think about her.

297
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,430
I never want to see her again.

298
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,329
Excuse me.

299
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,079
Who are you?

300
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,619
Dae Lyug.

301
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,890
It's Mom.

302
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,130
Dae Lyug. It's Mom.

303
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:26,339
Are you all right, ma'am?

304
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,809
Yes, I'm all right.

305
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,740
Did you call her here?

306
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,140
No, Mr. Sin.

307
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,680
Right.

308
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,410
No, Dae Lyug.

309
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,920
- I really wanted to see you. - Ma'am.

310
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,549
Get away from me. Get out of here!

311
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,650
I wonder how he can be so cruel.

312
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,660
How did you find his studio?

313
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:22,829
I...

314
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,960
followed you here.

315
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,559
Ma'am.

316
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,599
I told you.

317
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,769
I don't have much time left.

318
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,589
(Producer On Ma Eum)

319
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,730
Dae Lyug.

320
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,000
Dae Lyug. It's Mom.

321
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,750
All right. Let's begin our meeting.

322
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,359
Producer Choi, did Mr. Oh decide on his new webtoon?

323
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,720
Yes. Mr. Oh is definitely coming back to his old self.

324
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,259
Look at that smile. I guess it's good.

325
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,099
I'll look forward to it.

326
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,329
Producer Gi. You were planning a short-story contest.

327
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,400
Romantic fantasy is trending a lot these days.

328
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
So the concept we have is...

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,069
"What if a main character becomes a character in a romantic fantasy?"

330
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,970
Actually, people are wondering how it would be...

331
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,509
if "Weapon Feeb" were to become a romantic fantasy.

332
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,440
A lot of readers are looking forward to that.

333
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,779
Gosh. I get that romantic fantasy is hip these days.

334
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,480
But given the style of his drawing...

335
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,819
Okay. I'll think about it.

336
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,150
(Na Gang Nam Studio)

337
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,319
Na Gang Nam Studio is coming together nicely, right?

338
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,420
Yes. The preparation is going smoothly.

339
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,119
Of course. You're handling it.

340
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,990
It's my turn.

341
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:06,259
The board meeting is really around the corner.

342
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,230
At this board meeting,

343
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,130
I'm going to bring up two agendas.

344
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,339
The first agenda is Mr. Sin's "Weapon Feeb."

345
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,039
How it will turn into a drama.

346
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:17,740
And the possibility of launching...

347
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,440
the second season around the time the drama airs.

348
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,710
And the second agenda is Na Gang Nam Studio.

349
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,079
I'm going to present these two agendas to them.

350
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,250
Turn a crisis into an opportunity.

351
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,119
As long as this meeting goes well,

352
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,089
our team might gain more ground within Neon.

353
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,130
To do that, Mr. Sin must release his episodes...

354
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,529
without a problem just like now.

355
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,799
I know he's been solid.

356
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:45,240
So Producer On, please keep working hard.

357
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,509
Okay.

358
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,269
She sounds experienced now, doesn't she?

359
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,279
Is something wrong?

360
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,589
Gosh. This was my secret spot.

361
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,490
Mr. Sin...

362
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,000
has been stuck.

363
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,099
Does this have to do with his mother?

364
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,799
Yes.

365
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:23,470
He's having a hard time because of a personal matter.

366
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,079
But for our team's sake,

367
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,980
I need him to keep working on his webtoon like he did before.

368
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,450
He's already having a hard time,

369
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,849
but having to keep pressuring him to work on his webtoon...

370
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,059
is tough on me.

371
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,690
You've always done a great job.

372
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,529
I'm sure you'll figure this one out too.

373
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:52,140
So believe in yourself and cheer up.

374
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,609
Hey, you've been telling people to cheer up...

375
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,140
more than me lately.

376
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,839
Is that so?

377
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,579
Thank you.

378
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:07,519
I'll cheer up.

379
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,819
I should.

380
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,240
Mr. Sin, after this week, there won't be...

381
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,240
any more episodes on reserve.

382
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,710
Then...

383
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,450
I need a completed episode from you...

384
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,720
before this week's deadline...

385
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,690
for the readers to have something to read.

386
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,089
I'm really sorry.

387
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,559
But my mind is blank right now.

388
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,799
Why don't you meet with your mother?

389
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,210
You said you wanted to ask her something.

390
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,009
Once you get an answer, you might be able to...

391
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,339
No.

392
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,480
If that woman sees me, she will...

393
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,549
Mr. Sin.

394
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,059
You're no longer that powerless boy from all those years ago.

395
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,759
I'll go with you.

396
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,740
Wait.

397
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,220
When people touch him, Mr. Sin feels uneasy.

398
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,819
Why?

399
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,720
Because you tied me up like a dog.

400
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:27,789
Do you...

401
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:30,859
remember that?

402
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,859
Do I remember that?

403
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,900
Of course.

404
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,470
How could you be so shameless and come back?

405
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,970
What is it that you want?

406
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,640
I really wanted to see you.

407
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,819
Go on. Please?

408
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Say everything you wanted to say to me.

409
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,029
You can curse or resent me. I can handle it.

410
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,390
I don't need to do that.

411
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,799
Whatever I do won't change what you did to me.

412
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,069
Nothing will change.

413
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,470
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,009
Why did you do that to me?

415
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:19,680
Why?

416
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:23,309
Why...

417
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,880
Why did you abandon me?

418
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,190
I...

419
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,289
couldn't be responsible for you.

420
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,730
I didn't have a family.

421
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,970
I had to leave you at home all alone when I went out to make money.

422
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,970
I knew that you hated it.

423
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,779
But I had to tie you.

424
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,009
When I came back home from work,

425
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,579
I was afraid...

426
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,789
that every day of my life would be exactly that, Dae Lyug.

427
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,359
But you think...

428
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,059
you can be responsible for me now?

429
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,759
Be honest.

430
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,029
Aren't you here for money?

431
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,440
To extort money out of me?

432
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,519
I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry.

433
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,990
Ma'am.

434
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,390
Ma'am!

435
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:01,809
Ma'am.

436
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,220
Ma'am.

437
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Ma'am.

438
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,990
Yes, Mr. Seok.

439
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,470
What?

440
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,869
(On Ma Eum)

441
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,309
My gosh. This malicious post about Mr. Sin is everywhere.

442
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,980
Can people post stuff like this...

443
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,579
without checking the facts first?

444
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,920
There's Ms. On's business card in the post too.

445
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,619
Did you contact the person who posted that?

446
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,089
We can contact him when Ms. On gets here.

447
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:54,400
On Ma Eum, what happened?

448
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,430
So you went to the police station because of Mr. Sin.

449
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,470
That's...

450
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,210
Did you bury this on purpose?

451
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,309
I'm sorry. I told her it would be best not to tell you.

452
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,309
- What? - No.

453
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,279
I asked Producer Goo not to tell you...

454
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,190
because I was afraid it would ruin Mr. Sin's chance of making a debut.

455
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,660
So...

456
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,660
this could damage our team. No.

457
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,160
This could severely damage our company.

458
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,170
But you two discussed this and decided not to report it. Right?

459
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,099
I'm sorry. I was short-sighted.

460
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,039
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,869
There was a misunderstanding...

462
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,079
when he was sketching his characters.

463
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:42,650
Actually, Mr. Sin was the victim of assault.

464
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:46,049
Mr. Sin thought it was partially his fault.

465
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,349
So we decided not to pursue this.

466
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,289
I thought it could be put behind us.

467
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,859
I'm so sorry.

468
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,289
But still. You should've reported it!

469
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,730
That's enough, Producer Kwon.

470
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,299
So the online post isn't true.

471
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:03,829
Right.

472
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,470
That's a relief.

473
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,670
We can't let this affect Mr. Sin.

474
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,809
Let's try our best to get this under control...

475
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,910
before next week's board meeting.

476
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,980
Don't worry too much.

477
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,309
I'll talk to Neon's legal team, so they can help us.

478
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,680
It's not true.

479
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,190
Do you have his contact information?

480
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,630
I have the detective's phone number.

481
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,029
Come on. What is this?

482
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,329
We're busy trying to clean this mess too.

483
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,670
Besides, the post exposed him of a crime.

484
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,569
A crime, for goodness' sake!

485
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,440
What it said in the post isn't true.

486
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,539
I'll clear up the misunderstanding.

487
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Sir.

488
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:53,819
(I would like to expose Sin, the writer of "Weapon Feeb.")

489
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,990
I would like to expose Sin, the writer of "Weapon Feeb."

490
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,759
The popular webtoon artist, Sin,

491
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,619
followed my girlfriend and touched her.

492
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,990
I arrived just in time to stop him.

493
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,000
I pushed him gently to protect my girlfriend.

494
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But a woman, so-called his producer, came to the police station.

495
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,900
She kept arguing that I had hit him...

496
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,099
and forced me to stay silent.

497
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
(Sin Dae Lyug's Attacker)

498
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,490
He's not even answering his phone.

499
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,359
Did you not leave any photos of Mr. Sin after the assault?

500
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,799
Probably not.

501
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,730
(Detective, Sin Dae Lyug's Case)

502
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,599
Hello, detective. This is On Ma Eum. I called earlier.

503
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,440
The boyfriend won't answer my calls.

504
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,940
As you handled our case,

505
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,109
could you call him for us?

506
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,650
Then what about the security footage I asked for earlier?

507
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,519
I see. Thank you.

508
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,930
No?

509
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,259
No. We have to get the security footage ourselves too.

510
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Sir, I'm sorry. But could you drive us to Yeonju Church?

511
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,230
Let's check there.

512
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:21,000
Dashcam footage or security footage from stores.

513
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,339
We might be able to find any evidence or witnesses.

514
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,109
- I'm sorry. - For what?

515
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,480
I put you in a tight spot.

516
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,819
We made the decision together.

517
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,220
So we should take responsibility together.

518
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:51,069
He even posted Ms. On's business card.

519
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,500
(On Ma Eum)

520
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,640
She hasn't called you yet?

521
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,809
Will this...

522
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,779
put her in a tight spot?

523
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,609
Is this that webtoon?

524
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,680
Jerks like him don't even deserve one star.

525
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:07,480
- He's just like his webtoon. - It's so lame.

526
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,449
It should be called "Criminal Weapon."

527
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,449
Scumbags like him deserve zero stars.

528
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,190
I wondered if the artist was a psycho. I was right.

529
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,829
Yes. I've been in communication with CS and our legal team.

530
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,530
Of course, it's not true.

531
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,570
Right. I'll let you know as soon as the situation is sorted out.

532
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,070
Okay, thank you.

533
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:29,309
There's an article about him.

534
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,480
I keep getting advertising and marketing-related inquiries...

535
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,909
from other departments. What should I do?

536
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,309
Gosh, this is nuts.

537
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,860
(I never liked his drawing style. No wonder.)

538
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,619
(Take down the video about "Weapon Feeb." It makes me uncomfortable.)

539
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,960
Everyone is flipping out, posting angry comments on my channel.

540
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,159
What is it? What's going on?

541
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,059
Well...

542
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,329
Someone posted something about the artist of "Weapon Feeb."

543
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,670
And everyone is going bonkers.

544
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,710
My gosh. Even here, everyone is flipping out.

545
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,510
Ma Eum and her co-workers must be in crisis mode right now.

546
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,579
- Let me see. - No.

547
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,380
- Come on. - No!

548
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,510
Try and snatch it from me. Then I'll show you.

549
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,820
We should look for it in this area.

550
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,030
But I don't see any security cameras around.

551
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,429
Why don't we ask the shop owners?

552
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,170
- Let's check that one first. - Okay, good idea.

553
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,909
Oh, this camera? It's been broken for a while.

554
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:37,570
- It's broken? - Yes.

555
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,610
Thank you anyway.

556
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,449
By any chance, do you have a camera outside?

557
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,590
Gosh.

558
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,690
Darn it.

559
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,530
Hello?

560
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,860
Kang Kyung Ja?

561
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,400
Yes, I know her.

562
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,230
Sorry?

563
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,610
Okay.

564
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,469
Thank you.

565
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,409
What was that about?

566
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,579
Sin Dae Lyug's mother got into an accident,

567
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,179
but she doesn't have a guardian.

568
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,980
You should go. I'll look for it.

569
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,849
I can't. I'll feel so bad.

570
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,119
You said co-workers must take care of each other. I got this.

571
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,460
You should get going.

572
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,530
Taxi!

573
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm really sorry, Jun Yeong. I'll call you.

574
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,699
To Seungjin Medical Center, please.

575
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,780
- Calm down, please. - I have to go.

576
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,320
My goodness. Calm down, will you?

577
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,420
Ms. Kang!

578
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:54,650
Gosh, there you are.

579
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,190
She suddenly jumped in front of my car. I nearly had a heart attack!

580
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,920
- My gosh. - She has Alzheimer's.

581
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,059
You can't let her walk around on her own!

582
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,829
Alzheimer's? What do you mean?

583
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,630
Here, have a look.

584
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,530
(I have Alzheimer's.)

585
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,900
(I have Alzheimer's.)

586
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,639
(Alzheimer's Patient, Kang Kyung Ja)

587
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,340
(Alzheimer's Patient, Kang Kyung Ja)

588
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,550
Are you here to pick me up?

589
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,719
Then let's go.

590
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,849
I have somewhere to be.

591
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,750
I hate hospitals.

592
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,190
I have somewhere to be. I really hate hospitals.

593
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,219
Ms. Kang.

594
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,400
(Motel)

595
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,829
Well...

596
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,070
I'm really okay now.

597
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,769
You should get going.

598
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,610
But I'm still worried.

599
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,809
I'll be right here.

600
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:56,150
Believe me. I'm really okay now.

601
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,610
Get going, okay?

602
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,150
Okay, bye.

603
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,659
He's inside.

604
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,539
I'm sorry, Ms. On.

605
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,070
Don't be.

606
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,579
This must be the most devastating for you.

607
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,409
Have you eaten yet?

608
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,380
He says he has no appetite. He hasn't eaten anything all day.

609
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:38,320
Make sure you eat something, Mr. Sin.

610
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:42,389
We're doing our best to prove that it's not true.

611
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:43,559
Don't worry.

612
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,030
I'm certain that we can get it all sorted out.

613
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,699
And Mr. Sin.

614
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,570
- Your mother... - My foolishness is to blame.

615
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,239
I'm really sorry, Ms. On.

616
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,909
We worked hard together to produce results,

617
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,480
and I ruined everything.

618
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,820
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

619
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,429
It's not entirely your fault.

620
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:26,869
I told you.

621
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,940
I don't have much time left.

622
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,510
I really wanted to see you.

623
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,880
Of course, I remember.

624
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,989
That big guy beat him up to a pulp.

625
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,860
All the passersby gathered around them...

626
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,389
and recorded it with their phones. They caused a total ruckus.

627
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,329
Then many people must still have photos or videos of it.

628
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,730
Of course! I told you. All the passersby recorded it.

629
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Gosh, this is such a mess.

630
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,739
Ma Eum must be so stressed out.

631
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:07,809
I'm home.

632
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,750
Ma Eum.

633
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,679
Are you all right?

634
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,949
I read the article.

635
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,190
Is it true?

636
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,289
No. Of course, it's not true.

637
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:22,219
My gosh. Then why did they post such a thing?

638
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,300
Do they have it out for Sin Dae Lyug or something?

639
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,960
I wonder too.

640
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,199
I'll figure out a way to get it sorted out.

641
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,139
Thanks.

642
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,480
Everything will be okay.

643
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,329
If that's the situation,

644
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,369
what's the point of having a board meeting?

645
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,699
What that person is claiming in the post isn't true.

646
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,210
I suggest we have our legal team handle the matter.

647
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,710
If we fire the artist, it won't be our problem anymore.

648
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,679
Why should we fight for him while putting Neon's reputation at risk?

649
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,679
We should just get rid of the webtoon team.

650
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,590
I believe it is the best solution for the company.

651
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,920
How could you say such a thing?

652
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,789
All we have to do is fix what is not true!

653
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,260
Even if parts of it weren't true,

654
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:35,329
it is true that Sin Dae Lyug was involved in an unsavory incident.

655
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,110
Don't tell me you weren't aware of your team's situation.

656
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,010
Ma'am.

657
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,909
Didn't he also sign an agreement for a drama adaptation of his work?

658
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,960
If you don't tell me as soon as a problem occurs,

659
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:02,489
I can't protect you guys.

660
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:04,989
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

661
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,900
We have no evidence now, right?

662
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
We couldn't find any security footage,

663
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,400
but I went to the scene and asked around.

664
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,170
I was told that a number of people witnessed it.

665
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,940
Then is there a way to get the videos that the witnesses recorded?

666
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,949
Had you guys told us right away, none of this would've happened.

667
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,719
Hi, guys. It's Webtoon Witch here.

668
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,760
This is my first time doing a livestream.

669
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,860
You're probably surprised to see this.

670
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,429
I decided to do a livestream...

671
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,699
because I need your help.

672
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,539
At around 3:25pm on August 16,

673
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,570
an assault incident took place...

674
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,269
by Yeonju Church. I'm looking for people who witnessed it.

675
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,110
If you have videos or photos of the incident,

676
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,010
- contact Neon Webtoon's account... - What?

677
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,010
Why is Webtoon Witch helping us?

678
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,679
To tell you the truth,

679
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,989
she's my sister.

680
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,090
I only found out recently too.

681
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,059
Oh... I see.

682
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,559
Anyone who provides helpful information...

683
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,099
She could be criticized for this.

684
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,900
- will receive... - I'm grateful for her help.

685
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,199
free subscription coupons.

686
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,929
She offered to help and said that she didn't care...

687
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,070
- about losing subscribers. - Please spread the word.

688
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,409
But I know she's very attached to her channel.

689
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,139
We must uncover the truth so this won't affect her negatively.

690
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,909
Yes, we should.

691
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,719
The post you wrote earlier...

692
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,050
has been shared by a number of people.

693
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,150
Really?

694
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,619
Then why don't we try looking up a bunch of related keywords...

695
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,420
on social media and online communities?

696
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,130
We might be able to find some photos or videos.

697
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,429
Sure.

698
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,530
- Try "Yeonju Church." - Yeonju Church.

699
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,969
- I'll use my phone. - Okay.

700
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:58,369
Let me see him. Please?

701
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,039
You should see Dae Lyug another time.

702
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,880
The situation isn't so good right now.

703
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,510
I know.

704
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:09,389
Dae Lyug is having a hard time.

705
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,619
But I want to help.

706
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,130
I wanted to take care of him.

707
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,469
I only brought the things that he used to like,

708
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,139
so he'll enjoy them.

709
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,710
Go back inside.

710
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,269
Being glued to your desk won't help you come up with a solution.

711
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,099
Have some food and do something active. That will be more helpful.

712
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,599
It'll help you overcome this hurdle...

713
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,539
and work better.

714
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:07,309
I can't eat right now.

715
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,530
Jun Yeong.

716
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,960
- Here's your coffee. - Thank you.

717
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,360
Have you found anything yet?

718
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,929
All right.

719
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:34,000
Ma Eum. You wanted tea, right?

720
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,340
- Here. - Yes, thank you.

721
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,809
Any updates?

722
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,110
No, nothing yet.

723
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,510
- All right. Let's keep looking. - Okay.

724
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,980
Great, thanks.

725
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,150
Hey, Jong Guk.

726
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,889
I need some security footage.

727
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,989
It's not within your jurisdiction? You're a cop. Why does that matter?

728
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,469
Mingle with people...

729
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,139
and try to face them even if it's hard.

730
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,880
It'll help you realize what it is...

731
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,980
that you've been missing out on.

732
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,829
(Notifications)

733
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,730
Still nothing yet.

734
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,840
Have you found any videos yet?

735
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,039
No, nothing yet.

736
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,119
(Notifications)

737
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:29,650
Hey, what are you doing?

738
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:32,420
Oh, I'm just hitting the refresh button.

739
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,690
I keep checking to see if anything's been posted,

740
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,360
but nothing yet.

741
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,429
Staring at it won't make something appear magically.

742
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,199
Let's go get some food.

743
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,070
(Here's a video of Sin Dae Lyug getting beaten up.)

744
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,179
What? What is it?

745
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,610
What is it? Did you find something?

746
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,920
Look, here... Someone just posted something.

747
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,050
Look! "Here's a video of Sin Dae Lyug getting beaten up."

748
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,250
- What? - Where?

749
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,889
- Right here! - Let me see!

750
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:08,119
This popped up as soon as I hit refresh.

751
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,300
- You hit refresh and... Hold on. - Why? What is it?

752
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,000
There's another one. "I saw it too."

753
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,599
- "I saw it too"! - Yes!

754
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,800
- They saw it! - Hey.

755
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,469
"Here's a video from a witness."

756
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:22,940
- A witness! - Yes!

757
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,239
Hey, come on. Let's eat.

758
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,849
All right. Let's eat.

759
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,309
I can't eat anything right now.

760
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,320
If you let yourself fall apart like this,

761
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,949
it'll make things even harder for the people you work with. Okay?

762
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,889
You need to eat.

763
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:41,389
You need to do your job to make sure that...

764
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:43,860
Producer On's hard work won't go to waste.

765
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,090
All right, let's eat.

766
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,460
Come on. Dig in.

767
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,039
Many videos have been posted,

768
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,039
and they're being shared in other online communities as well.

769
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,909
A number of witnesses have posted what they saw,

770
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:34,909
so people now know that Sin Dae Lyug didn't molest her.

771
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:38,150
Thank goodness. How is public opinion responding?

772
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,880
Now that people know what the man had originally said wasn't all true,

773
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,119
many are supporting Dae Lyug now.

774
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:45,050
- My gosh, what a relief. - Thank goodness.

775
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,090
- This is only fair. - I know.

776
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,559
This guy...

777
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,360
- What's wrong? - Who is it?

778
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,030
The man who attacked Mr. Sin.

779
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,670
(Sin Dae Lyug's Attacker)

780
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,170
Answer it.

781
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,210
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

782
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,909
- What are you doing? - It's okay.

783
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,079
Why did you do that?

784
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,650
You screened my calls. You can't do this.

785
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,190
Well, it's not like I wanted to write that post.

786
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,019
- Sorry? - They said...

787
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,889
it wouldn't be a problem.

788
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,730
I was asked to write it.

789
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,829
You were asked to do it? Who asked you?

790
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:30,230
Well, that's...

791
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,769
(My sincere apologies.)

792
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,739
(Last but not least, I'd like to sincerely apologize...)

793
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,570
(to Mr. Sin Dae Lyug and Neon Webtoon.)

794
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,820
Is this all you can do?

795
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:51,820
You should've made sure that idiot wouldn't talk!

796
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,119
You should've made sure the company wouldn't make a move.

797
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,130
- What? - Neon's legal team stepped in.

798
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,400
Why would our legal team...

799
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,269
I'll call you back.

800
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,480
Did you tell the legal team to step in?

801
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:24,719
Yes. I figured we should deal with it sooner than later.

802
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,389
Well, it was an incident involving only one of our artists.

803
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,389
The company had no reason...

804
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:32,590
to take such a risk to get things sorted out for him.

805
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,130
Well...

806
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:40,469
I suppose you and I don't see eye to eye...

807
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,269
when it comes to how valuable he is to the company.

808
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,880
Then you should've at least given me a heads-up.

809
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,780
Why should I?

810
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:51,449
Why should I tell you, Director Heo?

811
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,889
So he said he was asked to do it?

812
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,590
Yes.

813
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,760
- Did you record it? - Yes.

814
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,500
All right. What's going on with Sin Dae Lyug?

815
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,070
I haven't received any files from him yet.

816
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:19,610
We cannot let this affect "Weapon Feeb."

817
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:22,679
If he doesn't send anything, we'll have to skip this week.

818
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,909
People won't like that.

819
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,820
Right. They'll start talking about the incident again,

820
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,420
which could lead to more misunderstandings.

821
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:34,389
I'll visit him later today...

822
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:35,920
and have a talk with him.

823
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:38,659
All right, good work anyway.

824
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,380
Producer On.

825
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,190
Oh...

826
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,190
You're probably not sure as to how you should bring it up to him.

827
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:15,329
Yes.

828
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:19,230
When you're an editor and a webtoon producer,

829
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:21,840
you're responsible...

830
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,369
for making sure your artist's work reaches its full potential.

831
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,579
However,

832
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,949
the pain of having to create something from nothing...

833
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,010
falls squarely on the artist's shoulders.

834
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:36,949
If the artist can't create something from nothing,

835
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:39,690
even working with the most competent producer...

836
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,059
won't mean anything.

837
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,360
The pain of having to draw...

838
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,230
and create something new...

839
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,030
even when you've lost all your confidence...

840
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,369
and don't feel sure about yourself at all.

841
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:59,139
We'd never know what it's really like.

842
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,019
Visit Dae Lyug and see if you can talk to him again.

843
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:09,719
Okay.

844
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:17,929
Wait.

845
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,159
I let you down, didn't I?

846
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,670
I still believe that you can turn things around.

847
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,099
The doors are closing.

848
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,679
Wait. Would you like to come in?

849
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:38,909
No, it's okay. I'll only upset him.

850
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,780
Dae Lyug...

851
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,449
ate the food that you brought after not eating for days.

852
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:46,860
Thank goodness!

853
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,619
I should've brought more food.

854
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,230
Well...

855
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,829
Please take good care of Dae Lyug.

856
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,710
Mr. Im Dong Hee.

857
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,050
I hope you enjoy the food too.

858
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:11,880
Thank you.

859
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,449
Bye.

860
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:44,309
Hey, Dae Lyug! What are you doing?

861
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:46,179
What are you doing?

862
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,119
That woman brought this, right?

863
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,559
Hey!

864
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:00,059
Ms. On, now's not a good time.

865
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,929
What's wrong?

866
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,030
That woman came again.

867
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:06,329
You mean, your mother?

868
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,579
How dare she show up again? What does she want from me?

869
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,550
Actually, I don't even want to know.

870
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,280
I need to tell you something about your mother.

871
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,679
I don't want to know!

872
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,119
There is a reason...

873
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,559
it took her this long to find you.

874
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,860
Your mother has Alzheimer's.

875
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:38,929
One more thing.

876
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:41,440
There's something else you didn't know.

877
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,039
What is it?

878
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:55,179
When you were little, a fire broke out at your house.

879
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,860
- Oh, no. Has someone called 911? - Isn't that Dae Lyug's place?

880
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,489
- My gosh. - What started the fire?

881
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,699
- How come 911 is taking so long? - What do we do?

882
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:09,730
- Where is his mother? - Should I break down the door?

883
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,429
- My gosh. - What's going on, ladies?

884
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,599
There you are. We've got a big problem.

885
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,539
A fire broke out in your house.

886
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:18,039
- Gosh, Dae Lyug is home alone now. - Don't!

887
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:20,610
- Don't go inside. - It's dangerous!

888
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,139
- Stop her! - My gosh!

889
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,579
Oh, no.

890
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:25,650
Dae Lyug!

891
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,079
Dae Lyug!

892
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,019
Dae Lyug, hold on.

893
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,389
I'm here.

894
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,360
Dae Lyug!

895
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,800
Dae Lyug.

896
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:45,400
Wake up. Are you all right?

897
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,769
Mom, my sketchbook.

898
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,739
Okay.

899
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,280
Ouch!

900
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,789
Don't go into the kitchen, okay?

901
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,929
Okay.

902
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,510
I have to go to work. I'll be home soon.

903
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,710
Make sure you eat.

904
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,750
You can read your comic books.

905
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,380
I won't be long. Okay?

906
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:08,820
Why didn't you tell him about it?

907
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:12,150
Maybe he was traumatized by what happened.

908
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:16,519
He didn't remember anything about that fire.

909
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,989
He started the fire while playing,

910
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:23,769
so I didn't really want to tell him.

911
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,969
But...

912
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:29,070
After all, it was my fault.

913
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,610
I left that little kid...

914
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,809
alone at home.

915
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,110
So there's nothing wrong about him resenting me.

916
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,389
The fact that I am a bad mother will never change.

917
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:47,659
And I know that he'll never forgive me.

918
00:59:49,389 --> 00:59:50,530
But I guess...

919
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,289
I'm a mother after all.

920
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,469
Before I completely lose my memory,

921
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,969
I wanted to see him at least once more.

922
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,039
I thought...

923
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,179
it'd help me retain my memories of him for a little longer.

924
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,349
But I was being selfish.

925
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,260
What do I do now?

926
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,460
- My gosh. - Ms. Kang.

927
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:25,090
All I did was hurt Dae Lyug.

928
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:28,460
What should I do?

929
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,460
She's lying.

930
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:32,199
I don't remember that at all.

931
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:40,239
I need to talk to that woman and find out the truth.

932
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,809
- Sorry? - I can't let her go like this.

933
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:46,579
I'll try calling her now.

934
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,250
Ms. Kang, where are you now?

935
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,230
I should leave.

936
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,800
Please take good care of Dae Lyug.

937
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,300
Thank you, Producer On.

938

All passengers can board the bus at Gate Seven. Thank you.

and fear so much all my life?

to see you all grown up. That's why I came to see you.

No, it's not like that.

- However, - Dae Lyug...

989
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,949
if there is anyone...

990
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,050
- I'm so sorry. - who can be your Almighty,

991
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:03,119
that person is probably your parent.

992
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,130
I'm really sorry, Dae Lyug.

993
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,760
Because a child's world...

994
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:09,929
is created by their parents.

(Today's Webtoon)

996
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,079
Why didn't you tell me?

997
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:05,090
Thanks to Judo,

998
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,389
I can be this strong.

999
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:10,519
I am truly honored that my last project...

1000
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,130
was with you.

1001
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:13,889
Thank you.

1002
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:17,359
Talk about an ill-fated relationship.

1003
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,300
Right?

1004
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:22,439
I told him.

1005
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:23,800
Hey, Jun Yeong.

1006
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,270
We said we'd fight together until the end.
