If he doesn't send anything, we'll have to skip this week.

People won't like that.

They'll start talking about the incident again,

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,899
which could lead to more misunderstandings.

We'll go through it and upload it. All right.

I got the files from Mr. Sin!

Great. Forward the files to the proofreaders.

27
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,649
Double-check the episode and upload it.

28

Thank you all so much for...

51
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,649
Well done. Great work, everyone.

52
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,580
My gosh. Let's all go home now.

53
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,280
We should get some rest now that we've met the deadline.

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,188
Get going, guys.

55
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,120
- I'll be off, then. - Okay, good work.

56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,859

- Let's go! - Well done.

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,750
I'm sorry I put you in a pickle.

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,379
I was too reckless.

63
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm grateful to you.

64
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,019
Thanks to you, I learned how to work in a team.

65
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,759
My sister was my only support system. After I lost her,

66
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,000
I thought only thinking about myself was the right thing to do.

67
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,230
I feel like...

68
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,540
I'm relearning all the things that I had told myself...

69
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,670
to intentionally forget and unlearn.

70
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,339
If this is something I should put up with in return,

71
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,149
I'd rather choose to take responsibility.

72
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,149
This is funny.

73
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,050
You and me. We were very different.

74
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,689
You were all the way over there, at the end.

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,529
And I was at the other end.

76
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,759
But we met here.

77
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,800
You're like the N pole. Me, the S pole.

78
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,628
Because we're so different,

79
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,100
it was easier for us to meet halfway.

80
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,810
What? Am I being too sentimental?

81
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,040
No.

82
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,339
If we met because you were my polar opposite,

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,209
I guess I'm glad I was the way I was.

84
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,089
Hey, why are you being so sentimental all of a sudden?

85
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,790
My gosh!

86
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,899
Is today Sentimentalists' Day or something?

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,269
Anyway, thank goodness we pulled it off.

88
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,600
I need a drink.

89
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,800
Hey, you can't drink!

90
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,708
All you do is bluff.

00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,749
Hey, you're back.

94
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,578
The newest episode of "Weapon Feeb" is up.

95

Everyone is already going wild.

96
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,350
Really?

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Guess what Dad is doing now

98
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,289
What's he doing?

99
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,660
- Let's go find out - Hey, what's with you?

100
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,269
Hey, you're crazy.

101
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,709
Dad, are you crying?

102
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,050
What? No.

103
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,579
(Hope...)

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,750
This is... You were reading this webtoon?

105
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,920
I wondered why you were always so busy.

106
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,529
You made this? I'm proud of you.

107
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,029
All you knew was judo.

108
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,029
You must be under a lot of stress.

109
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,029
It is stressful, of course.

110
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,939
But you know, Dad,

111
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,339
I want to pour all my heart and soul into this...

112
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,810
because the harder I work, the more people it'll reach,

113
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,279
and the happier they'll be.

114
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,620
Every moment is like a judo match,

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,490
but no one gets hurt.

116
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,990
That gives me such a sense of relief.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,028
So no matter how stressful it gets,

118
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,089
I can keep working harder and harder.

119
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,268
- Gosh, my sweet child. - Stop it.

120
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,568
- You're being so silly, Mom. - Stop!

121
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,740
Hey, what are you doing?

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,399
- Stop! - Come here.

123
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,569
Run, ladies!

124
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,180
Run!

125
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,389
I looked into it,

126
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,790
and there's something fishy about that post.

127
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,189
What's fishy about it?

128
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,829
The person who wrote it said something odd when he met my staff.

129
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:17,568
He said someone who knew about the incident...

130
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,800
asked him to write the post.

131
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,970
And apparently, that person guaranteed him...

132
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,740
that the false info in the post wouldn't cause any problems.

133
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,058
- This is... - I'm back!

134
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,789
- Oh. - You're back.

135
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,590
Did everything go well?

136
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,460
Yes.

137
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,470
She said our plans looked good. She gave us the go-ahead.

138
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,428
That's great!

139
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,570
Actually, I've got an idea. How about we organize a contest?

140
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,740
A contest?

141
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,470
Right before the board meeting?

142
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,409
Neon Webtoon has had a lot of issues lately.

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,350
An exciting new project like that will help us improve our image.

144
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,949
Also, it'd be nice to discover some new companies...

145
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,779
and develop rapport with them.

146
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,619
- I think it's a good idea. - Right?

147
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,048
I'm in.

148
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm in too.

149
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,120
All right. We're all doing a great job.

150
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:16,690
Let's stay strong and keep going.

151
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,830
We can do this!

152
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:18,929
- Yes! - Let's go!

153
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,070
Your mother is doing well at the hospital.

154
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,100
Thank you, Ms. On.

155
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,970
No problem.

156
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:32,480
I believe my job is done.

157
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,879
Dae Lyug has caught up with work.

158
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm so grateful to you for all your help, Mr. Im.

159
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:40,820
You were a tremendous help...

160
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,719
to both me and Mr. Sin.

161
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,889
Thank you very much.

162
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,500
Thanks a lot, Dong Hee.

163
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,399
My goodness.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,428
When you suddenly asked me to teach you how to add colors,

165
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,970
I was so surprised.

166
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,470
Keep up the great work. I'll be watching you.

167
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,379
Right. When I saw that, I was...

168
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,409
It nearly got me choked up.

169
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,850
What inspired you to use colors for this episode?

170
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:15,419
Well...

171
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,769
It's so pretty.

172
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,639
I remembered...

173
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,038
the moments in my life...

174
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,638
when everything wasn't in black and white.

175
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,179
There, a butterfly!

176
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,580
I had forgotten...

177
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,519
those memories.

178
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,120
I learned a lot through this experience.

179
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,659
I owe it all to the two of you.

180
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:57,629
Thank you.

You're not alone. Never forget that, okay?

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
Okay.

Mr. Sin...

187
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,629
Did you see that? One more time.

188
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,740

Mr. Im Dong Hee was heading back home, so I went to see him.

He did so much to help us out.

No. Have you?

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,769
- I haven't eaten yet either. - Yes!

199
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
- Shall we grab a bite to eat? - Sounds good.

200
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,009
- Wow. - Oh, my.

201
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,340
- There are still places like this? - I had no idea either.

The tteokbokki place I frequented with my friends when I was little...

203
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,320
also had walls where you could doodle and write stuff.

204
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,758
Should we do it too?

- Us? - Yes.

206
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,830
Sure!

207
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:39,029
It'd be no fun to just write our names.

208
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,830

All right.

211
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,298
That's cute.

212
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,240
What? Mr. Seok! You captured all the little details.

213
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:25,639
You can draw very well.

214
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,809
Didn't I tell you that I wanted to be a comic artist when I was little?

215
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,419
Really?

216
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,918
I knew it. You're good enough to be an artist.

217
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,789
No, I'm not that good.

218
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,659
I decided to be an editor because I knew I wasn't that good.

219
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,730
I read in a book...

220
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,329
that there's a term for people like me.

221
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,898
A shadow artist.

222
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,700
A shadow artist?

223
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,210
They want to create things...

224
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,269
but are afraid of becoming practicing artists.

225
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,610
So instead, they choose to become shadows.

226
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,148
I see.

227
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,850
When I read that for the first time,

228
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,918
I felt conflicted...

229
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,350
and a little guilty too.

230
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,620
But this job...

231
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,759
change my thoughts on the word, "shadow."

232
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,470
To bring a creative work into the world,

233
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:24,399
the artist must work with others,

234
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,139
who work hard behind the scenes...

235
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,309
to give the artist all the support they need...

236
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,440
even if the spotlight isn't on them...

237
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,049
and even if people don't know that they exist.

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,179
Are you all right?

239
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:48,730
It's just something little, but the advice really comforted me.

240
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,759
I hope it can be your good friend.

Thank you.

242
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:58,769
Perhaps, it requires even more courage and dedication...

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,340
than deciding to become an artist.

244
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,809

253
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,500
I wasn't sure if you were a good fit for the editor position.

254
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,470
Mr. Jang told me he saw something in you.

255
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,679
I have no idea what it is that he saw in you.

256
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,679

Oh, I see.

259
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,919
But you managed to prove yourself every single time,

in such a dynamic manner.

261

00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,830
- Just a bit better? - Yes, a teeny-weeny bit.

331
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,048
She believes that doing good deeds...

332
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,950
will help things go smoothly at work.

333
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,019
Hold on. Is today the big day?

334
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Yes.

335
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,460
Goodness. Even the CEO wouldn't do this.

336
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,700
Sorry. We must join forces and wish her all the best.

337
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,268
- Mom, do we have any rice cake? - We have mochi.

338
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,409
That's perfect. Where is it?

339
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,609
- My gosh. - Hold on.

340
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,029
See you guys later.

341
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,399
- Good luck, sir. - See you later.

342
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,529
See you later.

343
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,569
Thanks, guys.

344
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,569
I got this!

345
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,539
See you later.

346
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,500
(I can do it!)

347
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,650
I'm taking this back. It was mine to begin with.

348
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,349
Sorry?

349
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,450
Why? Do you still need this?

350
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,490
It's about time you just believed it.

351
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,160
Lady Luck is always on our side.

352
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:23,809
(Title, Format, Based on, Director)

353
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,079
We've already signed...

354
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,379
a drama adaptation contract with Director Shin Jae Won...

355
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,049
for "Weapon Feeb,"

356
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,049
which will expand the range of its IP assets.

357
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,749
It'll be made into a global OTT series,

358
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,750
so it'll get a lot of exposure.

359
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,859
If we start working on season two upon its release,

360
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,589
it'll further expand our IP assets.

361
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,599
So at this critical time,

362
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,799
if this project falls through because of the reckless plan...

363
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,630
to acquire Youngtoon,

364
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,039
Neon will suffer a lot of damage.

365
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,279
Even if we get a whole new team, the project can continue.

366
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,880
Youngtoon is number one in the industry.

367
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm sure they're more competent than our webtoon producers.

368
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,119
Each Neon webtoon producer...

369
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,589
has formed a strong bond with the artists they manage,

370
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,759
and that's what keeps us going.

371
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,689
Producer On Ma Eum discovered Sin Dae Lyug,

372
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,630
so he deeply trusts her and relies on her.

373
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
If we assign a different producer to the project,

374
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,799
the second season of "Weapon Feeb" may fall through.

375
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,538
What's the total revenue "Weapon Feeb" brings in monthly?

376
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:28,670
A million dollars,

377
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,578
not including the revenue from the fan goods or other IP assets.

378
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,980
Then clearly, the revenue from season two won't be negligible.

379
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,720
That's right.

380
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,159
Well, TV or film adaptations of webtoons...

381
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,920
happen very often.

382
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,130
Why talk about it at this meeting in such an ambitious manner?

383
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,629
And let's be honest. Youngtoon has done...

384
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,970
way more TV or film adaptations.

385
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,000
Correct. I'm glad you pointed it out.

386
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,539
Then why do you think Youngtoon...

387
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,410
is still sitting unbudgingly on the number one spot?

388
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,579
First, they have many webtoons.

389
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,650
Second, they have good artists.

390
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,250
To be more specific,

391
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,588
they have Mo Young Soo,

392
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:20,119
who keeps pumping out great webtoons.

393
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,159
But does Neon really have to acquire Youngtoon...

394
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,000
to have that system?

395
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,869
Can we not set up such a system on our own?

396
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,368
(Drama Adaptation of "Weapon Feeb," Contract Signed)

397
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,099
(Studio Ginger, to be launched in late 2022)

398
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,838
Neon Webtoon has Na Gang Nam,

399
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,180
a talented artist whom Youngtoon wants to recruit.

400
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,209
Na Gang Nam has a lot of content he could use...

401
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,819
in addition to his webtoons.

402
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,778
If we set up a subsidiary...

403
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,150
where he can simultaneously publish the content he has,

404
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,319
we can create a lucrative, ongoing revenue stream,

405
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,859
and it'll cost us less than acquiring Youngtoon.

406
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,529
To set up a company like that,

407
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,470
we need someone we can trust in the CEO seat.

408
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes.

409
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,579
Na Gang Nam doesn't exactly have a knack for business management.

410
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,680
You're absolutely right.

411
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,049
That is why...

412
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,819
I think Assistant Editor Seok Ji Hyeong...

413
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,319
should be appointed as co-head of Ginger Studio.

414
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,589
(CEO Seok Ji Hyeong, CCO Na Gang Nam)

415
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,589
- Assistant Editor Seok Ji Hyeong? - Yes.

416
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,028
Na Gang Nam will be the Chief Creative Officer of the company,

417
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,769
who will oversee all the creative content.

418
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,369
Seok Ji Hyeong is...

419
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,568
(Seok Ji Hyeong, Assistant Editor)

420
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:41,098
From comic books to Gingertoon and Neon Webtoon,

421
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,470
he comes with a lot of experience under his belt.

422
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,808
Most importantly,

423
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,609
he worked with Na Gang Nam as his producer for many years,

424
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,348
so they'll work very well together.

425
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,519
(Wrapping Up)

426
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,549
Last but not least,

427
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,890
I'd like to ask you all a favor.

428
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,758
No one calls you a fool...

429
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,660
when you plow a barren field, sow seeds,

430
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,930
and water the field...

431
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,499
because everyone knows...

432
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,799
that a big tree will grow and bear fruit.

433
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,240
I trust that you won't make the mistake...

434
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,680
of cutting this small tree that has just begun to bloom.

435
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:24,579
That'd be all.

436
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,650
Oh, did it go well?

437
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,318
So you're the CEO of Ginger Studio now.

438
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,460
Should I tell the team? Or do you want to tell them?

439
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,499
Congratulations. Let's go.

440
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Okay.

441
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,680
They'll be so happy to hear the news.

442
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:34,079
I'm back.

443
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
So what happened?

444
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,019
Well, it's done.

445
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:43,930
What?

446
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,460
It went well.

447
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,230
They spoke highly of our future projects and plans.

448
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,838
We still have to prove ourselves through numbers,

449
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,609
but no one will bother us until we produce results.

450
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,079
Gosh, you scared me.

451
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,609
Well, guys.

452
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,319
I'm really sorry for everything, and thank you.

453
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,959
What are you talking about? You're making me tear up.

454
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,519
I really mean it. Thanks, all of you.

455
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,130
Every single one of you.

456
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,930
This wouldn't have been possible without you guys.

457
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,529
Thank you.

458
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,039
Shouldn't you say that when you make a toast at our team dinner?

459
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,769
A team dinner sounds nice.

460
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,139
Another one? I'm not going.

461
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,838
Why not? We should celebrate.

462
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,079
My feet hurt so much.

463
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,749
Then don't take off your shoes.

464
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,979
I took off my shoes?

465
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,079
My goodness.

466
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Don't drink too much. And keep your shoes on.

467
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,359
This is where it began, right?

468
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,758
- That's right. - So you remember.

469
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,430
- Of course, I do. - How do you remember that?

470
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,589
Can I have your attention for a moment?

471
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,599
I have an important announcement to make.

472
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
What is it?

473
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,930
Well...

474

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,909
We should congratulate him...

478
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,750
on his honorable departure from Neon Webtoon.

479
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,720
What are you talking about?

480
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,819
We couldn't tell you until it was finalized at the board meeting.

481
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,460
You guys must be surprised.

482
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:27,829
You can tell them yourself.

(Little Tent Bar)

484
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,539
Well...

485
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:43,509
Some of you have been working with me...

486
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,549
since our Gingertoon days.

487
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,890
Mr. Kwon,

488
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,619
Mr. Choi,

489
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,160
and Ms. Gi.

490
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,329
Man Chul, you too.

491
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:03,369
Wherever I am, I'll always be rooting for you,

492
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,599
and I'll think that we're always working together.

493
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,109
And our new producers.

494
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,940
I was very worried about you two at first.

495
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,679
But I now know that you can solve problems on your own...

496
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,750
and that both of you are such competent webtoon producers,

497
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,720
so I think...

498
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,529
I can leave with a happy heart.

499
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,200
I'll always be rooting for you no matter where I am,

500
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,529
and I feel like we'll always be a team.

501
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,400
That's it.

502
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,608
It's a great opportunity for him, and it'll be good for us too.

503
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,309
Besides, we'll work with the company on an ongoing basis.

504
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,619
So this time,

505
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,950
we should let him go with smiles on our faces.

506
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:58,990
Gosh, I'm anxious.

507
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,460
Why are you anxious? Nothing's been decided yet.

508
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,729
Anyway, it is a good thing, right?

509
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,828
Of course.

510
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,499
We should congratulate him.

511
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,169
Congratulations, Mr. CEO.

512
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,068
- Gosh, stop it. - Congratulations, Mr. Seok.

513
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,700
Thanks, Du Hee.

514
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,970
Thank you so much for everything.

515
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,980
Thanks, Jun Yeong.

516
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,909
- Thanks. - Well...I'm happy for you,

517
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,119
- but if I'm promoted... - Cheers, guys.

518
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,489
- Congratulations. - Congratulations!

519
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,548
- Oh, boy. - Gosh.

520
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,219
I'm getting emotional for some reason.

521
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,890
I don't want to be promoted to assistant editor.

522
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,859
Don't do it, then.

523
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,329
I'll do it.

524
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,569
Thank you for proving me wrong.

525
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,980
You will continue...

526
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,579
to do a great job like this, right?

527
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,240
Heads or tails?

528
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,309
You're just going to ask me without any explanation? I see.

529
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,579
I'll go with...

530
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,450
heads.

531

(Fifty cents)

532
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,590
Good luck with the interview.

533
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,630
(Fifty cents)

534
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,769
I'm taking this back. It was mine to begin with.

535
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,440
Sorry?

536
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,469
Lady Luck is always on our side.

(Goo Jun Yeong)

541
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,119
Just like Ma Eum said,

542
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,949
our team was intact.

543
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,960
Your team must be so thrilled.

544
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,130
Yes, we're thrilled.

545
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,110
Don't get carried away.

546
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,808
I'm sure you know this as a judo athlete.

547
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:15,110
Sometimes, athletes have to wait for the referee to call the games.

548
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,750
I believe that our team has won by ippon.

549
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,050
Sure. We'll see about that.

550
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,320
Bye.

551
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,230
Gosh. That contract worker is getting on my nerves too.

552
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,139
Gosh. Darn it.

553
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,679
So I'm sorry to tell you...

554
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,420
that another producer will be replacing me.

555
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,090
Actually, there is no need for that.

556
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,719
What do you mean?

557
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,760
I'm planning to take a break for some time.

558
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,629
Sir. Is it because I've offended you in some way?

559
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,800
No.

560
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:16,340
My back pain has become unbearable now.

561
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,940
If I were to stop drawing,

562
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,710
I would be okay.

563
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,079
But if I were to complete my work with the effort it requires,

564
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,650
I will definitely need to get surgery.

565
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:33,519
Producer Jung was my editor.

566
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,090
So I'll wait until Producer Jung comes back to work...

567
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,199
and try to get better.

568
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,300
My goal will be not losing my touch...

569
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,139
during this break.

570
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,840
This must have been a difficult decision to make.

571
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,510
I'm sorry about this.

572
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,909
I know this is an important time for you guys.

573
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm sorry that I'm taking a break now.

574
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,280
Gosh, no.

575
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,948
Your health comes first before everything.

576
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,489
But I have some episodes saved up.

577
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,860
So I won't be gone for a long time.

578
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:12,329
You don't have to worry about work at all.

579
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,730
Please only focus on getting better, sir.

580
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,199
Please rest as much as you need and come back healthy.

581
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:25,710
You haven't forgotten the promise you made to us, right?

582
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:30,679
You promised to complete the Dragon series with a bang.

583
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,019
Right. Yes, I did promise you that.

584
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,590
You guys promised me that you would do everything...

585
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,519
to help me put the best finishing touches...

586
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,860
on my comic artist's career.

587
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,059
Well,

588
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,400
thank you.

589
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,940
Does it smell? I don't smell anything.

590
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,139
What about this?

591
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,809
Okay.

592
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,280
- This might be good. - No. I can't eat that.

593
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,018
- I don't even want to smell it. - But you need to eat something.

594
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:08,420
No. I'm not eating that. I can't eat anything.

595
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,150
Dumpling must be here.

596
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:12,789
Gosh.

597
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:19,360
Ta-da.

598
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:23,599
I'm here. And I come bearing tteokbokki, your favorite.

599
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,469
Tteokbokki!

600
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,800
She can't eat tteokbokki.

601
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,539
- Gosh. - She had bad morning sickness.

602
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,710
Wait.

603
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,839
You said you couldn't eat anything.

604
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,679
I guess I was craving Dumpling.

605
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,349
The moment I saw her, my appetite came back.

606
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,920
Mr. Na. I'm really sad.

607
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,860
I heard you would be working with Mr. Seok now.

608
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,429
You can't steal Mr. Seok from us.

609
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,599
I didn't steal him.

610
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,229
You guys tied me down at Neon,

611
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,730
promising that you would launch every single webtoon of mine.

612
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,829
Then I need someone to help me raise my babies.

613
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,869
Raise your babies? Who's raising my baby?

614
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,539
No. I'm raising your baby.

615
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,079
- Right. - Yes. Keep eating.

616
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,250
Only a producer knows...

617
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,380
how to sell it.

618
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,919
I believe in him.

619
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,448
An editor like him...

620
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,090
will do a fine job at producing my webtoons.

621
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,119
You guys are perfect partners.

622
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,059
- What? - The thing is, Mr. Seok told me...

623
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,400
that it was only up to the artists to create something from nothing.

624
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,469
He said there was nothing an editor could do.

625
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,039
But you just said that it was up to the editor...

626
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,010
to find the opportunities for the webtoons to succeed.

627
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,210
He's like a mom.

628
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,210
Then does it mean Mr. Seok is your mom?

629
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,380
What?

630
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,920
You told me that you guys created "Princess Kumiho" together.

631
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,260
Right. Yes. That's true.

632
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,259
But... Gosh. Why does it feel so creepy?

633
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,159
- Gosh. That's creepy even to me. - You know?

634
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:06,599
Goodness.

635
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,309
I know I'm late. Sorry.

636
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,239
I just got here too.

637
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:14,579
You must be tired. You had to meet your deadline.

638
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,179
You must be more tired. You just got off work.

639
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,219
How's Neon doing these days?

640
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,820
I think things are going well again.

641
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,920
The prize money for the upcoming contest is pretty big.

642
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,960
Do you think about drawing webtoons again?

(Director Heo Kwan Young's Recording File)

645
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,590
You're putting me in a tight spot.

646
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,429
You clearly told me that you were going to acquire...

647
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,530
my company at the price we settled.

648
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:11,429
Gosh. Those cockroaches. I'm so sick of them.

649
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,538
I took your word...

650
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,239
and started several projects and received investments.

651
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,809
I can't take care of them alone.

652

Ms. Kim.

653
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:22,610
You see? I won't go down alone.

654
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:25,178
If people find out...

655
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,579
you have shares of my company under borrowed names,

656
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,920
I wonder what will happen.

657
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,389
I don't care how. You must keep your promise.

658
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,170
I'm tired.

00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,419
There isn't much to offer. But...

660
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,920
What is this? You're getting me excited.

661
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,658
This hits the spot.

662
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,300
I actually ran out of coffee.

663
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,639
I was thinking about going outside to buy some.

664
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,340
Yes. This hits the spot.

665
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,210
By the way, shouldn't you be going home?

666
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,309
Even if I go home,

667
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,849
I'll probably be checking the entries for the contest.

668
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,320
Why? Does it look like I never leave the office?

669
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,320
No. It's not that. I feel bad.

670
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,828
Holding a contest isn't a simple task.

671
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,159
And I feel like I might have dumped all the work on you.

672
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:47,599
Well, I'm used to the workload.

673
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,569
It's been like this ever since Gingertoon.

674
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,670
Goodness. I feel worse now.

675
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,638
It's tough, right?

676
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:57,940
Of course.

677
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,110
I want to have hobbies too.

678
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,349
I want to see my friends too.

679
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,650
You know what?

680
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,678
You should have told us what you wanted to do.

681
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,279
You could have taken a long vacation too.

682
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,349
Vacation?

683
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:12,420
Do you know what I do on vacation?

684
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,590
I see. You must read webtoons.

685
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:19,399
Yes. Even when I went on trips,

686
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,869
I found myself reading webtoons at nice cafes.

687
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,599
Gosh. You're just like me.

688
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,598
I wonder why I work so hard...

689
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,340
when no one knows how much work I do for this.

690
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:32,369
But when I read the webtoons, it feels rewarding too.

691
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,679
I must love my job for now.

692
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,050
We turned the corner on this one.

693
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,820
So you should go on a long vacation this time.

694
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,159
Even if you end up reading webtoons,

695
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,359
isn't it nicer to read them at a nice vacation spot?

696
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,389
Then send me on vacation.

697
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,428
Okay. You should take a long vacation this time.

698
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:55,500
Okay.

699
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,269
Oh, right. How is Mr. Baek doing?

700
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,769
He will be getting a new editor again.

701
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,739
Mr. Baek is getting surgery?

702
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,509
Given the current condition he's in,

703
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,820
he thinks it will be too much for him to finish the webtoon.

704
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:15,619
I bet it won't be an easy operation.

705
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:16,949
Right.

706
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,389
As this was a hard decision for him,

707
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,489
we must respect his decision.

708
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,889
In the end, he made that decision for the sake of his work.

709
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,429
That's the spirit of a master on a different level.

710
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,360
He's amazing.

711
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,329
How's the contest going, Producer Gi?

712
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,940
We have to select the webtoons that will pass the preliminaries.

713
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:36,638
If you haven't sent me your recommendations,

714
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,269
please do so fast.

715
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,639
- I chose mine. - Which one is it?

716
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,480
"Travel Trouble."

717
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:45,678
Even if it doesn't win, I would like to work on it.

718
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,420
It was so memorable for me.

719
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,449
I see. Didn't you pick that one, Producer Kwon?

720
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,919
You already had your eyes on it...

721
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,960
and said you wanted to launch it on our platform.

722
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,190
You two must have similar tastes.

723
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,058
Like how you both wanted Ms. Goo Seul A.

724
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,299
Gosh. That's crazy.

725
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,800
That's not crazy. It happens.

726
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,468
Please take care of the contest, Producer Gi.

727
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:09,000
Is there anything else that needs to be discussed?

728
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,269
None, right? The meeting is over.

729
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:12,979
- Ms. On. - Yes?

730
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,339
- Can I talk to you for a second? - Okay.

731
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,409
Good meeting.

732
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,650
No way!

733
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,929
How long did you train as a judo athlete?

734
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,599
I trained for 15 years.

735
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,569
Then why don't you work with me...

736
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,130
for 15 years at Neon?

737
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,210
Does it mean...

738
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,679
You'll no longer be a contract worker.

739
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:52,949
How?

740
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,420
All thanks to your hard work.

741
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,618
How could we not hire a passionate hard worker?

742
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,460
If we didn't, it would've been Neon's loss.

743
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:02,489
Congratulations.

744
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,529
Come out after you enjoy the moment for a bit longer.

745
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,630
Okay.

746
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,860
This feels great.

747
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,190
How long have you been standing there?

748
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:39,860
Congratulations.

749
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,268
- Congratulations - Congratulations

750
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,299
- Congratulations - Congratulations

751
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,899
- Congratulations - Congratulations

752
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,500
- On getting the permanent position - On getting the permanent position

753
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,469
Producer On. Congratulations on the permanent position.

754
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:56,110
Congratulations. Gosh. We have another happy occasion to celebrate.

755
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,880
Gosh. That startled me. I told you I didn't want to do this.

756
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,288
Good work. Since we have similar tastes,

757
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,489
let's fight hard.

758
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:06,760
Congratulations, Ma Eum.

759
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,558
Goodness.

760
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,859
Who made you cry? Who is it?

761
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,030
Gosh. Good work.

762
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,630
- All right. - I'll work hard!

763
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:17,929
Okay.

764
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,869
- Okay. - Congratulations!

765
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,340
Gosh.

766
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:28,079
Goodness. Are you that happy?

767
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,150
I got the permanent position! Let's go!

768
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,448
(We regret to inform you...)

769
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,719
(that you did not pass the final interview.)

770
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,679
(On Ma Eum)

771
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,460
No one is home.

772
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,659
I'm home!

773
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,328
Ma Eum! Congratulations!

774
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,698
- Ma Eum! - My goodness.

775
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:58,329
Congratulations, my baby.

776
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,139
- Here. - Make a wish.

777
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:07,379
- Congratulations - Congratulations

778
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,210
- Congratulations - Congratulations

779
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,249
- Yes! - Yes!

780
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:22,960
- On Ma Eum! - On Ma Eum!

781
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,829
It's fun to plan a new webtoon together.

782
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:32,030
Gosh. But it's making me sad.

783
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,670
What do you mean?

784
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,170
I shouldn't have followed my gut. I should have discussed...

785
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,480
"The Beginning of Men" at length with you guys.

786
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,449
Things were iffy back then.

787
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,819
It breaks my heart to even think about that webtoon.

788
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,320
But it was the right call to end the webtoon.

789
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,360
I got hurt from so many hate comments.

790
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:55,760
I wasn't myself for a while after I ended the webtoon.

791
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,389
Especially that girl, Webtoon Witch.

792
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,199
You all saw her video, right?

793
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,800
- Yes. - Exactly.

794
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,269
I was so furious that I couldn't focus on my work.

795
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:09,169
How could she post several videos just to trash talk about his work?

796
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,570
Is she Webtoon Forecast? Why did she predict the plot?

797
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:14,308
Someone wrote that they read my webtoon...

798
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:17,480
just to enjoy Webtoon Witch's review videos.

799
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,780
Gosh. I was really shocked.

800
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:26,659
- Producer On, are you bored? - Are you bored?

801
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,889
Am I bored?

802
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,559
Gosh. That mean girl, Webtoon Witch.

803
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,230
- You seem uncomfortable. - Uncomfortable.

804
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,429
Uncomfortable? Gosh. Why...

805
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,198
I ought to smack her.

806
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:41,300
Goodness. Get my smack. Seriously.

807
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,510
Should we talk outside?

808
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:47,109
We used to brainstorm at a comic book cafe.

809
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,110
That was pretty fun.

810
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,479
Right. We could read comic books to get inspired during a break.

811
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,179
Right. Doesn't your family run a comic book cafe?

812
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,019
Why don't we go to your family's cafe?

813
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,849
We can go and get inspired. It will be a nice way to refresh.

814
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:02,019
Goodness. I wonder how you knew that.

815
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,428
Well, our comic book cafe... That's a bit...

816
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:07,460
What is it?

817
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:11,198
I see. They don't like me?

818
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,639
No! My family loves you.

819
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,908
But not today. It's...

820
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:20,380
Gosh. Today?

821
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,448
Five boxes.

822
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:29,618
I'm home.

823
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:30,949
- You're home. - Hey.

824
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:36,960
Gosh.

825
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,630
Hello.

826
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:39,829
Goodness.

827
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,659
Honey, come here.

828
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,300
I'm not dreaming, right?

829
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:47,099
This is really happening. Sorry.

830
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,369
Gosh. It's you, Mr. Oh. I can't believe this.

831
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,968
I'm a huge fan.

832
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,178
Hey, what's going on?

833
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:55,839
I heard that your family had a comic book cafe,

834
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,409
so I asked her if we could come.

835
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,380
I really love comic book cafes too.

836
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,718
- Hello. - Hi.

837
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:03,788
Hi.

838
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:06,389
I'm Ms. On's colleague. My name is Choi Du Hee.

839
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,760
Hello. She told me a lot about her team. Nice to meet you.

840
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:12,659
Mr. Oh, can I get an autograph?

841
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,698
Of course. I would be happy to.

842
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:16,259
Honey, I have a limited edition...

843
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,868
of "Ghost Kitchen" on the table in the living room.

844
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,699
Bring the book, a pen, and a piece of paper.

845
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,710
I'm her dad.

846
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,468
Why don't you take a seat?

847
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,940
- Right. Please sit. - Sure.

848
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,650
Where's Nu Ri?

849
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:33,150
Nu Ri.

850
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,349
Why is Dad rushing upstairs?

851
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,489
Gosh.

852
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,219
He's really here. So cover your mouth.

853
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,530
You're Ms. On's younger sister?

854
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,669
Yes. Then have a good time.

855
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,198
Hey, Nu Ri. Stay and have a chat.

856
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,909
Mr. Oh is going to give us an autograph.

857
00:53:56,969 --> 00:53:59,468
You always read his webtoons.

858
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,808
- Mom, No. - Of course you do.

859
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:05,210
Nu Ri is also a huge fan of webtoons.

860
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:06,979
She always reads your webtoons.

861
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,750
What was that called? "The Beginning of Men."

862
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,218
She kept reading that over and over again.

863
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:13,789
That's so touching.

864
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,059
- I feel so grateful. - Same here.

865
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,389
- I was the producer in charge. - What?

866
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,429
I see. His producer is here too.

867
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:24,500
By the way, they must be so tired.

868
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,499
Right. You seem very tired.

869
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,638
Not at all. Coming here definitely rejuvenated me.

870
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,669
No. My mom is pestering you for an autograph.

871
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,639
And people over there recognized you. Then...

872
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,308
It will drain your energy very quickly.

873
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:37,480
Right. It will drain your energy.

874
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,650
I love this.

875
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:41,579
You're so handsome.

876
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:43,948
- You're handsome. - Just read your comic book.

877
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,518
Hey. He's right.

878
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,289
It's great to communicate with his fans. Goodness.

879
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,460
Those of you who are here, this is your lucky day.

880
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,328
Right. Let's do a signing event with his fans.

881
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:57,570
Why would he give out autographs here now?

882
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,900
Some of them are hardcore fans.

883
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,000
Right. It's dangerous here.

884
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,268
It's dangerous here.

885
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,010
That's possible. Shall we go?

886
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,038
- No. Let's do an event. - I...

887
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,339
We can tell them about "The Beginning of Men."

888
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,379
- I'll see him out. - He just got here.

889
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,149
- Isn't he leaving so soon? - I'll be back!

890
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,619
Gosh. Wait.

891
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,288
This isn't right. Goodness. What am I going to do?

892
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:19,989
I found it. "Ghost Kitchen."

893
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,860
They all left!

894
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,190
Are you crazy?

895
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,928
- Nu Ri. - What?

896
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,629
Look what you made me do!

897
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,129
You kicked him out too. Why are you blaming me now?

898
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,300
You shouldn't have provided a reason for me to kick him out.

899
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,339
You criticized his work a lot.

900
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,439
If he knew you were the Webtoon Witch,

901
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,578
it would've gone very badly.

902
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:41,679
Webtoon Witch?

903
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,710
You've been there the whole time?

904
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,050
Webtoon Witch...

905
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,018
Didn't she criticize the webtoon Ma Eum worked on?

906
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,250
Was that you, Nu Ri?

907
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,559
Who's this Webtoon Witch?

908
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,429
Nu Ri, did you badmouth your sister?

909
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,800
Gosh. I didn't badmouth her.

910
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,299
I critiqued. Let's use advanced vocabulary.

911
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,499
Then you should've told your sister about it in advance.

912
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,969
You knew she was upset.

913
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,638
I started it before her.

914
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:12,739
It was before she became a webtoon producer.

915
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,349
There wasn't time for it. Sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

916
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,679
But I didn't do this to complicate things for her.

917
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,250
You guys always blame me for everything.

918
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:27,059
What's gotten into her? What happened?

919
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:28,820
It's nothing.

920
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,090
What is it?

921
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:33,730
I didn't mean this to happen either.

922
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,820
I wasn't going to tell our parents about it like that.

923
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:03,730
Sorry.

924
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,460
Whatever.

925
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,769
Recently,

926
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,670
someone said this line of work is similar to what shadow artists do.

927
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,639
I could relate to that.

928
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,179
Webtoon producers...

929
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:24,710
quietly stay by the artists' side like their shadows.

930
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,779
And people don't know about us...

931
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,349
just like they don't pay attention to shadows.

932
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:33,349
It wasn't what you wanted.

933
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,960
But you became...

934
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,658
someone else's shadow at a young age.

935
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:39,889
I can't imagine how you felt.

936
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,629
Since we were kids, our parents paid more attention to me...

937
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,768
because I was training to be a judo athlete.

938
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:49,769
You must have been disappointed and upset. Right?

939
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,340
You're much cooler when you're in a spotlight.

940
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,380
I'll be honest about your channel.

941
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,718
Gosh. You're so annoying in that.

942
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:04,389
But I watched the whole thing because it was fun. How annoying.

943
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,860
- Really? - Yes. Seriously.

944
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,889
Now that I'm assisting the artists,

945
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,500
I'm realizing how much sacrifices our family made...

946
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:20,300
when I was a judo athlete.

947
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,039
From now on,

948
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,309
I'll give you intel about webtoons...

949
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,650
and help your channel.

950
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,519
And...

951
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,190
I know that this was your thing first...

952
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,760
because you're the person who got me into comics.

953
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,070
You were the one who recommended me...

954
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,739
to read "Princess Kumiho" when I was injured.

955
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,809
I began to like webtoons afterward.

956
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:02,939
In a way, I might have become a webtoon producer...

957
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,650
thanks to your influence.

958
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,949
You gave me something to love as much as judo.

959
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,360
Thank you so much. I mean it.

960
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,860
I didn't get that.

961
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,230
What did you say?

962
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,539
Thank you. I mean it.

963
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,940
- Happy now? - Yes.

964
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:33,570
- Happy now? - Yes.

965
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:38,079
Mr. Baek's surgery is tomorrow.

966
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,779
- Yes. - It will take months...

967
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,719
for him to recover after the surgery.

968
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:46,090
We should find another webtoon to fill in the sales we'll lose.

969
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,260
But when Mr. Baek comes back,

970
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,159
he promised to complete the Dragon series with us.

971
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:55,900
Let's keep working hard.

972
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,629
- Okay. - Okay.

973
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,199
I have big news!

974
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,569
- What is it? - Director Heo Kwan Young...

975
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,139
is getting interrogated by the audit team right now.

976
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,920
Who are you guys?

977
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,190
Director Heo, we're from the audit team at the head office.

978
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:27,030
Please cooperate.

979
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Get started.

980
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,469
Who gave you the order?

981
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,130
Are you sure you can handle the consequences?

982
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,449
Check the inside of the drawer thoroughly.

983
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:51,519
Ma'am.

984
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,420
Why are you doing this to me now?

985
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,329
I thought...

986
01:00:57,889 --> 01:01:00,900
you were indispensable to our company.

987
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,530
Sometimes, you do dance around the line.

988
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,599
But such threats...

989
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:10,670
make the ecosystem run smoothly.

990
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:15,280
But I received a report I could not dismiss.

991
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:18,449
A report?

992
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:21,779
I don't know who told you what.

993
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,019
We can take this to the end.

994
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,550
But...

995
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:31,329
a resignation from you would be best for everyone.

996
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,369
Gosh.

997
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:43,299
So this is the end.

998
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,239
Doesn't that hit the spot?

999
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,610
This feels more anticlimactic.

1000
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,239
Is it because it feels surreal?

1001
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:52,349
But isn't it much better than his corruption getting covered up?

1002
01:01:52,949 --> 01:01:55,449
Well, right.

1003
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,659
This is great.

1004
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,500
Who wrote "idiot" and "fool" here?

1005
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:19,309
I'll go talk to him.

1006
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,659
I told the managing director.

1007
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:38,889
- Tell her what? - Everything Mr. Heo made me do.

1008
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,699
And I gave her a recording file too.

1009
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,070
It's obvious that he was behind...

1010
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,340
Mr. Sin's scandal too.

1011
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,440
I knew he would keep coming after our team.

1012
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,209
Jun Yeong.

1013
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,780
We decided to fight this to the end.

1014
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,079
Thanks.

1015
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,569
(Operating Center)

1016
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,809
Honey, be strong.

1017
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:32,349
(Operating Center)

1018
01:03:58,639 --> 01:03:59,940
Are you all right?

1019
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Yes.

1020
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,349
Any news from Mr. Baek?

1021
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:08,349
No. Not yet.

1022
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:13,590
Yes, ma'am.

1023
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,389
How did it go? Did the surgery go well?

1024
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:21,900
Yes. That's great news.

1025
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,599
Yes. Then we'll visit him soon.

1026
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:28,800
Yes. I'll call you before we go.

1027
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,469
Okay.

1028
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,469
Is he okay?

1029
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,109
Yes. He just came out of surgery.

1030
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,440
Luckily, it went well.

1031
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,749
That's great. Let's go see him in the hospital later.

1032
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,519
- Okay. - Can I go too?

1033
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,920
Mr. Sin is very worried too. Can we come too?

1034
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,928
Sure. Let's go together.

1035
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,889
- Get ready then. - Okay.

1036
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:57,429
(Intensive Care Unit)

1037
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,699
He just came out of the surgery. Why is he in the ICU?

1038
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,210
Maybe, the recovery room is inside.

1039
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,979
I see. Smart.

1040
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,650
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

1041
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,409
Is something wrong?

1042
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:16,480
My husband isn't waking up.

1043
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,150
What?

1044
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,110
(Today's Webtoon)

1045
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,479
(With a step forward, today is different from yesterday.)

1046
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,750
I haven't even thanked him properly.

1047
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:25,519
If we launch the webtoon as it is, will it be a hit?

1048
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,920
You can step back from this.

1049
01:06:26,989 --> 01:06:28,260
It will be different this time.

1050
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,059
I regretted it a lot after giving up on the chance...

1051
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:33,630
to work with you.

1052
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,000
I feel like working on the team...

1053
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:40,000
has totally healed me.

1054
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,909
I feel like the On Ma Eum I know would've managed to overcome it.

1055
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:47,579
That moment, I realized...

1056
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,349
that I was ready to cross the last threshold.

1057
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:57,449
