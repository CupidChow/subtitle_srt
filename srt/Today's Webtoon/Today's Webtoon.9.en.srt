Oh, hello.

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,519
This is pretty.

16
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,060
This one?

17
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,269
Hey! Over here!

18
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,008
- Hey. - Don't.

19
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,080
Who are you?

20
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,948
- Babe, don't. - What are you doing? Hold on.

21
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,549
- People are watching. - What were you drawing?

22
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,219
Show me. Hand it over!

23
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,619
Come on. Hand it over.

24
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,159
Babe, please!

25
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,818
- Come here. Hand it over. - Stop.

26
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,659
- Please! - Let go. Hand it over!

27
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,430
- My gosh! - Darn it.

28
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,300
You crazy loser!

29
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,629
My gosh! Babe, stop!

30
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,068
- Hey! - Stop! Don't record this, please.

31
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:48,039
- Stop. - Let go. Hand it over!

(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

35
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,489
We checked, and Mr. Sin was actually the one who was assaulted.

36
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,460
This jerk tried to touch my girlfriend.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,930
Is it true?

38
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,039
- Don't lie! - Calm down! He really didn't.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,469
But he did follow me around, which creeped me out.

40
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,810
He stared at me and kept giving me a creepy look.

41
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,479
I was...

42
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,580
working on my sketches.

43
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,259
Let me introduce myself properly.

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,129
I'm Kim Young Sin, the CEO of Youngtoon.

45
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,930
Thank you.

46
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,639
You must be surprised by my unannounced visit.

47
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,909
Yes, I was a little surprised.

48
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,908
It's rare to have the CEO of a company come all the way here...

49
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,080
to meet me in person.

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,750
I figured you'd say no right away...

51
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,620
if I asked you through someone else.

52
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,889
Mr. Seok, I would like to recruit you...

53
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,829
as the chief editor of Youngtoon.

54
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,709
Mr. Sin, why did you do such a thing?

55
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,310
Mr. Sin, today...

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,350
Do you know what today means to me?

57
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,259
We made the official decision to publish your webtoon, "Weapon Feeb."

58
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,628
It's the most joyous, rewarding day...

59
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,229
in my career as a webtoon producer...

60
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,300
because your dream finally came true.

61
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,230
But...

62
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,769
I couldn't understand the emotions of the new female character,

63
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,370
so I drew her based on someone who looked like her.

64
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,240
So you made others uncomfortable because of your webtoon?

65
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,579
Mr. Sin.

66
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,250
Of course, your webtoon is important.

67
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,620
But people come first.

68
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,759
You keep forgetting that.

69
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,370
I'm sorry. I should go home.

70
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,769
Don't abandon me.

71
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,839
To me,

72
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,480
you're like the Almighty.

73
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,448
I can sort of see...

74
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,318
why he said to me you were like a deity to him.

75
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,189
People don't like me.

76
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,660
And no one liked my work either.

77
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,120
But...

78
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:57,230
you were the first person who accepted me for who I was.

79
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,500
You said I was valuable too...

80
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,069
and believed in me.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,809
- Mr. Sin, I was... - I'll do as you say.

82
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,779
I'll never do the things that you don't like, so please...

83
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,079
don't abandon me.

84
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,569
A penny for your thoughts?

86
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,240
Jun Yeong.

87
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,350
- Come on. Let's go. - Oh!

88
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,949
Are you upset because of what happened yesterday?

89
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,990
Jun Yeong, can I ask you a favor?

90
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,399
A favor? What is it?

91
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,430
That incident involving Mr. Sin.

92
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,399
Can you please not tell anyone at work?

93
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,810
If anyone finds out, you'll be in a pickle.

94
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm worried they'd cancel the decision to publish his webtoon.

95
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,079
I'll make sure you won't be affected.

96
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,649
- Okay. - Thanks.

97
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,060
My apologies, sir.

98
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,300
I missed your call because I had to work late.

99
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,699
I suppose you always give your best in everything you do.

100
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,009
Thanks to you,

101
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,040
the team can keep their spot on the homepage.

102
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,579
What's going on with Na Gang Nam?

103
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,350
He's decided...

104
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,420
to start a short project with Youngtoon on the side.

105
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,089
While keeping up with his series on Neon?

106
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,588
Was that all you too?

107
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,160
- That's... - I believe in actions, not words.

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,129
I have to say, you seem to be faltering these days.

109
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,009
If you've had a change of heart, just tell me.

110
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm just trying to give you a chance because I'd hate to see you...

111
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,980
waste your potential.

112
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,219
Attention, everyone. I have awesome news.

113
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,319
Young people these days don't use the word "awesome" often.

114
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,120
Then I'll say it's uber-awesome news.

115
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,860
Okay, what is it?

116
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
I managed to track down Ma Hae Kyu.

117
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,359
- What? - My gosh.

118
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,628
Ma Hae Kyu? The one who wrote "Please, I Need a Time Machine?"

119
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,700
Yes.

120
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,099
He's practically been living in hiding for long.

121
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,669
You're so well-connected.

122
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I called everyone I had known since before the birth of digital comics.

123
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,209
"Please, I Need a Time Machine" is so popular right now.

124
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,308
Wouldn't it be amazing to release a remake as a webtoon?

125
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,120
Persuading him won't be easy.

126
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
Right, it won't be easy.

127
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,349
So I must step in.

128
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,918
You'll try to persuade him yourself?

129
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,418
I worked with him in the past.

130
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,959
Anyway, that said... Ma Eum and Jun Yeong.

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,058
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

132
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,330
I'm just going to call you guys Producer On-Goo from now on.

133
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,860
You two should come with me.

134
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,370
I think it'd be good to talk about your proposals too.

135
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,539
- Sure, sounds good. - Okay.

136
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,340
- We can do it! - Yes!

137
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,740
We got this!

138
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,379
All right. Let's do this.

139
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,219
I met Mr. Ma Hae Kyu for the first time...

140
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,750
when I was a rookie like you guys.

141
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,820
He was such a famous comic book artist back then.

142
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,190
What does he do now?

143
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,529
Nothing. He left the industry many years ago.

144
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,460
I don't even know if he'll remember me.

145
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,370
I don't feel as nervous because you guys are with me.

146
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,808
Mr. Ma Hae Kyu knows that you're coming, right?

147
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,610
His daughter answered the phone.

148
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,710
She said I should come and talk to him in person.

149
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,009
My goodness.

150
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,210
I assumed he'd be wealthy, from his royalties alone.

151
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,679
He was, but he blew it all.

152
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,519
On stocks and gambling.

153
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,490
Mr. Ma.

154
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,330
Mr. Ma Hae Kyu!

155
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,629
His daughter said he was always home.

156
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,259
Mr. Ma Hae Kyu.

157
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,200
Who are you?

158
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,668
Oh, you must be Yu Na.

159
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,638
We spoke on the phone. I'm Jang Man Chul.

160
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,009
Neon's chief editor.

161
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,909
Is your father home?

162
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,679
Come on in.

163
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,789
Hello?

164
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,360
My shift starts soon. Please leave in 30 minutes.

165
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,929
I guess your mother isn't home now.

166
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,070
Well...

167
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,440
Your mother likes watermelon, so I got this for her.

168
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,970
Your mother would be very excited to see me.

169
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,109
She cooked for me a bunch of times.

170
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,610
She makes really good kimchi stew.

171
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,110
Well...

172
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,679
- When will she be home? - She died.

173
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,960
His room is over there.

174
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,100
Let's go.

175
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,539
Mr. Ma, may I come in?

176
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,289
Mr. Ma.

177
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,000
How have you been?

178
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,099
We worked together when I was at "Flow," the comic magazine.

179
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm Jang Man Chul.

180
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,509
Jang Man Chul?

181
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,610
When I lived in Apgujeong-dong,

182
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,249
you always came to my place to pick up the manuscripts.

183
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,210
Yes, that's right. You remember me.

184
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:00,319
Please sit.

185
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,450
Thank you.

186
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,470
Do you still like baseball?

187
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,809
What was the team called? Monsters?

188
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,339
Are you still a fan of that bottom-ranked team?

189
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,740
Of course. I'd rather not watch baseball than be a traitor.

190
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,080
That's a good line.

191
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,750
I should use it next time.

192
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,229
Anyway, what brings you here?

193
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,359
I'm here to talk to you about...

194
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
"Please, I Need a Time Machine."

195
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,128
We'd like to publish a remake of it as a webtoon...

196
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,499
and wanted to consult you first.

197
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
No!

198
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,570
Comic books must be read on paper.

199
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:00,409
My work should not be read on your tiny phone screen.

200
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,220
Right. But the cuts in your work are just amazing.

201
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,919
If we change that to fit the webtoon format,

202
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,319
it'll be a hit.

203
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,489
It'll be a great opportunity to let young readers know about your work.

204
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,259
Bring me a million dollars, and I'll think about it.

205
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,809
I poured my heart and soul into it.

206
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,049
A million dollars is way out of our budget,

207
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,720
but we'll do our very best.

208
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,719
Of course,

209
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,450
you'll keep 100 percent of your royalties.

210
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,888
We'll increase your prepayment as much as possible...

211
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,259
so you can improve your home and the space where you work...

212
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,820
He still thinks he's a big-shot comic book artist.

213
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,519
- He is the best comic artist. - Who cares?

214
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,690
No one even remembers him.

215
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,658
To help him make a comeback,

216
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,860
my mom worked herself to the bone before she died.

217
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,100
I feel so bad for her.

218
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,169
He's a piece of garbage.

219
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,909
Gosh.

220
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,250
We'll be back.

221
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,049
You're wasting your time.

222
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,350
Nothing will change even if you come back.

223
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,888
If you ever need our help,

224
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,029
call me.

225
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,628
Feel free to call me...

226
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,129
when you're bored or have food cravings.

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,809
We're rooting for you, Yu Na! See you again soon.

229
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,080
Call me.

230
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,759
(On Ma Eum)

231
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,789
Keep in mind what you saw today.

232
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,398
I brought you guys along to help you...

233
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,570
better understand the artists you'll meet as webtoon producers.

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,139
- Especially you, Producer On. - Yes, sir.

235
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,110
I suggest you pay more attention to Sin Dae Lyug.

236
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,939
The lives of those...

237
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,609
whose work has become their everything...

238
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,149
tend to unfold the same way.

239
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,049
Their work is ingenious,

240
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,250
but their lives are often thrown out of balance.

241
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,049
We must make sure their ingenuity...

242
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,690
doesn't get fired up and die off quickly.

243
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,189
It is our job to help them shine for a long time.

244
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,259
That is our role and duty as producers.

245
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,130
Yes, I'll always remember that.

(Producer On Ma Eum)

249
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,788
Mr. Sin.

250
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,589
It's me, On Ma Eum. Are you inside?

251
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:36,630
(No smoking)

252
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,240
Mr. Sin.

253
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,269
Ms. On.

254
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,680
May I come in for a moment?

255
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:59,920
Sure, yes.

256
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,400
You are getting enough sleep, right?

257
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,838
What about dinner? Have you eaten?

258
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,009
Yes.

259
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,880
I ate that premade meal.

260
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,220
This is not good. Let's go have dinner.

261
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,818
- What? - Hurry.

262
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,160
Get ready and meet me outside.

263
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,259
Okay.

264
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:49,930
Mr. Sin.

265
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,670
Like I said the other day,

266
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,409
your webtoon is very important,

267
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,970
but people come first.

268
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,579
Right.

269
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,809
And you are one of those "people."

270
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,719
You must eat nourishing meals...

271
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,750
and get enough sleep, okay?

272
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,259
But I can't stop thinking about the plot.

273
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,369
What did I say?

274
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,769
- Eat well. - Eat well...

275
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:26,440
- And? - and sleep well.

276
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,109
Good.

277
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,839
The meat will burn. Eat up.

278
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,210
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

279

"Coach is here. Assemble, everyone."

285
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,298
- He hits the ball like this. - Yes.

286
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,169
- It creates a sense of urgency. - Look at this!

287
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,739
- Yes. - You drew this?

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,420
Goo Jun Yeong.

292

- How could you? - Pardon me?

293
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,828
"Full Count" is already ranked number four.

294
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,829
This rookie did such an amazing job!

295
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,160
Really?

296
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,940
(4th "Full Count")

297
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,869
Congratulations. It will soon get to the royal stage.

298
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,869
Thank you.

299
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,139
Producer Kwon, you should work harder.

300
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,009
"The Law of Girls" might soon be caught up.

301
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,849
Yes. He's doing a good job.

302
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,519

The comments are all positive.

306
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,189
Congratulations. Gosh, I'm jealous of you.

307
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,900
"Weapon Feeb" will do well too.

Aren't you going for lunch?

310
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,740
Hi.

311
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,690
Did it not go well with Mr. Ma yesterday?

312
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,650
He's...

313
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,990
gone too far.

314
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,059
He's quite ruined.

315
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,329
I heard about him through rumors.

316
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,970
It didn't feel so good after meeting him in person.

317
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,000
I thought, "how did my role model end up like that?"

318
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,740
That's why the remake project...

319
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,240
is really important to you.

320
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,109
Would it be my greed?

321
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:26,778
You wanted its digital service provided ever since Gingertoon.

322
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,519
You remember that.

323
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,720
I was so locked up during that time.

324
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,289
It would have made you frustrated being next to me.

325
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:40,630
No.

326
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,499
I think it's a profitable project...

327
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,539
with good intentions.

328
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,539
You can also expand it to additional copyright business...

329
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,210
by using the characters made reborn through webtoons.

330
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,210
Right? You also think so too, right?

331
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,548
Great. I feel confident now that you say that.

332
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:01,049
It's done. Let's go and eat.

333
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:05,890
What are you doing?

334
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,730
I don't understand Mr. Ma Hae Kyu.

335
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,930
It's a way to easily earn money in his later years.

336
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,869
Why did he reject?

337
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,400
Wouldn't it be because of the pride as an artist?

338
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,739
Or he could be a perfectionist.

339
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,779
Besides, remaking is a double-edged sword.

340
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,538
You have to leave your work...

341
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,348
on the hands of others,

342
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,250
so he might be worried that his work may be ruined.

343
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,920
The pride of an artist? That's important.

344
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,960
Especially to a great artist like Ma Hae Kyu.

345
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,529
Genius artists...

346
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,789
are not bound by the rules of the world.

347
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,029
I thought you'd be a realist.

348
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,939
Because I'm an ordinary employee of a company.

349
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,868
Would he have created a masterpiece...

350
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,769
like "Please, I Need a Time Machine" if he was ordinary like me?

351
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,980
Still. Shouldn't he fulfill his role as a father first?

352
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,079
He has a family to take care of.

353
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,490
That's because...

354
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,419
you're a novice who doesn't know...

355
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,359
how great "Please, I Need a Time Machine" is.

356
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,720
Just continue eating.

357
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,930
What about you, Ma Eum? You read it all, right?

358
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,130
- Yes, I did. - How was it?

359
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:22,900
Hold on.

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,140
Hello?

361
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,309
Yes. I'm On Ma Eum.

362
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,619
Excuse me. I have to go.

363
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,119
Sure.

364
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,789
Where did you say it is?

365
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,460
- It's on the phone. - Are you crazy?

366
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,000
- Leave me. I'm the victim. - Yu Na.

367
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,130
Are you the guardian of Ma Yu Na?

368
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,528
Yes. I'm her sister. What's going on?

369
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:01,169
This crazy girl pushed me and smashed my phone.

370
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,068
You took my picture from the back first.

371
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,038
When did I? Do you have proof?

372
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,038
There's proof. Give me the phone.

373
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,548
It's not turning on because you broke it.

374
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,049
What proof is there?

375
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,549
Can't you run forensics on broken phones too?

376
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,450
It is possible.

377
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:17,818
Then let's do it like this.

378
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,788
I'll reimburse you for the cost of the phone.

379
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,089
So please give them the phone as evidence.

380
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,989
- What? - I don't think it's a bad deal...

381
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,629
if you're innocent.

382
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,829
Let's do that.

383
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,528
Why should I?

384
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,229
- Are you okay? - I'm the victim.

385
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,900
Let's just do it like that.

386
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,670
Gosh.

387
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,880
I'm sorry about today.

388
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,109
Those kinds of people make a bigger fuss...

389
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,619
if I say I don't have an adult to call.

390
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,990
You did a good job.

391
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,490
Make sure to call me if such things happen again.

392
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,358
Should I just teach you self-defense...

393
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,930
so that they wouldn't mess with you in the first place?

394
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,269
I'll repay you for the costs that you paid him.

395
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,068
But do you normally work around this hour?

396
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,769
Shouldn't you be at school?

397
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,939
The person who was supposed to work couldn't show up.

398
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,480
It's also not fun to go to school anyway.

399
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,809
It's better to earn more.

400
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,549
Give me a bite.

401
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,160
- The cake. - Let me have a bite.

402
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,029
Here.

403
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,569
This is really delicious.

404
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,269
Should we order another one?

405
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:41,710
Mom...

406
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,809
also used to open her mouth asking to be fed.

407
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,920
Your mom was a beautiful person.

408
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,420
She was. Her appearance and her heart were both pretty.

409
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,930
She got married to my useless father for nothing.

410
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,730
She worked so hard to take care of him and died.

411
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,470
It's all because of the comics.

412
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,268
- It's Artist Oh Yoon. - It's him.

413
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,940
Wow.

414
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,278
He said hi.

415
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,379
Is it because his work isn't good? His face changed.

416
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,649
He'll still be able to live well even if he doesn't draw.

417
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,480
Is that why he doesn't put much effort?

418
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,220
I'll do the same too, if I were him.

419
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,389
I think his drawings keep getting worse.

420
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,758
I know. The story isn't nice either.

421
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,459
I don't think he's working now.

422
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,089
I guess it's easy to be an artist.

423
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,930
- I think he heard us. - Keep quiet.

424
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,109
I brought up the topic about ending the webtoon early,

425
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:51,710
but he was persistent.

426
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,339
He said no.

427
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,309
He's afraid to be remembered as an artist whose work got canceled.

428
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,079
That's a natural reaction.

429
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,920
- On that note... - Yes?

430
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,119
Couldn't we give him a little more time?

431
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,930
Do you think the Chief Editor...

432
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,400
brought up the issue simply because of the profits?

433
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,400
Would it really help Artist Oh Yoon?

434
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,109
Have you ever read your father's comic books?

435
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,809
No.

436
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,548
I didn't even want to look at them after Mom passed away.

437
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,250
So I threw them all out.

438
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,950
I also don't read webtoons.

439
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,789
I just don't like them in general.

440
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,990
I hate them.

441
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,470
Hey.

442
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Are you coming from somewhere?

443
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,169
I met Artist Ma's daughter.

444
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,839
At this hour?

445
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,539
Well, yes.

446
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,079
That's a lot to deal with at a young age.

447
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:10,450
Yes. I could understand why...

448
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,190
she blames Artist Ma.

449
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:15,829
That's right. More so if she didn't read any of his works.

450
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,500
But I saw her smile today.

451
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,099
It was bright and pretty.

452
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,940
I hope she could keep smiling like that.

453
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,970
For that to happen,

454
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,180
you should make it work with Artist Ma Hae Kyu.

455
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,480
Yes.

456
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,450
Artist Sin Dae Lyug's new webtoon will begin today, right?

457
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,720
- That's right. - You must be feeling nervous.

458
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,390
No. I'm excited.

459
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,690
- You'd be nervous. - No, I'm excited.

460
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,758
I'm sure you're nervous.

461
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,058
No. I used to be a judo player.

462
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,490
I don't get nervous because of such things.

463
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,740
How many minutes are left?

464
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:00,970
It's 3 minutes to 11 o'clock.

465
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,939
Hey.

466
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,480
Good.

You scrolled down so fast that I couldn't even read it.

483

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,259
The storytelling is amazing.

497
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,259
I think this series will go on to become a legend.

498
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,829
I'm going to binge-read this!

499
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,929
My gosh. This artist must be a genius.

500
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,670
I've never read a story with such an unusual setting.

501
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,269
I wasn't going to read this because I didn't like the drawing style,

502
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,068
but it's so good.

503
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:48,368
(I totally agree. This is really good.)

504
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,410
Well done.

505
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,180
You're cool, Sin Dae Lyug.

507
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,339
- Yes. - Mr. Sin.

508
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,848
Did you read the comments?

509
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,509
Everyone is raving about it.

510
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,980
Yes, I saw it. I'm relieved.

511
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,720
I know how hard you worked.

513
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,690
No.

514
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,220
As your number one fan,

515
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,890
I'm so proud.

516
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:52,299
Thank you.

517
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,609
I really mean it.

518
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:01,640
This wouldn't have been possible without your help.

519
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,019
Mr. Sin, are you crying?

520
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,159
Mr. Sin.

521
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,829
Only good things await you from now on.

522
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,769
"Only good things?"

523
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,469
That's nice.

524
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,010
Come on. Stop crying.

525
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,789
"Today was fun."

526
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,598
What? That sounds so lame.

527
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,699
"Congratulations."

528
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,829
"You looked pretty?" Come on!

529
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,670
Should I send this?

530
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,340
I should, right?

534

535
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,649
Congratulations, Producer On.

536

Thank you.

537
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,848
It broke into the top row as soon as it was released.

538
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:49,949
It's going viral on social media too!

539
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,819
So many people are paying to check out the preview.

540
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,328
Usually, people only read the first episode...

541
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,089
and not bother paying for the other episodes.

542
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,198
Exactly.

543
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,859
I was worried about his drawing style.

544
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,368
But thankfully, people think it's unique so far.

545
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,799
Thank goodness we didn't turn down this amazing series.

546
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,369
Right, Mr. Kwon?

547
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,079
"Mr. Kwon, you'd better step up your game."

548
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,879
"You've lost your touch."

549
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,510
"The rookies will beat you in no time."

550
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,518
How about that? Happy now?

551
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,389
Well said!

552
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:24,820
You know this is only the beginning, right?

553
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:26,659
Yes, sir!

554
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,489
If this is like a marathon, you've just left the start line.

555
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:30,889
That's right.

556
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,630
Being the 1st one to hit the 100km mark means nothing.

557
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,268
I'll do my best so I can successfully finish the marathon.

558
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,569
- You can do it! - I got this!

559
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,638
- You can totally do it. - Congratulations.

560
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,269
- Good luck. - Congratulations.

561
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,468
I'm glad that both "Full Count" and "Weapon Feeb"...

562
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,840
are doing so well.

563
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,710
- Let's keep up the good work. - For sure.

564
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,000
I want to see the comments.

565

Mr. Seok, I would like to recruit you...

566
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:25,780
as the chief editor of Youngtoon.

567

What are you doing?

568
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,489
I was looking for something.

569
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,929
You look like you got busted while doing something else.

570
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,699
I was talking about my face.

571
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:47,170
You seem to be in a good mood today.

572
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,209
Both "Full Count" and "Weapon Feeb" are getting such good feedback.

573
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,268
"The Law of Girls" too.

574
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,408
Heo Kwan Young went on about how the webtoon camp was a waste of money...

575
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,308
and that it was useless.

576
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:58,678
I want to trample all over his face.

577
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,449
Hey, Ji Hyeong.

578
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,690
Seriously, well done. Thanks so much.

579
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,158
Oh, please. I didn't even do much.

580
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,460
You didn't do much?

581
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,388
You persuaded Na Gang Nam to stay with us,

582
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:10,988
discovered new, talented artists,

583
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,399
and paired them up with the rookie producers...

584
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,199
while guiding them and helping them out...

585
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,869
Assistant Editor Seok Ji Hyeong, please keep up the great work!

586
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,880
My gosh. What would I have done without you?

587
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,380
Gosh, thank goodness.

588
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,909
I should've visited you at your studio.

589
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,250
No, I wanted to come here to check out Youngtoon's office.

590
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,518
So how do you feel now that you've seen it?

591
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,388
Would you like to do another project with us?

592
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:39,719
That would be nice, but...

593
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:43,789
I don't want to rock the boat with Mr. Seok.

594
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,429
Who cares?

595
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Besides, who's to say that Ji Hyeong will stay at Neon forever?

596
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:54,699
- What do you mean? - I mean, you never know.

597
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,170
Just like we crossed paths again like this.

598
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,380
There's definitely something.

599
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,380
Babe!

600
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,090
What... What is all this?

601
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,559
I was feeling gloomy, so I bought this to cheer myself up.

602
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,158
Hold on, babe.

603
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,598
Slow down, please.

604
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,469
I wouldn't have bought this had I wanted to drive slowly.

605
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,039
- This feels so nice! - No! Slow down!

606
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,670
Help!

607
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,030
Oh, no. It's empty.

610

I'm adding this to my list.

611
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,558
I can't wait to read the next episode.

612
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,299
A story of a female baseball player? It's so refreshing.

613
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,130
This is so good. It's amazing!

614
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,469
I believe in actions, not words.

615
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,110
I have to say, you seem to be faltering these days.

616
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,579
I feel bad for you.

617
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,690
I think it's a waste.

618
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,058
Isn't it time to get over it now?

619
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,319

620
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,929
Gingertoon. The memory.

621
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,659
- Stop. - You stop.

622
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,500
It's time you leave Chief Editor Jang.

623
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,800
Just leave from it.

624
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,739

632
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,019
Have this with your father.

They're just some snacks.

634

It's a hard job you do.

635
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,670
You keep calling him "artist."

636
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,900
Artist?

637
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,639
He can't draw comics now. Not even a single line.

638
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:51,739
I still...

639
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,239
really like and respect your father's comic books.

and end up working in this field...

642
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,320
is all thanks to his comic books.

643
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,360
What's your dream?

644
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,329
I don't have any.

645
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,000
I'll end up like him if I have a dream.

646
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,569
I just wish to save up a lot...

647
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,440
and escape this house.

648
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,449
Please give this to your father.

649
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,289
They're documents about the webtoon remake.

650
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,460
Get inside. I'll come again.

Only one would have been enough.

00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,829
Happy birthday,

662
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,968
my dear friend.

663
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,639
(Happy birthday, my dear friend.)

664
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,159
I should stop eating snacks at night.

665
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:01,829
Joon Yeong?

666
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,199
I heard you were on leave. You came to read comic books?

667
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,440
Why aren't you going in?

668
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,650
You didn't visit so often as a VVIP.

669
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:26,460
Do you want some ramyeon? I'll make you ramyeon.

670
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,019
Come in.

671
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,659
Come in.

672
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:39,940
Here.

673
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,009
I don't know about other dishes,

674
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,710
but when it comes to ramyeon, I'm an expert cook.

675
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,300
- Right? - It's really delicious.

676
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,098
Ramyeon is best when eaten at a comic book cafe.

677
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,230
It's delicious.

678
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,940
Thank you.

679
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,639
For the ramyeon?

680
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,250
Yes.

681
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,059
Were you reading Artist Ma's book again?

682
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,960
Yes.

683
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,259
It gets more interesting the more you read it.

684
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,130
A masterpiece is different for sure.

685
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,800
It would be nice if Yu Na reads this too.

686
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,900
It's sad that she just hates comics.

687
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:48,269
How about bringing her here?

688
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:51,710
Oh.

689
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,710
I also didn't realize until I came here...

690
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,750
that comics were so interesting.

691
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,279
I think it's because Yu Na doesn't know well too.

692
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,119
Why didn't I think about that?

693
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,849
Thank you.

694
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,860
It's for the ramyeon.

695
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,329
An elite is surely different.

696
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,530
I should have made two bowls.

697
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,070
Is there anything more you need?

698
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,699
- Do you have rice? - Rice.

Hi.

701
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,880
When do you get off work?

702
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,149
I just need to organize these.

703
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,150
Really?

704
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:41,189
Do these go here?

705
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,589
No, I should do that.

706
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,329
I want to go somewhere with you after your work ends.

707
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,030
You didn't eat yet, right?

708
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,400
What words do you use these days?

709
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,739
Do you use "so whaTV?"

710
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,610
- No. - You don't use that?

711
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,039
I don't.

712
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,609
Isn't it a trend?

713
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,578
I heard they don't stop at that.

714
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,309
They go further.

715
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,209
They don't use "king angry" these days too.

716
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,280
It's "king angrasche" or "king succession."

No. It's not about that. This is my home.

not going to read comic books.

729

Well, well.

You work, but you're not giving up on your studies too.

Sure.

It's delicious.

Everything you eat at a comic book cafe is delicious.

740
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:11,239
Is she your mother?

741
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:12,769
Yes.

742
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,909
It's my favorite picture among those we took together.

743

keeps one full for whole life.

753

but they still cheer up.

822
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:47,968
They're not obsessed with past glory or dream...

823

You're my dad.
