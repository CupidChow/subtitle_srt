(Episode 8: I Will Be Your Unchanging Truth)

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,950
Drink up.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,688
Producer Jang, I see that you can still drink quite a bit.

13
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:57,030
Oh, sorry. You're an assistant editor now.

14
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,200
You can call me whatever you want.

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,869
The title doesn't matter. We're friends, you know?

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,268
No, it's important. It's a sensitive issue among office workers.

17
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,669
I don't care. You know I'm cool with stuff like that.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,339
Yes, you are cool indeed. That's why I like you.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
Let's drink.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,809
- Hello. - Hello.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,109
Hello.

22
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,650
What's wrong?

23
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,030
- I see. The woman from Youngtoon. - Ma'am.

24
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,389
A beer, please.

25
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,229
Okay. Thank you.

26
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,729
- Let's drink soju first. - Sure.

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,400
- Gosh. Let me pour it for you. - Mr. Na Gang Nam?

28
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,969
You finished it? Gosh, you can hold your liquor.

29
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,509
Why is Mr. Na meeting up...

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,109
with the assistant editor from Youngtoon?

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,879
How are things at Youngtoon?

32
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,450
Pretty good. The sales numbers have been good,

33
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,750
and we have loyal readers.

34
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,989
But there's one thing we don't have.

35
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,688
- What might that be? - What do you think?

36
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,389
It's you, Mr. Na Gang Nam.

37
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,099
What? Look at you, Ms. Assistant Editor.

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,569
If you could publish a new webtoon with us,

39
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,168
Youngtoon would soar even higher.

40
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,609
I'm struggling to meet my deadlines for "Princess Kumiho."

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,969
I can't start a new webtoon.

42
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,210
You said you'd finish the series soon when I was at Gingertoon.

43
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,349
Right, I did. But it's still not finished.

44
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,090
Has it been about five years already?

45
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,519
But "Princess Kumiho" wasn't what you wanted to do.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,729
You always wanted to write an intense story.

47
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,090
That's right.

48
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,699
I like dark, intense stories.

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,929
But every time I pitch a story like that,

50
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,400
they say it's too dark and gloomy.

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,299
"Princess Kumiho," which I worked on with Seok Ji Hyeong,

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,109
was my first webtoon that got published.

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,508
But the truth is, it's the total opposite...

54
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,878
of the kind of story I wanted to write.

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,710
Who knew it'd be such a hit?

56
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,419
You're so talented. You were bound to be successful...

57
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,389
even if you didn't write "Princess Kumiho."

58
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,489
Hey, why are you flattering me nonstop today?

59
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,030
Stop it already. You're making me dizzy.

60
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,090
I'm just stating the facts.

61
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,800
Mr. Na.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't you think you've done enough?

63
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
I mean, for "Princess Kumiho."

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,050
I want to see you...

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,650
working on the kind of story...

66
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,550
that you've always wanted to tell.

67
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,489
The Youngtoon readers...

68
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,729
are dying to read such dark, intense stories.

69
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,300
Besides, such genres targeting adults sell better too.

70
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,240
We can offer you a top-notch compensation package.

71
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,479
Because you're top-notch.

72
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,060
My baby!

73
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,529
Oh, no. Are you hungry? I was in the shower for too long, right?

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,699
Let me give you some food.

75
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,779
Hi.

76
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,019
Here, eat up.

77
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,459
Was she hacked?

78
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,939
Darn it.

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,120
I covered everything.

80
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,249
There's something else.

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,958
I feel like someone takes photos of me when I'm getting into my car.

82
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,089
I've heard the shutter sound a few times in the parking lot.

83
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,660
And my packages keep going missing.

84
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,459
Let's report it to the police.

85
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,529
The security footage will tell us who took your packages.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,699
That person must be the culprit.

87
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,569
Is there anyone you think that could do something like this?

88
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,069
Someone who knows your address.

89
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,680
No, I can't think of anyone.

90
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,579
You and Mr. Kwon are the only ones who know my address.

91
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,720
I communicate with my assistants via messenger.

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,519
Darn it.

93
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,529
Did Mr. Kwon hack into her computer?

94
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,839
Why are you staring at me like that? Got something to say?

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,240
No, it's nothing.

96
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,550
What's wrong? You look tired.

97
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,220
Oh, I didn't sleep well last night.

98
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,920
Everyone's here, right?

99
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,790
- Hello. - Let's get started.

100
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,898
I already skimmed through this, but I was wondering...

101
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,028
Hey, Yu Mi. What about the fan goods?

102
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,268
I ordered them from the place that makes BLACKPINK's fan goods.

103
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,508
- I see. - A microphone and some cushions.

104
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,208
- Nice, well done. - Thank you.

105
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,379
Let's look at the last page.

106
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,139
(Best New Artist of the Year)

107
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,790
What?

108
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,000
Dong Hee! This...

109
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,040
Do you need something, sir?

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,269
Oh.

111
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,279
I forgot how to undo what I just did.

112
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,779
- I see. - I can't get this to work.

113
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,550
One moment, please.

114
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,160
What's wrong?

115
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,019
Sir, this is...

116
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,459
- The whole thing's been deleted. - What?

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
- That's it for the meeting. - Okay.

118
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,869
Make sure you guys prepare thoroughly for the new projects.

119
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,600
Also, Youngtoon is busy stealing artists from other platforms.

120
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,239
Papaya lost a couple of their main artists.

121
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,839
They're going bonkers now.

122
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,610
Their new webtoons will go up next month.

123
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,110
Be careful and make sure we don't get our artists stolen.

124
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,720
- Okay. - Okay.

125
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,919
What's with you guys today?

126
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,619
- Ma Eum. - Yes, sir.

127
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,090
You, of all people, can't be like this.

128
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,158
Yes, sir!

129
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,360
Will you let them steal Na Gang Nam?

130
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,029
No, of course not. Well understood, sir!

131
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,779
Should I visit Mr. Na at his studio?

132
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,950
- Why? - Well...

133
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480
You heard Mr. Jang. He was like, "Don't let them steal him."

134
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,019
I'll figure out what to do once I'm there.

135
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm meeting him for lunch.

136
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,590
- I see. I'll come with you... - No.

137
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,000
I understand that you're anxious,

138
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,070
but we can't force him to stay with us.

139
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,239
If we show up together, it might rub him the wrong way.

140
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,909
So just relax and wait.

141
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,750
Okay, Ms. On Ma Eum?

142
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,210
Okay.

143
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,109
- It's okay. Sit. - It's hot today, isn't it?

144
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,169
Yes.

145
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,579
I really needed something to help me relieve my hangover.

146
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,239
You suggested meeting here as if you read my mind.

147
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,279
Anyway, what's up?

148
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,649
- Let's eat first. - Okay.

149
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,490
You see, yesterday...

150
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,889
I saw you.

151
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,629
You did? Where? Why didn't you say hi?

152
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,000
You were with Jang Hye Mi.

153
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,330
Oh, boy.

154
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,870
I'm not bringing this up to make you uncomfortable.

155
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,740
I guess that's why you wanted to see me today.

156
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,678
My gosh. So you rushed here to see me.

157
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,009
I guess I'm not a has-been yet, after all.

158
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,350
Come on. You're hurting my feelings here.

159
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,820
You're like the face of Neon.

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,159
So? Are you worried?

161
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,429
Yes.

162
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,470
Are you seriously thinking of joining Youngtoon?

163
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm not sure yet. I'm still thinking.

164
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,008
But I'm free to go wherever I want.

165
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,408
If I end up joining a different platform,

166
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,179
don't call me a traitor like a petty loser would.

167
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,620
But you'll complete "Princess Kumiho" with us, right?

168
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,250
I'm thinking about it.

169
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,989
As you know, I don't have...

170
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,860
the physical energy to work on two projects at the same time.

171
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,529
If I want to move to a different platform and start something new,

172
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,929
I should wrap up "Princess Kumiho."

173
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,929
I see.

174
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,268
Is what Youngtoon offering a lot better than what we're paying you?

175
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,569
If you tell us, we could definitely try to match the offer.

176
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,840
No, it's not about that.

177
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:52,148
From time to time, I wonder if it's okay...

178
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,320
for me to keep working on webtoons like "Princess Kumiho."

179
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,190
It's all I've been doing since my debut.

180
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,250
But you see,

181
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,690
it's not the kind of webtoon I really wanted to draw.

182
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,199
I'm 40 now. The world is changing so rapidly,

183
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,428
and I still have tons of stories I want to tell,

184
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,668
but I'm not young anymore.

185
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,939
When I think about that... How should I put this?

186
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,240
I feel all anxious and hot inside.

187
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,840
- You know what I'm saying, right? - Yes, I sure do.

188
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,480
If you want to start a different webtoon,

189
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,649
we'd be more than happy to publish it.

190
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,419
Our styles are too different.

191
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,059
I know what Neon readers want better than anybody else does.

192
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,889
But you see, we now publish a wide range of webtoons.

193
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,289
Also...

194
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,928
Ma Eum and I will give you all the support you need...

195
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,269
Hey. You'd better not tell Steamed Dumpling.

196
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,240
She'll cry if she hears that I'm thinking of ending the series.

197
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,070
She's a die-hard fan of "Princess Kumiho."

198
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,538
Anyway, this is about my career.

199
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,309
Let me think a little more and decide.

200
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,449
- Can I order suyuk? - Sure, of course.

201
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,679
We'd like some suyuk, please.

202
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,090
- Eat up. - Okay.

203
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:09,929
Something's up, right?

204
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,268
- No! - Your face tells us you're lying.

205
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,299
What's going on?

206
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,100
- Well... - Tell us.

207
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,409
The thing is...

208
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,610
I happened to see Mr. Na having a meeting with Youngtoon yesterday.

209
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,619
If he suddenly wraps up "Princess Kumiho"...

210
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,190
and joins Youngtoon...

211
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,690
My gosh, it's all my fault.

212
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,370
Well, it's not decided yet. Right?

213
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,769
Also, why is it your fault?

214
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,940
Because it's happening after I started working with him.

215
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,139
Every webtoon has an end, you know?

216
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,849
It's not like you were forced to end it because it wasn't doing well.

217
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,879
You won't be held accountable for the series coming to an end.

218
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,759
- What's wrong? - I am that person.

219
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,599
- What? - I may be forced...

220
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,429
to end the series because it's not doing well.

221
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,529
Oh Yoon's new webtoon keeps getting bad feedback.

222
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,100
I should've talked him out of starting "The Beginning of Men."

223
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,139
Are you still worried?

224
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,850
Yes, I am.

225
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,590
I really can't let Mr. Na go.

226
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,330
Am I being selfish?

227
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,730
Every reader of his webtoon must feel the same way.

228
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,940
And as his producer, you ought to protect the project.

229
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,309
- Hello. - Hello.

230
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,639
Hi. What brings you to the head office?

231
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,878
We had to stop by the marketing team's office.

232
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,019
I see.

233
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,519
Jun Yeong, what is the name of your colleague here?

234
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,518
I'm On Ma Eum in Webtoon Service, sir.

235
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,559
I see.

236
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,889
The contract worker we hired through special recruitment?

237
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,090
Yes, sir.

238
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,399
Jun Yeong, can you spare me a moment?

239
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Sure.

240
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,070
- Will you step aside? - Oh, sure.

241
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,309
- Can you take this? - Yes.

242
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,039
Are there any issues that have come up recently?

243
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,038
"Issues"? What do you mean?

244
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,149
Are they wasting money?

245
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,080
Any changes in the artist lineup?

246
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,949
I'll hear about everything eventually,

247
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,820
but it'd be nice to know in advance.

248
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,519
We might lose one of our main artists.

249
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,528
Which one?

250
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,059
Na Gang Nam.

251
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,059
Oh, everyone will flip out.

252
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,840
Neon Webtoon is nothing without Na Gang Nam.

253
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,139
Any other changes that I should know about?

254
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,080
No, sir.

255
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,009
All right. You may leave.

256
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,289
When we were launching Neon Webtoon,

257
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,730
everyone strongly suggested that we acquire Youngtoon.

258
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,039
But I said no to that...

259
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,440
and chose you and Gingertoon's editorial department.

260
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,038
For that, I'm always grateful.

261
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,849
Don't be.

262
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,479
If you keep failing to meet my expectations,

263
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,920
I'll fire you without hesitation.

264
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,619
Do not make me regret my choice.

265
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,160
I believe the company will suffer a lot of damage.

266
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,660
Do not humiliate me in front of Heo Kwan Young.

267
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,529
Do you understand, Mr. Jang?

268
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,039
Yes, well understood.

269
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,069
(New Email from Na Gang Nam)

270
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,739
(From Na Gang Nam)

271
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,809
What's gotten into him?

272
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,680
Mr. Na sent me the episode two days before the deadline.

273
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,848
("Princess Kumiho," Episode 230)

274
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:01,949
(I'm sending you Episode 230.)

275
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,190
Maybe this is like that thing.

276
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,058
Men are suddenly nice to their wives when they're having an affair.

277
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,558
They come home early and send flowers.

278
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,160
It means he's made up his mind to leave us.

279
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,059
Hey! Don't say stuff like that.

280
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,259
You know what? I agree with him.

281
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,900
Where is Ji Hyeong?

282
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:18,739
Tell him to come back at once.

283
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,939
Yes, Mr. Seok... Okay.

284
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
What?

285
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,069
What is it?

286
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,950
So you're saying...

287
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,819
you failed to persuade him?

288
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,028
Yes, he said he needed some time to think.

289
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,500
Time to think, my foot.

290
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,329
He's trying to buy time to negotiate with Youngtoon.

291
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,400
What matters the most is what he wants to do.

292
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,368
My goodness. You guys have no sense of urgency.

293
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,940
We must make him stay at all costs.

294
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,180
Aren't there any hidden clauses in his contract?

295
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,949
- Mr. Kwon. - Don't be such a snob.

296
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,019
Think about the money "Princess Kumiho" brings in.

297
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,950
It brings in over ten million dollars a year.

298
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,720
Do you know how you'll make up for it if you suddenly lose it?

299
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,459
If you leave it up to the artist because you want to act nice,

300
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,900
and if our sales drop because we lose him to our competitor,

301
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,230
will you take responsibility for it, Mr. Seok?

302
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,529
Will you?

303
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,769
Sorry to interrupt,

304
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:31,210
but I am Mr. Na's producer.

305
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,910
I don't know what I can do to take responsibility for it,

306
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,480
but if one of us must be reprimanded for this situation,

307
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,549
I believe it should be me. I'm really sorry.

308
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,690
I apologize.

309
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,160
I'm the one...

310
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,160
who should be held accountable.

311
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,769
Ma Eum, Mr. Seok.

312
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,569
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

313
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,869
Do whatever it takes to persuade Na Gang Nam.

314
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,079
To Neon Webtoon, Na Gang Nam is...

315
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,680
Please do it for me.

316
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,720
Make him stay.

317
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,589
Okay.

318
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,559
Okay.

319
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,768
Hey. If you don't think you can do it, let me know.

320
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,108
I'll visit him myself.

321
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:40,939
No, I'll visit him again and try to persuade him.

322
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,210
"Princess Kumiho"...

323
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,549
"Princess Kumiho" is... We really can't lose it, you know.

324
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,250
Yes, I know.

325
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,059
It's the last remnant of Gingertoon.

326
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,399
But when he said he felt as though he was the only one...

327
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,769
not moving forward in this rapidly changing world,

328
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,440
I didn't know what to say.

329
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,470
Asking him to stay, knowing how anxious he feels...

330
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,779
I feel like I'm being selfish.

331
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,219
(This old comic is bringing back so many memories.)

332
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,689
(This is my Taekwon V underwear!)

333
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,190
(Yi Seul was born at this hospital!)

334
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,059
"How to turn back time."

335
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,670
"Please, I need a time machine."

336
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,410
Hey, I thought you already sent the file over.

337
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,049
Come on! Why are you still working?

338
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,849
Aren't you taking me out on a date?

339
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,349
A different platform approached me with a nice offer,

340
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,049
so I'm trying to sketch out the story.

341
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,859
Does that mean you're finally done with "Princess Kumiho"?

342
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,700
Well, I guess.

343
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,599
That's such amazing news! I was sick and tired of it.

344
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,369
Hey! That's mean.

345
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,598
For the past five years, "Princess Kumiho"

346
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,900
has been putting food on the table for me.

347
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,740
Not for me, though.

348
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,140
I make a lot of money too.

349
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Then can't we go out and have some fun today?

350
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:31,088
Let's throw a party! To celebrate the end of "Princess Kumiho"!

351
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,919
No. We'll have a wrap party after I finish the webtoon.

352
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,929
- Let's go! - No. I have to work on this.

353
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,689
- Are you going to wear that? - No.

354
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,058
- Come on. Wait. - Please.

355
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,730
- Yes! - I can't go to a party...

356
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,609
This is so good.

357
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,979
Did you tell Steamed Dumpling that you were wrapping it up?

358
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,150
No, not yet.

359
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,619
She must be so sad.

360
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,019
She was a huge fan of "Princess Kumiho."

361
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,019
Right. If you join another platform,

362
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,829
you won't be working with Steamed Dumpling anymore?

363
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,730
And Mr. Seok Ji Hyeong too?

364
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,470
Well, yes until I sign another contract with them.

365
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,140
That's disappointing.

366
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,000
Both of them were so adorable.

367
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,740
If I join another platform, you can't leave home again.

368
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,008
- Why? - "Why?" Isn't it obvious?

369
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:31,879
No one from that platform will find you and bring you back.

370
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,019
I don't like that.

371
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,789
Darn it. This is no fun.

372
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,390
"Fun"?

373
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,430
- What's this? - This way. Here!

374
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,599
(Producer On Ma Eum)

375
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,268
- Mr. Na. - Hey, Producer On.

376
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,369
Why are you calling me at this hour?

377
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,400
I have to tell you something.

378
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,170
Tell me what?

379
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,180
How much "Princess Kumiho" influenced my life.

380
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,380
I mean it.

381
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,880
You have no idea...

382
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,489
how every single word and action from San Ha comforted me...

383
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,359
whenever I had a tough time with judo.

384
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,130
San Ha had been my role model ever since I started college.

385
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,130
And she had been my friend too.

386
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,768
I'm sure a lot of teenage girls and girls in their 20s...

387
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,069
consider San Ha their role model and friend.

388
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,640
Why are you telling me this in the middle of the night?

389
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,910
Because...

390
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,680
I just wanted you...

391
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,779
to continue this series for a long time.

392
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,649
You must've heard something.

393
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,750
Come on. I told him not to tell you.

394
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,089
I hope this can help you make a decision.

395
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,630
Thanks, anyway.

396
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,299
It was quite moving...

397
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,470
although it didn't help me at all.

398
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,569
Goodnight.

399
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,189
(Pounding)

400
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,930
Right. As for your drawing style,

401
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,758
I think it will be better...

402
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,269
with a cheerful story than a dark story like this.

403
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,268
Pardon?

404
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:08,639
You see, the way you draw your lines complements...

405
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,009
perky scenes.

406
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,939
So colorful and cute characters...

407
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,480
and such cheerful stories might be good use of your style.

408
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,619
What do you think?

409
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,549
Why don't we trust my instinct and try this out?

410
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,759
Mr. Na.

411
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:44,739
(Clicking)

412
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,779
(Lee Hyun Jae!)

413
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,450
Gosh. This is awful.

414
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,049
You startled me.

415
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,750
Dad! Haven't you heard of knocking? Where are you manners?

416
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,489
I'm bringing you folded laundry. And you're yelling at me?

417
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,729
No. I didn't ask you to fold them for me.

418
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,959
Hey, should I be criticized for folding laundry...

419
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
for an unemployed daughter who lounges around at home?

420
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,470
I'm not just lounging around.

421
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,028
Why do you always think I'm not doing anything?

422
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,699
I have a plan too!

423
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,769
What's wrong?

424
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,008
You and I are going to talk later.

425
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,410
I hate you too, Mom.

426
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,680
You guys only adore Ma Eum.

427
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,980
Gosh. That scared me out of my wits.

428
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,420
I fainted because it was so boring.

429
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,759
Du Hee, this is driving me crazy.

430
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,089
How could an artist like Oh Yoon end up on the bottom like that?

431
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,358
Seriously.

432
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,298
I told you he should stick to his forte, comedy webtoons.

433
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,568
It's like a Chinese restaurant selling tteokbokki.

434
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:47,669
It can be jjajang tteokbokki.

435
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,410
That sounds tasty... Do you have a death wish?

436
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,439
He was going to leave us if I didn't say yes.

437
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
What could I have done?

438
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,979
He added some comedy factors because I kept giving him feedback.

439
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,548
At first, it was even more serious and bleak than this.

440
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,650
I don't care about the mood of the story. It's not entertaining.

441
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,019
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,390
See how he feels about ending the series prematurely.

443
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,929
- Pardon? - If Mr. Na leaves,

444
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,930
we're going to have a huge hole to fill for our sales.

445
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,569
Ten million dollars a year.

446
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,308
To offset the loss, we need him to come back...

447
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,410
with another comedy webtoon to give us some breathing room.

448
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,559
So what is "Feeb" exactly?

449
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,259
"Feeb" is...

450
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,799
a kind of weapon that controls people's potential.

451
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,799
In other words,

452
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:26,470
it's a monster that instills fear.

453
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,339
- So... - Exactly. What's that?

454
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,609
As for "Weapon Feeb,"

455
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:38,949
if you fail to make the readers understand the concept of Feeb,

456
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,720
it won't even stand a chance.

457
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,890
Here's what I think. Mr. Sin...

458
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,889
is drawing his webtoon based on his instincts.

459
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,229
That means...

460
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,268
it's possible that even he might not understand...

461
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:58,200
the true nature of his webtoon or the message he wants to deliver.

462
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,140
You can't repeat what Mr. Sin said...

463
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,469
like a parrot just because that's what he said. Right?

464
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,509
Right. I'll fix it again.

465
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,650
Okay?

466
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,049
Okay. Good work. You can go.

467
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,519
- Good work. - Good work.

468
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,089
Well...

469
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,200
It's nothing.

470
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,440
(Contacts)

471
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,980
(Producer Jang Hye Mi)

472
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,269
Let's do our best.

473
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,799
Do our best?

474
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,640
Okay.

475
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,640
We can do this!

476
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,579
Let's go!

477
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,390
It's easier to follow the plot...

478
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,729
when the readers can identify themselves as the characters.

479
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,099
That way, it'll be easier to understand Feeb.

480
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,630
(Clear emotional development)

481
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,269
Okay.

482
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,500
I'll try my best since you said we need to do this.

483
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,809
But I'm not sure.

484
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,180
I just draw my webtoon the way I see it in my head.

485
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,720
- Can I use the restroom? - Okay.

486
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,450
Gosh.

487
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,230
Hey, that was really mean.

488
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,798
- Are you all right? - Are you okay?

489
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,930
Gosh.

490
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,569
Are you hurt?

491
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:23,849
Mr. Sin.

492
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,650
I'll think more about the feedback you gave me today...

493
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,250
when I'm working on the webtoon.

494
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,420
No. I...

495
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,130
Why did you want to see me?

496
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:46,069
I was kind of excited to get a call from you.

497
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,579
Why would you get excited? I'm sure you know why.

498
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,309
What did you offer Mr. Na?

499
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,519
I guess you really don't want to lose him.

500
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,420
Na Gang Nam's webtoon...

501
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,230
You know what it means to us.

502
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,700
Are you doing this because you know that?

503
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,230
Ji Hyeong.

504
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,599
Do you think I'm doing this because of a personal vendetta?

505
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,069
I'm Youngtoon's assistant editor.

506
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:27,609
I simply made a proposition to an artist we need.

507
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,108
And I get that "Princess Kumiho" is meaningful...

508
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,879
to you and Mr. Jang because it began...

509
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,549
back in your Gingertoon days, but that's what you two think.

510
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,419
You know that Mr. Na never liked it...

511
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,859
because it wasn't his style.

512
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,329
If you make him turn down a good offer...

513
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,829
and force him to keep drawing it, I'd say it's so selfish.

514
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:12,960
(Chungma Studio)

515
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,839
The readers must be able to relate to the character...

516
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,038
to follow the story,

517
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,269
so I think you should provide a clearer portrayal of the emotions.

518
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,579
That way, it'll be easier for them to understand what "Feeb" is.

519
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:21,190
You need to help me with this. I can't do this alone.

520
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,658
Good morning!

521
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,159
- Hello. - Good morning.

522
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,428
Ma Eum, Jun Yeong. Can you guys spare me a moment?

523
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,369
- Sure. - Come to the meeting room.

524
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:31,829
Sure.

525
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,699
A meeting.

526
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,268
("Please, I Need a Time Machine")

527
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,379
- Oh, this is... - You know this? Have you read it?

528
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,439
Yes. It's a classic, isn't it?

529
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,480
Yes, it is. Look at you!

530
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,948
- What about you, Jun Yeong? - I've never seen this before.

531
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,119
Right, I bet.

532
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,650
It came out before you were even born.

533
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,889
Read it.

534
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,190
It is one of the best-known time-travel comics of the 90s.

535
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,360
The story is interesting, and it's very well-made.

536
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,059
- Okay. - That said,

537
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,400
I want the two of you to come up with a proposal...

538
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,030
- for a remake. Work on it together. - Pardon me?

539
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,699
You want to do a remake of "Please, I Need a Time Machine"?

540
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,109
Our target readers are probably younger than you guys,

541
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,739
so I'm sure they don't know about this series.

542
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,948
You two can probably relate to them the most,

543
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:17,849
so I want you guys to be in charge of the project.

544
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,480
Okay, I'll do my best.

545
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,749
And you, Jun Yeong? You look like you have something to say.

546
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,820
Well...

547
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,289
There will be things...

548
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,389
that are simply not in line with current trends.

549
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,900
Is there a reason we must do a remake of such an oldie?

550
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,230
This project is meaningful because...

551
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,069
Back in the day, comic books had to be printed to reach readers.

552
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,569
These days, everyone reads webtoons.

553
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,369
And nowadays,

554
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,940
people turn them into memes and circulate them on social media.

555
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,408
(Watch what you say.)

556
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:51,308
Some scenes from this series have become popular memes.

557
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,449
- I saw it. - You did?

558
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,190
All right. These days, everything changes so fast,

559
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,989
but it'll be sad to lose all things of the past.

560
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,659
Good things must live on.

561
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,489
I think it'll do well.

562
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,860
But that's just what I think, and I'm old.

563
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,369
Your opinion really matters because you two are young.

564
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,699
That's why I want you guys to work on it.

565
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,809
I'm in.

566
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,079
Me too.

567
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:24,949
It'll be fun.

568
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:30,289
You've been needing more time to finish your episodes,

569
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,960
and I was worried about your wrists too.

570
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:39,360
Thanks, Producer Choi. You're the best.

571
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,869
The view count isn't going up,

572
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,909
so I'm losing my confidence.

573
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,409
I was able to work on it quickly when I was feeling confident.

574
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,880
I don't know where it started to go wrong.

575
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,519
I think the project got off on the wrong foot.

576
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,518
You must stay confident.

577
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,360
We're all counting on you.

578
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,429
Right.

579
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,199
Did you not promote it because you were totally counting on me?

580
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,698
- Sorry? - I mean, think about it.

581
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:22,340
I'm famous, so it's odd that the view count is this low.

582
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,369
Are you sure it got enough exposure?

583
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,908
I can assure you that it got as much exposure...

584
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,408
as all the other Neon webtoons did.

585
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:30,949
- Are you sure? - Yes.

586
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,219
Then what is the problem?

587
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:41,519
Producer Choi, is "The Beginning of Men" that bad?

588
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,829
Yes, it is.

589
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,300
I mean, it's not bad. But it's not something...

590
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,030
people are used to.

591
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,799
It's not the kind of fun people are familiar with.

592
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,769
Exactly! It's novel.

593
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:58,210
Novel and unusual.

594
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,210
It doesn't mean it's boring, you know?

595
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,050
Well, you're right.

596
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,579
Then how come the view count isn't going up?

597
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,820
I can't get through to him.

598
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,789
This conversation will go on in circles.

599
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,789
Well, Mr. Oh.

600
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,659
Do you have a good idea?

601
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,800
Your specialty...

602
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,840
is comedy. How about you go back to that?

603
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,698
- What? - I don't think your fans...

604
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:32,579
are ready to open up to your novel, unusual ideas yet.

605
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,178
Are you saying we should drop the project altogether?

606
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:38,880
If you're okay with it, we can start working on a new one...

607
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:40,919
and publish it right away once this ends...

608
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,348
Are you kidding me? You'll force me to end it early?

609
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,920
- No, don't get me wrong. - My gosh, Neon and you...

610
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,960
I didn't think you'd be like this. I can't believe this.

611
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,829
How could you blindside me like this?

612
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,598
No! Please don't get the wrong idea.

613
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,429
I just wanted to get your opinion.

614
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:58,800
Of course, my answer is no.

615
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,699
I will not end it early, no matter what.

616
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,340
I will keep going even if the view count doesn't go up at all!

617
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,179
If you'd like,

618
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,590
you could take a break,

619
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,889
and then work with Youngtoon and with us as well.

620
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,590
Well, will I have enough energy to pull that off?

621
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,800
If "Princess Kumiho" ends,

622
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:30,530
Steamed Dumpling will cry, right?

623
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,499
I'd want to cry too.

624
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,340
What? Come on. This is so unlike you.

625
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,179
I'd like to...

626
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,920
work with you...

627
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,449
for as long as I can.

628
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,389
But...

629
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,159
if you decide to end the series,

630
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,469
please make sure...

631
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,800
to give it an absolutely memorable ending...

632
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,409
that befits...

633
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,409
its masterpiece status.

634
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,480
Your fans have been a big part of this journey.

635
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,750
Make them proud.

636
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,420
Do you really mean it?

637
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:28,989
Yes.

638
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,070
- Come on. - Okay.

639
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,840
It's right here.

640
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,149
What are you doing? We're running late because of you.

641
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,979
Oh, sorry. Where is it? Which way?

642
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,250
Let's go.

643
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,590
Ta-da!

644
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,289
- How do I look? - You look so gorgeous.

645
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:02,760
Then let me try on something else.

646
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,328
This. It's the one I saw. What do you think?

647
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,129
- Do you like this? - Yes, it's the one. Go for it.

648
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,199
Okay!

649
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:33,989
What?

650
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:17,869
Hey.

651
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,840
Babe, where are you?

652
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,070
Oh, I'm...

653
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,369
I'm...

654
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,110
Where are you?

655
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,150
Do you want some salad?

656
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,618
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

657
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,590
I felt like someone put some kind of spell on me or something.

658
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,788
You'd better not leave me alone and take off like that ever again.

659
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,199
You got it. Never. I won't do that again.

660
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,300
Promise me.

661
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,199
I promise.

662
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,610
Gosh.

663
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:37,579
You.

664
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,218
How could you leave me alone and take off like that...

665
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,948
the moment you promised you wouldn't do that?

666
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:48,319
I'm sorry. But I really saw Princess Kumiho!

667
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,129
Earlier at the shopping mall and the restaurant.

668
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,030
Are you crazy? Have you finally lost it?

669
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:58,699
Get a grip! I'm so sick of you talking about "Princess Kumiho"!

670
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,250
You'll never be able to end "Princess Kumiho."

671
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,650
You love that girl more than me.

672
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,239
Gosh.

673
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,150
This...

674
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,559
I...

675
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,630
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

676
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,699
(Artist Na Gang Nam)

677
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,210
(Artist Na Gang Nam)

678
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,880
Hello.

679
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:55,980
Yes.

680
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,420
Okay.

681
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:06,159
Yes. Okay.

682
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:07,360
Yes.

683
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,530
Thank you so much.

684
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,869
Okay.

685
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,710
Was that Mr. Na? What did he say?

686
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:23,449
He will continue drawing "Princess Kumiho."

687
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,379
- Ma Eum. What's wrong? - Gosh.

688
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,920
My legs. My legs just gave out.

689
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,150
- Hey, get up. - Thank you.

690
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,920
But he does want to publish a new webtoon simultaneously.

691
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,759
So he had developed a 20-episode horror webtoon a long time ago.

692
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,198
And he will try to publish that with Youngtoon.

693
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,828
I'm fine with everything. I'm so grateful. Thank you, Mr. Na!

694
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,840
- Yes. I'm glad he will stay! - Thank you!

695
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:56,808
To be honest, my heart was shrinking into a small lump.

696
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:59,050
Shouldn't we tell Mr. Jang about this?

697
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:03,050
Right. I'll call him and tell him.

698
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:06,019
Gosh. I'm so relieved!

699
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:17,230
Seriously.

700
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,539
Thank you, Mr. Na.

701
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,369
Thank you.

702
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,840
Don't thank me.

703
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,539
I didn't make the decision. She did.

704
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:33,250
What do you mean?

705
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,119
It's something between us.

706
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:46,328
I tried to draw different characters or come up with different stories.

707
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,058
I ended up drawing Princess Kumiho.

708
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,130
She showed up in my dream too.

709
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,400
On top of that, I even saw her in the afternoon.

710
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,369
I knew it. You don't believe me. You think I'm lying. Right?

711
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,609
I'm being serious.

712
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,709
This wicked brat doesn't want me to abandon her.

713
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,750
She's been following me all day wherever I went.

714
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:08,150
She still got life inside her.

715
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,190
I can't end the webtoon prematurely.

716
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:18,159
I used to be a poor bicycle, spinning on its own.

717
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,960
And "Princess Kumiho" turned me into a huge plane I am now.

718
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,299
I want to keep driving this plane with all the people on the plane...

719
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,769
for the time being.

720
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:28,239
Gosh.

721
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,639
I'm so glad...

722
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,139
that I still have...

723
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,710
a chance to tell you this.

724
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:40,150
Actually,

725
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:45,550
I like it too.

726
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,690
I'm a fan of "Princess Kumiho."

727
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,260
I'm a hardcore fan of the webtoon...

728
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,300
just like Ma Eum.

729
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,269
I'm a true fan of it.

730
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,070
We're all fans.

731
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,808
Gosh. There's no way you like it more than me.

732
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:12,710
You know what? That brings me to my point.

733
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,179
- Yes? - Well,

734
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,319
could you find Han Seul tomorrow?

735
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,919
She left home again.

736
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,419
- Gosh. - Gosh. Don't joke about that now.

737
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,989
- Gosh. - She left home?

738
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,159
I'm serious.

739
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,300
Seriously?

740
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,570
- That's important. Right? - Gosh.

741
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,840
I'm so glad to hear that.

742
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,039
Producer Goo.

743
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,579
I need you to pay...

744
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,320
special attention to Pomme for the time being.

745
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,718
- Pardon? - Youngtoon has been...

746
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,360
quite aggressive lately.

747
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,500
Just like they did to Mr. Na, they might contact our artists...

748
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,199
and try to get them to switch to their platform.

749
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:05,099
They might come after our artists.

750
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:09,739
Okay. I'll pay more attention.

751
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:19,980
This is so creepy.

752
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,019
How did he figure out my address?

753
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,389
By any chance, are you on social media?

754
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,459
- Yes. - Did you post photos of your house?

755
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,030
No. I didn't.

756
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,999
(See All)

757
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,500
I guess I posted a few.

758
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,670
Let me see them.

759
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,479
(Courier)

760
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,880
Gosh. I should take this down now.

761
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,809
(Delete)

762
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,250
(Do you want to delete this post?)

763
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,018
You shouldn't post photos on social media for the time being.

764
00:51:56,019 --> 00:51:57,590
It could be dangerous.

765
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
Okay.

766
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,619
Is there anyone you can call?

767
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,829
- Someone who could stay with you. - No.

768
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,730
My parents live in the countryside.

769
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,230
I don't want them to worry, so I'd rather not tell them.

770
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:13,170
I don't have close friends.

771
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,409
Why don't you invite your assistants here and work with them?

772
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,280
- How many are there? - Two. A woman and a man.

773
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:25,280
Great. Why don't you ask them to commute here?

774
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,889
I've never met assistants in person.

775
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,860
This is a good chance to meet them.

776
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,730
It's better than being anxious and not being able to focus.

777
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,400
You're not worried about me, right?

778
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,828
- Pardon? - You're worried...

779
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:45,969
that I might not be able to meet the deadline.

780
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,570
No.

781
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,739
Of course, I'm worried about you.

782
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,039
How could you say that?

783
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:55,439
I'll stop by often too.

784
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,409
Okay. You can leave now.

785
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,779
I won't miss the deadline...

786
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,079
and make sure to send the file on time.

787
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,119
Go.

788
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,489
Just leave.

789
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,960
Right. I do have to ask you something.

790
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,899
- What is it? - You said you had a meeting...

791
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,400
with another platform. Which platform was that?

792
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,570
Why are you suddenly asking me that? You weren't interested back then.

793
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:21,039
I'm interested now.

794
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,840
Youngtoon. Why do you ask?

795
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,780
Was it their assistant editor, Jang Hye Mi?

796
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,610
Was that her name?

797
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,049
It was a female assistant editor. I'm going to meet her soon.

798
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,949
Pomme, please don't join them. I'll do better.

799
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,920
What's this sudden change of attitude?

800
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:40,789
- This isn't like you. - What?

801
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,190
You're more charming when you act indifferent.

802
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,059
Leave already. Just go. Seriously.

803
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,630
- Don't leave us. - Go!

804
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,780
What does Mr. Sin want to express through "Weapon Feeb"?

805
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,150
It's fear and domination.

806
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,919
What does Mr. Sin want to express through "Weapon Feeb"?

807
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,118
Fear. It's...

808
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,460
Gosh. You startled me!

809
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,658
What are you doing here?

810
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:21,329
I thought you were going home after your meeting.

811
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,630
I had to prepare for the new webtoon meeting.

812
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,039
Jun Yeong, you've changed.

813
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:31,768
I have?

814
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,738
At first, you didn't want to handle a rookie artist.

815
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:35,239
Right after the camp.

816
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,719
Then do you want to prepare for the meeting together?

817
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,189
I was practicing my pitch. But I was having a hard time.

818
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,090
And I'll help you with yours too.

819
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,089
Sure. Let's do it together.

820
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,230
Sounds good.

821
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,459
There are three key points behind the intentions.

822
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,598
"We all have dreams in life."

823
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,069
I really like that you focused on the keyword, "dream."

824
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,940
I really liked this part because you sounded confident.

825
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,169
Then I'll practice a bit more...

826
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,380
and see what I should add more.

827
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,249
- This is Feeb. - I see.

828
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,718
I think you should keep it up to this line, not this.

829
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,590
I think that might be better. Other people...

830
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,929
might have a hard time understanding it.

831
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,759
I see. I have to get people to feel related.

832
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,069
Then if I just tell them this is Feeb, they might not get it.

833
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,769
Feeb is closely connected to fear.

834
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:12,309
(Logline)

835
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:15,340
It shows.

836
00:56:15,909 --> 00:56:17,150
Everyone is here.

837
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,849
- You're here. - Okay.

838
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,480
All right.

839
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,150
Ms. On. Did you prepare a lot?

840
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:26,550
Yes!

841
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:29,090
You sound confident.

842
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,760
All right.

843
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,360
We shall start our meeting to decide on our new webtoons.

844
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:36,630
Is "Full Count" first?

845
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,130
Jun Yeong, you may begin.

846
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,238
Originally, having too much text was a downside of the webtoon.

847
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,139
But this aspect has been improved.

848
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:47,780
We'll add a love story to widen the range ofour target readers.

849
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:50,349
I...

850
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:52,610
enjoyed it.

851
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,880
The artist is talented.

852
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:59,019
With the added love story, it will definitely increase views.

853
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,989
Good job, Mr. Unclogger.

854
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,389
Right. Well done.

855
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:06,529
A baseball webtoon always brings in a bare minimum of readers.

856
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,259
It's because you love baseball.

857
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,529
Be honest. It's fun. Isn't it?

858
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:12,599
It's fun.

859
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:14,899
The scenes and plot development are pretty good for a rookie.

860
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,900
Right.

861
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,570
Next up is Mr. Sin's "Weapon Feeb."

862
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,110
Ms. On.

863
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:26,309
Let's see.

864
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,949
His drawing has improved a lot.

865
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:34,388
But his drawing is still pretty rough.

866
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:36,689
Think about where he started. There's a limit to his improvement.

867
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,230
Rough lines can be seen as his artistic style.

868
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,230
His sketches look good.

869
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,230
His style matches the mood of the webtoon.

870
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:48,000
But the plot is the most important.

871
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,639
It won't be fun if the artist tries to make things too complicated.

872
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,638
But we must know the story well for us to tell our readers about it.

873
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,449
Ms. On, could you tell us about the setting of the webtoon?

874
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
Sure.

875
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:23,300
Through his webtoon, Mr. Sin wants to portray...

876
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,710
fear and domination.

877
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:29,479
Feeb is a weapon that latches on to people's fear...

878
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,849
and controls people's hearts.

879
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,480
The moment people feel fear, Feeb attacks them.

880
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,289
You would be fine as long as you don't feel fear.

881
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,960
But people can't suppress fear.

882
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,219
Colonel Kim Hwal is beloved by everyone.

883
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:46,529
But he has a secret agenda to dominate people...

884
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,159
by using Feeb.

885
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,169
After figuring out his agenda, only this character...

886
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,229
stands up to Hwal and raises his voice.

887
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,039
That's our main character, Hwi Young.

888
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,710
But the main character doesn't leave an impression.

889
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,039
He looks so weak. The readers won't find him attractive.

890
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:05,179
Because he's small, weak, and ordinary,

891
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:08,280
he's fighting against fear more desperately.

892
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:11,820
Not only does the main character confront his enemies,

893
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,788
but he also has to face his inner fear...

894
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:15,559
as if his life depends on it.

895
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,189
Because the main character is weak,

896
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,730
he's more desperate to escape from fear and be free.

897
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,698
Just like the main character,

898
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:27,940
we have to face our own fear every day.

899
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,239
It could be a trauma from our childhood.

900
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,980
Or it could be a sense of insecurity about work.

901
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,619
Or it could be a sense of loss.

902
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,788
Seeing the main character and his friends in this webtoon...

903
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:48,489
standing up to their fear and fighting it...

904
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,788
will give a lot of courage and hope...

905
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:53,360
to our readers who try their best to stay strong...

906
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:57,400
even when fear comes after them every day. I'm certain of it.

907
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:07,480
- That's it. - Gosh.

908
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,348
Great job.

909
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,610
- I have a meeting. Excuse me. - Okay.

910
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,949
- Good job. - Thank you.

911
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,119
Good work.

912
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,189
Gosh, Jun Yeong. You were better than I thought.

913
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,030
You sounded very smart.

914
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:46,909
Mr. Sin. I have good news.

915
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:50,349
It's official that your webtoon will be released on our platform.

916
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,260
Gosh. I knew you could do it.

917
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,860
You're doing a great job with the rookies this year.

918
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:03,968
The rookie producers or the artists?

919
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,170
All of them.

920
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:09,300
I told Director Heo that I would show results with the camp.

921
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,239
And I'll get to shove it in his face.

922
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,739
I know you're working hard to lead the incubating team.

923
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,550
Gosh. We're just getting started.

924
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,579
What if the webtoons don't do well after we launch them?

925
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,518
He will use that to make us look bad.

926
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:25,218
Let's pick up a hit webtoon.

927
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:27,590
And that will be our walk-off home run. Nice and neat.

928
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,590
Keep managing them to the end.

929
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,389
Okay.

930
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:36,329
Get home safely.

931
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,699
Gosh. There's another typo.

932
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:44,868
I've already reviewed this multiple times.

933
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:46,169
Why do I keep seeing typos?

934
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,639
(We're going on a trip. We made kimchi stew.)

935
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,769
Right. This is definitely waking me up.

936
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,900
Jun Yeong, do you want some too?

937
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,809
It might help you focus better.

938
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:19,840
Thanks.

939
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,980
Do you want to switch webtoons?

940
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,919
A fresh pair of eyes might be more helpful.

941
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,019
Sounds good.

942
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,760
- So this is the one? - Yes.

943
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:40,230
I'll put this up.

944
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,059
Here.

945
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,739
(A full count is bound to make both the hitter and pitcher nervous.)

946
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:06,250
What are you two still doing here? I thought you went home.

947
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,018
We had a lot to get done before we launch the webtoons.

948
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,090
I see.

949
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,400
Right. Your first webtoon artists will be making their debut.

950
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,760
Yes.

951
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,899
You've been working hard ever since the camp.

952
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,800
We have you to thank.

953
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,670
Gosh. Don't thank me.

954
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,569
You guys met up with the artists, revised the webtoons,

955
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,010
and made them come this far.

956
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,449
Jun Yeong, you're getting a call.

957
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,250
Oh, that.

958
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:38,090
You don't have to pick it up? The caller ID was Answer Right Away.

959
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,018
- It's okay. - I see.

960
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,518
She must be your girlfriend.

961
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:42,619
What?

962
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,029
You changed the caller ID to Answer Right Away.

963
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,159
You had a girlfriend?

964
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,869
Gosh, no. I don't.

965
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,280
This is getting interesting.

966
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,550
Your face got red. It really must be your girlfriend.

967
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,549
- No. - Your ears are red too.

968
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,079
Then who is it if it's not your girlfriend?

969
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,090
It's not my girlfriend. Anyway, it's not her.

970
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,289
I didn't know that you could get shy too, Jun Yeong.

971
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:21,230
Okay. I'll pretend I don't know that. Don't be so shy.

972
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:25,500
Anyway, wrap up and go home.

973
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,570
- Are you going home now? - Yes, I'll get going first.

974
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,399
- See you tomorrow. - Bye.

975
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,500
See you tomorrow.

976
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,578
Gosh. It feels iffy...

977
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,380
to answer an unknown number at this hour.

978
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,920
Hello?

979
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,590
What?

980
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:49,920
You've been well, right?

981
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:59,170
(Saman Tech Building)

982
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:08,809
Mr. Seok, I would like to recruit you...

983
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:14,679
as the chief editor of Youngtoon.

984
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,619
(Today's Webtoon)

985
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,150
(Special thanks to Lee Dal and Woo Jung Won for their guest appearance)

986
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,158
(All the animals were filmed under the guidance of experts.)

987
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,590
Can you please not tell anyone at work?

988
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:59,630
If anyone finds it out, you'll be in pickle.

989
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:01,530
(We've found out where the artist is.)

990
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:03,599
You piece of garbage...

991
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:07,900
Looks like you've decided to change your spot.

992
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:10,638
Happy birthday.

993
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:11,639
(My dear friend, happy birthday)

994
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,238
I heard that the next chief editor for Youngtoon...

995
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:16,880
will receive a huge salary.

996
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,250
Why would Mr. Seok...

997
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:22,150
go to Youngtoon?
