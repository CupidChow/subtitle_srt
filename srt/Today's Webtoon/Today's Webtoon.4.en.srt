00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:40,769
Please, Mr. Na.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,039
Revise Episode 213 of "Princess Kumiho".

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,149
Every night, I'm up working. This is shortening my life span.

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,159
I worked myself to the bone and did my best to finish the episode,

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,829
so don't you dare say such a thing.

15
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,200
Don't you think you're just whining right now?

16
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:08,668
It's not exciting enough for the readers.

17
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,000
What? It's not exciting enough?

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,509
You're new. You don't know anything. How dare you?

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,539
I know better than anybody else does!

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,178
Up until recently, I was your avid fan...

21
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,250
and one of your readers.

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,580
It is not good enough.

23
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,720
I have to be honest even if it's going to make you hate me.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,889
My favourite webtoon, "Princess Kumiho",

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,360
is definitely better than this.

26
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,600
Your reader On Ma Eum must've been disappointed...

27
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,729
when she read this episode.

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,199
Your fans excitedly waited a whole week to read it.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,168
Do you know how disappointing it is to see that...

30
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,740
it's the same story as last week's episode?

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,079
The artist Na Gang Nam that I know...

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,550
can do a much better job.

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,080
Gosh...

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,959
Is it that bad?

35
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,289
Yes!

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,129
Really?

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,759
Please revise it by tomorrow.

38
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,100
I'll be waiting!

39
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,780
I'll be waiting, Mr. Na!

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,978
One more thing, Mr. Na.

41
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,309
I forgot to tell you earlier,

42
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,880
but please also check the banner ad for the main page as well.

43
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,019
Seriously!

44
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,660
Fine, I'll do it.

45
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:13,729
I'll do it.

46
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,529
What? What now?

47
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,329
What do you want?

48
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,369
I said I'd fix it. I will revise it.

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,909
You told me to do a better job, so I will.

50
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,840
Can't you keep your mouth shut and wait?

51
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,039
Ta-Da! Surprise!

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,880
I went to the spa and did some shopping too.

53
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,850
Han Seul!

54
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,060
What's wrong, babe?

55
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:18,759

(Episode 4: You Talented Ones Shall Be Slaves to Your Talents)

57
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,369
Ma Eum, aren't you going home?

58
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:33,239
I asked Mr. Na to revise the episode.

59
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,879
I can't go home knowing that he'll be working all night.

60
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,809
So you're going to stay up all night here?

61
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,010
It's not like he'll know.

62
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,249
I commend your decision.

63
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,249
Oh, also...

64
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:50,619
Check in with him throughout the night to make sure it's going well.

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,090
- Will do. - Good.

66
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:58,970
I think Mr. Seok wants to toughen you up.

67
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,900
- I hope everything goes well. - Thank you.

68
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,839
Bye. Have a good night.

69
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,340
- Bye. - Bye.

70
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,340
Jun Yeong, aren't you going home?

71
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,678
Oh, that's... You finished them already?

72
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,150
Yes, I read them quickly because they were so engaging.

73
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,619
Here, I'll return them tomorrow.

74
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,720
It's okay. I'll return them myself today.

75
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,859
I want to check out other comic books too.

76
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,260
What?

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,059
I guess you're interested in comics now.

78
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
A little.

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,668
Then I'll put together a list of recommendations for you.

80
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,169
And you can get a discount at our comic book café.

81
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,340
- Why? - What do you mean, why?

82
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,178
Because you're my only newbie friend.

83
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:46,249
You're a VVIP. A very, very important person.

84
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,049
I am?

85
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,989
I'll get going, then. I hope all goes well.

87

Wish me luck so I can make sure Mr. Na finishes it on time.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,369
Get home safely.

89

Hi.

Oh, it's you.

92
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,450
Wait outside.

93
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,350
I interviewed you, didn't I?

94
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,119
Your name was...

Goo Jun Yeong, right?

96
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,929
- Yes. - Which team are you on?

97
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,428
The Webtoon Service Team, sir.

98
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,460
Webtoon?

99
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,830
Oh, dear. Why Webtoon of all teams?

100
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,769
Anyway, what brings you to the head office?

101
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,538
I need to get a contract approved...

102
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,640
Come on. You're too competent to run such a petty errand.

103
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,780
Didn't you want to join the Service Planning Team?

104
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,150
Yes, I did.

105
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,650
Then...

106
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,960
why do you think you were assigned to that team?

107
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,309
(A new villain appears. Tae Jun was thought to be dead but...)

You know they're like a ticking time bomb, right?

111
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,470
Yes.

112
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,570
So we have to take care of them, carefully.

113
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,039
We can't let the bomb go off, you know?

114
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,950
We have to get rid of the bomb.

115
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,930
Why don't you be our Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit?

116
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,489
I'd like you to do it.

117
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,398
Pardon me?

118
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,529
You should join the head office soon.

119
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,839
I'm not quite following, sir.

120
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,239
Come on. You know what I'm trying to say.

121
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,170
Don't act like you don't understand.

122
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,080
I won't say it twice.

123

- If you don't want to, forget it. - No, it's just that...

124
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,249
Think about it and let me know.

125
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,920
But don't take too long.

126
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,889
There are times...

127
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:17,619

00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,229
When I read the revised version, I realized...

168
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,070
that he could totally do it.

169
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,670
I was being too soft on him,

170
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,670
and it nearly ruined the webtoon...

171
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,009
and Mr. Na as well.

172
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,649
You are a fast learner.

173
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,850
It seems like you learned a lot at once.

174
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,220
All thanks to your nagging.

175
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:12,889
Oh...

176
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,859
Do young people call it "nagging" outright these days?

177
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,758
Oh, no! Did I say "nagging"?

178
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,929
I guess I did. Sorry, my bad.

179
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,830
I meant to say... "Advice".

180
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,700
"Guidance". Yes, that's right.

181
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,070
It's a tough job, isn't it?

182
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,440
Yes.

183
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,879
But I have to say,

184
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,778
this job makes me happy.

185
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,379
What? What about it makes you so happy?

186
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,019
I get to read my favourite webtoon...

187
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,389
before anybody else does!

188
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,519
Hey.

189
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,090
- Let's eat. - Okay.

190
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,529
Were you always a big eater?

191
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,929
Didn't you see?

192
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,570
See what? I only met you recently.

193
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,109
(Princess Kumiho, looking for a human husband)

194
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,040
- It's up now. - Is it?

195
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,670
- Is this it? - Yes.

196
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,220
("Princess Kumiho", Episode 213)

197
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,290
Mom, what are you doing?

198
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,259
Nu Ri, read it.

199
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,560
Oh, is it "Princess Kumiho"?

200
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:03,259
What if it's another boring, drawn-out episode?

201
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,800
Let's see...

202
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,800
What? My goodness.

203
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,809
Why? Is it boring again?

204
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,840
- I'm home. - Hey.

205
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,080
No. This episode of "Princess Kumiho" is really good.

206
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:21,149
- What? - Talk about a crazy plot twist.

207
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,379
My gosh, what a relief.

208
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,819
Did you read it? Is it good?

209
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,690
Why did he keep it so drawn-out when he could do this?

210
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,118
What are you talking about?

211
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,358
He had to build up the story to be able to do this.

212
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,059
What? Are you taking his side because he's your artist?

213
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,999
- Yes. Got a problem with that? - Wow.

214
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,769
Hey. Webtoon Witch won't be able to bash him again, right?

215
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,810
Why are you asking me?

216
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:47,670
I don't know.

217
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,179
Mom! It was so stressful.

218
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,878
Well done.

219
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,249
Thanks.

220
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,749
Na Gang Nam never lets us down.

221
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,488
This episode is so good!

222
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,518
This is why everyone loves "Princess Kumiho". What a twist.

223
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,189
I said it was boring, but I take it back.

224
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,559
I can't wait to read the next episode.

225
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,190
This is from Producer On Ma Eum.

226
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,699
Here.

227
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,869
These flowers are so beautiful.

228
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:15,469
My dear Dumpling is really thoughtful.

229
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,800
"My dear Dumpling"?

230
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,340
Since when did you call her like that?

231
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:29,419
Mr. Na, thank you so much for your amazing work.

232
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,719
I was touched when I read this episode.

233
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,560
You probably hate me now.

234
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,959
You can keep hating me. I will continue to speak up...

235
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,260
and bother you when I need to.

236
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,729
I know I still have a lot to learn.

237
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,800
Please continue to help and guide me.

238
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,639
Sincerely, On Ma Eum.

239
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,909
You can't win me over with a bribe like this!

240
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,709
(Sincerely, On Ma Eum.)

241
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,679
You're a brazen brat, Steamed Dumpling.

242
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,580
What are you doing? Move.

243
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,250
Get out of my way.

244
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,060
Move, will you? You're blocking my way.

245
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,629
Good grief.

246
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,399
Excuse me. What are you doing?

247
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,169
Let him pass...

248
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,240
You're blocking his way.

249
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,879
That face.

250
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,590
It's interesting.

251
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,290
What are you doing?

252
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,330
What's your problem?

253
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,678
Do you need a hand?

254
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,320
No, it's okay. Don't worry.

255
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,119
I got this.

256
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,850
My gosh, thank you.

257
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,419
"Webtoon Camp"?

258
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,959
What's the point though?

259
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,500
We're showered with new webtoons at every audition.

260
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,230
Do you really need a budget increase for this off-line event?

261
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,839
Yes, we'll be mentoring the new artists as well,

262
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,968
so it'll be a great opportunity to find some hidden gems.

263
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,409
- It'll be good for Neon's image... - Look, Mr. Jang.

264
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Here, we must let the numbers do the talking.

265
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,219
ROI is what matters.

266
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,020
It'll take a couple of years to find and refine the diamonds in the mud.

267
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,859
Can you really afford to wait that long?

268
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,599
It's nice to work with artists who are already established,

269
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,399
but we might find someone who's like a jackpot through the event.

270
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,500
I mean, the chances are slim. But why don't we try our luck?

271
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,770
What if it's another epic fail?

272
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,510
Will you take responsibility for all the damage?

273
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:21,850
Yes, I will.

274
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,850
How?

275
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,589
(Yoon Tae Sung, Action)

276
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,688
(Da Som, Sci-Fi)

277
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,490
Gosh, again?

278
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,929
They're all so boring.

279
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,458
None of the new artists looks good this month.

280
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,958
Not just this month.

281
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,730
It's been like this for a few months now.

282
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,869
How's everything coming along for the Webtoon Camp?

283
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,668
At the moment,

284
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,040
we're going through the applications and portfolios.

285
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,708
Who will be mentoring them?

286
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,740
Mr. Baek Eo Jin and Mr. Oh Yoon.

287
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,309
What about Pomme? She should be mentoring them.

288
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,749
That way, reporters will write about it.

289
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,350
Well, that would be great. But it's not easy to persuade her.

290
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,649
Jun Yeong.

291
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,090
Do you think you can get her to do it?

292
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,159
Me?

293
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,760
Yes. You're her producer.

294
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,399
Didn't you fail to persuade her for the past two years, Mr. Kwon?

295
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,600
- I don't remember that. - Gosh.

296
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,468
If we don't up our game this year,

297
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,740
this might be our last camp.

298
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,918
So we're not throwing this camp for fun.

299
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,418
I'm saying you should do your best to prepare for this camp.

300
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,119
And let's bring in an awesome rookie artist this year.

301
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,188
- Jun Yeong. Ma Eum. - Yes.

302
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:40,559
- Yes. - You two should never leave...

303
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,889
the camp with Mr. Seok.

304
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,829
And the rest of you.

305
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,099
You should visit as often as you can and keep me in the loop.

306
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,698
Mr. Kwon. I really need your talent to thrive this year.

307
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,000
Please do your best. Okay?

308
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,468
Let's meet again after we put together a list.

309
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:56,009
Why do you look so down?

310
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,079
All right. Let's have an amazing camp this year!

311
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
All right. Let's aim for a big hit!

312
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,419
Let's aim for ippon!

313
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,490
Yes. For ippon.

314
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,590
Let's aim for ippon!

315
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,898
- Let's aim for ippon! - Let's aim for ippon!

316
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:18,230
Yes!

317
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,299
All right. Prepare for the camp, everyone.

318
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,939
- Let's meet between 4:30 to 5pm. - Okay.

319
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,270
What does it mean this could be our last camp?

320
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,609
- What? - You said that during the meeting.

321
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:34,909
Oh, that.

322
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,090
I don't think they would fund the camp next time.

323
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:44,958
They invested in the camp for three years,

324
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,189
but nothing came of it.

325
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:49,459
I see. That's what you meant?

326
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,129
I thought something was up.

327
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,699
Enjoy your smoke.

328
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,340
- No. - Why not?

329
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,879
What's the point of going there? People will just gossip about me.

330
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,419
Those aspiring webtoon artists would badmouth me when they see me.

331
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,949
They would hate me and get jealous.

332
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,560
You're liked.

333
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:21,329
- Pardon? - There are many people...

334
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,260
who like you too.

335
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:27,899
Why do you always focus on the people who hate you?

336
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,840
I came here to ask you...

337
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,169
to join the camp this year because we really need your expertise.

338
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,310
But I'll stop asking.

339
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,178
- But I'll make a suggestion. - A suggestion?

340
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,820
I think you should come to the camp for your sake.

341
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,689
So many people like you, envy you,

342
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:53,429
and want to be just like you.

343
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,330
You can see them for yourself at the camp.

344

You may think I'm crossing the line,

345
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,169
but I think you will need this in your life.

357
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,669
I recommended this artist.

358
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,628
His drawing still needs work.

359
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:10,300
But it's interesting for some reason.

360
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,939
And his idea is fresh too.

361
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,270
I would like to observe the artist up close.

362
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,580
You do? Will you take responsibility for this?

363
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,948
- Pardon? - Can you be certain...

364
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:21,449
that this is a talented artist?

365
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,250
Or is it just a mere interest of yours?

366
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,649
You can't think wasting a spot is okay.

367
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,759
What if we pass up an artist because of your webtoon artist...

368
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,429
and the artist we pass up ends up becoming a successful one?

369
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:35,959
Are you confident that you can pick out a talented artist?

370
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,698
You're not even that confident,

371
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,070
yet, you're pushing for this lousy artist?

372
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,580
I wouldn't say "lousy", per Se.

373
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,780
It would be nice if you could see it as being unique.

"Hey"?

376
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,429
Well, the story is definitely interesting.

377
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,899
And the energy and the style of the webtoon is quite distinctive.

378
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,770
- Is that so? - Yes.

379
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,769
So we should focus on the story more.

380
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,139
And we can help the artist improve on the drawing.

what do you use?

Yes, they're all right answers.

your ability to stay glued to your seat for as long as you can.

This is about that day, isn't it?

492
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,869
(That face. It's interesting.)

493
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:50,779
We've met. Don't you remember?

494
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,420
Oh, right.

495
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,949
You're that rude woman.

496
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,618
Me? What? I'm rude?

497
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,359
You followed me around and drew my face without my consent.

498
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,830
I call that rude.

499
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,630
I just wanted to draw the faces of those who are alive.

500
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:12,830
What?

501
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,540
I only see people who are ill, patients facing death,

502
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,069
or doctors' expressionless faces.

503
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,310
So when I'm trying to draw, I'm at a loss...

504
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,949
as to how to depict ordinary people's faces...

505
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:28,610
and facial expressions.

506
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,489
I work at a hospital.

507
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,589
That's why...

508
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,159
you followed strangers around and drew their faces?

509
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,889
Yes.

510
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,299
(Smack)

511
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,170
"Weapon Feeb"?

512
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,409
Wait, you are...

513
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,810
Sin Dae Lyug?

514
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,619
Yes.

515
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,020
Is there a problem?

516
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:16,560
I thought it was weird but captivating for some reason.

517
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,929
Turns out, it was a webtoon created by a total weirdo.

518
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,639
Will you take responsibility for this?

519
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,068
Can you be certain that this is a talented artist?

520
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:29,610
Are you confident?

521
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,730
(Welcome to Neon Webtoon Camp)

522
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,569
Welcome, Pomme.

523
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,139
Thank you very much for joining us.

524
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,739
No problem.

525
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,979
Is Producer Goo Jun Yeong not here?

526
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,150
Oh, he's inside. He's tidying up.

527
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,250
Let's go inside.

528
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,318
- Should I move my face forward? - Sure.

529
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,420
In 1, 2, 3.

530
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:20,959
Thank you!

531
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,000
You look even more handsome than your webtoon characters.

532
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,399
- Thank you! - All right, bye.

533
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,670
My gosh!

534
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,239
Hello.

535
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:35,009
Can I get your autograph?

536
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,739
That's my book.

537
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,079
Yes, I'm a huge fan.

538
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,650
Oh, here.

539
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,380
What's your name?

540
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:46,380
- I'm Goo Seul A. - Goo Seul A?

541
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,489
- Is it your pen name? - No, it's my real name.

542
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,719
I don't have a pen name yet.

543
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,529
I don't even know whether or not I can become a webtoon artist.

544
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,830
Why do you think that?

545
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,969
I'm not good enough yet.

546
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:06,000
I've realized it even more since coming here.

547
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,770
Now, I'm wondering...

548
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:11,739
maybe I should just do it as a hobby.

549
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:16,619
Take a seat.

550
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,420
Oh, okay.

551
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,389
It's not your call.

552
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,290
Pardon me?

553
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,360
There is only one thing...

554
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,299
you can decide.

555
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,529
What is your goal? Do you want to become a webtoon artist...

556
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,000
or not?

557
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,539
Instead of asking yourself,

558
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,639
"Can I do this?",

559
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,679
you should be asking,

560
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,880
"Do I really want to do this?"

561
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,750
What do you say, Seul A?

562
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:56,889
Do you really want to become a webtoon artist?

563
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:02,429
Yes, I do. I really do.

564
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,770
"Be brave."

565
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,369
(To Goo Seul A, Be Brave!)

566
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:19,980
You can do it.

567
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,650
I can do it.

568
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:30,459
Is that blood? You have a nosebleed!

569
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,089
Are you okay? Oh, no.

570
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:34,460
I'll get you some tissues.

571
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,639
You didn't get any sleep last night.

572
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:49,069
You can't keep pushing yourself like that. I'm worried.

573
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,610
Right.

574
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:54,380
But this is my first time...

575
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,250
having an entire day to myself to focus on my drawings,

576
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:01,389
so I don't know when to stop and take a break.

577
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:06,830
All right.

578
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,389
Can you stand up?

579
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,230
I'll show you what you can do.

580
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,600
Like this, with your arms.

581
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,839
One, two, three.

582
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,580
The other side too.

583
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,380
All right.

584
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,179
One, two, three, four.

585
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,650
It really hurts.

586
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,189
Don't work nonstop.

587
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,158
You need to stretch every few hours.

588
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,600
Make sure you stretch before you start working.

589
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:45,799
Like this, okay?

590
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,069
- Even your neck is so tense... - No...

591
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:52,270
Okay, I'll do the exercise you showed me.

592
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,610
You must look after your health if you want to complete your work.

593
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,210
Are you worried about me?

594
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,080
I thought you hated me.

595
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,190
I'm doing my job as a webtoon producer.

596
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,290
Besides, I don't hate people easily.

597
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,060
Hating someone consumes a lot of energy.

598
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:22,000
Then...

599
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,440
would you mind taking a look at what I'm working on now?

600
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,710
Just briefly.

601
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,170
Sorry?

602
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,350
I see. Sure.

603
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,019
You should show your character's emotion...

604
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,949
more clearly through your drawing.

605
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,118
- Thank you. - Sure.

606
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,049
Wait. Could I...

607
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,690
get your autograph on my tablet?

608
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:49,029
- Right here? - I want to get some of your energy.

609
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,199
I want to be just like you.

610
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,928
- Like me? - Yes.

611
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:58,139
You're my role model.

612
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:45,319
(Sliding)

613
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,150
(What?)

614
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,560
Well, so...

615
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,830
this is the storyboard now. Right?

616
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:01,170
No. I'm done with that story.

617
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,969
I see.

618
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,169
You want to submit it in black and white without any colours?

619
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,239
Yes.

620
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,009
You see, the world I see isn't that colourful.

621
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:17,520
I just drew what I saw and felt.

622
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:21,790
I see.

623
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:25,790
Is this a continuation of the story you submitted for the camp?

624
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,460
Yes. This is a very long story.

625
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,130
You already finished developing that long story?

626
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,500
Yes. It's in my head.

627
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,269
(Park Hwi Young.)

628
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,339
(Your parents passed away.)

629
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,949
(You must go to the hospital right now.)

630
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,920
What's this? I had been wondering about that from the first episode.

631
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,889
Oh, that. That's Feeb.

632
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,259
- As in "skin"? - No. It's F-E-E-B.

633
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,900
- Feeb? - Yes.

634
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,339
Feeb controls our potential.

635
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,770
People's fear and hate created Feeb.

636
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:20,810
Now, I finally see you.

637
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:23,250
Aren't you happier to see me outside your house?

638
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,448
Aren't you just happy that you finished your mission?

639
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,889
Thanks to you, I got a lot of compliments from my team.

640
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,250
Thank you.

641
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,988
It was fun.

642
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,119
I met...

643
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,489
a lot of people who told me I was their role model.

644
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:39,330
Everyone wants to be just like me.

645
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,900
So I realized I should be happier.

646
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,839
That's a great idea.

647
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,810
I'm glad I came even if it was for a day.

648
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,080
Thank you for inviting me, Producer Goo.

649
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:52,880
Don't mention it.

650
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:54,948
("Neon Sponsors 'Webtoon Camp'")

651
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:57,920
This year's camp seems to be going well.

652
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,119
We must see if they can finish the camp smoothly.

653
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,159
And besides, having good results matters more.

654
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:08,889
You're especially strict with Mr. Jang.

655
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,270
Everything his team does is outdated, and I hate it.

656
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,699
Why did you scout Mr. Jang?

657
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,338
If you wanted to acquire a webtoon department,

658
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,709
I'm sure you had better options.

659
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,638
Why did you bring in those people from a failed platform, Gingertoon?

660
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,650
Gingertoon didn't fail.

661
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,350
The company forced them to close the platform.

662
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,548
Isn't that the same thing?

663
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:38,758
Their platform closed because it wasn't profitable.

664
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:40,659
I can't jump to conclusions.

665
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:45,299
It's possible that someone could've restructured the company...

666
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,199
as a way to show one's competency.

667
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:53,239
Mr. Heo, you were at Gingertoon before joining our company, right?

668
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:56,839
You must know more about their internal situation than me.

669
00:47:57,509 --> 00:47:59,909
Look at her. She's taking a shot at me.

670
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:02,508
(Comic Book Café On)

671
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:04,548
I'm home.

672
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,389
Why is it so dark? Is everyone out?

673
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,060
Hi.

674
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,230
You were home, honey.

675
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,600
I'm not feeling...

676
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:32,239
You know, I'm...

677
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,850
Well...

678
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,170
You've been gone for so long.

679
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,139
I wanted us to have some quality time together.

680
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,850
So I told our girls not to come home.

681
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,080
For the entire week.

682
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,850
The entire week?

683
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:17,319
The entire week.

684
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:20,759
Come here.

685
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:25,799
It's okay.

686
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,400
Sorry.

687
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,380
(I took care of it.)

688
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,549
I took care of it.

689
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,199
Think about it and let me know.

690
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,810
But don't take too long.

691
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,440
There are times...

692
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,310
when timing is more important than the decision itself.

693
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,169
What? You woke up early.

694
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,468
Yes. I like going for a run in the morning.

695
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:37,869
Really?

696
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,199
How about a bet?

697
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:44,679
The loser buys coffee.

698
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,980
Gosh.

699
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,429
They are full of energy.

700
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,869
You're a better runner than I thought.

701
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:47,409
Than you thought? I'm a guy, you know?

702
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,339
A guy? That's funny.

703
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:56,249
I'm an athlete, you know?

704
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,850
So I thought I would win for sure.

705
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,420
I won, right? You cheated.

706
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,819
Cheat?

707
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,060
Fine. Let's say you won.

708
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,060
I'll buy you coffee.

709
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,770
Coffee is on me. Let's go.

710
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:28,310
Yes!

711
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,449
Thank you for the coffee.

712
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,759
This hits the spot.

713
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,969
Ma Eum.

714
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,880
You remind me of someone I know.

715
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,949
Who?

716
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:05,420
There's just someone I know.

717
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:20,500
(Please live.)

718
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,170
Sir.

719
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:32,210
Can you take a look at what I have so far?

720
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,279
Me?

721
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,750
Yes.

722
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:41,650
Well, I finished colouring up to this point.

723
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,920
I don't know how to pitch this.

724
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,460
It's about baseball.

725
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:50,859
Yes. I used to be...

726
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,600
in the Little League up until middle school.

727
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:57,069
What would have happened if I didn't quit and kept going?

728
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:59,369
That's what this webtoon is about.

729
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:03,169
- The chief editor will like it. - Pardon?

730
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,909
Our chief editor is a hardcore baseball fan.

731
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:10,380
I think you should use that when you pitch tomorrow.

732
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,579
Since you used to play baseball,

733
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,089
you have a lot of experience and are well-versed in baseball.

734
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,690
And you're confident to show that in your webtoon.

735
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,020
Thank you.

736
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,989
Now, I sort of know how to pitch this webtoon.

737
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,798
Was my advice helpful?

738
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:29,069
It was really helpful. I guess that's why you're a producer.

739
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,869
I'm glad to hear that.

740
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,480
- Do you want a drink? - Give me a drink, please.

741
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,988
Gosh. You're going to use that to pitch your webtoon?

742
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,349
- Hey, come here and check this out. - What?

743
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,659
This is crazy.

744
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,719
What is this?

745
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,159
Goodness. It looks like we have one less artist to worry about.

746
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,069
How did he get picked to join this camp?

747
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:05,440
Maybe, he's rich or has connections.

748
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:09,139
- Is he drawing or scribbling? - Is he really a webtoon artist?

749
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:13,439
All he has to do is colour that black. That's it.

750
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,880
He's just doodling.

751
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:17,650
Hey.

752
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,920
Have some food.

753
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,049
Have some food.

754
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:02,859
(Gazing)

755
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,830
(Slashing)

756
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:07,258
You have a minute until the deadline.

757
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:09,270
Everyone, submit your file.

758
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:22,079
("Weapon Feeb" by Sin Dae Lyug, Send)

759
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,150
(Your email has been sent successfully.)

760
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,949
I'll start the countdown.

761
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,359
Eight, seven, six,

762
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,829
five, four, three,

763
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,959
two, one.

764
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,569
Your time is up. Good work!

765
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,299
We did it.

766
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,880
Good work.

767
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,009
- Good work. - Good work.

768
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,549
It finally ended.

769
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,278
Hello.

770
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:03,118
I drew the webtoon, "Vampire Family's Journey to Seoul".

771
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,618
My name is Goo Seul A.

772
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,789
(Oh Yoon)

773
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:09,360
The genre of this webtoon is fantasy and romance.

774
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,829
The major storyline centers around...

775
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,758
the vampire family who moves to Seoul...

776
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:16,199
from the countryside and their new life in Seoul.

777
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,838
And it also shows heart-fluttering,

778
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,809
yet dangerous romance between the two main characters.

779
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,310
(Oh Yoon)

780
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,580
Mr. Kang Tae Kyu.

781
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,750
You won a contest from Papaya before.

782
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,480
Yes. I was 20 years old then.

783
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,219
I thought I would be killing it once I made my début.

784
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,520
But they made me fix my characters and the storyboard for years.

785
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,428
I just wasted my time working...

786
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,360
under incompetent producers.

787
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,899
"Mom. Behind you..."

788
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,329
Well,

789
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,428
the truth is,

790
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:50,500
I don't read other webtoons because it makes me mad.

791
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:54,068
Seriously. I noticed some weird webtoons...

792
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:55,869
on Neon Webtoon.

793
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,409
So it made me think that my webtoon deserved to be on your platform too.

794
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,948
(Jang Man Chul)

795
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:02,409
Those who can't find...

796
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,420
strength in other webtoons will never grow.

797
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,048
Reading other webtoons is a part of your studies.

798
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:11,218
I'm disappointed by your narrow mind.

799
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:12,459
(A girl?)

800
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,659
(Yes. Let's change the baseball team together.)

801
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,130
Hello. I'm Lee Yoo Jin of "Full Count".

802
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:21,729
Two outs. Full count.

803
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,170
Do you know the meaning of "full count"?

804
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,638
When the batter has 2 strikes and 3 balls,

805
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,739
that's called a full count.

806
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,408
Sometimes, a batter hits a home run then.

807
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,250
Or the batter is struck out.

808
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,479
Just like the focused batter with a full count,

809
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,089
I am also as focused and desperate as the batter.

810
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:43,949
I gave my all to my work. Thank you.

811
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,718
Ms. Lee. You were in the Little League.

812
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,258
Yes. I kept playing baseball with the boys until middle school.

813
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:53,258
But I quit because as you can see, I have a small build.

814
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:55,368
- A pitcher or a batter? - I did both.

815
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,130
But I'm a better pitcher.

816
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,000
My curve balls are pretty good.

817
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,509
Gosh. She can throw curve balls.

818
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,709
Then you must have a lot of things to talk about in your webtoon.

819
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,909
Yes. I'm confident about that.

820
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,080
I have a lot of friends whom I can interview.

821
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,959
(Kim Hwal, in his 50s, nationally recognized religious leader)

822
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,989
Okay.

823
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:30,199
So...

824
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:32,900
Feeb...

825
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,369
controls...

826
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,339
people's potential.

827
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,850
Being a weapon is the concept.

828
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:49,750
It's a monster based on...

829
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,119
horror and hatred...

830
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,690
people have.

831
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,130
So there's a religious leader character.

832
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,400
It's a story about people who stand against him.

833
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,500
That's the main idea.

834
01:00:08,469 --> 01:00:11,210
Where did you learn to draw?

835
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:12,810
Did you ever take a class?

836
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,449
No. I started drawing on my own.

837
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,210
No wonder.

838
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,489
The story itself is interesting.

839
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:27,989
Do you want to stay on just as a storywriter?

840
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:32,199
A webtoon artist must win over the readers with its drawing.

841
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:35,529
But no readers would keep reading with this kind of drawing.

842
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:39,069
I see. But...

843
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,339
I didn't come up with the story first.

844
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,539
These images came to me first. So I started drawing.

845
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,109
Okay.

846
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,678
Judging by the way you speak,

847
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,650
I don't think you can be a writer either.

848
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,559
Mr. Sin.

849
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,230
Has it ever crossed your mind to take a drawing class?

850
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:03,659
No.

851
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,159
I don't want to be good at drawing.

852
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,569
I just wanted to draw comics.

853
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,299
That doesn't make sense.

854
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:16,110
Is it possible to separate drawing from comics?

855
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,210
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

856
01:01:55,009 --> 01:01:56,750
Oh, no. We feel awful.

857
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,449
It's broken.

858
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,619
But aren't you going to quit drawing anyway?

859
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,119
I thought it would be better if you quit sooner.

860
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,130
We've been in this industry for a long time.

861
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,460
So we can spot a quitter when we see one.

862
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,968
What's your point?

863
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,429
Do we have to spell it out for you?

864
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,900
- We're saying this for your sake. - Yes.

865
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,110
You can try all your want with this junk tablet.

866
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:25,739
But you'll never make a début.

867
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,449
I think I will make a début before the dinosaurs...

868
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,520
who don't know their places.

869
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:42,460
What?

870
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:45,060
This guy is ridiculous.

871
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,960
Do you want to die, you jerk?

872
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,799
How old are you?

873
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:52,339
How dare you talk back to us?

874
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,110
If you're poor and can't draw, just crawl back home, you jerk!

875
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,250
You little...

876
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:11,860
No matter what you tell me, I won't quit drawing comics.

877
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,659
You guys are already rotting in your heads.

878
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,630
That's all you see. So you never made it as webtoon artists.

879
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:20,360
You crazy jerk.

880
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,699
Stop.

881
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,040
Unless you want to get kicked out.

882
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,710
Who do you think you are?

883
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,940
The camp is already over. You can't kick me out.

884
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:36,449
You jerk.

885
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:43,489
What are you doing?

886
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,119
Gosh.

887
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:40,279
(Today's Webtoon)

888
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:43,179
When I spit out bad thoughts, they come true.

889
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:46,250
Just like I have been cursed by the things I said.

890
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,350
Put together a team to incubate new talents.

891
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,020
He instinctively knows how to stage the story for comics.

892
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:55,960
What if I reach a conclusion that keeping the Webtoon Service Team...

893
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,258
is more profitable in the long run?

894
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:00,830
Does it mean you will pull out webtoon from the main page?

895
01:05:01,529 --> 01:05:03,600
What's the right thing to do?

896
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:06,000
Do your best to grow as much as you can.

897
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:08,040
So you can be a real help.
