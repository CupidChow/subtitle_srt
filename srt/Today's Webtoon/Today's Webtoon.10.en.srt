Can I have that?

11
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,929
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,340
That.

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,739

16
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,230
of Youngtoon are amazing.

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,400
They're contacting Ji Hyeong.

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,409
Are you going home?

19
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,680
Do you want to grab a drink?

20
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,109
Sure.

21
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,819
Ma Eum.

22
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:01,560
What?

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,289
Is he your boyfriend?

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,329
No, he's from work.

25
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,139
You were expecting a friend?

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,300
Bye.

27
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,009
Don't leave. Let's drink together.

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,280
Right. You're here. You might as well stay.

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,550
It's okay. Have a good time.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,719
Come on. Stay.

31
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,419
I won't stay for too long.

32
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,960
Sure.

33
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,629
Can we have a glass? Are you having beer?

34
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,399
One beer and Sprite, please.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,500
Okay.

36
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,370
- Do you want to sit here? - Relax.

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,110
You said it was tough, but no wonder you enjoy working there.

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,639
Stop it.

39
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,680
It's my mom.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,020
I'm going to answer the call. Don't say anything weird.

41
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,889
Okay. She knows me so well.

42
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:07,930
Thank you.

43
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,069
Nice to meet you. I'm Ma Eum's friend, Lee Eun Young.

44
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,099
Nice to meet you. I'm Goo Jun Yeong.

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,339
We work as a webtoon producer.

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,639
How old are you?

47
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,508
I'm 26.

48
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,610
We're friends. Here, let me pour you a glass.

49
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,189
- Thank you. - Stop.

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,229
He doesn't drink. You don't drink.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,469
Have Sprite.

52
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,699
- Here. - Thank you.

53
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,069
What's going on?

54
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,080
You're the same age, and you work together,

55
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,679
but why are you so polite?

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,810
I thought he was older than you.

57
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,449
You think so?

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,949
I want it to be casual. Would that make you feel uncomfortable?

59
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,849
No. I like it.

60
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,860
Shall we talk casually too?

61
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,199
Sure.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
You said it first.

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,769
Now, let's get started.

64
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,638
Okay. Let's drink.

65
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,779
What?

66
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,809
How about a toast?

67
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,319
You need to drink too.

68
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:42,120
Do you want... One... One more glass?

69
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,990
What?

70
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,730
- That was too polite. - Let me pour you a glass.

71
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,490
Good.

72
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,899
Okay.

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,000
Between us...

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,230
You're home.

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,239
Where's Ma Eum?

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,740
She's not home yet. She's having a drink with Eun Young.

77
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,910
Okay.

78
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,938
Honey. Have some watermelon. It's really sweet.

79
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,648
Dad. Have some watermelon. It's so sweet.

80
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,109
- Move. - Why?

81
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,519
Let me go wash my hands.

82
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,790
Why are you telling me to move?

83
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,060
(Ma Eum's Room)

84
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,759
Did Mr. Ma Hae Kyu go to the nursing home?

85
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,329
Yes, he said he'll get rehab.

86
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,899
He asked me to look after Yu Na while he's gone.

87
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,170
- I see. - It's great.

88
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,439
So, what do you want to say?

89
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,209
Say what?

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,889
I had an offer for Youngtoon chief editor position.

91
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,029
Really? Hey. That's great.

92
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,360
You should've been one already. It's so late.

93
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,259
Congratulations.

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,970
You're finally on a roll.

95
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:08,970
I'm happy for you.

96
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,509
It was just an offer.

97
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,980
I didn't want you to hear it from someone else.

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,349
So I'm telling you now.

99
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,518
You could tell me after accepting the offer.

100
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,688
That's a rare chance. In fact, it's Youngtoon.

101
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,990
Besides, not anyone can be the chief editor.

102
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,328
You need perfect timing...

103
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,698
for the perfect opportunity.

104
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,100
That's really great.

105
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,629
Congratulations.

106
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,139
But this isn't time for that.

107
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,980
You should only think about yourself.

108
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,519
It's here.

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,230
Man Chul.

110
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:04,959
Ji Hyeong.

111
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,829
If I...

112
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,040
change my mind and beg you to stay,

113
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
you must...

114
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,470
only think about yourself to the end.

115
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,879
Put yourself in the highest priority.

116
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,180
That's the only advice I can give you...

117
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,790
as your old friend and colleague.

118
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,290
Bye.

119
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,000
Bye.

120
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,910
You should've confirmed the schedule.

121
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,479
He doesn't understand why he should post his cartoon on the internet.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,948
He didn't even let me talk about the meeting.

123
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,420
What was I supposed to do?

124
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,588
We were known each other for such a long time.

125
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,489
How could he slam the door in my face?

126
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,328
Did you confirm the meeting schedule with Artist Yeom for tomorrow?

127
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,329
What?

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,029
Yes.

129
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,730
This job is a total scam.

130
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,398
I was moving to another publisher...

131
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,040
It's not a scam. The era of webtoon is coming.

132
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:25,980
It's going to be huge.

133
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,719
- Huge. - That swindler.

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,249
(1. Jaemimaru)

135
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,749
(2. Funnytoony)

136
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,619
(4. Webottle or Toonbottle)

137
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,919
(5. Gingertoon?)

138
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,230
Ji Hyeong. What do you think for the logo?

139
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,798
(5. Gingertoon?)

140
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,029
You said you want to name it Gingertoon.

141
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,200
Man Chul.

142
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,398
You can't name a company Shudder...

143
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,939
or use that for the logo.

144
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,638
So I said I'll go with Gingertoon.

145
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,340
Gingerbread cookie is all you can think of for Gingertoon.

146
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,820
Take a photo and copy.

147
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,159
The law firm and other...

148
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,860
You should use the second method.

149
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,559
Make it look three dimensional.

150
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,360
For the second step...

151
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,340
Help me.

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,639
Watch out.

153
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,008
- We have to go now. We're late. - Wait.

154
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,679
- What? - I can't find the contract.

155
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,278
Didn't you leave it there last time?

156
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,849
It's gone.

157
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,120
Here.

158
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,048
Oh, yes. Thank you.

159
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,719
- Where was it? - Here.

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,359
- Bye. - See you later.

161
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,490
Let's go. Bye.

162
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,960
- Thanks, Ae Ri. - Bye.

163
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,100
Everyone.

164
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,740
Mr. Hae Soo is finally joining us!

165
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,179
Wonderful.

166
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,450
This is real.

167
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,449
Great.

168
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,989
As soon as he saw the contract, he signed it.

169
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,689
I knew it.

170
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,019
We should take a photo on a day like this.

171
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,829
All right. Ten seconds.

172
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,028
- Hurry up. - Ten seconds.

173
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,199
Go down.

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,029
Ten seconds are so long.

175
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,099
Keep the contract up.

176
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,469
- Keep smiling. - Keep smiling.

177
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,470
Here we go.

178
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,460
- Assistant Editor Seok? - Yes?

179
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,158
It's the soundtrack production plan.

180
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,299
- Can you go over it? - Okay.

181
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Did you...

182
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,469
get approval from artists?

183
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,668
Yes. I'm going to tell...

184
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,878
Pomme and Sin Dae Lyug in person today.

185
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,079
Okay. Good luck.

186
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Thank you.

187
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,090
By the way, what is all this?

188
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,459
Stuff from Gingertoon.

189
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,220
I see.

190
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,029
Hello.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,369
You're here too.

192
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,399
Because I missed you.

193
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,340
This way.

194
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,908
They're my assistants. They're Neon Webtoon producers.

195
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,949
Say hello.

196
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,179
- Hello. - Hello.

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,179
Nice to meet you.

198
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,350
I'm Producer On Ma Eum.

199
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Hello. I'm Producer Goo Jun Yeong.

200
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,970
I'm glad the assistants live nearby.

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,699
Thanks to you, the work will be done on time.

202
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,940
Right?

203
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,210
All you care about is work.

204
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,209
Like I said before,

205
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,049
you're my highest priority.

206
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,220
Well, you don't sound sincere.

207
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,889
Tell her.

208
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,329
About what?

209
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,230
About my sincerity.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,129
I'm not sure about it.

211
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,970
Just this once.

212
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,899
Well...

213
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,470
I don't know.

214
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,740
I'll do my best.

215
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,620
Mr. Sin.

216
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,289
I told you last time.

217
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,058
The cartoon is important,

218
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,889
but it's not as important as people.

219
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,299
And that includes you too.

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,929
Eat well,

221
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,500
and sleep well.

222
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,950
I like it.

223
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,820
She's different from the previous characters.

224
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,059
- What do you think? - I like the expression.

225
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,289
But...

226
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,200
it looks familiar.

227
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
You think so?

228
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,539
Nothing looks similar to me.

229
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,009
If you're okay with it, I'll color it and finish it up.

230
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,779
Okay.

231
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,250
Have you checked the document on the soundtrack?

232
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,750
I think Ji Hyeong will move to Youngtoon.

233
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,090
- What? - You scared me.

234
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:50,629
Why would Assistant Editor Seok go to Youngtoon?

235
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,799
He gets a lot of offers.

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,668
But he already refused Youngtoon once.

237
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,398
When we closed Gingertoon, he didn't go to Youngtoon...

238
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,839
and came here with us.

239
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,539
It's different this time.

240
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,509
It's the chief editor position.

241
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,710
The chief editor position...

242
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,009
is a rare chance.

243
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,980
Yes, that'd come with conditions...

244
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:15,620
that he can't possibly refuse.

245
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,659
Youngtoon?

246
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,110
Where are you going? Do you have a meeting?

247
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,279
To meet Oh Yoon.

248
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,480
- Did you make up your mind? - Yes.

249
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,590
It still won't be easy.

250
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,259
Bye.

251
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,269
Do you want me to get you cheongsimhwan?

252
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,639
Good luck.

253
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,889
Darn it.

254
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,700
Nice.

255
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,600
Only two more to go.

256
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,340
What the heck? I'm winning.

257
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,719
I texted you many times that I'll visit you today,

258
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,990
but you didn't respond.

259
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,720
I called you in front of your house, but you didn't answer it.

260
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,759
I didn't know. I was too busy.

261
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,670
It's tough, isn't it?

262
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,069
You can barely make a progress.

263
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,519
It's always been tough.

264
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,890
This isn't my first time drawing.

265
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,190
Sometimes I'm stuck.

266
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,190
I'm sure it'll all work out.

267
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,529
You think so?

268
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,140
You've never been in the bottom rank for this long before.

269
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,710
You'd been exhausted,

270
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,108
but you were never lost.

271
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm not lost.

272
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,509
I'm doing my own thing,

273
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,920
but people don't see it. That's frustrating.

274
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,250
It suddenly got me thinking...

275
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,819
if I made a wrong choice.

276
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,230
Did I make a wrong choice?

277
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,599
What the heck?

278
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,069
You liked it when I described it.

279
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,568
You said it was good.

280
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,980
You said you wanted to publish it.

281
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,450
- It's my fault. - What?

283
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,519
If I can go back in time...

284
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,390
If I get a chance again,

285
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,230
I would've plucked up my courage and went against it.

286
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,799
I wanted to follow your opinion.

287
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,569
I was afraid...

288
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,670
you might move somewhere else if I go against your idea.

289
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,910
I neglected my duty.

290
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,349
When I first read "The Beginning of Men" synopsis and rough draft,

291
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,680
it was hard to understand and abstruse.

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,190
I also thought you won't be able to prove your real worth in that genre.

293
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,660
What's my real worth?

294
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,289
Being silly?

295
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,960
You make everyone happy.

296
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,140
So, it's a cartoon for comedy?

297
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,009
I don't feel like laughing.

298
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,440
(Darn parents.)

299
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,579
Don't give in.

300
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,920
I thought I met a genius.

301
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,759
What?

302
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,460
- What is it? - It's so...

303
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,259
Look at you.

304
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,329
- I'm okay. - What's wrong with you?

305
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,200
Geez.

306
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,538
Do you remember the first thing I said...

307
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,509
- when I met you? - This is crazy.

308
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,680
"The world needs your cartoon."

309
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,619
Anyone who reads your cartoon...

310
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,029
will be truly happy at least for that moment.

311
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:28,230
Right. That's what you said.

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,440
I was really excited to hear that.

313
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:41,778
I thought I won't be able to debut...

314
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,210
after Gingertoon closed.

315
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:47,750
But I had a flashy debut in Neon thanks to you.

316
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,400
You put your faith in me back then.

317
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,069
Please trust my opinion just once more.

318
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,210
Your sense of humor is warm, not cynical or biting.

319
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,480
It's humane.

320
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,778
And I know you started "The Beginning of Men"...

321
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,220
to show that humanism.

322
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,849
This isn't just about the sales numbers.

323
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,960
Even for your sake, it's better to decide quickly.

324
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,960
I've arrived at this decision after long, careful consideration.

325
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,599
If you think I'm wrong, you can go ahead and scold me.

326
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,569
But as your producer, I, Choi Du Hee,

327
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,539
believe that you should end "The Beginning of Men" here...

328
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,980
and aim for a successful comeback with a new project.

329
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,329
People who said my work lacked depth...

330
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,470
and that I'd amassed popularity only due to my looks and the TV shows...

331
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,839
I really wanted to prove them wrong.

332
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,910
And those who said I could only make funny webtoons.

333
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,680
I wanted to silence them for good.

334
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,470
Mr. Oh.

335
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,740
You see, making someone laugh...

336
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,839
It's the hardest thing to do.

337
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,420
And in this country, no one can beat you on that front.

338
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,450
I hope you can take pride in that.

339
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,490
Producer Choi...

340
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,750
(You can do it!)

341
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:39,990
I never once imagined the office...

342
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,160
without Assistant Editor Seok.

343
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,940
It's five dollars.

344
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,049
- I'll get the same one. - Sure.

345
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,650
Wait, but...

346
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Thanks.

347
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,720
Ever since I heard Mr. Seok might leave Neon,

348
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,759
I've been having a hard time focusing on work.

349
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,700
Just because of that?

350
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:24,000
- What? - I mean, people change jobs often.

351
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:27,639
Besides, if they're offering him the chief editor position,

352
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,739
we should congratulate him.

353
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,740
Yes, you're absolutely right.

354
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,339
We should totally congratulate him.

355
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,549
It's just that I'm a little sad.

356
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,190
He's my first mentor, you know.

357
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,259
I guess you emotionally relied on him a lot.

358
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,589
Yes.

359
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,299
I certainly did.

360
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,029
And I learned so much from him.

361
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,369
But all I did was cause trouble...

362
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:03,039
and make him clean up my mess.

363
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,539
I would've tried to learn things more quickly...

364
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,809
had I known he'd leave the company so soon.

365
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,430
Are you feeling hot?

366
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:26,400
No, I'm good.

367
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,269
(Answer Right Away)

368
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,609
I'll be right back.

369
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,109
Yes.

370
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,890
Do you work out too?

371
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,329
These days, nothing's more important than taking care of yourself.

372
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:04,829
I go for a run from time to time to clear my head.

373
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,099
Come on. You need more than just cardio exercises.

374
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,910
A real man must lift weights.

375
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,910
Right.

376
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,950
- Sorry? - The towel.

377
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,190
Thank you.

378
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:38,470
Is there something else you need me to do?

379
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,099
I believe I've sent you all the reports you needed.

380
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,039
- Are you sure? - Yes.

381
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,880
You think you've covered everything I needed?

382
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,078
Based on the reports you sent last time,

383
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,649
it seems like Mr. Kwon's projects take up a large portion...

384
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,719
of the team's sales.

385
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,359
I'd like to view his list of artists and other files.

386
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,930
Oh, those are his personal files.

387
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,369
Right, and I want to see them.

388
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,499
It's risky for the team to let just one producer...

389
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,069
dominate everyone else in sales.

390
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,809
And he's the only one who has access to all the key info and data?

391
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,380
I think it's dangerous to let him thrive all alone.

392
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,220
Nothing bad will come out of me having access to the info.

393
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,859
What's this? Raise your arm.

394
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,829
You said you only did cardio.

395
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
It's a talisman. My good luck talisman.

396
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,390
You gave me this on the day of my interview.

397
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,220
Right!

398
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,389
But you didn't pass the interview that day.

399
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,130
Regardless, I got the job and am sitting here now.

400
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,140
Mr. Seok!

401
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,740
You scared me.

402
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,079
What are you doing here?

403
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,519
(Little Tent Bar)

404
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,259
Hey, what's the matter?

405
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,170
Did something happen?

406
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:56,710
- Yes. - What? What happened?

407
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,680
I heard you were getting bumped up.

408
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,079
Hey, where did you learn that expression?

409
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,789
Back when I was doing judo,

410
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,159
my seniors said that when our coaches or head coaches...

411
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,789
were moving forward in their careers.

412
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,329
I see.

413
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:22,369
Anyway, who told you that I was getting bumped up?

414
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,240
Mr. Kwon told me.

415
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,969
He said you were probably going to join Youngtoon...

416
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,140
as their new chief editor.

417
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,440
He said rumors were running rampant.

418
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,180
- Mr. Kwon said that? - Yes.

419
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,089
But that's not true.

420
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,089
- Sorry? - I haven't decided yet.

421
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,059
They did approach me with the offer, but...

422
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,829
Oh.

423
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,670
Does it mean you might turn down the offer?

424
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,069
Yes.

425
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,140
Why? Do you want me to stay?

426
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,278
I know it's not my place to say this...

427
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,379
and that I'm being selfish.

428
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,849
But of course, I want you to stay.

429
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,588
But everyone says that you won't be able to turn it down...

430
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:20,390
as it's an amazing opportunity, so I don't know what to say.

431
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,970
Right, it is a great opportunity.

432
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,910
There are many people who want that position.

433
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,809
Then how come you haven't made up your mind yet?

434
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,250
Well... Just because everyone wants it,

435
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,890
it doesn't mean I have to want it too.

436
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,490
So I'm really trying...

437
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,890
to listen to my heart.

438
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,500
To figure out what I really want...

439
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,700
and what I should choose...

440
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,670
to make sure I won't regret my decision later on.

441
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,309
Oh, it's okay.

442
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,819
- One moment. - Okay.

443
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:26,690
Yes, what's up?

444
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,690
Okay, all right.

445
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,059
No, I'll meet you there.

446
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,299
Okay.

447
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,440
Well...

448
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,710
You should go home. I'll see you tomorrow at work.

449
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,380
- Okay. - All right, bye.

450
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:52,180
Wait, Mr. Seok!

451
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
Yes?

452
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,319
It's nothing.

453
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,259
Get home safely.

In short.

462

It is your job to find the answer.

Oh, me? I see, okay.

464
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,949
Starting next month, you are to send me the answers you find.

Why are you still undecided?

471
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,760
It's an amazing offer.

472
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,760
Everyone is different and considers different things...

when making a career decision.

474
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,000
I keep thinking...

475
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,738
that you're a better fit for the position.

476
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,300
Why did they approach me?

477
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,670
Because I want to be with you.

478
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,719
I need to learn more from you.

479

Just like you chose Neon...

because of Mr. Jang Man Chul,

481
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,519
I chose you as my chief editor.

Why won't you accept the offer?

Shouldn't you be grateful that you got an offer from Youngtoon?

Hello, Mr. Na. How have you been?

524
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,920
Mr. Seok, are you moving to Youngtoon?

525
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,090
So the rumors are true.

526
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,658
You practically begged me not to go to Youngtoon.

527
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,829
And you're joining Youngtoon as their new chief editor?

528
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,039
I feel so betrayed.

529
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,379
Listen. Nothing's been decided yet.

530
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,610
Well, I was mad at you when I first heard the rumors.

531
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,380
But then, I thought about it,

532
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,920
and it is about time you got the chief editor title.

533
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,218
Besides, if you're Youngtoon's chief editor,

534
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:13,219
it'll be easier for me to move to Youngtoon later on.

I don't think it's a bad idea.

you kept hunching your back while working on your drawings,

I suggest you tweak the angle...

602

00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:17,170
I will see you tomorrow.

(Title, Payout Per Episode)

675
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,969
- Hello? - It's me.

676
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,139
Who is this?

677
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:08,750
I said we should meet another time, Uncle.

678
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:12,949
Why? So you can change your number and go AWOL on me again?

679
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,960
Goodness. Why are you treating me like a loan shark?

680
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,360
What do you want from me?

681
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,968
Help us out with our living expenses.

682
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:26,029
We only lived at your place for a few months.

683
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,300
We were always walking on eggshells and ate the bare minimum to survive.

684
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,239
- Have some shame, will you? - Hey.

685
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,479
You can't do this to me.

686
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,908
You were abroad when Ae Ri died.

687
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:38,449
Who held a funeral for her?

688
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,919
I was the most heartbroken when your sister died.

689
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,150
I was the only one who sincerely cried.

690
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,760
That's why I'm here, to see you for one last time.

691
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:53,800
Enjoy the food. And do not visit me at work again.

692
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:56,800
You brat. You're such an ingrate.

693
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,500
I did my best to raise you two for my late sister's sake.

694
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:08,940
You took my parents' insurance payout.

695
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,650
On top of that,

696
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:13,980
you took the money Ae Ri earned from her part-time jobs.

697
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:16,280
You were heartbroken when she died?

698
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:19,420
I bet you were just angry because your meal ticket was gone.

Hey, Producer Goo. Did you have lunch?

00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:33,639
Spicy beef soup... Never mind.

702
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,400
I'll see you in the office.

703
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:41,840
Jun Yeong! Wait.

704
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:45,150
How do you know that man?

705
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,949
It was him. It was his fault that Ae Ri died.

706
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:34,730
What brings you all the way here?

707
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,900
I've made my decision.

708
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,500
I figured I should let you know sooner than later.

709
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,130
What? What is it? Is there a problem?

710

No. Everything's fine.

00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,670
At a beef barbecue restaurant. Awesome, right?

715
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,469
- Yes. - You don't like beef?

716
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:49,639
- I do. - Right? It's awesome.

717
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,509
"Awesome"? Are you serious?

718
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,510
This is our farewell dinner for Mr. Seok.

719
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:59,409
Goodness. Read the room, will you?

720
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,820
Oh, dear.

721
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,059
I'm going to pig out today.

722
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,530
What's with you today? You're scaring me.

723
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,739
What? What's the problem?

724
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,869
You never join us when we have a team dinner.

725
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:26,309
We're having beef today, Hanwoo.

726
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:31,479
He's here because this is Mr. Seok's farewell dinner.

727
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,808
Farewell dinner? Come on.

728
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,178
If you take a taxi there, you won't pay more than the base fare.

729
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:36,479
Don't make such a fuss.

730
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,819
We know how you feel. You're acting all tough,

731
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,159
but you'd hate to see him leave. No one's sadder than you are.

732
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:44,030
Mr. Kwon.

733
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,989
You must be on pins and needles...

734
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,229
because you don't want to be promoted to assistant editor.

735
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,869
I already told you guys loud and clear. I won't do it.

736
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,768
Why not? You'll be great at it.

737
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:54,839
Why would I? I'm not crazy.

738
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,569
I'd have to work a lot, and it's stressful.

739
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,169
I'll get nothing but empty compliments.

740
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,610
You're clueless.

741
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,440
But you'll get a raise.

742
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,649
You really are clueless.

743
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,609
It'll be a tiny pay raise.

744
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,320
It's peanuts compared to the commission he currently earns.

745
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,050
Yes, you know how it works.

746
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,690
There is probably zero chance that Mr. Seok will decide to stay, right?

747
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,429
How would I know?

748
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,429
He should accept the offer. I mean, for his own sake.

749
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,670
Hey, what are you doing? Pouring your own drink?

750
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,170
Jun Yeong.

751
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,110
Here, let me.

752
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,679
Oh, you guys have dropped the honorifics.

753
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,309
Yes.

754
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:43,349
Hey, Ma Eum.

755
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,219
You're already downing your drinks?

756
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:49,760
She must be sad. Mr. Seok was her first mentor.

757
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,289
Goodness. Take it down a notch, will you?

758
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,468
A team dinner? Why, all of a sudden?

759
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:58,630
And Hanwoo at that?

760
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,170
I want to treat you to a nice dinner before you leave.

761
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,710
Hey, I have something to tell you.

762
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:06,138
We can talk when we sit down. Everyone is waiting for us.

763
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,440
- Come on. - Wait, but...

764
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,939
I'm full. I ate too much.

765
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,948
- You made it. - There they are.

766
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,949
- You're here. - You don't need to get up.

767
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,920
- The man of the hour is here. - Why am I the man of the hour?

768
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,789
Come on. We already know.

769
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,819
Know what?

770
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,630
That you're leaving Neon.

771
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,900
It looks like I was the only one who didn't know.

772
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,969
Yes, that's why we're here.

773
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:41,679
All right. As you all know...

774
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,119
Mr. Seok and I...

775
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,988
have been working together...

776
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:57,658
since our Gingertoon days, but Youngtoon...

777
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:59,730
Stop! Wait.

778
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:02,860
Do you want to tell them yourself?

779
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,929
Yes, let me tell them.

782
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,849
- What are you doing? - Let go.

783
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,190
What's with you today? You're scaring me...

784
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:34,829
Say something cool.

785
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,380
I know what you're all thinking now.

786
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,250
And I know about the rumors that have been going around.

787
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,949
- But... - Sorry, one moment.

788
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:57,819
I really wasn't going to cry.

789
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,449
My gosh.

790
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,059
- What's with her? - Mr. Seok.

791
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,299
I'll do better! Can you please stay?

792
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,469
My gosh...

793
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,369
Oh, boy. She's drunk.

794
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,670
I'm not going anywhere.

795
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,940
Yes, don't leave us.

796
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,280
Yes, I'm not leaving.

797
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:28,380
What?

798
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,590
Don't worry.

799
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,389
- Really? - Yes.

800
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,489
- I decided to stay. - What?

801
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,630
What? Seriously?

802
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,429
But why?

803
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:49,300
Have you lost your mind? Are you serious?

804
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:52,570
Yes, I'm serious.

805
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,849
I've been thinking hard...

806
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,150
to figure out why I'm so hesitant to leave Neon.

807
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,820
Is it because I feel indebted, like you said?

808
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,489
Or is it because I'm afraid to take on a new challenge?

809
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,329
I kept trying...

810
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,769
to listen to my heart.

811
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,239
But you see,

812
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,639
I want to stay so I can take responsibility...

813
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,280
for the new projects I've started...

814
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,480
and the people I've met.

815
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:40,320
I planted all these trees and flower seeds...

816
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,559
in the garden called Neon. I want to see them grow well...

817
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,329
and produce good fruits.

818
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:51,099
I'm sorry to tell you this,

819
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:56,440
but they might get rid of your desk next year.

820
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,869
What do you mean?

821
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:02,980
Neon's higher-ups are planning to acquire Youngtoon.

822
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:09,920
I decided to stay because there is still a lot of work to be done.

823
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,289
And...

824
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,860
it looks like I also have some babysitting to do.

825
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:22,860
Anyway, let's stop talking about this.

826
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,499
Ma Eum, stop crying.

827
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,598
Let's enjoy the meat.

828
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:27,869
- Okay! - Sounds good!

829
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,138
- All right. - Let's drink.

830
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,909
- Oh, my. - How about a toast?

831
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:34,279
Here's to Mr. Seok Ji Hyeong!

832

- Cheers! - Cheers!

833
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:36,979
- Stop overreacting. - Whatever.

834
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,980
Cheers!

835
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:39,808
Here's to Mr. Seok Ji Hyeong!

836
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,118
- Cheers! - Cheers!

837
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,380
Hey, Ji Hyeong.

838
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:44,190
Okay, hang on.

839
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:47,959
Oh, that's too much.

840
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,859
Then how about we toast to the editorial department?

841
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,059
- Sure. - Sounds good.

842
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:55,658
Here's to the success of the editorial department!

843
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,269
- Cheers! - Cheers!

844
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,769
We're whole again!

845
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,809
- Why did you turn down the offer? - Way to go!

846
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:05,409
Seriously.

847
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,280
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

848
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,579
I know you kindly gave me such an amazing offer,

849
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,210
but I still have a lot to learn.

850
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,780
I think Ms. Jang Hye Mi is a great fit for the position.

851
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:18,650
Right.

852
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:23,489
Thank you.

853
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:25,190
Take care.

854
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,239
Hey, why are you here?

855
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:39,610
Mr. Seok.

856
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,909
I want to ask you something.

857
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,079
Sure, what is it?

858
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,260
Do you know this person?

859
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,340
How do you know her?

860
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,929
(Today's Webtoon)

861
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,269
Do you remember that girl Ae Ri we used to work with at Gingertoon?

862
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,369
Do you know if she had family members?

863
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,468
Since you've moved now,

864
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:18,139
I hope that only new and good things happen to you.

865
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,908
You had her thinking that you'd make her...

866
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:22,210
into a full-time employee.

867
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,079
Excuse me, don't you recognize me from the webtoon department?

868
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,018
What are you doing here?

869
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:30,619
I had some documents to give you.

870
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:33,389
That friend of ours was the reason...

871
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,489
why we make webtoons.

872
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,360
She's Jun Yeong's sister?
