(Today's Webtoon)

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,990
I always hated comic books.

00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,490
When my sister was alive,

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,191
I hated them because I thought...

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,901
they were like jokes for kids compared to my reality.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,901
Then after my sister died,

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,240
they always reminded me of her.

16
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,781
So I always wanted to run away.

17
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:07,410
I kept running away...

18
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:10,581
and ended up here, of all places. Who knew?

For some reason,

00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,031
I keep thinking of that line.

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,091
My sister...

31
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,670
It was because of me.

32
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,531

- What? What happened? - He's calling me!

46

Yes. I can't fall asleep.

- Who is it? - About that text...

51
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:57,080
Oh, that! I sent it by mistake. Don't let it bother you.

52
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,890
But it bothers me.

53
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,320
What?

54
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,420
Nothing.

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,630
All right.

56
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,461
I'll see you at work.

57
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,670
Okay, see you at work.

58
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,210
What was that about? Was it that co-worker of yours?

59
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,240
I didn't know you two talked outside of work.

60
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:27,410
Tell me! What's going on?

61

Hey, what's wrong with talking to a co-worker on the phone?

62

Gosh, you...

It's good to see you.

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,191
Good morning.

You're back, Jun Yeong.

68
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,200
Yes.

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,699
Did you get some rest? Hey, have you grown even taller?

70
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm sorry I went AWOL like that.

71
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,630
Don't be sorry.

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,270
Vacation days exist so we can rest and recuperate.

73
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,741
You sure believe in work-life balance.

74

Director Heo is working on completing the Youngtoon merger.

75
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,491
I'm aware that you don't have enough time to get anything done properly.

76
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,130
But if you do manage to find a way,

77
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,731
fight with everything Neon has got and win.

78
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:59,140
That is the only way I can help you.

79
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,311
Everything Neon has got?

80
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,589

Guys.

83
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,580
Is everyone available for a meeting this morning?

84
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,351
Okay, let's get started.

85
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,720
Director Heo Kwan Young...

86
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,090
is working on acquiring Youngtoon.

87
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,629
I'm sure some of you have guessed that we're in a bit of a crisis,

88
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,370
but I bet none of you knew that the situation was this bad.

89
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,900
I only found out recently myself.

90
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,340
I thought we at least had six months left,

91
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,111
but we only have three months left now.

92
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:18,080
Gosh, I'm getting a bad feeling, and this feels all too familiar.

93
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,320
The fact that Director Heo is stepping in too.

94
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,791
- Hey. - What?

95
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,291
He's right.

96
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:31,760
Yes. It's very similar to what we went through at Gingertoon.

97
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:35,199
I'm sure you guys understand instinctively...

98
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,140
how serious the situation is.

99
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,241
We must produce results that the higher-ups would approve of...

100
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,740
and prove that the company needs us.

101
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,340
Yes. We must prove it, no matter what.

102
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,611
The problem is that it won't be easy.

103
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,150
We all know that Director Heo has been trying to shake us up.

104
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:51,820
From here on out, it'll only get worse.

105
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,820
Right. So if we want to stop him, we should shake him up first.

106
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,061
Don't tell me you stayed because you knew this would happen.

107
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
My gosh.

108
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,541
You always have to be the cool guy, don't you?

109
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,639
Well, what can we do? We have to do something.

110
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,810
We all came here because we believed in you, Man Chul.

111
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,650
So if they kick us out, we'll leave together.

112
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,911
We won't let him trample over us twice.

113
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,220
That's right. If we stay focused and tackle this together,

114
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,121
we can produce meaningful results.

115
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,161
I'll meet with Mr. Oh Yoon right away and talk about his new project.

116
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:37,200
Then this will be a 100-day project.

117
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:40,161
How can we dramatically improve the team's performance?

118
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,729
Let's brainstorm together first.

119
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,900
Okay, I know you guys will come up with lots of great ideas.

120
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:45,970
Sounds good.

121
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,041
Okay, we'll tackle this together as a special task force.

122
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,311
We'll do our very best until the end so we won't have any regrets.

123
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,580
- Our goal is to win by ippon! - Let's win by ippon!

124
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,819
Yes, that's it! We can do this.

125
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,350
We can do this, guys. You may return to your desks.

126
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,119
- Okay. - Get back to work.

127
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,860
- Okay. - Thanks. We got this!

128
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:16,531
What are you working on?

129
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,770
Youngtoon is number one in the industry at the moment.

130
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,370
Who do you think is the biggest contributor?

131
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,511
- That's... - That's right.

132
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,449
Mo Young Soo. You never let me down, Mr. Seok.

133
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,521
It's all thanks to Mo Young Soo.

134
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,191
Do you know how many people use our service?

135
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,090
Did you make it?

136
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,690
- We made it! - Young Bae.

137
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,060
We created the service together!

138
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:43,459
Do you know what kind of offers I had to turn down...

139
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,500
to switch to Gingertoon?

140
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,131
The platform will close down only after three months?

141
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,041
I'm so sorry. I can't even face you.

142
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,380
It's all my fault.

143
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,881
I don't want to see your face. Just get out of my studio.

144
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,449
He was always one of the top-tier webtoon artists,

145
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,261
but his webtoon studio has turned into a corporation now.

146
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,330
Hello, sir.

147
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:20,830
I'll give you a rundown of your schedule for the day.

148
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,770
- You have a meeting... - Hey.

149
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,040
- with the new artists at 10am. - Take it easy.

150
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,199
- Hello, sir. - At 12:30pm, you have...

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,771
- Hello, sir. - a lunch meeting with Cocoa Pay.

152
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,910
At 2:40pm, you're meeting with the tax accountant.

153
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:33,579
- Hey, is it going well? - Then at 5pm,

154
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,650
you have a meeting scheduled with YH Film.

155
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:38,579
- Oh, YH Film? - Then at 8pm,

156
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,989
- you'll review the TV commercials. - Okay.

157
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,420
- I left your schedule on your desk. - Got it.

158
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:45,989
Youngtoon started growing rapidly...

159
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,690
and outpaced us by a wide margin...

160
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:49,631
when Mo Young Soo...

161
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:52,131
went to Youngtoon after Gingertoon closed down.

162
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
That's right.

163
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,801
That was when our positions were switched. Youngtoon and us.

164
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:59,401
Mr. Kwon.

165
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:02,511
Have you tried contacting Mo Young Soo since that incident?

166
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,411
No.

167
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,881
He doesn't exactly have fond memories of Gingertoon.

168
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,881
Right, but we really need him.

169
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,350
To prove to the executives that the company needs us,

170
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,220
we must talk to Mo Young Soo in advance to get him on our side.

171
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,891
We really need him.

172
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:19,761
It won't be easy though.

173
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,570
What? How did you know I'd be here?

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,411
You always come here to think.

175
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,110
I got busted.

176
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,181
Are you worried?

177
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,061
No.

178
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,730
I knew we didn't have much time left because you told me.

179
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,200
It's just that it's happening faster than I thought.

180
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,131
But it's okay.

181
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:04,970
You don't look okay though.

182
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
You can tell?

183
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,511
With you, it always shows.

184
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,311
You know...

185
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:20,220
I told myself that I'd do my very best and accept the results...

186
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,720
no matter what would happen in a year from now.

187
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,060
So hearing that we might have to surrender...

188
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,261
without a proper showdown...

189
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,801
It upsets me.

Sir, Neon Webtoon called.

Mr. Jang Man Chul would like to meet with you.

198
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,450
Jang Man Chul?

199
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,960
Should I just tell him that you're not available?

200
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,431
No, I can meet him. Go ahead and arrange a meeting.

201
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,200
Now, it's hitting me that we're in a crisis,

202
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,470
seeing that you're staying late with us.

203
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,141
I know, right?

204
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,570
At best, we won't get fired. What are we doing, seriously?

205
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:55,911
Mr. Kwon, I thought you'd be most stressed out.

206
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
Thanks.

207
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,620
If we don't want to go through the same thing, we should try our best.

208
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,891
Well, what are Mo Studio's recent sales numbers?

209
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,761
If you see here...

210
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:13,661
This shows their monthly active users.

211
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,729
Here's their sales report.

212
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,931
They're estimated numbers.

213
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:19,969
But it's probably higher than this. Definitely not lower.

214
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,370
What? 470 million dollars?

- Good morning. - Oh! Good morning.

225
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,430
I saw you pick up litter in front of the cafe earlier.

226
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:50,931
Oh, you saw that?

227
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,561
- I picked these up on purpose. - Do you collect garbage?

You guys got here together?

- I'm not sure. - You don't know?

What? What were they laughing about? Why...

- I see one here. - Oh.

251
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:16,181
But where's mine?

252
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,181
Am I your vending machine?

253
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,681
- Hey. - Can I have this?

254
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,881
Mr. Jang Man Chul. You came alone?

255
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:50,450
I wanted to drop in and say hello as it's been so long.

256

Oh, my. You came all the way here just to say hello?

257

That and to talk about some things.

258
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,191
- Take a seat. - Thank you.

259
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,631
I've never had a chance to work with you...

260
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,331
since joining Neon, and I was always sad about that.

261
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,871
Right. I suppose we're not really meant to work together.

262
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,810
If it is at all possible,

263
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,009
I would like to work with you.

264
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,040
Well, I'm not sure.

265
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:23,550
I don't think I'll ever work with Neon.

266
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:26,181
I know you still have hard feelings.

267
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,720
It's not about that.

268
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:32,990
As you can see, I now run a big company with many employees.

269
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,161
Whether there are still hard feelings or not,

270
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,530
I can't afford to be affected by such personal emotions.

271
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,141
What I care about is the business' profit and loss.

Oh, however...

273
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,780
Competition always keeps us frosty.

274
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,350
"Competition"?

275
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:00,181
Oh, it must be her.

276
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,391
Come on in.

277
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:05,121
She's here.

278
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,290
- Hello, Mr. Mo. - Welcome.

279
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:13,930
Well, I was worried I'd run late for my meeting...

280
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:16,631
with Ms. Jang Hye Mi, which was scheduled in advance.

281
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:20,200
Since you two know each other, this is okay, right?

282
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,539
I'll just come back when you're done.

283
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,941
Oh, don't worry.

284
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,780
Mr. Jang and I are done here.

285
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,891
I'll come back another time.

286
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,540
Oh, Producer Jang...

287
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:57,770
I mean, Assistant Editor Jang Hye Mi. That was quick.

288
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,310
I thought it'd take a while.

289
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:02,750
He doesn't want to meet with me today, after all.

290
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:09,851
Are you planning to steal Mr. Mo Young Soo from us?

291
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,320
We have to try all we can.

292
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,191
I didn't know you were this kind of person.

293
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,691
My goodness.

294
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,530
My gosh. Who knew we'd end up like this?

295
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:25,141
When you went to Youngtoon, I was genuinely happy for you.

296
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,210
I don't think it's a bad thing.

297
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,780
Actually, I wish you had shown us this side sooner.

298
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,651
Then...

299
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,351
all of us might still be working together.

300
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:47,191
Back then, I really didn't know what I was doing.

301
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,730
So I want to do better now.

302
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,901
Ms. Jang Hye Mi, you're doing well.

303
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,941
You're doing a good job in your position,

304
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:02,911
and I'm...

305
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:10,151
I'll do better.

306
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:25,199
As for "Cold-blooded," I am trying to persuade him...

307
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,930
to publish it with us.

308
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:27,999
("Cold-blooded" by Na Gang Nam)

309
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,200
But I think Youngtoon is going full force too.

310
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,901
Anyway, that is the situation now.

311
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:35,510
Ma Eum.

312
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,081
I need you to persuade Mr. Na.

313
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,411
You can do it, right?

314
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,510
Yes, okay.

315
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,950
Come on. What's with that reaction? It's very unlike you.

316
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,460
The company's future depends...

317
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,191
on every project we're trying to kick off at the moment.

318
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,730
With this, we're going directly up against Youngtoon.

319
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,131
Can I really do this alone?

320
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,341
I'm putting you in charge because I know that you can do a good job.

321
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,141
Who do you think...

322
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,810
can protect you in this situation?

323
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,081
Protect me?

324
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,520
Mr. Jang? Oh, wait. You?

325
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,881
No, it's you.

326
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:25,190
Like you said, the team's future...

327
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:27,560
depends on everything we're trying to do now.

328
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:30,960
If you manage to lead such an important project to success,

329
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,970
no one will dare to mess with you.

330
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,871
You can do it, right?

331
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:47,881
Yes.

332
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,750
Can I really trust that you can do this?

333
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,881
I'll do my best!

334
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:58,520
Good. That's the On Ma Eum I know.

335
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,191
My gosh, but still...

336
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,560
You have to accompany me to the first meeting.

337
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,300
Sure, no problem.

338
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,800
I can do this!

339
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:10,030
- Let's try to talk to him. - Okay.

340
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,841
We should bring it up first. How should we...

341
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,410
Enjoy.

342
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,611
Thank you.

343
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,111
Eat up.

344
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,351
My gosh, this looks so good.

345
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:35,661
It's delicious.

346
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:37,729
I was hungry. Thank you for this.

347
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,060
- Eat up. - Okay.

348
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,600
I organized and analyzed the ideas we discussed...

349
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:47,400
about the love line for each character.

350
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:49,270
Oh, thank you.

351
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,880
(Falls in love with a teammate)

352
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:56,881
But this is a little different.

353
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,780
Didn't we say she'd fall in love with the older guy?

354
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,391
Well, I did analyze both versions.

355
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,891
But in my opinion, the older guy is...

356
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,030
(Goo Jun Yeong)

357
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:18,071
(On Ma Eum)

358
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:20,100
He's like her mentor.

359
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,171
Falling in love with her teammate as they grow together...

360
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,780
will turn the story into a fun romantic comedy.

361
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,780
But women love older guys with glasses, just like him.

362
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,350
I think she and the older guy should become a couple.

363
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:34,450
That was good. Hold the bat up.

364
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,989
Hold this part at the bottom.

365
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,259
This way, you can have a long hit. When the ball comes,

366
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,060
that is when you'll swing the bat.

367
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,760
- Oh, okay. - Got it?

368
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,260
Jun Yeong, throw another pitch.

369
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:54,469
(Wow)

370
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,641
(Laughing heartily)

371
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,581
Well done! That's it.

372
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:01,779
Hold the bottom and hit the ball. You can hit a long home run.

373
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,210
Yes! Now, I know.

374
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,821
I'm not sure how I feel about that kind of relationship.

375
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,891
Is he her coach or what?

376
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,960
What did you say?

377
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,730
- What? - You little...

378
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,200
No. A guy like him makes you want to lean on him.

379
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:24,970
Once you fall for him, it's game over.

380
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,310
As for the plot, we'll try to make it more entertaining.

381
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:31,710
But that's what it's like in real life.

382
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,381
Let's eat.

383
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:36,411
Okay.

384
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,990
Are you sure there won't be any problems?

385
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,590
Yes. I told you...

386
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:50,760
that nothing's been decided yet.

387
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:53,161
I'm still traumatized...

388
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,371
by how Gingertoon shut down its service so abruptly.

389
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,341
As for "Cold-blooded"...

390
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,039
At the moment, I can't tell you for sure that I'll publish it with Neon.

391
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,750
- Mr. Na, please. - You see, he can be very cold.

392
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:12,250
Hence the title, "Cold-hearted."

393
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,320
It's "Cold-blooded," not "Cold-hearted."

394
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:15,550
It means the same thing.

395
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,351
Keep your cool.

396
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,691
Anyway, I'm worried too.

397
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,360
They're all my babies,

398
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:24,161
but I can't draw everything by myself.

399
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,260
I wish I could find a way around it too.

400
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,331
A way around it?

401
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:34,800
Why isn't this working?

402
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,519
I'm back, guys!

403
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,191
- You're back. - Hello.

404
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:57,890
What did Mr. Mo say?

405
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,730
I'll have to talk to him again.

406
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:01,101
Oh, gosh.

407
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,831
Hi, Producer Kim. It's been a while.

408
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,310
Yes, of course. No one was interested in...

409
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,010
Seriously?

410
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,641
Really?

411
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,821
We'd love that.

412
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,621
Okay, let's meet up soon. Right.

413
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,720
That's fine. Put in a good word with the director.

414
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:28,931
Okay, thank you.

415
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:30,790
Guys, big news!

416
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,431
Director Shin Jae Won wants to turn "Weapon Feeb" into a drama.

417
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:36,970
A drama?

418
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,101
Director Shin Jae Won? Isn't he a hitmaker?

419
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:43,510
The global OTT platform Mavelix is interested in producing it.

420
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:44,979
That is such amazing news!

421
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,911
If this works out, it'll help us out so much!

422
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,309
It'll certainly prove why the company needs Neon Webtoon.

423
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,151
Talk about perfect timing!

424
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,650
This is amazing news for Sin Dae Lyug.

425
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:55,690
Yes, for sure!

426
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:58,120
Producer On, you have to give him a heads-up.

427
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:00,821
Come on. Of course, he'd be on board in a heartbeat.

428
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:13,040
I'm not interested.

429
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:20,480
The most important thing is that this remake...

430
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,911
will boost the value of "Weapon Feeb."

431
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,350
Everyone will talk about it and...

432
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:27,881
I just want people to read my webtoons.

433
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:29,990
That's all.

434
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,960
"Weapon Feeb" was conceived and created as a webtoon,

435
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,361
so I'm not interested in making a remake in a different genre.

436
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:44,300
You want to communicate with people through your webtoons, right?

437
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,371
I still vividly remember your reaction...

438
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,010
the day the first episode of "Weapon Feeb" was released.

439
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,411
You seemed much happier than the time...

440
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,911
when you were drawing alone in your room.

441
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,421
If "Weapon Feeb" is turned into a drama,

442
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:03,750
it means your work will reach even more people.

443
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:08,490
I can assure you that it'll be an amazing experience for you.

444
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:10,490
Could you please...

445
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:13,060
reconsider?

446
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,740
If I turn down the offer,

447
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,240
will it affect you negatively?

448
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,321
Yes, but your choice is what matters.

449
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,161
I don't want to force you. Please kindly reconsider.

450
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:41,520
I'll do it.

451
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,161
Really?

452
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,631
If it's something you need, I'll do it.

453
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,840
Thank you, Mr. Sin. Thank you so much.

454
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:56,910
I'll make sure everything goes well. Thank you so much.

455
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,540
- Seriously, thank you. - Sure.

456
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,380
I'm home.

457
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:03,550
- Hi. - Hey.

458
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,321
Oh, no! I realized something as soon as you walked in, Ma Eum.

459
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,820
I'm making curry, but we don't have any curry paste.

460
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,749
My goodness. Do you want me to pick it up?

461
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,790
Yes, hold on.

462
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:15,460
Honey, go with Ma Eum and get some groceries.

463
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:18,699
- No, I'll pick it up quickly. - No.

464
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,071
I need you to go to the grocery store and get a bunch of things.

465
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,700
We've run out of bottled water.

466
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,510
Dad, is your butt glued to the chair?

467
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,941
Hurry up.

468
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,780
- What are you waiting for? Go. - Okay.

469
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,350
Thanks.

470
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,790
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

471
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,460
But I feel like I saw curry paste.

472
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:59,299
My gosh. I found curry paste right here.

473
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,941
That is not curry paste.

474
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:04,071
Oh! Sorry, I can't really read Korean.

475
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Put on your seatbelt.

476
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:19,691
Okay.

477
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:26,101
Are you wearing the cologne?

478
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:29,700
I thought it was for me.

479
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,710
Let's go.

480
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:46,081
You said you wouldn't wear it.

481
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:01,000
- Okay. Enjoy. Thank you. - Sell a lot.

482
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,401
Buy 1 and get 1 for free.

483
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,470
You can pick the flavors you want.

484
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,641
Right here. Have a sample.

485
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:10,841
Goodness. Here you go.

486
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,341
Okay.

487
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:13,611
Goodness. Do you want a sample?

488
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:23,450
- This is tasty. - Our promotion ends today.

489
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:25,050
Why don't you take two bags?

490
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,459
- Give them to us. - Which flavor?

491
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,931
We have meat and kimchi dumplings.

492
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,230
- Two bags of kimchi dumplings. - Two bags of kimchi dumplings.

493
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:33,459
The father and the daughter have the same taste in food.

494
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,999
But you guys look nothing alike.

495
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,171
Why would you say that?

496
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,430
She went missing in my hometown when she was young.

497
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,140
But just by looking at her face,

498
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:42,610
the people in my hometown knew she was my daughter...

499
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,810
and brought her home.

500
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:47,309
Gosh. Okay.

501
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,750
- Come on. Stop that. - Here you go.

502
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:50,880
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

503
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:52,081
- Sell a lot. - Okay.

504
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:53,921
Nu Ri, come out and eat.

505
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:56,450
Okay.

506
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,430
We haven't had a family meal like this for a while.

507
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:03,691
This is great!

508
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:04,891
Thank you for the food.

509
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,030
You're the spitting image of each other when you eat.

510
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,510
Look at that.

511
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:21,911
Gosh.

512
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:26,050
What are you guys doing?

513
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,191
Honey, do you want some soju?

514
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:31,921
I'm good as long as it's not ginseng liquor.

515
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,091
- What? What's that about? - What?

516
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:37,290
- What? - Hey.

517
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:39,331
I thought I was going to die.

518
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,299
Mom, you must have been out of your mind! Seriously.

519
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,400
- Really? - Be quiet. I want to unhear that.

520
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:45,401
- Come on. - Wait.

521
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:46,440
I don't want another sibling.

522
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,539
Are we going to have another sibling?

523
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,111
- Stop it. I don't like it. - I love it!

524
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:55,111
I'm doing better than you think.

525
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,780
You're here to check up on me. Right?

526
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,651
No. I'm here because I'm your fan.

527
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,490
- What about you? - Pardon?

528
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,861
I like your cat.

529
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,430
Seriously?

530
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,770
We'll come back again.

531
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,340
You don't have to come by so often. Ms. On, the same goes for you too.

532
00:34:26,341 --> 00:34:28,209
Are you already sick of me?

533
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,350
No.

534
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,221
Let us buy and drop off a few things you might need.

535
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:34,249
Not shopping online must inconvenience things for you.

536
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,890
I'm all right. It's a hassle for you guys to come back again.

537
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,620
I'll go with them and bring them back.

538
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,430
Could you? Thank you.

539
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,890
Sure.

540
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:01,741
How long have you been working with Pomme?

541
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,921
It's been about six months.

542
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:08,421
How's work?

543
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,119
You guys used to communicate via messenger.

544
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,551
But you have to commute now.

545
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,191
I love it.

546
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,761
I like it.

547
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:22,171
Have you seen anyone suspicious when you were commuting?

548
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,531
No.

549
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,150
- Wait. - Yes?

550
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:43,749
You're not going to take the returned packages?

551
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,491
I'm not a courier.

552
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:48,519
Come on. I know your face. Yes, you are.

553
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,159
You said you were a courier a few days ago.

554
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,230
A courier?

555
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,960
I got a text message and a photo that the package arrived.

556
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,801
But when I got home, the package was gone.

557
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,270
- I love you! - What are you doing?

558
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,740
My gosh.

559
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:04,770
I already got her on camera.

560
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,111
You got the wrong person.

561
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,850
- Excuse me. - What?

562
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,380
Haven't we met at the party with webtoon artists?

563
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,020
No. I don't know you. I've never seen you. Darn it!

564
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,060
- Move out of my way! - Hey! Stop right there!

565
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:26,361
I told you to stop!

566
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,040
Move!

567
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,040
Get out of my way!

568
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,111
Are you okay?

569
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,781
Darn it.

570
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,180
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

571
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,781
Sorry.

572
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:53,020
Darn it.

573
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,790
Jun Yeong, keep chasing him.

574
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,060
Stop chasing me.

575
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:11,111
Don't come close.

576
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:13,011
Stay away! Darn it.

577
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,310
What have I done wrong?

578
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,350
I'm going to call the cops on you.

579
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,019
Don't come near me!

580
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,691
Why? To turn yourself in?

581
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,050
What nonsense is that?

582
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:26,460
You're Pomme's stalker.

583
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,991
I have sharp eyes, you know.

584
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Do you have proof?

585
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,631
Don't frame an innocent guy!

586
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,701
Darn it. Move back!

587
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,810
If you feel wronged, hire a lawyer.

588
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:51,381
Let's go to the police station.

589
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:54,750
Is this the police?

590
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,991
That guy still has been stalking me?

591
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,191
Right. It turned out he also hacked into your cameras inside your house.

592
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,090
We lodged a complaint with the maintenance office.

593
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:04,361
They'll reinforce security.

594
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,901
I'll visit often for the time being.

595
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm sorry.

596
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:13,341
Had I been more observant when I was commuting,

597
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:16,011
I could have easily spotted him.

598
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:19,781
To tell you the truth, I have a hard time...

599
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,611
looking at people.

600
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,781
My biggest challenge is to interact with people too.

601
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,290
Of course, it's not your fault either.

602
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:37,631
Could you keep commuting for the time being?

603
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:40,960
Working with you does help me a lot.

604
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,500
- I'd love to. - Me too.

605
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,540
Then I hope we continue to work well together.

606
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:56,381
She must have been shocked, but she handled it pretty well.

607
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:58,781
Right.

608
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:01,250
But I'm relieved that we caught her stalker.

609
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:02,691
Good job, Ma Eum.

610
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:06,520
Hold on.

611
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,190
Are you all right?

612
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,100
I must have sprained my ankle when I fell earlier.

613
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,770
I'll be fine.

614
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,941
You're good at that.

615
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,480
This used to be an everyday thing when I was an athlete.

616
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:38,051
I should have bought a pair of scissors.

617
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:44,930
Thanks.

618
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:51,600
Are you okay now?

619
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,140
Yes. What about you?

620
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:58,310
- Me? - You fell on the ground earlier.

621
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,210
Oh, that. I'm okay.

622
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,350
See? I knew you weren't okay.

623
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,821
Hold on.

624
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,511
Rotate your wrist.

625
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,420
I'm fine now.

626
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:42,381
Is that so? That's good.

627
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:45,120
Make sure to ice it when you go home.

628
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:49,730
- Ma Eum. - Yes?

629
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:05,540
Never mind.

630
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,841
I'd rather not say it now.

631
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,710
Later.

632
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,080
I want to tell you properly later.

633
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:17,390
What was that? You're making me curious.

634
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,100
- Here. Is that okay? - Yes.

635
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:57,460
Can we meet tomorrow?

636
00:42:00,361 --> 00:42:01,701
Something good happened?

637
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:03,870
No. Nothing.

638
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:09,841
Will it go smoothly this time?

639
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,881
You made it all easy for us.

640
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,111
Only if Yoon Tae Hee didn't steal it from us three years ago,

641
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,250
things would've been easier.

642
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:22,150
Right.

643
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:25,350
It was all for nothing.

644
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,120
But who knew things would work out?

645
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,890
No one knew I'd join Neon.

646
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,801
Right. If it's meant to be, it will be.

647
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:42,910
Take over for the price you mentioned?

648
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:47,881
Okay.

649
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:02,761
All right.

650
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:16,471
Ma Eum.

651
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:17,941
What?

652
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,781
Hey. Did you buy this? It smells so good.

653
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,980
Yes, I was worried about your skin.

654
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:26,680
What are you doing?

655
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:29,179
Speaking of which, can I borrow your clothes?

656
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,321
What? You've never borrowed them before.

657
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:33,890
I'm going to exercise with my friend tomorrow.

658
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,421
Okay.

659
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,790
Don't you have anything cool?

660
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,201
Did you get hurt?

661
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes, a little.

662
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:47,039
I thought you only get hurt from judo,

663
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,740
but you still get hurt even while working in the company.

664
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:50,410
You should've been careful.

665
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,241
- Ma Eum. - Yes?

666
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,350
Never mind.

667
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,850
I'd rather not say it now.

668
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,051
I want to tell you properly later.

669
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:08,090
What? Are you thinking about someone?

670
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,160
No.

671
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,930
Is it the same guy I'm thinking?

672
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,530
No.

673
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:16,930
You look very flustered.

674
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,201
Mom.

675
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,680
I should've known better.

676
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:43,290
Here's the data you asked.

677
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,160
I don't need it anymore.

678
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,701
I don't know what you're after,

679
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:58,870
but that data is no big deal.

680
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,941
If I get in trouble for something that petty,

681
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,750
it'd be sad.

682
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,611
If you give me another chance,

683
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:08,321
I'll never let you down.

684
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:13,460
Right. It'd be a shame...

685
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,790
to lose you along with that team.

686
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,261
Okay. I'll give you another chance.

687
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,940
Write up a report on why it's beneficial...

688
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,841
to take over Youngtoon based on the data.

689
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:33,941
With indisputable evidence.

690
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:35,980
That's what you're good at.

691
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:44,320
Did you like the draft?

692
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:45,350
Yes.

693
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:47,691
Mr. Kwon. What did you think of the draft?

694
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:53,031
- Mr. Kwon. - What?

695
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,700
What's wrong? What are you thinking?

696
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:55,959
It's nothing.

697
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,230
- Can you check the draft? - Okay.

698
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,350
(Chief Editor Jang Man Chul)

699
00:46:12,381 --> 00:46:14,221
I'm going to meet Mo Young Soo.

700
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:21,220
(CEO Mo Young Soo)

701
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:22,930
When are you going to stop visiting me?

702
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:27,700
I should try harder to recruit you.

703
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,960
Impressive.

704
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,471
That's an old business method.

705
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:38,040
It shows my effort.

706
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,881
I also shouldn't neglect the job I have for you.

707
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,881
What can Neon suggest me?

708
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:52,420
I'm already getting the top-notch treatment from Youngtoon.

709
00:46:52,421 --> 00:46:54,560
And Youngtoon is the best in this field.

710
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,659
You didn't sign the contract with Gingertoon...

711
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,031
because it was the best in the field.

712
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,640
Thanks to that mistake,

713
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,571
I learned my lesson big time.

714
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,080
That business is all about conditions.

715
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,080
That an artist should have a firm system.

716
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:26,520
I'm aware that you don't have enough time to get anything done properly.

717
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:30,031
But if you do manage to find a way,

718
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:33,730
fight with everything Neon has got and win.

719
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:36,770
That's the reason...

720
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,241
you should work with Neon.

721
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,941
Neon is offering an investment...

722
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,410
to Mo Studio.

723
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:55,020
It's true Neon Webtoon is not as big as Youngtoon in the field,

724
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:56,890
but its head office, Neon, is...

725
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:59,221
the top company in Korea's IT field.

726
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,991
If Neon's investment can bring two companies together,

727
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,160
all infrastructure Neon has will be shared.

728
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,201
Please give me a chance to make up for the old mistake.

729
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:22,580
Let's talk about it in the next meeting.

730
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,679
We could recruit Mr. Mo?

731
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,920
Yes. Mr. Kwon knows Mr. Mo the best.

732
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:31,350
- Can you work on the proposal? - Okay.

733
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:33,761
Let's prepare for the meeting together.

734
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:36,060
Ms. On. How's "Weapon Feeb" going?

735
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:38,560
I'm meeting the production company soon.

736
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:41,030
- Keep me updated. - Yes, sir.

737
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:43,300
- Ms. Gi. - I just sent you a draft...

738
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:45,130
on the promotion...

739
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,971
for Artist Yeo Tae Goo's publication.

740
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,300
Mr. Seok already approved it.

741
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,510
If you approve it, I'll proceed it right away.

742
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,480
I'll check on that. Mr. Choi.

743
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,651
I'm having a meeting with Mr. Oh Yoon for his new work.

744
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,710
Along with Ms. On and Mr. Goo.

745
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,120
Good. How are things going with Ms. Pomme?

746
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:04,321
I asked her again. She said she could proceed without a break.

747
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,261
How grateful. Things are going great.

748
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,430
Let's keep it up. Let's go!

749
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,030
- Yes. - It's great.

750
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:13,401
Good work.

751
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:17,971
Okay. I'll give you another chance.

752
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,670
Write up a report on why it's beneficial...

753
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:24,471
to take over Youngtoon based on the data.

754

Jun Yeong.

758
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:01,741
What were you going to say the other day?

759
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:05,881
Oh, that. I'll tell you later.

760
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,980
Is it that important?

761
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,691
Yes.

762
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,091
I want to wait until I'm ready.

763
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,361
That sounds like a confession.

764
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,301
What?

765
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,369
Are you ready to order?

766
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,709
Can you give us more time? We're still waiting for someone.

767
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,710
Sure.

768
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,781
Are we expecting someone?

769
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:40,881
She must be here.

770

772
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:56,060
Nice to meet you.

773
00:50:57,631 --> 00:50:58,730
Hello.

774
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:02,571
You must like him so much.

775
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,441
You even set up a meeting.

776
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,941
The game will be over tomorrow anyway.

777

But it's nice to get to know your future colleague.

What do you mean the game will be over?

779
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,250
You'll see.

780
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:31,470
Why do you always take me with you...

781
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:32,769
when you never buy what I pick for you?

782
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,801
You're so loud.

783
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:37,241
Did you call me to carry your stuff?

784
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,270
Bingo.

785
00:51:39,781 --> 00:51:41,639
Hey. It's your colleague.

Am I right?

790
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:51,691
I recognized him at once because he shines.

791

00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,410
It's not the first time.

825
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,220
I've never seen...

826
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:36,691
such a deceptive company before.

827
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,220
Don't you ever call me again.

828
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:39,960
Mr. Mo. Wait!

829
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:41,491
Mr. Mo!

830
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,269
I'll go meet him.

831
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,640
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

832
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:12,451
("Neon Director Heo Pushing Youngtoon Takeover")

833
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,221
What are you trying to do?

834
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:20,060
Is there a takeover plan that I'm not aware of?

835
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:21,660
Come on.

836
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:25,471
The reporter exaggerated it.

837
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,440
I only said I'm considering...

838
00:55:29,441 --> 00:55:33,781
various content companies for takeover.

839
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:38,980
But it's true, isn't it?

840
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:50,790
I'll release a correction immediately.

841
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:55,201
Look, Director Heo.

842
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,770
I don't know what you're planning to do,

843
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:03,870
but I won't tolerate any more of your jokes.

844
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:07,941
I'd never do that to you.

845
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,191
You started it.

846
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,160
You shouldn't have stood up for him so much.

847
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:32,701
Director Heo.

848
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:37,741
Don't you think you took it too far?

849
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,410
What are you saying?

850
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,080
Oh, is it about the article?

851
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:45,810
There will be a correction soon.

852
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,620
You think a correction will do...

853
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,881
after causing all the ruckus?

854
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:54,159
How are you going to make up for discouraging my teammates...

855
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,660
and confused artists?

856
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,701
What else can I do?

857
00:57:03,531 --> 00:57:06,071
You'll have to deal with it.

858
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:11,410
That's what you're here for.

859
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,921
This is strange.

860
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:27,060
He always causes a problem in the worst situation.

861
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,691
Heo Kwan Young.

862
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:34,930
What are you doing in the head office?

863
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:36,660
I need to drop off some materials.

864
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:41,171
Producer Goo.

865
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:53,250
Nothing's confirmed.

866
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,579
And you know...

867
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,290
a takeover doesn't happen that fast.

868
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:01,890
Of course. It won't affect the publication at all.

869
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:05,560
Gingertoon... Why are you bringing that up?

870
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,460
That will never happen. Don't worry.

871
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:11,571
That darn article.

872
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,941
This is so upsetting.

873
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:18,409
Why did Director Heo have to release that article...

874
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,910
just before signing the contract with Mr. Mo?

875
00:58:24,111 --> 00:58:25,250
I know.

876
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:36,861
(Heo Kwan Young)

877
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,480
Where did Jun Yeong go? We have a meeting.

878
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:01,821
Right.

879
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,991
- I'll get him. - Okay.

880
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,410
What's up with the article on takeover?

881
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:26,941
Surprise.

882
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:31,410
I couldn't just rely on your loyalty.

883
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,151
It's my minimum security...

884
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,721
to keep the game going.

885
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:40,960
Open it.

886
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:52,870
What's it like in the office?

887
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:57,210
I need evidence on why he's doing this especially in times like this.

888
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:02,480
Everyone's flustered. They're all busy.

889
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,281
My surprise didn't go to waste.

890
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,230
What are you waiting for? Open it.

891
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,730
Yes, sir.

892
01:01:37,471 --> 01:01:40,111
(Today's Webtoon)

893
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:43,210
The most important thing is to prevent writers from leaving.

894
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:46,781
I can't think of anything...

895
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:50,750
as if my head went blank.

896
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,790
Get out!

897
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:56,221
I can't bear it anymore.

898
01:01:56,721 --> 01:02:00,289
Are you still thinking only about yourself and not the team?

899
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,330
Am I not allowed to?

900
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,471
You look more unstable than before.

901
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,599
Why are you struggling alone...

902
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,471
as if you have all the worries in the world to yourself?

903
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,770
I thought we were in this together.
