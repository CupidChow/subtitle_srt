(Today's Webtoon)

10
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:42,081
What's going on?

11
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:44,251
Why did he call us to come in? What's the emergency?

12
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:46,552
Hey, Seok Ji Hyeong!

13
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:50,581
- What on earth happened? - What do you mean?

14
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,791
Mr. Baek wants to withdraw all the copies he sent us.

15
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:55,562
What?

16
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,231
He wants to take down all the episodes people paid for.

17
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:02,001
What on earth did you tell him at his house earlier today?

18
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,031
I'm going to his place.

19
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:10,201
- Hey. - I'll go with him.

20
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:12,771
What? If you go there now...

21
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,912
This is nuts.

22
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:17,651
Then what about the upload today?

23
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,281
Must you ask? Post a notice saying we're skipping a week.

24
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,282
We are?

25
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:22,721
I need you guys to all log in now.

26
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,691
Go through everything he's sent us in the past...

27
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,351
and find something we can use in the meantime.

28
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,960
We have stuff, but they're all in black and white.

29
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,820
I don't care. Find something we can use!

30
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:32,230
He's our main artist. We can't go for weeks without posting anything!

31
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,392
I'll try to find something.

32
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:40,871
You can just take it easy.

33
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:52,582
(Why send those poor kids if you were going to show up anyway?)

(Short Break Notice)

35
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,431
Mr. Baek Eo Jin is skipping a week? That's unlike him.

36
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,162
I wonder if something happened.

37
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,032
Yes. Please let him know that I'd like to speak to him in person.

38
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,671
Yes, I can come back tomorrow.

39
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,102
Right, please let him know.

40
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,511
Thank you.

41
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,162
It's all my fault.

42
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,961
What do you mean?

43
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:40,261
I shouldn't have told him to read the comments.

44
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,671
People have been leaving mean comments lately.

45
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,472
If he's doing this because he's hurt by the comments...

46
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,912
I apologize for overstepping my bounds.

47
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:00,081
It's okay. We don't know for sure yet.

48
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,821
Let's wait.

49
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:04,622
Get in.

50
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:15,562
Hey, that's not the case.

51
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,270
No, that won't work.

52
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:21,372
- Hey, call Ms. Gi and ask her. - Sure.

53
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:23,341
We're still here.

54
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:25,611
We were able to reach him, but we haven't...

55
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:28,442
Got it. Okay.

56
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:42,321
(Episode 2: Change All You Want! Leave Your Old Ways Behind!)

57
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,241
Hello.

58
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:03,882
Hello.

59
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,921
We're on in. Thank you.

60
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:15,692
Mr. Seok is in front of his place now, hoping to persuade him.

61
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,032
What about the last time you saw him?

62
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,662
- Right, but... - Nothing out of the ordinary?

63
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:23,162
We're trying, but I'm not sure.

64
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,472
My goodness. Did everyone pull an all-nighter?

65
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,741
Yes.

66
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,211
Oh, dear. We'll lose hundreds of thousands of dollars again.

67
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:37,181
I'm off to my meeting with the production company.

68
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,822
- Excuse me. - Who are you here to see?

69
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:49,592
I'm here to speak with the staff in charge of Mr. Baek's projects.

70
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:54,462
Kyung Sik is such an ingrate.

71
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:57,661
Mr. Baek did so much for him.

72
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,630
For five long years.

73
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,401
Then yesterday...

74
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,072
He caused a total ruckus and left.

75
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,842
Are you heading home now?

76
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,852
Or are you leaving for good?

77
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,491
Dong Hee told me.

78
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,522
I heard you were signing with a new platform.

79
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:23,891
Yes.

80
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,731
Did you go over the contract carefully?

81
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:29,331
I heard about the newer platforms' unfair contract terms...

82
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:32,431
I'll figure it out, Mr. Baek.

83
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,272
I'm just worried.

84
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:37,772
You couldn't work on your next project even after your début,

85
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,871
so you started assisting me again just a few years ago.

86
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:45,180
You should prepare everything so you can start a proper project...

87
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:47,082
I said, I will figure it out.

88
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:50,081
Stop nagging me, will you?

89
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,620
- Hey. - Also,

90
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:54,322
you should worry about yourself before you worry about me.

91
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:58,462
People say your work is a complete mess now. I bet you had no idea.

92
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,060
That's what every comment and forum says.

93
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,061
"Baek Eo Jin's days are over."

94
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,731
"He's so done. He's just a has-been now."

95
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,412
"Even his drawings look hideous. It's a hot mess."

96
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,671
Hey, Kyung Sik!

97
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,642
What? "Hideous"?

98
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,952
("Chan!")

99
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:28,822
Are you not going to bed?

100
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,661
I'm going to bed.

101
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:33,662
Yes, I should too.

102
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,212
(New Message, Image File)

103
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,582
(I'm done reading these outdated comics.)

104
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,380
I'm done reading these outdated comics.

105
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,750
These old geezers should just retire.

106
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,490
(When will Baek Eo Jin retire?)

107
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,691
He should have called it with "Soaring of the Dragon".

108
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,691
He shouldn't have come back.

109
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,262
Why did he come back and bring doom to the entire series?

110
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:12,001
He's at the age of doom indeed.

111
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:14,800
I wish death upon all of you.

112
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,072
I hope you drop dead, you psycho.

113
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:21,642
Mr. Baek called me late last night.

114
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,912
He asked me what an old geezer meant.

115
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:29,421
What? An old geezer?

116
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:30,981
"Old geezer"?

117
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,750
That's what young people these days say...

118
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:37,221
when referring to someone old who's stuck in an outdated mindset.

119
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,532
Like those who wear dentures.

120
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:43,702
Anyway, it's not nice to call someone like that. Why do you ask?

121
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,231
Outdated?

122
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:50,441
I see.

123
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,681
Thanks for answering my call so late.

124
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:07,592
He had never really used the Internet before,

125
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,322
so I believe it was his first time seeing such mean comments.

126
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,231
He must've been so hurt.

127
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:28,380
His main character's face got elongated.

128
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,311
Is his chin getting longer now?

129
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,412
I have no hope now.

130
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,920
His drawing style is unsalvageable. Seriously.

131
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,750
(These old geezers should just retire.)

132
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,422
(I have no hope now.)

133
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,131
Mr. Seok Ji Hyeong was here again.

134
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,871
I kept on drawing without even realizing...

135
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,042
that I was crumbling away.

136
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,342
It's about time I retired.

137
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:04,281
But...

138
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:07,952
what I found even more shocking...

139
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:11,182
was the fact that...

140
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,092
the things I kept wanting to portray through my work...

141
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,621
weren't communicated at all.

142
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,260
(How much longer will he keep drawing?)

143
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,760
(Do we have to listen to this old geezer even in webtoon?)

144
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:23,131
That human life is precious and beautiful.

145
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,641
That sweetness is a strength.

146
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,911
None of that was communicated...

147
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,082
to my readers...

148
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:41,481
or to Kyung Sik, who always worked right by my side.

149
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:46,852
I thought I was pouring my heart and soul into my work,

150
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:50,491
but it didn't make the readers feel anything.

151
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:56,131
I feel pathetic.

152
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,432
I feel truly pathetic.

153
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,672
Hey, I thought you had quit smoking.

154
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:37,802
I have a bad feeling about this. This reminds me of the old days.

155
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:44,042
Don't worry too much.

156
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,852
I'll get it sorted out at all costs.

157
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,861
About Mr. Baek...

158
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:59,391
We should give him some time, right?

159
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,062
Yes.

160
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:06,631
I'll let the readers know that he's taking a break.

161

00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,141
- What? - What? No!

164
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,911
I thought they were just skipping this week.

165
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:19,552
I don't know.

166
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,321
Is the artist ill or something? He's old, you know.

167
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:24,952
No! He can't die until he finishes the series.

168
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,352
- This is not good. - I'm so annoyed.

169
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:29,222
(We're taking a short break due to the artist's personal reasons.)

170
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,001
Oh, boy. It looks like Jang Man Chul...

171
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:38,572
won't even last a week.

172
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:45,140
Hey, Jun Yeong. What brings you to the head office?

173
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,672
It's far for you, isn't it?

174
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,042
My gosh.

175
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,781
So how's it going? Are you enjoying working on the webtoon team?

176
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:53,681
Not really. It's boring.

177
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,582
I heard they might get rid of that team next year.

178
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,721
- Did you hear? - What?

179
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:01,861
They might have another department absorb the team...

180
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,530
and have the existing Neon staff run it.

181
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,761
Then what will happen to Jun Yeong?

182
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:08,931
Is he wasting a whole year?

183
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:12,771
No way. I'm sure there's a reason they sent him to that team.

184
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:17,172
(Are you ready for this?)

185
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,911
(Please...)

186
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,592
His drawing style did change a lot.

187
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:36,161
That old man is ridiculous. I think he's really shocked.

188
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,391
I sent him screenshots of all the mean comments here.

189
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,432
You losers should thank me.

190
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,871
Now that he's gone, there's a vacancy at Neon.

191
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,371
For real? Well done.

192
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:52,672
But it's not like we can't début because of those boomers.

193
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:54,410
That's true.

194
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:57,082
These days, I feel more threatened by those aggressive youngsters.

195
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,852
But isn't it a good thing that there's a vacancy now?

196
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,051
True that.

197
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,651
Things are getting interesting for a change.

198
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:04,881
(A report has been sent.)

199
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,261
(Report)

200
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,191
Don't you think Yang Kyung Sik wrote this?

201
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,231
(I sent him screenshots of all the mean comments here.)

202
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:17,832
Gosh, I can't believe this.

203
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:21,740
How could he do this? He worked with Mr. Baek for years.

204
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,102
Hello.

205
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:30,312
- You're here. - Yes. You guys are all here.

206
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,881
- Can we get another glass? - Sure.

207
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,251
Thank you.

208
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,521
We should have done something...

209
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,230
before this happened.

210
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,802
What can we do? Producer Jung was in charge.

211
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:53,501
It's common to see drawing styles change after a long time.

212
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:55,471
I know, but I think we should've had...

213
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:58,542
an open conversation with Mr. Baek about it.

214
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:02,381
We couldn't bring it up because he's such a senior artist.

215
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:04,842
That includes me.

216
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:07,582
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,832
So everyone knew.

218
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:24,202
About Mr. Baek Eo Jin.

219
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,802
He's not going to retire like this, right?

220
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:29,942
I'm not sure.

221
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,281
When you're making a webtoon,

222
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,781
you, as the artist,

223
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,682
must create the world by yourself.

224
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,092
There's no guidebook to follow. It's all on you.

225
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:49,121
You have to create a whole new world by yourself...

226
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:53,131
while meeting the deadline every week.

227
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:58,572
Once you upload one episode and feel that you can breathe a bit,

228
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,631
you realize that your next deadline is creeping up on you.

229
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:06,771
Every week, you have to come up with a story, draw it, and edit it.

230
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,942
Over and over again, like a squirrel in a wheel.

231
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:16,552
Mr. Baek...

232
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,222
has been doing that all by himself...

233
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,161
for over 30 years.

234
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,432
When someone like that...

235
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,812
suddenly stops and gives up on everything,

236
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,371
what should we say?

237
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:46,151
What would you say?

238
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:55,491
Never mind. Even I don't know. How would you know as a newbie?

239
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,302
I went through something similar when I was doing judo.

240
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:04,761
Back then,

241
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:10,302
I was most grateful to my friends who were as lost as I was.

242
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,401
"Lost"?

243
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:14,241
They just hung out with me and waited for me.

244
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:18,511
I do understand that his situation is very different from mine,

245
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,222
but a good pacemaker...

246
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:25,081
wouldn't force him to get up and start running right away.

247
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:26,891
I mean, I wouldn't rush him.

248
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:29,991
That's just what I think.

249
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:36,731
So you're saying we should just wait?

250
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:43,072
But what if he's not lost? What if he has given up?

251
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,911
How about we toss this again and see?

252
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,981
Will Mr. Baek come back or not?

253
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,452
All right.

254
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,922
If we get heads, it means he'll come back.

255
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,261
If we get tails...

256
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,931
Well, it means we'll have to wait a little longer.

257
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,042
- Can you hold this? - Sure.

258
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,042
All right.

259
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,180
- Oh, boy! - My gosh!

260
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,720
Hold on, okay.

261
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:34,551
I know that this won't decide our fate, but...

262
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:35,691
- Right. - Hold on.

263
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,302
All right.

264
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:46,102
Abracadabra!

265
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:57,842
Ta-Da!

266
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,252
He'll come back.

267
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,092
Oh, my bus is here.

268
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,391
- I have to take this. - Okay.

269
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,531
- I'll be off, then. - All right.

270
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:14,861
- Oh, this! - Right.

271
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:16,531
- Bye. - Bye, get home safely.

272
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:17,661
- Will do! - Bye.

273
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:22,941
Bye.

274
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,951
(Fifty cents)

275
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,461
(Fifty cents)

276
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,262
I guess Mr. Goo has out-of-office meetings today.

277
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,641
Oh, it's that day for Mr. Kwon.

278
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,441
I guess he took Mr. Goo.

279
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,741
- "That day"? - Yes.

280
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:03,440
Mr. Kwon lets artists' complaints pile up for a while...

281
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:06,782
and then picks a day to deal with them.

282
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,181
I see.

283
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,551
I asked you to change the thumbnail...

284
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,292
over a month ago, but nothing has been done.

285
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:18,461
It's not getting views because the thumbnail isn't catchy enough.

286
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,130
If I were one of your main artists like Na Gang Nam or Pomme,

287
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,032
would you still take this long to take care of it?

288
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,072
("Truly Beautiful")

289
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:33,742
How come I rarely see my banner on your main page?

290
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:36,210
- Pardon me? - I mean,

291
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:40,281
I see Pomme and Mouri's banners on the main page...

292
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,812
every time I log into the Neon app.

293
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,920
Do I really have to say this myself?

294
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,492
My début webtoon was a hit.

295
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,960
If you're going to treat me like a has-been...

296
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,860
just because my second webtoon didn't do well,

297
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:53,832
I can't work with Neon.

298
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:58,032
I'm sorry. I apologize.

299
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:01,332
Look. Try putting my banner here just for a day.

300
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,541
If you promote my webtoon just as much,

301
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,871
I'll get as many views as they do. Am I wrong?

302
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,911
So you'll do nothing and just wait?

303
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:14,082
You need to persuade him and force him to upload the episode.

304
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,721
How much time will you give him?

305
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:19,220
Or just end the series or something. You need a plan.

306
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:22,220
The thing is, we can't really find another artist like Mr. Baek...

307
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,660
who can carry his weight on the project.

308
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,561
I don't care about that.

309
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,431
The sales numbers are what matter. Don't you get it?

310
00:20:29,032 --> 00:20:30,102
What?

311
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,272
Mr. Jang Man Chul, whom I deeply respect.

312
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:37,072
You got fired from Gingertoon because you had no sense of urgency.

313
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:40,470
You still haven't learned your lesson?

314
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,711
- You jerk. - What are you doing?

315
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,121
Mr. Heo, don't be so harsh on him.

316
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,861
Mr. Jang still has a year left.

317
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,762
If you're already that harsh on him, what will you do later on?

318
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:03,131
Understood, ma'am.

319
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,042
Darn you.

320
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:22,151
(Little Tent Bar)

321
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,732
Since joining Neon,

322
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,771
I've turned a blind eye to many things...

323
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,772
because I didn't want to repeat my mistake at Gingertoon.

324
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,742
I shouldn't have done that.

325
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:54,782
I'm sorry. I...

326
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,921
I should have been on top of these things.

327
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,951
It's not just your fault.

328
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,292
I noticed that ages ago. But I didn't say anything.

329
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:19,272
I always wanted to ask you this.

330
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,370
Why did you come with me to Neon?

331
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:23,881
I know that you had a lot of offers back then.

332
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:25,710
You knew?

333
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,512
How could I not?

334
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,380
If you knew, you should've been nicer to me.

335
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,852
I've been nice to you.

336
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:35,421
- How could I be nicer than now? - Gosh. Come on.

337
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:40,431
Well, I just...

338
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,901
decided to join you because you were a Monsters' fan.

339
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:49,741
- What? - Well, everyone knows that...

340
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,701
Monsters' fans are loyal.

341
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:54,071
They never had a chance to play baseball in the fall...

342
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,272
for over a decade.

343
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:57,242
And half the time they played, they came in last.

344
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:59,552
Despite that, you guys don't switch teams.

345
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,051
How should I explain this?

346
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:04,522
You guys close ranks with loyalty and faith.

347
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,620
You're a Monsters' fan.

348
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:10,522
That's right. Monsters' fans are loyal.

349
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:14,231
Monsters!

350
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:17,532
Go, Monsters!

351
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,582
Yes, this is Goo Jun Yeong.

352
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,910
Hey, Mr. Goo. Are you done with the meetings?

353
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,551
Yes. I'm done with the meetings.

354
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:34,581
You must be tired.

355
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,720
I wish I could tell you to go home and rest up.

356
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:38,891
You need to make one more visit.

357
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,720
- Where? - You know Pomme, right?

358
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,190
The webtoon artist wants to see you in the studio now.

359
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,232
I just texted you the address. Go to the meeting.

360
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,232
Are you serious?

361
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:56,502
Don't you think you're delegating too much of your work?

362
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:58,941
It's okay. I can do that to a new employee.

363
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,812
What?

364
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,180
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

365
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:07,311
All right. Here we go.

366
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,380
One. Funny how I feel for you

367
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,650
Hands up.

368
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,551
- Ji Yu is amazing. Isn't she? - Yes.

369
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,791
How does she do that?

370
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,461
- Is this how you do it? - Yes.

371
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,792
He's here.

372
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:50,022
Can I borrow your umbrella?

373
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,661
Then can I come closer?

374
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,701
Are you Pomme?

375
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:03,002
I see. You're the new guy Mr. Kwon sent?

376
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:05,671
She's kind of rude.

377
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,021
I'm glad you're tall.

378
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,721
- Pardon? - Come this way.

379
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:30,930
This keeps blinking.

380
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:33,031
And the light is out. So I can't focus on my work.

381
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,502
I can see that. Did you call someone?

382
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,002
I did.

383
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:39,312
Me?

384
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:41,541
You don't know how to change a light?

385
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,680
Calling a producer at this late hour for your personal problem...

386
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,151
is the same as going on a power trip.

387
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:49,252
Is it? I don't think so.

388
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:51,180
I'm asking you to help me.

389
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,450
Going on a power trip means...

390
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,752
missing an episode and telling the chief editor...

391
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,961
that I couldn't work on my episode because of the new producer.

392
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,772
Turn on the light.

393
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:49,842
You fixed it.

394
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:52,752
You're more useful than I thought.

395
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:01,252
Thank you.

396
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:06,492
I'll be able to meet the deadline without a problem thanks to you.

397
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,861
I see. All right.

398
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:10,861
Bye.

399
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:12,931
What's your name?

400
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:15,871
Why do you care?

401
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,801
- How old are you? - Pardon?

402
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,072
You think you're better than me?

403
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:23,582
Goo Jun Yeong.

404
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:27,151
I see. Mr. Goo Jun Yeong.

405
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,052
I'll see you around.

406
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:55,111
Does she think I'm her personal manager?

407
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,411
Some webtoon artists treat their producers as their managers.

408
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:05,582
Don't webtoon artists mostly find their producers bothersome?

409
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:08,950
Pomme is a special case.

410
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:10,890
- Why? - She became a top artist at 20.

411
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,461
And she's been killing it since her début.

412
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:14,891
People around her babied her too.

413
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,232
She probably got used to that kind of treatment.

414
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:21,232
Pomme does bring in a lot of money for the company.

415
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,241
When Neon launched the webtoon service,

416
00:28:24,242 --> 00:28:25,771
they went to great lengths...

417
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:28,941
to bring in Na Gang Nam, Baek Eo Jin, and Pomme.

418
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:30,481
It's not an overstatement to say...

419
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:32,342
the three of them are doing all the heavy lifting.

420
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:34,380
She must know that too.

421
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,420
She's so used to abusing her position.

422
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,322
Gosh, changing the light isn't that bad.

423
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,650
You're lucky it wasn't unclogging the toilet.

424
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:43,061
- Come on. We're eating here. - I'm serious.

425
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:44,292
Some artists do ask you to do that.

426
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,460
- Are you serious? - Yes!

427
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:47,992
That's too much.

428
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:01,171
I bought the sand for my cat because it said it was soluble sand.

429
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:02,982
But when I flushed it down, it clogged my toilet.

430
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:05,482
Maybe, I dumped too much in one go?

431
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,532
(On Ma Eum)

432
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:40,482
Gosh. I lost again.

433
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,411
When will I ever beat you?

434
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,621
Gosh.

435
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,292
You still haven't told your dad about your job at Neon?

436
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,792
No.

437
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:00,471
But are you really going to quit judo?

438
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:07,042
Why? Because of that incident?

439
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:11,542
No. Just because.

440
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,211
I've had my run.

441
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:18,221
I gave it my all and tried my best with everything I got.

442
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,292
Now, I want to make an effort to do something else.

443
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,562
To a place that will be nicer to myself.

444
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:28,062
What about the webtoons?

445
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:32,002
I like webtoons as much as judo.

446
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:38,001
(The soft overcomes the hard.)

447
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,771
"Make a world where people help each other."

448
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,911
(Make a world where people help each other.)

449
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,241
Why are you still here? Aren't you going to leave?

450
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,811
- I haven't seen that for a while. - I see.

451
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,552
- Was that always tilted like that? - Yes.

452
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,852
Really? Now?

453
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,321
It's pretty high.

454
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,291
So we have to look up to read it.

455
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,592
It has to tilt a bit, so we can see it clearly.

456
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:00,262
Silly you.

457
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,161
I see.

458
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,401
- After getting caught in the fire, - I'm home.

459
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,171
he gave everything to his sculpture.

460
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,801
- What are you watching? - Did you know...

461
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:12,141
- A documentary about Michelangelo. - the Italian painter...

462
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:14,471
Why are you watching a documentary about Michelangelo all of a sudden?

463
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,710
- Michelangelo... - I'm going to Italy...

464
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:19,081
with my friends from high school. So I've been studying.

465
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:21,351
- That's pretty cool, Mom. - However,

466
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:23,552
when you look at the statue, David,

467
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:26,151
at his eye level,

468
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,921
you'll notice that the body proportion seems off.

469
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,391
He has a big head, long arms,

470
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:34,491
and abnormally large hands and feet.

471
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,861
Did the master sculptor make a mistake?

472
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,871
Actually, this was what Michelangelo intended.

473
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:43,542
If you were to look at the statue from below,

474
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,940
it would have the perfect body proportion.

475
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,311
It's pretty high.

476
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:49,512
It has to tilt a bit, so we can see it clearly.

477
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,482
Isn't that so fascinating?

478
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:58,782
Mom!

479
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,491
- Goodness. You're hurting. - Mom.

480
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:02,690
What's wrong with you?

481
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:03,762
- Gosh. It hurts. - I love you.

482
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:06,332
I love you.

483
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,262
What's gotten into her?

484
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:26,251
- What is it? - I'm sorry to call on a weekend.

485
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:28,252
Can I see you now?

486
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,282
- Now? - Yes!

487
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:06,921
Honey.

488
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:12,221
I should stop disappointing people...

489
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:16,401
and just retire. I think that's the right thing to do.

490
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:20,871
Mr. Baek.

491
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,242
We're really sorry.

492
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,881
Why are you apologizing?

493
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,812
There's no reason for you to apologize.

494
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,762
I feel that everyone in the editorial department...

495
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,732
has been just relying on you for everything.

496
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:57,140
Even without us having to do anything,

497
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:00,471
you always produced such stellar work,

498
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:04,582
so we took it for granted.

499
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:08,110
When you could actually use our help,

500
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:10,021
we did nothing to help you.

501
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:11,252
I'm sorry,

502
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,691
but I never once thought...

503
00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:16,661
to reach out to you for help or to consult you.

504
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:21,931
I've seen one too many artists who became obsolete...

505
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,732
because they overly relied on their editors.

506
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:28,031
If I can't draw without your help,

507
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,542
that's all the more reason to retire.

508
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:35,812
Your drawing style... I mean, there's nothing wrong...

509
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,641
with your drawings.

510
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:42,251
Hey, there's a right time for everything.

511
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,422
I think now is the perfect time to bring it up.

512
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,192
What do you mean?

513
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,422
I don't mean to be rude,

514
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:53,692
but your back is hunched now.

515
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,991
However,

516
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,201
it wasn't always like that.

517
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:02,601
But your workspace is still set up...

518
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,402
the exact same way.

519
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:07,071
So is the angle of your drawing board.

520
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,911
However, you've aged.

521
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,681
And in that process, your core muscles...

522
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:15,111
In other words, your abdominals,

523
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,352
obliques, and back muscles have become weak,

524
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,752
which has resulted in your hunched posture.

525
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:36,002
Therefore, your eye level has changed significantly.

526
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,442
Even if you're trying to draw the exact same thing,

527
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:46,241
the change in the angles renders the drawing different.

528
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,252
What I mean by that is...

529
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:58,362
Even the drawings that look elongated.

530
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,361
If they're seen from your eye level...

531
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,701
- Tilt it more. - Like this?

532
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:15,442
They still look exactly the same and are as balanced as before.

533
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:18,982
Your drawings are not out of balance.

534
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:22,181
Your angle was the problem.

535
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,390
That's right. So if the problem was that...

536
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:28,990
you kept hunching your back while working on your drawings,

537
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:30,720
I suggest you tweak the angle...

538
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,332
of your drawing board, so it's not tilted.

539
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:37,931
Then...

540
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:40,431
I can create drawings...

541
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,672
that I won't be embarrassed of?

542
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:46,411
Yes, that's correct.

543
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,212
Honey, you have more guests.

544
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,721
What?

545
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,062
What brings you guys here?

546
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:05,361
Who are they?

547
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,161
They're Mr. Baek's former assistants.

548
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,962
They've all made their débuts.

549
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,761
We're here because we heard your assistant quit and ran away.

550
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,272
Let us help you finish the episode, sir.

551
00:37:18,341 --> 00:37:21,341
I can't wait to find out how "The Dream of the Dragon" will end.

552
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,581
We'll assist you to the best of our ability,

553
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:26,082
so you can start uploading again soon.

554
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:31,482
But what about your projects?

555
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:34,191
You guys are all currently working on your own projects.

556
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:35,450
Don't you worry.

557
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:38,320
You told us to always work at least three weeks ahead of schedule.

558
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,260
You guys are running ahead of schedule, right?

559
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:41,632
- Yes, of course. - Sure thing.

560
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:45,402
You taught us everything.

561
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:49,272
From how to draw to how to maintain a successful career as an artist.

562
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,820
All right, let's do it.

563
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:12,962
- Yes! - Yes!

564
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:19,031
- Come on. - Let's get to work.

565
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:22,732
- We got this. - Yes, of course.

566
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,841
- Ma Eum. - Yes.

567
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,811
I told you I had no idea...

568
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:32,281
what Mr. Jang saw in you. Remember?

569
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:34,582
- Yes. - Right.

570
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,721
I still don't know what it is that he saw in you,

571
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,362
but you did a great job today.

572
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:48,231
Really?

573
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:50,132
Yes, well done.

574
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,132
Then are you going to buy me dinner today?

575
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:54,931
What?

576
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,570
I have a feeling that you're a big eater.

577
00:38:57,571 --> 00:38:59,641
Yes! I eat a lot.

578
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,841
Can I pick something expensive?

579
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:10,582
I'll pick the restaurant and what to order. Okay?

580
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,382
Okay!

581
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:15,352
- Wait. - Yes.

582
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,291
Hey, where did I park?

583
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,991
Right in front of Mr. Baek's house.

584
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:22,632
Really? My goodness.

585
00:39:23,332 --> 00:39:25,261
- I'm going to pig out! - Okay.

586
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,812
(On Ma Eum)

587
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,141
(On Ma Eum)

588
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:52,022
Can't you please put your trust in me, Dad?

589
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:11,212
My gosh, Mr. Baek is back.

590
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,181
(Look carefully!)

591
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:16,720
Oh, the artist who's been drawing the dragon series for 30 years?

592
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,851
That's right. Isn't he amazing?

593
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:20,391
He never disappoints!

594
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:31,761
Hey, "The Dream of the Dragon" is back.

595
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:34,131
I thought the artist was terminally ill or something.

596
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,602
I told you. He won't die until he finishes the series.

597
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:45,010
- How is it? Is it good? - Sorry?

598
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:47,851
Isn't it the new episode of "The Dream of the Dragon"? Is it good?

599
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:50,351
- Yes. - It's so good.

600
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:51,522
It's so much fun.

601
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:52,752
Is it?

602
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:55,152
- Do you want to read it with us? - No, it's okay!

603
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,871
The dragon is back.

604
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:11,841
More perfect than ever.

605
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,411
The dragon is back.

606
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:24,082
Mr. Baek. You won't go anywhere, right?

607
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,022
You must stay healthy until you finish the series.

608
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:30,121
Mr. Baek, send me your address. I'll send you some herbal medicine.

609
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:33,991
I read "The Dream of the Dragon" when I'm wallowing in depression.

610
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,531
It makes me want to live another week to read the next episode.

611
00:41:38,761 --> 00:41:40,800
So keep working on the series for many more years to come.

612
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,031
I love you.

613
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:48,672
My gosh.

614
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:50,942
Mr. Baek.

615
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:54,082
You've completely revamped your workspace.

616
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:58,422
This incident gave me the strength to challenge myself.

617
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,891
All my juniors are volunteering to teach me.

618
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:07,191
My pen pressure is weak, so I need to figure out...

619
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,761
how to go from soft to bold lines.

620
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:13,371
You see, I still have many stories to tell.

621
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,931
I can't let my age defeat me.

622
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:18,071
Of course, you shouldn't.

623
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,410
I'll consult you on things as often as I can from now on,

624
00:42:22,411 --> 00:42:23,811
so help me out.

625
00:42:23,812 --> 00:42:27,212
My gosh. I'm the one who needs your help, sir.

626
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:33,551
Thank you so much, sir.

627
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,792
Hey, Dumpling. You're really...

628
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:43,660
Well done. You did a great job.

629
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,231
Seriously, well done.

630
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,070
Keep up the good work.

631
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:50,871
Yes, sir! Can I keep working here if I keep it up?

632
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:58,041
Yes, sure thing. You work so hard.

633
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,911
Of course. That's only fair.

634
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,550
I'll give you a bonus. Hold on.

635
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:03,951
- No, it's okay! I'll work hard. - Gosh, you.

636
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,752
- You can do it. - I can do it!

637
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:09,221
I'm so glad I hired you.

638
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:11,261
I certainly made the right hiring decision!

639
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:27,941
I'm sorry.

640
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,970
No matter how hard you work,

641
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:31,212
you won't get a permanent position...

642
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:34,152
because this team will be gone by next year.

643
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:38,181
- Cheers. - Cheers.

644
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:40,891
This is great.

645
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:45,720
Don't turn around. Just drink it.

646
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:47,191
Gosh. No.

647
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:49,331
By the way, Mr. Kwon isn't joining us today?

648
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:50,731
He never stays for get-togethers like this.

649
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,300
Work-life balance is important to him.

650
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:53,671
Unless he's on duty, he goes home on time.

651
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,902
I see.

652
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,871
- Ms. Gi. - Here.

653
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,582
- I can't drink. - I see. You're lightweight.

654
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:05,740
You should've told me sooner.

655
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:07,711
Excuse me. A bottle of Sprite, please.

656
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:09,481
- You drink Sprite, right? - Yes. Thank you.

657
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:11,851
I don't know, there's no way of knowing

658
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:12,882
Goodness.

659
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:17,561
Don't laugh at that.

660
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:18,691
But it's funny.

661
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:20,061
I knew it was funny.

662
00:44:20,062 --> 00:44:21,962
- I still got it. - He'll keep making those jokes.

663
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,331
At least one of us should be a lightweight.

664
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,701
I've never seen a lightweight before.

665
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:29,201
I can't believe there's a lightweight on our team.

666
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:35,010
I hope to get along with you.

667
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,011
You can't pour it like that.

668
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:38,841
Gosh.

669
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:45,422
Mr. Goo, do you have a problem with me?

670
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:48,651
- No. I don't. - Let me pour it for you.

671
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,362
Here comes the professional. Okay. Take this.

672
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,261
There you go.

673
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,431
Look at her tilting the glass. Nice.

674
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,962
Her posture is precise.

675
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,930
Gosh. You're good at this.

676
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:05,840
The ratio is 2 to 8. I went with the golden ratio.

677
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:08,271
Gosh. Ms. On. You know how to pour beer properly.

678
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,771
- Should we drink it? - Cheers.

679
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:12,341
- Cheers. - Cheers.

680
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:22,321
Awesome.

681
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:26,422
I've never seen anyone drink beer faster than Mr. Choi.

682
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,430
People at the training center...

683
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:31,461
knew me as the girl who could drink beer fast.

684
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,001
When I was out of energy, with a can of beer,

685
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:36,941
I got full of energy. That got me up again.

686
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,371
That's amazing.

687
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:42,140
Ms. On. Have another glass with me. Just one more drink.

688
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:43,910
- Sure. Here I go. - Gosh.

689
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,681
I didn't know you could drink like that.

690
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:47,751
She's not an easy match.

691
00:45:47,752 --> 00:45:50,982
Gosh. I'm so glad I hired you. That's good.

692
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:54,950
Mr. Goo. Get-togethers aren't fun, right?

693
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:57,062
Right. I mean, no.

694
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:58,462
This is fun.

695
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:00,991
He's honest.

696
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:03,832
Today...

697
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,070
Mr. Goo. I thought you couldn't drink.

698
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:09,401
Maybe, a glass might be okay. He'll be fine.

699
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:10,672
Really? Then drink some more.

700
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,411
I'm okay.

701
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:20,041
- Gosh. - Did that seriously happen?

702
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:21,551
Why... What?

703
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,851
He's not fine.

704
00:46:23,852 --> 00:46:26,450
- It's okay. Don't mind him. - Is this really happening?

705
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,251
He will be fine...

706
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,021
- once he takes a nap. - No.

707

Sit down, Ms. Gi.

708

- Should we have a shot? Cheers. - Hurry.

709
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:36,361
- Mr. Goo. Are you all right? - Can you pour me a shot?

710
00:46:36,362 --> 00:46:38,402
- Okay. Thank you. - Are you serious?

711
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,632
- Bottoms up. - Slow down.

712
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,601
Stop it. We just...

713
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:44,140
This tastes so sweet.

714
00:46:44,141 --> 00:46:46,171
I'm in trouble. What am I going to do?

715
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:47,911
- This is crazy. - No one is going home today.

716

The new recruits this year...

717

We had enough. Let's go.

Hey, what are we going to do with him?

723
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:03,792
- Gosh. - Mr. Goo.

724
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:06,521
- Get up. - Do you know where he lives?

725
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:09,430
No. But we have to get him up first. He's so heavy, though.

726
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:11,200
- I'll take care of him. - What?

727
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:13,601
- Hey. Gosh. You can't. - Hey, what about Ms. On?

How is she going to... Hey.

735
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,051
- I already paid. - She got it.

736
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:30,921
- How... - I feel so reassured to have her.

737
00:47:30,922 --> 00:47:33,252
- Gosh. - I picked the good one.

Gosh. Don't worry.

No. He's a colleague from my team.

- He's your colleague? - Gosh.

817
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,812
I told you I was busy preparing for my next webtoon.

818
00:52:27,482 --> 00:52:28,950
I told you not to book anything.

819
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:31,821
This was scheduled a long time ago. And there was a notice too.

820
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:35,022
Please do this for us today. I'm sorry about this.

821
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:41,161
Hello.

822
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:43,031
I think we're almost done here, right?

823
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:47,061
I have to head out first for a meeting about the film rights.

824
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,232
- You two can wrap up here, right? - Yes.

825
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:53,272
And please move those hardboard cut-outs to Mr. Oh Yoon's studio.

826
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:57,241
- Pardon? - He said he liked them.

827
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:00,341
Sure. We'll bring them to his studio.

828
00:53:00,712 --> 00:53:02,482
- Okay. - Bye.

829
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:10,792
"We"?

830
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:56,300
Hang in there. We're almost there.

831
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:59,772
We'll see the apartment once we cross the overpass.

832
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,181
I know that too. I know.

833
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:06,312
But it's tough.

834
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:12,051
All right. When you climb up the stairs,

835
00:54:12,422 --> 00:54:15,852
lower your upper body slightly and loosen your core. That's easier.

836
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:19,161
Like this. One, two. Follow my lead.

837
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:20,661
You can do it.

838
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:46,422
Gosh.

839
00:55:03,332 --> 00:55:04,701
I'll take this.

840
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:08,971
Take your time.

841
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,542
Darn it.

842
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:33,632
This is so beautiful.

843
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,771
Gosh. Going home after work...

844
00:55:36,772 --> 00:55:38,401
while looking at the sunset over the Han River...

845
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:39,871
has been my dream.

846
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,612
One of my dreams came true today.

847
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:45,681
What a humble dream you have.

848
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,852
The shape of my ear is unique, isn't it?

849
00:55:56,951 --> 00:55:57,962
Pardon?

850
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:00,792
Yes.

851
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:03,792
This is quite common in judo or wrestling players.

852
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:05,701
Our ears get pressed against the floor all the time.

853
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:08,301
The blood vessels in the ears are weak, so they swell easily.

854
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,002
So it's like a badge of honour.

855
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:15,542
- Pardon? - It shows how hard you trained.

856
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:18,511
You're right.

857
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,051
I have one too.

858
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:25,352
A college diploma, a score on a foreign language exam,

859
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,221
and various kinds of certificates.

860
00:56:28,022 --> 00:56:29,621
But I feel like...

861
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:33,490
everything I worked hard for is useless on this team,

862
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:34,661
so I feel demotivated.

863
00:56:36,232 --> 00:56:37,332
I see.

864
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:41,371
You might think that now,

865
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:45,102
but wouldn't there be a day when your badge of honour shines?

866
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,570
So hang in there.

867
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,812
And cheer up?

868
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:51,212
Yes.

869
00:56:52,582 --> 00:56:55,411
Ms. On, you often say things like "Do your best"...

870
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,281
and "Cheer up."

871
00:56:58,721 --> 00:57:00,351
Yes. I do.

872
00:57:00,352 --> 00:57:02,292
But I don't like hearing such comments.

873
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:05,022
"Cheer up." "Do your best."

874
00:57:05,692 --> 00:57:07,362
The more I hear them, the more demotivated I feel.

875
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:09,962
I'm already doing my best with everything I have.

876
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:11,701
"I'm supposed to do better than my best?"

877
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,272
"How much more? And how?"

878
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:17,640
It makes me feel pessimistic.

879
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:18,641
I see.

880
00:57:20,172 --> 00:57:22,971
Maybe, it's because I'm simple.

881
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:25,241
When someone told me to cheer up,

882
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:28,582
I think I wanted to return the kindness to them.

883
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,382
It was during my match.

884
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:32,921
"You can do it." "Go for it!"

885
00:57:32,922 --> 00:57:35,152
I could hear everything from the stadium.

886
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:38,160
Then it made me think I should give it everything I had,

887
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:39,961
- Go for it, Ma Eum! - so I could win.

888
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:42,831
I wanted to win, so I could make the people...

889
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:44,632
who cheered for me happy.

890
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,402
I think that's what I wanted.

891
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:49,930
That might be why I developed the habit...

892
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:52,741
of telling people around me to cheer up.

893
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:56,011
But after hearing what you said,

894
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:59,112
I could see how one could take it that way.

895
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:00,911
I should go easy on that.

896
00:58:02,281 --> 00:58:05,120
This is Sachon Station.

897
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:06,381
I have to go that way...

898
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:07,621
- to make a transfer. - The doors are on your right.

899
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,191
- I'll get going. Good work today. - If you want to make a transfer,

900
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:14,462
please transfer at this station.

901
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:31,442
Attention.

902
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:34,780
Ryu Jin A's "Run All Night"...

903
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:38,021
accumulated 100 million views just now.

904
00:58:38,022 --> 00:58:39,051
Let's give him a round of applause.

905
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,851
Gosh. That's enough.

906
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,861
That's enough.

907
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:46,291
Get back to work.

908
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:49,591
All of the webtoons you're managing are on the royal floor.

909
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:53,561
Gosh. He'll get a huge bonus at the end of the year. So jealous.

910
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:56,031
Thanks to "Run All Night", our performance index went up a lot.

911
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,272
The rest of you should follow his lead.

912
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:00,700
- Yes, sir. - And as for the new recruits...

913
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:01,970
- Yes. - Yes.

914
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,741
You'll begin managing a webtoon artist starting today.

915
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:06,582
Really?

916
00:59:06,982 --> 00:59:08,482
And Mr. Seok...

917
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,951
will tell you who your webtoon artist will be.

918
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,792
Which webtoon artist am I going to manage?

919
00:59:22,332 --> 00:59:23,991
I won't tell you yet.

920
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:26,902
Is it a new webtoon artist?

921
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,232
- Wait. - Okay.

922
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:32,402
Does she like this job this much?

923
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,780
Jun Yeong, sorry for this late reply.

924
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:39,882
I've been so busy lately. It's a busy season in HR.

925
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:43,011
I'm free tomorrow night. What do you need help with?

926
00:59:43,252 --> 00:59:45,422
Are you going to put in a request to transfer?

927
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:48,891
I want to consider that option.

928
00:59:49,591 --> 00:59:52,321
Please let me know once you have some time.

929
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:55,362
Thank you for looking out for me.

930
00:59:57,902 --> 01:00:01,632
Right. I heard that you had to unclog Pomme's toilet the other day.

931
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:08,141
She was so grateful.

932
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:09,741
Good job, Mr. Unclogger.

933
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:42,571
Is he mad?

934
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:12,840
Jun Yeong, you've been working hard at your job these days.

935
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:14,911
Everyone from our school heard.

936
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,941
I didn't know you were such a hard worker.

937
01:01:16,942 --> 01:01:18,780
I heard you unclogged Pomme's toilet.

938
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,082
Did she pay you extra?

939
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:22,550
I hear she makes 500,000 dollars a month.

940
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:24,451
(LOL)

941
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:30,451
- Darn it. - You startled me.

942
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:34,491
What? Are you mad at me because I called you Mr. Unclogger?

943
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,831
Gosh. This was the first time...

944
01:01:36,832 --> 01:01:37,832
you did your job right...

945
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,231
after joining our team, so I complimented you.

946
01:01:39,232 --> 01:01:40,631
How could you get mad at me for that?

947
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:42,502
You're not as tough as you seem.

948
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,071
You'll have to handle things a lot worse than this.

949
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,571
Gosh. Seriously.

950
01:01:55,652 --> 01:01:58,181
- An iced Americano, please. - Please wait.

951
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,490
Make that two, please.

952
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,491
Sir, I'm sorry.

953
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,862
I want to put in a request to transfer right away.

954
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,102
Can I do that?

955
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:16,700
I've been thinking,

956
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,741
but staying on this team is a waste of time.

957
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:21,101
No. You just got assigned there.

958
01:02:21,102 --> 01:02:22,471
So I don't think you can do that right away.

959
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:25,740
Then I'll resign.

960
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:26,882
No!

961
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:32,121
Sir, I'll talk to you in person.

962
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:36,352
What is this? You were eavesdropping on my call?

963
01:02:39,962 --> 01:02:40,991
No.

964
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:43,731
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

965
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:45,661
It just... But...

966
01:02:46,502 --> 01:02:48,331
But you're not going to, right?

967
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:51,601
- What do you mean? - You won't resign, right?

968
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,812
I will resign if they won't transfer me.

969
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,011
Why?

970
01:02:56,212 --> 01:02:58,411
- Isn't it obvious? - Well...

971
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:01,851
But still. If you resign,

972
01:03:01,852 --> 01:03:04,781
all of your hard work to join Neon would be a waste.

973
01:03:04,821 --> 01:03:07,422
Don't decide now. Hang in there. And if you try hard...

974
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:09,752
I...

975
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:14,362
Why don't we stop trying so hard and doing our best?

976
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,232
How could I try harder than now?

977
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,732
You should stop trying hard too.

978
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:22,231
- Pardon? - There's no point...

979
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,132
working so hard to become an official employee here.

980
01:03:24,672 --> 01:03:26,542
By next year, this team will be gone.

981
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:29,141
What?

982
01:03:29,312 --> 01:03:31,641
Mr. Jang Man Chul and the rest of his team...

983
01:03:31,781 --> 01:03:33,681
will probably be dismissed by the end of this year...

984
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:35,951
because of the low performance.

985
01:03:37,652 --> 01:03:38,921
Giving you the impression...

986
01:03:38,922 --> 01:03:41,152
of making you an official employee if you worked hard...

987
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:43,091
They were deceiving you.

988
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:46,362
They just hired you to use you for a year and then toss you.

989
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:49,962
So you should also find a way to survive elsewhere.

990
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:53,602
Don't waste your precious year here with false hopes.

991
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,681
(Today's Webtoon)

992
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:42,311
I think I'm going to need luck from here on out.

993
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:44,082
Your webtoon artists have been decided.

994
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,681
This is crazy!

995
01:04:47,352 --> 01:04:48,791
Is that why you called me?

996
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,490
I called you because I wanted to see you.

997
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:53,261
What does it mean to be an editor?

998
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:56,161
The pain the creator goes through...

999
01:04:56,562 --> 01:04:58,862
is equivalent to the pleasure of the readers.

1000
01:05:00,402 --> 01:05:02,301
Why do you think I assigned you to that team?

1001
01:05:02,772 --> 01:05:04,430
You have to make sure...

1002
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:05,971
Na Gang Nam meets his deadline.

1003
01:05:06,172 --> 01:05:07,441
Tell them I'm taking a week off!

1004
01:05:07,442 --> 01:05:09,740
Did you not get the episode file yet?

1005
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:11,341
Hey, do you think this is a joke?
