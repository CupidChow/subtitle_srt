00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,609
Are you reading a webtoon again?

14
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,209
I'm done.

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,108
Come on. Let's go!

00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,750

Mr. Im!

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,150
- Ma Eum. - Who knew I'd run into you here?

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,019
Do you jog every weekend?

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,859
No, every day.

26
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,790
- Every day? - Yes.

27
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,029
On weekdays, I just go for a run in my neighborhood.

28
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,159
Today, I came to the Han River since it's the weekend.

29
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,799
What about you? What brings you here?

30
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,399
Oh, I came here at dawn to take some photos for the background...

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,469
and stayed to watch the sunrise.

32
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,500
For the background? You take such photos yourself?

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,909
Yes, I still prefer to draw based on the photos I took.

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,840
Of course. You're really amazing.

35
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,409
Amazing? Oh, please.

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,049
I'm still preparing for a contest...

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,780
when I've been an assistant for ten years.

38
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,319
Don't say that.

39
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:28,418
In Mr. Baek's studio, you're like the anchor...

40
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,689
that keeps everyone grounded. I know I can always count on you.

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,930
I assure you that your hard work will pay off.

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,559
Well, by any chance...

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,370
Would you be able to take a look at my work later?

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,210
I'd love your feedback before I submit it to the contest.

45
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:50,679
Well, I'm not sure if I can be of much help,

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,949
but I'd love to check it out. I'm excited and curious.

47
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,978
My gosh. Thank you so much for saying that.

48
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,219
- I'm honored. - The honor is mine.

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,240
I've been an aspiring webtoon artist for ten years.

50
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,469
I'm so used to this now.

51
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,139
But I may be able to take the leap this time.

52
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,749
You can do a good job, right?

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,060
Don't be nervous. Just relax and be yourself, okay?

54
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,430
I'll do my best.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,300
You can do it. Best of luck.

(Jang Hye Mi)

58
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,930
Please, ma'am. Don't remove Webtoon from the homepage.

59
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,489
You know that getting the exposure on the homepage...

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,100
has a direct impact on the number of clicks.

61
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,669
Every manager is asking me...

62
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,670
to include their team's service on our homepage.

63
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,870
And my job is to achieve a fair balance between them.

64
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,149
Remember what we promised? There isn't much time left.

65
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,350
Give me as much support as you can during the time we have left.

66
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,319
That way, we won't have any regrets.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,990
Both you and I.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,430
You're back.

69
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,569
Jun Yeong.

70
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,939
Can the three of us have a meeting?

71
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,980
Come to the meeting room.

72
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,029
Dae Lyug, it looks like you'd have to redo what you sent me just now.

73
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,100
Oh. Why?

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,269
Come here.

75
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,170
The perspective is skewed.

76
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,370
If you draw a line in the middle with the soldiers at the eye level,

77
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,179
you can see that you should make the soldiers bigger...

78
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,050
and the horses smaller.

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,819
But why?

80
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,420
This way, the sense of pressure is heightened.

81
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,860
In any case...

82
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,689
Just redo it.

83
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,600
Okay.

84
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,769
He probably never learned how to do it,

85
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,810
but he instinctively knows how to stage the story for comics.

86

(How to improve the homepage)

87
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:24,059
Write up a report that explains the reasons...

88
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,759
why Webtoon has to stay right here.

89
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,299
Data analysis and service planning are your specialties, you know.

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,569
It has to be good enough to persuade Director Heo,

91
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,370
so we could really use your help, Jun Yeong.

92
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,509
The current webtoon team will be gone.

93
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,310
You know Youngtoon, right?

94
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,449
They're number two in the industry. We want to acquire that company.

95
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,679
Jun Yeong, we're counting on you.

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll take you out for a nice dinner.

97
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,489
I've got plans for lunch. Enjoy your lunch, guys.

98
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,089
- Okay. - I've got plans too.

99
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,720
Enjoy your lunch.

100
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,089
Shall we go for lunch too?

101
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,100
- Sure. - Let's go.

102
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,870
Jun Yeong, let's go.

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,910
- Okay. - She wants galbitang. That way.

104
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,310
- Let's have ginseng chicken soup. - Sure, I just want some soup.

105
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,208
I want tteokbokki.

106
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,550
All of a sudden?

107
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,279
The fried rice with the sauce is so good.

108
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,680
Hey, you're mean.

109
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,300
Who is she?

110
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,628
They worked together at Gingertoon for many years.

111
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,370
She's currently the assistant editor of Youngtoon.

112
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,069
I see.

113
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,208
If they didn't break up, they'd be an assistant editor couple now.

114
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,740
What? They were in a relationship?

115
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,379
A long time ago. It was many years ago.

116
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,378
I see.

117
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,720
What brings you here?

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,089
I'm here to have lunch.

119
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,490
Don't give me that.

120
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,420
You're still so boring.

121
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,398
Did you sign with all the artists you discovered...

122
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,399
through the Webtoon Camp?

123
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,370
Yes, the ones that we need.

124
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,699
I see.

125
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,069
You seem immensely interested in Neon.

126
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,939
Of course, I am. Neon is our competitor.

127
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,609
You should pay some attention to Youngtoon too.

128
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,809
Sure thing. I'm very interested in what Youngtoon is up to...

129
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,350
because it's our competitor, like you said.

130
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,049
I'm keeping a close watch on Youngtoon.

131
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,980
Then let's keep in touch more often.

132
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,649
And let's share some information too.

133
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,220
We don't have the kind of relationship where we should be...

134
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,320
talking often, do we?

135
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
You're still so old-fashioned.

136
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,500
Are you uncomfortable around me?

137
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Yes.

138
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,509
Get used to it.

139
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,139
I'll keep contacting you when I want to know what you're up to,

140
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,850
and I'll come and see you when I miss you.

141
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,750
I'll see you around.

142
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,429
Enjoy your lunch. I already took care of your bill.

143
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,299
Oh, you really didn't have to.

144
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,840
Thank you.

You'll be seeing me often.

00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,950
Gosh, I'm getting indigestion.

148
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,889
You suggested coming here.

149

What brings you here?

153
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,570
Are you here to see Mr. Baek? Or Dae Lyug?

154
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,509
No, I'm here to see you.

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Me?

156
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,809
Oh, because of the thing I mentioned?

157
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,580
Oh, that.

158
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:13,679
Well, I'm here to see Mr. Baek, Dae Lyug,

159
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,490
and you as well. I'm here to check in with everyone.

160
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,019
Oh, I see.

161
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,558
Have you eaten?

162
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,700
No, not yet.

163
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,500
- You must be hungry. - Yes.

164
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,169
Were you out taking photos for the background?

165
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,940
Yes. How did you know?

166
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,039
- Did you eat gimbap again? - Oh, how did you know?

167
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,970
(Publication Rights for "The Eyes of the Dragon")

168
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,019
From now on, you can just send me these things by courier.

169
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,220
No, I don't want to.

170
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,149
I'm your fan, you know.

171
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,490
This way, I get to see you. I like doing this.

172
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,629
By the way, is Dae Lyug doing well?

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,529
I was a little worried at first, but he's doing a pretty good job.

174
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,970
Anyway, I heard...

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,940
you strongly vouched for Dae Lyug's work.

176
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,309
Yes.

177
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,509
Why did you like it so much?

178
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,009
I just thought...

179
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,080
it was interesting.

180
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,450
I really wanted to see how the story would end.

181
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,789
I see. That's the most important thing.

182
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,159
You really have a good eye as a webtoon producer.

183
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,700
You really think so? Thank you. I'm flattered.

184
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,440
- Let's sit over there. - Thank you.

185
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,669
Thank you so much.

186
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,210
It's a humble spread, but eat as much as you want.

187
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,209
What? This is a feast.

188
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,018
She's such an amazing cook.

189
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,720
That's why I can't leave even after ten years.

190
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,820
I still haven't made my debut because of her delicious food.

191
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,190
Is there something you need?

192
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,340
Dae Lyug.

193
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,789
I'll go and check in on him.

194
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,990
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay.

195
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,509
Dae Lyug, what's wrong?

196
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,539
What's the matter, all of a sudden?

197
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,080
Mr. Baek's wife is a wonderful person.

198
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
I know.

199
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,879
I know that, but...

200
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,419
When someone touches me...

201
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,990
Especially if it's a woman...

202
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,190
It's hard for me to be in the same space with women.

203
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,000
What about Producer On?

204
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,898
You're okay around her.

205
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,870
You can eat with her, and you two talk often.

206
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,070
That's because she's not a woman.

207
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,169
Hey, what do you mean? That's rude.

208
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,309
To me, she's like the Almighty.

209
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,139
The Almighty?

210
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,809
She recognized my talent...

211
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,450
and discovered me. She's like the Almighty who made me.

212
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,889
Did something happen at the studio?

213
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,230
I thought you'd be upset with me.

214
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,769
You'd never do something like that for no reason.

215
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,509
If there are things that bother you or stress you out at the studio,

216
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,639
you have to tell me.

217
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,049
Okay.

218
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,590
Oh Yoon's ambitious new webtoon, "The Beginning of Men."

219
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,559
It's at rock bottom.

220
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,128
- I keep scrolling down... - Darn it!

221
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,798
- but can't seem to find it. - That little... She's dead meat.

222
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,658
- His comedy webtoon was a hit. - What's going on?

223
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,969
- I thought he'd keep it up. - The Webtoon Witch...

224
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,600
- But of course, - bashed "The Beginning of Men."

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,239
- he clearly can't. - Webtoon Witch! How dare you.

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,109
She's gained more subscribers,

227
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,939
- It's boring. - and she's gotten even feistier.

228
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,409
It's not even touching.

229
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,579
- I've been there too. - It's not even original.

230
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,379
Hey, Du Hee. If it stresses you out that much, take care of it.

231
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,519
You really frustrate me.

232
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,989
This is driving me nuts!

233
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,459
I want to shove this burger into her mouth.

234
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,419
It's so predictable.

235
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,490
The planet will crash into Earth. Earth is doomed,

236
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,158
and so is the webtoon.

237
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,600
Naturally, Oh Yoon is doomed too.

238
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,700
My gosh.

239
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,538
I mean, it's worse than a B-rated comedy.

240
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:06,210
I really don't understand why he can't give up on this story.

241
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,580
Don't tell me...

242
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,749
- that Oh Yoon thinks... - This one...

243
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,219
- got so many views. - this will be a masterpiece.

244
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,659
I'll be even blunter in my next video.

245
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,490
(Webtoon Witch: I'll be even blunter in my next video.)

246
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,229
It looks like you drew with your foot.

247
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,439
- Look who's talking. - Hey, Gang Nam. You made it.

248
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,139
Gang Nam, we're in Gangbuk!

249
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,538
- That was funny, right? - You and your lame jokes.

250
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,878
Okay, no more jokes.

251
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,079
Hey, do you think you're always the man of the hour?

252
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,579
Must you always be the last to arrive?

253
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,109
It's not like I wanted to be late.

254
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,249
I barely got any sleep but came here to see you guys...

255
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,819
right after meeting my deadline.

256
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,689
Hey, we have deadlines too.

257
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,459
We're not as successful as you are, but we're working hard too.

258
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,459
Didn't you say you finished the series recently?

259
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,888
- I'm working on a new one. - Already?

260
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,258
These days, if you sit on your ideas,

261
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,230
they become useless before you even know it.

262
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,199
The world is rapidly changing.

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,028
Well, that's true.

264
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,069
But you have nothing to worry about.

265
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,239
Thanks to "Princess Kumiho,"

266
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,809
you don't have to work for the rest of your life.

267
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,610
My gosh, I'm so jealous.

268
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,239
- Hey, hear me out. - What?

269
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,908
I have an idea for a new webtoon.

270
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,679
It's about someone who has autism.

271
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,460
(I want to know!)

272
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,759
(Mom)

273
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,730
Is everything okay?

274
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,428
Yes. Same old, same old.

275
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,500
You really can't say that anymore.

276
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,700
- What? - It's already been ten years.

277
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,840
How much longer will you keep trying?

278
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,049
You should move back home if you can't make your debut this year.

279
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,349
You see, your dad is getting old now.

280
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,048
I really am almost there.

281
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:54,519
If I quit now, all my hard work will go to waste.

282
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,220
You're almost there? Are you sure?

283
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,090
You said the exact same thing last year and the year before too.

284
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,939
A big opportunity may come knocking on my door,

285
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,240
just as it did with Sin Dae Lyug.

286
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,549
I hope she'll be my Almighty Savior too.

287
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,950
Producer On. Remember what I asked you the other day?

288
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,119
Do you mind taking a look at my work?

289
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,690
(Producer On Ma Eum)

290
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,240
Mr. Im!

291
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,819
My gosh. The story is very solid.

292
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,089
The drawing style is very cute.

293
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,189
This is great. Do you have to submit this to Papaya's contest?

294
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,160
Why don't you submit it to ours?

295
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,529
I already did, but I didn't win.

296
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

297
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,230
I was one of the finalists.

298
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,470
But I never make the final cut, every single time.

299
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,299
The fact that you made it to the finals...

300
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,940
means that your skills are already top-notch.

301
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,740
You should look at it that way, don't you think?

302
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,048
It'd be helpful if you could figure out a way...

303
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,779
to win the judges over.

304
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,589
- Win the judges over? - Yes.

305
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,289
I recently participated in the Webtoon Camp.

306
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,759
And I learned that...

307
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,659
the ones that are well-liked by most judges...

308
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,359
don't necessarily stand out more...

309
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,170
than the ones that aren't really liked by everyone...

310
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,068
but a couple of judges...

311
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,069
rave about.

312
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,209
The ones that a couple of people are super passionate about...

313
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,579
tend to do better.

314
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,240
You mean, like Dae Lyug's work?

315
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,650
What?

316
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,980
Oh, right.

317
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,390
Anyway, I love webtoons with a strong theme.

318
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,190
This is a love story of a human being and an AI, right?

319
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,229
Well, not really.

320
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,068
The main story is about the AI's journey to find its identity.

321
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,939
Gosh, I'm sorry. I keep doing this.

322
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,470
Don't be sorry. It's not your fault.

323
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,608
I've never encountered anyone...

324
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,410
who could figure out the theme right away.

325
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:37,049
Even Mr. Baek said it was difficult.

326
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,720
It's all my fault.

327
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,289
No, don't say that.

328
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,029
Gosh.

329
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,839
I was really hoping to hear her say that it was a fun story.

330
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,910
But I did not get to hear that.

331
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,789
Oh, thank goodness. You're still here. Take this.

332
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,660
- Oh. - It suddenly started raining.

333
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:19,960
Thank you.

334
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,489
I'll return it to you soon.

335
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,490
Don't worry about it. We have tons in the office.

336
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,029
And here.

337
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,368
What is this?

338
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,900
It was like my good luck charm back when I was doing judo.

339
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,470
I don't think I need it anymore.

340
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,479
- It's a bamboo tree. - It's mojuk.

341
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,079
Once, I fell into a bad slump while doing judo.

342
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,579
I don't know where my dad heard about it,

343
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,920
but he gave me this.

344
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,750
What is this?

345
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,389
Mojuk.

346
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,990
It's a type of bamboo tree...

347
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,589
that takes five years to germinate.

348
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,460
It's busy putting down roots.

349
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,160
But after five years,

350
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,000
it can grow several dozen centimeters a day.

351
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,369
You feel like you aren't improving, right?

352
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,740
You're wrong.

353
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,710
You're just...

354
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,710
taking some time to put down roots right now.

355
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,109
Once your roots are fully grown,

356
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,618
your skills will begin improving drastically,

357
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,349
just like this mojuk.

358
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,890
It's just something little, but the advice really comforted me.

359
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,930
I hope it can be your good friend.

360
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,000
Thank you.

361
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,640
It's raining. Get home safely.

362
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,809
Will do.

363
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,699
Don't try to blame the artists.

364
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,559
The producers are to blame.

365
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,630
Especially you.

366
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
It's raining. Where were you?

367
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I met with Mr. Im Dong Hee.

368
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:15,639
Mr. Im? Why?

369
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,279
He's preparing for a contest. He asked me to take a look at it.

370
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,939
I thought he was working on a project with a different platform.

371
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,180
That fell through.

372
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,509
So he's participating in another contest?

373
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,720
He's got the skills, but luck hasn't been on his side.

374
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:30,349
Luck? Give me a break.

375
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,359
It just means he doesn't have it in him to go any further.

376
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,160
There's a fine line between mediocrity and good.

377
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,299
What? Do you think I'm wrong?

378
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,868
If we do our best...

379
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,099
to support him, we can help him become great.

380
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,480
Don't say stuff like that in front of Im Dong Hee.

381
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,608
If you mean well but can't take responsibility,

382
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:55,779
it can do a lot of harm.

383
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Okay?

384
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,420
Get back to work.

385
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,759
(Answer Right Away)

386
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,730
Hey, Producer Goo.

387
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,099
Let's have a meeting with Lee Woo Jin.

388
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,269
- Now? - Yes.

389
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,249
(Neon Homepage Renewal Proposal, By Goo Jun Yeong)

390
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,579
This is Producer Goo Jun Yeong. You know him, right?

391
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,348
Yes, we met at the camp.

392
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,259
Once your project kicks off,

393
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,960
he will be your producer.

394
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,629
Pardon me?

395
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,960
What? You don't want to do it?

396
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,000
It's not that.

397
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,769
I look forward to working with you.

398
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,799
Although it hasn't been confirmed yet.

399
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:57,210
Well, you prepared diligently for your webtoon.

400
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,209
I sent you the file for "Full Count."

401
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,210
You read it, right?

402
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,009
- Yes. - How was it?

403
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,049
It was fun.

404
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,879
The pace of the plot development was great.

405
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,750
Your approach to show baseball was original too.

406
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,250
Thank you.

407
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,759
But how should I say it? It was too informative.

408
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,829
There was too much text explaining the rules and the matches.

409
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,659
I think the readers might be turned off...

410
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,500
by excessive information before they get hooked.

411
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,730
Right.

412
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:24,839
That was mentioned at the camp as well.

413
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,739
And as for readers who aren't interested in baseball,

414
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,579
I think you might need more interesting elements.

415
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,339
Like what?

416
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,249
Well, there could be romance.

417
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,079
I decided to exclude romance when I started this webtoon.

418
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,650
Why?

419
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,088
Even if it's about baseball, it takes place at a school.

420
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,088
Just because a high school girl is the main character,

421
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:47,089
it doesn't mean there should be romance.

422
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,088
I want to include many incidents she has to go through...

423
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,528
as she plays with the boys.

424
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:53,298
I started this webtoon because I wanted to show...

425
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,099
how the characters improved through this journey.

426
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,298
If I add romance to the webtoon, the story will have no direction.

427
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,269
Isn't that a prejudice? Romance isn't a bad thing.

428
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,440
Whatever we do, love is all around us.

429
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,680
I think it will be great as long as it's not the main focus.

430
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:14,279
Or do you feel not confident that you can't draw romantic scenes?

431
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,549
I can draw romantic scenes too!

432
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,318
If you want, I can even turn this into a love story between men.

433
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,920
I can make everyone on the team fall in love.

434
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,359
Gosh. That sounds fun.

435
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,700
- Pardon? - What?

436
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,130
I think you both have a point.

437
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,170
Woo Jin, why don't you consider this too?

438
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:39,809
Okay.

439
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,779
Please consider it in a positive light.

440
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,348
I'm only saying this because I want your webtoon...

441
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:47,549
to get more attention when it's officially released.

442
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,329
Thank you.

443
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,400
I'll get going.

444
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,509
What? Everyone left to have lunch.

445
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,470
Should we order sandwiches?

446
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,910
Sure.

447
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,750
- I want that one. - Me too.

448
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,390
Okay.

449
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,059
(Mushroom)

450
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,029
This is good.

451
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:36,829
By the way,

452
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,640
you were pretty tough during your first meeting.

453
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,710
I thought my honest feedback would help her webtoon.

454
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,679
I'm sure you probably had similar feedback.

455
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,879
How come you didn't tell her before?

456
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,509
You were planning to put her webtoon up on our platform too.

457
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,219
Firstly, I wanted her...

458
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,589
to tell her story as much as she could in the beginning.

459
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,390
Secondly, you were going to be in charge of her project.

460
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,459
I want you to fill out the report for the meeting...

461
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,799
before we officially sign this off.

462
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Pardon?

463
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,339
Add that everyone on the team will have their own love stories.

464
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,670
Pardon? You're joking. Right?

465
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,309
I'll root for you.

466
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:20,880
Do it well.

467
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,819
(Answer Right Away)

468
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,990
You must be busier than me.

469
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,529
It's hard to reach you.

470
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,359
- I'm sorry. - No.

471
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,769
I like that you're working hard for the company.

472
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
But...

473
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,769
I'm going to need that report from you pretty soon now.

474
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,539
Okay. I'll do that.

475
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:58,450
(Can I stay there from Monday to Wednesday?)

476
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,819
Is it available this Friday and Saturday?

477
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,190
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,329
Yes. Really?

479
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,900
Thank you.

480
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,500
Of course. My team...

481
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,900
is going to work so hard, so you don't regret this.

482
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,970
Thank you! Bye.

483
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,009
- Will we be on the main page? - Yes.

484
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:31,650
Hey, we secured our spot on the main page!

485
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,849
- Let's work harder now! - Yes!

486
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,548
- Yes! - You did it!

487
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,989
Yes!

488
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,389
Let's eat meat!

489
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,919
Fine. I'm buying tonight!

490
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,190
- Yes! - Yes!

491
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,759
So you're going to include webtoon on the main page?

492
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,470
We have other major services. Why webtoon?

493
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,970
Mr. Jang had a point.

494
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:57,939
To bring in teenage customers who will be our future customers,

495
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,509
the company launched a webtoon platform.

496
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,879
So we ought to give them unyielding support...

497
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,579
at least for three years.

498
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:07,019
That way, when the result comes out at the end of their third year,

499
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,089
they will be able to accept the result.

500
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,119
I should even the playing field for their match.

501
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,089
So there won't be any complaints later.

502
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,359
Are you sure you're just evening the playing field?

503
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,500
I think you are already leaning toward one side.

504
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I am?

505
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,799
Not at all.

506
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,539
Why would you think that?

507
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,079
You're all preparing to discuss the new webtoon, right?

508
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,118
Yes. The incubating team for rookie artists...

509
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,118
will discuss Ms. Lee Woo Jin and Mr. Sin Dae Lyug's webtoons...

510
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,959
during the meeting.

511
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,019
Mr. Sin Dae Lyug?

512
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,990
I see. Are you confident, Producer On?

513
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,059
Yes.

514
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,729
His drawing has improved, and he finished a lot of episodes.

515
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,829
I'm sure you'll be curious about the ending no matter what.

516
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,099
Really?

517
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,469
Mr. Sin might be ready.

518
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,939
But you know that if you're not ready,

519
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,369
it won't go anywhere, right?

520
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,239
Pardon? Me?

521
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,640
Yes. You.

522
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,680
He wants you to draw up a nice report for the meeting.

523
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,449
Include the characters and summary in the report.

524
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,089
I see. Okay.

525
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,518
Producer Seok, you're in charge of Ms. Lee's webtoon.

526
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,028
So no problem there.

527
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,829
Oh, that. Producer Goo will be leading it.

528
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,029
Really?

529
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,900
Producer Goo, do you think you can do it?

530
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,599
I'm sure he'll do well.

531
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,839
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

532
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,410
Especially Mr. Sin's webtoon.

533
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,548
Great. This is it. Get back to work, everyone.

534
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,778
- Good work. - Good work.

535
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,680
- Good work. - You too. Good work.

536
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,589
Jun Yeong, can I talk to you?

537
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,868
Thanks to you,

538
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:05,299
we were able to secure a spot on the main page.

539
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:07,939
- I see. - You really are...

540
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,839
a huge help to our team. Thank you.

541
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,710
Don't mention it.

(Producer On Ma Eum)

543
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,589
- Hello. - Mr. Sin.

544
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,589
We'll have a meeting to decide on new webtoons to release.

545
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,059
And "Weapon Feeb" will be discussed too.

546
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,460
Pardon?

547
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:36,869
I see.

548
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,369
I'll work hard, so your webtoon gets picked.

549
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:42,869
I'll be in touch again.

550
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,569
Okay.

551
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,079
Hey.

552
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,250
Sir.

553
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,319
Do you have some time to spare?

554
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,430
- Was it Ms. On? - Yes.

555
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,200
They will have a meeting to decide on new webtoons next week.

556
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,369
And mine will be discussed too.

557
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,309
Gosh. Good for you.

558
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,140
If you get picked, your webtoon will be on Neon right away?

559
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,809
Gosh. I'm jealous.

560
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,479
When will I make my debut?

561
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,078
You're still young.

562
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,779
You should train for ten years like me.

563
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,680
Why are you putting a curse on...

564
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:30,920
You heard that, right?

565
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,789
Stop making such jokes.

566
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,690
When people hear it, it comes across as a curse.

567
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,500
You've been doing it to yourself for ten years.

568
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,230
Hey. Why you...

569
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,069
Dong Hee.

570
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,768
Your webtoon will be chosen, and you'll make your debut too.

571
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,369
I got a good feeling about this.

572
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,410
Okay.

573
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:56,808
Im Dong Hee?

574
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,910
Yes.

575
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,979
I heard that he made it to the final round at our contest.

576
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,019
Do you remember his webtoon?

577
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,049
I see. Yes.

578
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:09,589
I felt bad when his webtoon wasn't chosen, so I bought him drinks.

579
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:13,160
I gave him feedback recently.

580
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,599
I was wondering if my feedback confused him more.

581
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,670
Isn't that overestimating?

582
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:23,439
I think Mr. Im is quite a talented artist.

583
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,109
No, not his talent. I'm talking about you.

584
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:29,849
I see.

585
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,619
So far,

586
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,819
we've been watching Lee Woo Jin and Sin Dae Lyug...

587
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,489
getting discovered and polished...

588
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,589
- from the beginning. Right? - Yes.

589
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:43,930
The producers can't take all the credit for their journey.

590
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,299
I remember his story.

591
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,700
I even remember why it wasn't chosen as a winning webtoon.

592
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,140
Then wouldn't it be helpful if we let him know why?

593
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,839
Well, I'm not sure.

594
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,880
Shouldn't he be able to fill the blank himself...

595
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,079
for him to truly grow?

596
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,720
Whatever the result may be.

597
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,320
Enjoy your time.

598
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,429
This is fascinating.

599
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,499
I feel like we're still in college.

600
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,670
It looks like everyone grew up but me.

601
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,500
You grew up too. How could you not have?

602
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm not sure.

603
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:33,409
I just feel like I'm getting old without achieving anything.

604
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,380
I still feel like a kid at heart.

605
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,280
It feels like only my body is getting old.

606
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,079
You'll get a break too.

607
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,019
You've been working under Baek Eo Jin for ten years.

608
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,849
Not everyone can do that.

609

All of us think you're amazing.

610
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,989
All of us forgot about our dreams a long time ago.

611
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,829
But you're dedicating your youth to make your dream come true.

612
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,769
That's amazing.

613
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,639
Right.

614
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,840
I did dedicate my youth to this.

615
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,150
I didn't know, but dreams come at high prices.

616
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,119
What if my dream can't come true in this life?

617
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:16,949

No, he hasn't even called.

Right, they announced the winners yesterday. Is that why?

No, he didn't win again.

633

Is he shocked?

634
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,638
In the past, he always smiled even when he didn't win.

635
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,570
And he always came here,

636

What happened?

655
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,099
Why are you fighting?

656
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,639
(Webtoon Selling Point)

657
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,849
Is it going well?

658
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,849
I'm doing my best.

659
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,590
But knowing that this could make or break the rookie artists' debuts,

660
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:20,019
I feel like nothing I write is good enough.

661
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,059
(Artist Sin Dae Lyug)

662
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,289
It's Sin Dae Lyug. Why is he calling me?

663
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,130
He never calls me first.

664
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,630
Hello, Mr. Sin.

665
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,400
All my files are gone.

666
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,539
Sorry? What do you mean?

667
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,780
All the files on my computer are gone.

668
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,210
Everything I've worked on, from the very beginning. All of it.

669
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,579
Calm down.

670
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,389
I'll be right there. You're at the studio, right?

671
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,019
Okay. I'll be there shortly.

672
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,619
What's wrong? Did something happen?

673
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,090
Yes, I must hurry.

674
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,299
- I'll come with you. - It's okay. You're busy.

675
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,159
I'm sure I can be of help.

676
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,900
Isn't it urgent?

677
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,099
- Yes. Then would you come with me? - Sure.

678
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:25,018
Thankfully, I backed up the files that you had emailed me.

679
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:27,019
So don't worry too much.

680
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,230
I guess there were files that you hadn't emailed me yet.

681
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,659
Yes.

682
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,869
But...

683
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,369
I can draw them again.

684
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,610
Does that mean everything's been sorted out now?

685
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,610
Is Mr. Im Dong Hee not here today?

686
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,589
If someone deliberately broke Mr. Sin's laptop,

687
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,090
we should look into it.

688
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,288
Are there any security cameras in the studio?

689
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,090
I never once thought...

690
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,090
I'd need to install cameras in the room where my assistants work.

691
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,129
I'm sorry, Mr. Baek. What we meant was...

692
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,030
Honestly, I think he's delusional.

693
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,469
Both Dong Hee and I are confident and proud of what we can do.

694
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,570
- Who does he think he is? - That's enough.

695
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:18,840
Well, it looks like the situation...

696
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,179
has been sorted out now.

697
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,880
You guys can leave.

698
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,519
You too, Dae Lyug.

699
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,719
It's partially your fault too.

700
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,690
So let it go, and do not stir things up.

701
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,659
Yes, sir.

702
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,400
All right, then.

703
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,030
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

704
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,530
We apologize.

705
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,119
I know he denied it,

706
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,389
but what if Sin Dae Lyug is being bullied?

707
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,989
He doesn't seem like the type to put up with something like that.

708
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,829
If anything, he'd shut himself off from the world.

709
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:16,969
Anyway, I didn't see Im Dong Hee at the studio.

710
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,928
What if he did it?

711
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,739
Gosh, no way.

712
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,968
He'd never do such a thing.

713
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:26,239
And he always takes such good care of Sin Dae Lyug.

714
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,980
You never know what someone is really thinking.

715
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:04,550
You didn't come in today.

716
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,420
I suppose you didn't get the result you wanted.

717
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:14,619
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,460
I should've told you.

719
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:18,889
I get it.

720
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,360
I understand that you need some time to pull yourself together.

721
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,500
But don't be childish.

722
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Pardon me?

723
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,639
As for Dae Lyug, I calmed him down.

724
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,579
What you did was very unlike you.

725
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:40,579
I'm sorry.

726
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,320
I don't know what I was thinking.

727
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,960
Just remember this one thing.

728
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:49,059
In order to create something,

729
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,659
you must look inward and continue to reflect on yourself.

730
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:58,099
No matter how ugly or pathetic it is,

731
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,769
you must face the truth about yourself.

732
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:08,409
Sir.

733
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:11,679
I...

734
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,579
hate his guts.

735
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,849
I really envy his talent.

736
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,389
I'm so jealous of him, and it's driving me crazy.

737
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,860
I want...

738
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,500
to be like him too.

739
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,769
Hey, you're here.

740
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:05,300
Hey.

741
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:26,158
Dong Hee. The winner of the Papaya Grand Prize...

742
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,590
is very young.

743
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,589
It's someone who goes to a top-tier university.

744
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,900
And a skilled artist, on top of that. I'm jealous.

745
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,759
Life is so not fair.

746
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,369
The story is so boring though.

747
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:40,139
There's nothing special about the story and the main characters.

748
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,868
Hey, it takes a skill to create an engaging story...

749
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:44,840
with such a plain plot.

750
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:47,110
I bet that person has never felt a sense of despair.

751
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,380
I bet they've never been hated...

752
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,880
or treated like a nuisance by anyone either.

753
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,820
Does it bother you that much?

754
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,319
It's not about that.

755
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,690
They have a place to return to even if they can't draw webtoons.

756
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,829
And you don't?

757
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,469
No.

758
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,599
Not even one.

759
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,880
You must have had another job.

760
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,780
I only had that job literally to survive. Nothing more.

761
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,619
If I don't draw webtoons,

762
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:31,949
my life will be pointless.

763
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,809
Dong Hee, could I meet with you in private?

764
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,279
Luckily, I had saved his files.

765
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,780
So we were able to secure the files.

766
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,650
But considering what happened at the meal,

767
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:03,948
I was wondering...

768
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:07,090
if Mr. Sin was having a hard time fitting in at work.

769
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,429
I know what you're worried about.

770
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,868
But no one is bullying him at work.

771
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:18,968
Gosh. Of course. I know that.

772
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:20,139
I'm just concerned...

773
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:24,070
that I might have put him...

774
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:28,510
in an environment that's hard on him out of my own greed.

775
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,849
I feel reassured hearing that from you.

776
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,650
I envy him.

777
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,319
What? Why?

778
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,218
He has such a sweet producer like you...

779
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,920
who looks after him.

780
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,158
I can sort of see...

781
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,429
why he said to me you were like a deity to him.

782
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,428
He said that? Gosh, I'm far from it.

783
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,099
I didn't do much for him.

784
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,139
It was my bad luck...

785
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:59,639
for not being able to meet a producer like you...

786
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,739
when I was younger.

787
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,210
Don't say that.

788
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:07,848
I'm sure you met more competent producers than me.

789
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:10,420
Then it means I'm just not talented.

790
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,550
Gosh, no. I didn't mean it like that.

791
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,760
I know.

792
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,760
I'm sorry.

793
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:20,400
I can't seem to fix this habit of looking down on myself.

794
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:24,369
What about the contest?

795
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,469
I didn't get picked again.

796
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:29,670
I see.

797
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,238
Then could you send me the revised file...

798
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,078
you submitted to the contest?

799
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,449
I'll show it to Mr. Seok.

800
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,550
No.

801
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:40,949
No.

802
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,590
Why not?

803
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,920
Thank you for everything.

804
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,389
- Goodbye. - Bye.

805
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,619
I kept my place by making lame jokes...

806
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,820
when everyone but me had made their debut.

807
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,729
I laughed at myself first before others had a chance.

808
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,999
I've been here for a decade, but I haven't made my debut yet.

809
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,599
Aren't you being a bit inconsiderate?

810
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,070
Then I guess I'm just anyone seeing how I'm here for ten years.

811
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,900
If you make a debut before me, hire me as your assistant.

812
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,809
"It means I just need a bit more time."

813
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,539
"I'll make it if I try a little more."

814
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,480
"A little more."

815
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,079
"A little more."

816
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,189
I had been fooling myself by telling myself that...

817
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,119
I could be like Mr. Baek someday.

818
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,159
But the moment I read Sin Dae Lyug's webtoon,

819
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,059
I couldn't fool myself anymore.

820
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,000
I felt emotions I had never felt while reading my own webtoon.

821
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,829
Are you all right?

822
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,050
If I don't draw webtoons,

823
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:56,420
my life will be pointless.

824
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,219
He doesn't care about his surroundings.

825
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:02,389
A free-spirited genius who only speaks the truth.

826
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,929
People like him will be beloved...

827
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,400
by the deity of webtoon.

828
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,829
Not me.

(Main Characters)

831
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,170
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

832
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:54,980
I thought you were writing a proposal for Mr. Sin.

833
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,280
I already finished his.

834
00:52:57,409 --> 00:53:00,280
This is for Mr. Im's webtoon.

835
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,750
When I gave him feedback last night, it might have been too casual.

836
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,860
I thought giving him a report would help him more.

837
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,559
You're so enthusiastic.

838
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,630
You're not even handling his webtoon.

839
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,059
I won't be able to give him the answer he's looking for.

840
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:19,170
But we can at least look for the answer together.

841
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:21,800
He's really talented and works hard.

842
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,769
I don't think he's always short of luck.

843
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,909
He's also lucky seeing how you're trying to help him.

844
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,280
He is.

845
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,150
What was that?

846
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,780
Hearing that is making me want to work harder.

847
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,750
Are you leaving without saying goodbye like the others?

848
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,219
Gosh, no.

849
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,860
I was going to tell you in the morning.

850
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:28,300
Has it been ten years since you began working under me?

851
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,510
Yes.

852
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:33,440
Thank you...

853
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,440
for everything, sir.

854
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,789
Did you finally face yourself?

855
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:50,130
It took so long.

856
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,760
I realized that you had been waiting for me...

857
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:56,670
all this time.

858
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:03,710
I had been waiting for you to break out of that shell...

859
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,739
and face it head-on.

860
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,289
I'm sorry.

861
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,659
I think this is the end for me.

862
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,800
And...

863
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,800
I was truly happy.

864
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:39,039
Thanks to you, I was able to dream.

865
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,409
Mr. Im.

866
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,980
Gosh. Ms. On.

867
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,090
I wanted to stop by to see you. Are you going somewhere?

868
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:28,260
Yes. This won't take that long.

869
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:29,860
- Thank you. - Sure.

870
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,190
- I'll get it. - Thank you.

871
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,400
I thought you always rode that bicycle.

872
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,269
Yes.

873
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,070
I bought it when I started working as an assistant.

874
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,409
I've had it for ten years.

875
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:48,909
Anyway, what brings you here?

876
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:57,550
Do you want to talk to me about Sin Dae Lyug?

877
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,360
No. Today, I'm here to see you.

878
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,659
Me?

879
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:09,360
Here. I should have given this to you sooner.

880
00:57:11,269 --> 00:57:12,530

What?

889
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,408
What? Why?

890
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,209
I think this is my limit.

891
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:56,710
No. Why? Why don't you try a bit more?

892
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,078
You're almost there.

893
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,280
No.

894
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,179
I spent ten years thinking I was close.

895
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,420
I was the one who broke Sin Dae Lyug's laptop...

896
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,489
the other day.

897

I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,400
Whenever I saw him, I kept getting mad.

899
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,369
When I observed him,

900
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:25,670
it became very clear to me that I was running away...

901
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,440
by using my dream as an excuse.

902
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:32,150
He's creating something I had dreamed of...

903

when I first started.

904
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:38,719
I realized that by observing him.

905
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,489
That the truth was...

906
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:44,030
I was scared of becoming a professional webtoon artist.

907
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,929
I was afraid of getting evaluated and confronting my weaknesses.

908
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,329
But I complained why people didn't see my talent.

909
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,400
I just thought someone was bound to recognize my talent.

910
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,639
I only resented them and waited.

911
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,840
Pathetic, right?

912
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,379
I mustered up my courage for the first time...

913
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,650
in ten years to quit.

914
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,820
But I still have no regrets.

915
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:16,590
I did everything I could for all these years.

916
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,030
And I was truly happy.

917

Well,

918
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,429
it might come across as an excuse.

919
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,139
No, not at all.

920
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,510
Right.

921
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:37,409
Here. Let me give this back.

922
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,119
I wasn't a mojuk.

923
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,690
I don't deserve to keep this.

924
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:48,289
No.

925
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,960
You've been fighting to stay in the game for ten years.

926

wherever and whatever you do.

928
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:07,510
It's my present for you. Please keep it.

929
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:11,750
I will then.

930
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:15,920
Keep working at Neon for a long time,

931
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,619
so you can produce a lot of great and fun webtoons...

932
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,590
for the readers.

933
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:26,460
I have no doubt that you can do it.

934
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:15,280
When did you get home? I didn't hear you come in.

935
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,289
Mom.

936
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,389
What's wrong?

937
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:31,860
Did something happen?

938
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,829
Today,

939
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,569
I met an aspiring webtoon artist...

940
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,500
who gave up on his dream after working so hard for ten years.

941
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,369
I wanted to stop him too.

942
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:49,409
"He shouldn't give up. What a waste."

943
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,250
"He should try one more time."

944
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,659
I was reminded of Dad.

945
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,190
Dad must have been so sad that my effort went to waste.

946
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:12,230
Do you understand how he feels now?

947
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,869
But I still couldn't stop him.

948
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,210
He gave everything he had to his dream for ten years.

949
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,179
Just like you?

950
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:34,860
Just like me.

951
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,599
Your dad will realize that too.

952
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,599
He just needs time to accept it.

953
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:16,929
Everyone. Can I have a minute?

954
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,969
Dong Hee will be leaving the studio as of today.

955
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,409
What?

956
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,750
Thank you for everything, guys.

957
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,380
Thank you, sir.

958
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,380
Thank you for everything.

959
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:39,018
Let's help him move his things.

960
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:42,089
Gosh, no. I already got my stuff.

961
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:45,059
My uncle will pick me up since I'm going back to my hometown.

962
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,259
I know you're busy. You don't have to see me out.

963
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,659
- But still. - I'm all right.

964
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,000
He's here.

965
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,800
Take care, everyone.

966
01:03:57,409 --> 01:03:59,010
Call me when you come to Busan.

967
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,510
Mr. Baek, I'll go now.

968
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:04,679
Okay.

969
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,789
I think Dong Hee forgot this.

970
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:17,659
I'll go and give it to him.

971
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,809
Here. You forgot this.

972
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,880
I left it there on purpose.

973
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,849
You can use it.

974
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,949
Gosh.

975
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,190
I don't need that anymore. Please use it well.

976
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,519
Why are you leaving?

977
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,030
Is it because of me?

978
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,000
Because...

979
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,869
I bothered you too much?

980
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:00,400
Yes. That's right.

981
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,170
So I'm going to quit now.

982
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,739
Actually, I couldn't tell you before.

983
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,480
Your webtoon was moving.

984
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,849
I choked up when I read it.

985
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:18,019
AI's journey to find its identity.

986
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,289
I could sympathize a lot.

987
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,829
You're the first.

988
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:31,868
You're the first person...

989
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:35,369
to realize that my webtoon was a story about finding identity.

990
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,110
Gosh. Thank you.

991
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,139
I'm glad that you understood my story.

992
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:48,719
Well,

993
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,050
the person who broke your laptop...

994
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:55,260
was me.

995
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,929
Do you know why?

996
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,300
Because...

997
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,900
my drawing was awful.

998
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,510
Gosh. No way.

999
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:16,340
Goodness. You're something else.

1000
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,750
Work hard for my sake.

1001
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,219
I'm me.

1002
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,650
I can't be you.

1003
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:30,789
Right. You're right.

1004
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:42,900
Stay healthy.

1005
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:40,360
It's the answer Mr. Im found.

1006
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,130
I should respect it.

1007
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,199
I see. Right.

1008
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,699
He could probably come to that decision...

1009
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,440
because he had given his all...

1010
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,110
to his dream.

1011
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,150
As I told you before,

1012
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,179
just because you do everything for them from A to Z,

1013
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:05,650
it doesn't mean they will be webtoon artists.

1014
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,389
Overprotection...

1015
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,760
can backfire.

1016
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,229
Then as for the webtoon artists you handle,

1017
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:24,869
what kind of webtoon artist do you want them to become?

1018
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,270
Me?

1019
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,210
Well,

1020
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:34,680
I want them to be strong enough to be able to wade the waves...

1021
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:39,090
all on their own even if their producers...

1022
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,590
or the platforms change.

1023
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,060
You know, after all, webtoons are created...

1024
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:50,760
at the end of the artists' fingertips.

1025
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:13,890
(Pomme)

1026
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,460
Hello.

1027
01:09:16,989 --> 01:09:18,659
Can you come right now?

1028
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:22,699
I think I'm being watched in my house.

1029
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,270
What do you mean?

1030
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,670
Okay. I'll be there right away.

1031
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:37,880
Hey, we've been to this place before.

1032
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:41,078
- That's right. - I thought you found a new place.

1033
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:42,978
- Let's go inside. - Fine.

1034
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:44,420
(Mapo Seodaepo)

1035
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,618
- Hello. - Hello.

1036
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:47,960
Hello.

1037
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:51,489
What's wrong?

1038
01:09:56,529 --> 01:09:58,729
- I see. The woman from Youngtoon. - Ma'am.

1039
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:00,939
A beer, please.

1040
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:02,868
Okay. Thank you.

1041
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:04,639
- Let's drink soju first. - Sure.

1042
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,369
- Gosh. Let me pour it for you. - Mr. Na Gang Nam?

1043
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:09,640
You finished it? Gosh, you can hold your liquor.

1044
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,278
Why is Mr. Na meeting up...

1045
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:13,909
with an assistant editor from Youngtoon?

1046
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:56,390
(Today's Webtoon)

1047
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:59,159
I want to see you working on the kind of story...

1048
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:00,560
that you've always wanted to tell.

1049
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,698
Are you worried?

1050
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,159
I should wrap up "Princess Kumiho."

1051
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:06,698
We might lose one of our main artists.

1052
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:09,368
Neon Webtoon is nothing without Na Gang Nam.

1053
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,639
"Princess Kumiho"...

1054
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,909
had been my role model ever since I started college.

1055
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,340
And she had been my friend too.

1056
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:14,840
please make sure to give it an absolutely memorable ending...

1057
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,478
that befits... its masterpiece status.

1058
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,779
It's really hard to see...

1059
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:21,019
the gifted ones work for a long period of time.

1060
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,119
Is that true?

1061
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,350
Why did you do it?
