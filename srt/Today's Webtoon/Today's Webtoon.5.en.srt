If he can't draw again, will you take responsibility for it?

To artists, their hands are their everything. Don't you know that?

18
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,050
Wasn't he the one who misused his precious hand first?

I'm sorry.

33
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,830
If he posts about it on the Internet,

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,429
the team will be doomed because of that temper of yours.

I keep seeing strange posts on social media.

49

It's nothing serious.

Is that so? Are you sure?

Call Du Hee and Yu Mi. Tell them to keep tabs on the situation.

Are you in a pickle because of me?

Gosh, no.

I let you down.

80
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,399
In many aspects.

81

Yes, I liked it too.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,088
The story is based on the artist's personal experience,

88
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,430
so it'll be fine even if it ends up being a long series.

89
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,060
What did you think of it, Mr. Baek?

90
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,129
The progression and narrative directions...

91
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:36,128
is very straightforward, which is typical of sports webtoons.

92
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,399
With a little guidance, it'll be good.

Goo Seul A.

94
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,838
Her drawings are beautiful,

95
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,638
but the composition is a little...

96
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,379
I think she doesn't really know how to drive the story forward.

97
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,378
I think the slow tempo could be part of her style,

98
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:51,720
so I didn't mind it.

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,350
Her drawings are so pretty that you don't want to scroll down quickly.

100
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,720
That's true, but that tempo...

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,290
I don't think it's intentional.

102
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,430
I think she's still letting her drawings take the lead.

103
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,429
But drawing-wise, she does have her own unique style.

My gosh. What is this, seriously?

106
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,910
This artist's drawings are awful.

107
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,410
And his pitch didn't make any sense.

108
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,319
Why was he selected to participate in this anyway?

109
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,180
Mr. Jang?

110
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,220
Someone clueless on our team was adamant that we include him.

111
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,560
The drawings could definitely be better,

112
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
but he instinctively knows how to stage the story for comics.

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,429
How to stage the story?

114
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,430
That scene, for example.

115
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,500
The character feels cornered. To portray that,

116
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,139
he drew a wall behind him and a big monster in front of him.

117
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,040
And he used the low-oblique angle...

118
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,079
to portray the sense of urgency and anxiety.

119
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,149
Good point.

120
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,980
Rookie artists normally put in a few childish lines and move on.

121
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,378
Did he learn how to do this?

122
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,419
He said he never learned to draw comics.

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,060
It's a natural-born ability.

124
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,688
Look. The angles, the placements of the speech bubbles,

125
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,699
and even the way he uses composition to portray emotions. It's great.

126
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,299
In other words, the drawing quality is...

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,670
the only thing that needs improvement.

128
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,069
I guess there's someone you have your eye on.

129
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,509
I just think that you picked someone who doesn't suit your taste.

130

What are you doing here?

136
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,940
It's my fault, so I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.

137
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,740
How is he? Is he badly hurt?

138
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,038
How about we have him work with someone who can draw for him?

139
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,178
No. If we do that,

140
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,918
the vibe will totally change.

141
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,278
The gloomy vibe...

142
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,720
created by the rough style is what makes this charming.

143
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,418
We could tweak the drawing style a bit,

144
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,158
but if we have him work with someone else,

145
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,889
it'll look completely different.

146
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,959
Then what do we do?

147
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,629
It's not like we can tell him to go learn how to draw better.

148
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,768
Well, Mr. Jang.

149
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:23,899
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:28,470
How about we have him work as my assistant?

151
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,980
Will that be okay with you?

152
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,980
Clearly, he's not skilled enough to assist you.

153

No one can be skilled right off the bat.

154

That would be amazing. I mean, if you're okay with it, sir.

Yes.

00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,388
I'm so relieved to know that he's not badly hurt.

166
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,628
He's totally fine, so...

167
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,590
Still, I should apologize to him.

168
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,460
Why?

169
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,929
He nearly got hurt because of me.

170
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,070
And it was wrong of me to give him such an attitude.

171
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,610
This happened because I upset him.

172
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,110
Gosh, thank goodness.

173
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,049
We had a little problem at the camp. I'm sorry.

174
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,389
We're trying to get it sorted out now.

175
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,758
I read a post that said they would sue the company.

176
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,758
Oh, that. We got it deleted right away last night.

177
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,129
There was some misunderstanding.

178
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,359
- Mr. Jang Man Chul. - Yes.

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,129
No one thought the Webtoon Camp was a good idea,

180
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,039
except for you, who insisted that it was very important.

181
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,710
That's why we allocated the project budget.

182
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,039
Yes, I'm aware.

183
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,980
From the looks on your faces,

184
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,249
I can tell that you all had a chance...

185
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,379
to test your limits and work fiercely.

186
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,220
The experience you had here is only the beginning.

187
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,929
From now on, you'll face your limits...

188
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:31,129
tens of thousands of times.

189
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,699
Whenever that happens, think of this experience...

190
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,100
where you pushed yourself to overcome your limits.

191
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,710
I hope you can all continue to grow as artists.

192
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,210
I wish you the best of luck.

193
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,179
We can do it!

194
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,960
Have you had a chance to ask Sin Dae Lyug?

195
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,889
About assisting Mr. Baek.

196
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,029
Yes, but he said he didn't want to work as an assistant.

197
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,399
Really?

198
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,629
I see.

199
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,799
Well, if he wants to choose the slower path...

200
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,440
We can't force him to do it.

201
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,710
- Anyway, thanks. - No problem.

202
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,149
But try to persuade him again.

203
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,490
A competent producer must be able to persuade their artists.

204
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,019
Okay.

205
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,690
- You can do it. - I got this.

206
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,789
Mr. Sin Dae Lyug!

207
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,740
(Neon Talent Development Center)

208
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,549
Mr. Sin Dae Lyug!

209
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,720
Could you please reconsider it?

210
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,529
- Reconsider what? - Assisting Mr. Baek.

211
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,898
Mr. Baek Eo Jin is the best comic artist in the country.

212
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,629
And he's a wonderful person.

213
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,909
Learn from him and improve your drawing skills.

214
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,479
Then I'll give you all the support you need...

215
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,580
so you can make your official début.

216
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,980
Why are you doing all this?

217
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,820
I'm just an aspiring webtoon artist who can't even draw.

218
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,259
I want to be the first reader of your webtoon.

219
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,729
I've been told that a webtoon producer shouldn't think like that.

220
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,259
I was scolded a few times.

221
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,129
But it doesn't matter.

222
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,268
I want to be the first one to read your webtoon...

223
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,909
before it sees the light of day.

224
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,009
I'll think...

225
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,350
I'll think about it.

226
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,019
I want to bet...

227
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:08,549
all my good luck on you.

228
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,459
- Hi, guys! - Hi.

229
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,128
Today, I'll show you how I take care of my skin.

230
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,558
You're such a busy bee.

231
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,298
Of course. I do this every day...

232
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,899
after I wash my face.

233
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,840
I see.

234
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,219
- My gosh. - Is it good?

235
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,889
- Yes. Follow your jawline. - I want to try it too.

236
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,918
It firms up your skin.

237
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,529
- My gosh! - You can feel it, right?

238
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,028
- Yes! - Right?

239
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,329
I'll get in trouble if my mom becomes even prettier.

240
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,570
- Why? - It'll be a big problem.

241
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,269
- My gosh! - You're greedy.

242
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,999
Dad? Where's Dad?

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,139
What? Gosh, Dad isn't home. Don't worry.

244
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,278
My gosh, you must be tired.

245
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,939
Welcome back. Let's sit down.

246
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,508
Is Dad back at the training camp?

247
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,508
Yes, he went back in just a couple of days.

248
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,178
My gosh, thank goodness.

249
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,819
I'm suddenly so tired now that I'm home.

250
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,019
You're tired? I've never heard you say that before.

251
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,259
What's gotten into you?

252
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,489
You need to eat a nutritious meal. What do you feel like?

253
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,128
Braised spicy chicken or braised short ribs?

254
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,199
Nu Ri wants braised short ribs!

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,669
I want braised short ribs.

256
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,039
I'll just have rice with the side dishes we already have.

257
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes!

258
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,308
(Webtoons for the 2022 Neon Webtoon Camp Unveiled)

259
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,349
This is what I'm reading these days. It's so good.

260
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,408
Really? What is this?

261
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,508
- I know this one. - You do?

262
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,979
It's about a vampire moving to Seoul from the boondocks...

263
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,119
- to look for her husband. - That's right.

264
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,990
It's about baseball.

265
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,719
But the rules are easy to understand,

266
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,159
so I think you'll like it.

267
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,590
Isn't this grotesque?

268
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,959
But the story is very interesting. It's different.

269
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,899
Right. The story is pretty engaging,

270
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,028
but the drawings look kind of clumsy.

271
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,829
Female readers are drawn to nice drawings.

272
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,069
So this one and...

273
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,099
How are people reacting to the short stories from the Webtoon Camp?

274
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,268
Not bad.

275
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,069
Many are saying the ideas are refreshing.

276
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,039
A number of them have mass appeal.

277
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,378
There are comments that say they're good enough to be long series.

278
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,109
Lee Woo Jin's baseball webtoon is popular, right?

279
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,278
Yes, it's the most popular one.

280
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,750
See? I knew it.

281
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,449
I'd like you to work on that one.

282
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,189
Do your best so we can start publishing it as soon as possible.

283
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,459
Mr. Seok.

284
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,489
- Jun Yeong and Ma Eum. - Yes, sir.

285
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,028
Take them and put together a team to incubate new talents.

286
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,058
Got it.

287
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,258
It'd be great if the other producers could take one each too.

288
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,668
Count me out, please.

289
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,799
I'm already working on many projects.

290
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,500
I also have to work on a bunch of web novel remakes.

291
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,739
All right. Excluding Mr. Kwon, since he's busy.

292
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,739
I'd like the rest of you to focus on the new artists.

293
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,480
The team's future depends on them.

294
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,678
Help me out, please.

295
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,750
I bluffed and said that we'd produce visible results soon.

296
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,950
I said that to Heo Kwan Young.

297
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:17,170
Hey, come in.

298
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,839
Take a seat.

299
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,879
So? Have you thought about what you'd need to do?

300
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
To get rid of the bomb?

301
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,589
Yes.

302
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,490
First, I'd like to know what will happen after the bomb is removed.

303
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,130
Will the webtoon team...

304
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,759
be absorbed into a different team or merge with another team?

305
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:39,700
No.

306
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,200
The current webtoon team will be gone.

307
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,670
You know Youngtoon, right?

308
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,410
It's a small company that specializes in webtoons,

309
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,009
but they're number two in the industry.

310
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,809
We want to acquire that company.

311
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,849
Of course, it's not finalized yet.

312
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,149
We'll come up with an M and A proposal...

313
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,349
based on thorough research...

314
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,289
before we suggest it to the higher-ups.

315
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,049
I'd like you to collect the data...

316
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,890
that we'd need for this.

317
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,088
We just need to show the higher-ups...

318
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,699
that acquiring an established company...

319
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,959
is more profitable and better for the company's future...

320
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,930
than continuing to invest in the webtoon team.

321
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,298
I thought you were going to wait...

322
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,699
until the end of the year to see if the team's performance improved.

323
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,140
That was the plan, but it's obvious.

324
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,709
In less than a year,

325
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,210
such a dramatic improvement is not possible.

326
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:30,210
Oh, but then again...

327
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,249
They might try to fudge their numbers...

328
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,920
to make their KPI look better than it actually is.

329
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,088
In order to prevent that,

330
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:39,559
I'll need you to submit accurate reports separately to me. Okay?

331
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,259
Yes, sir. But I have a question.

332
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,099
After analysing the data I collected,

333
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,200
what if I reach a conclusion that...

334
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,210
keeping the Webtoon Service Team is more profitable in the long run?

335
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,450
What is the likelihood of reaching such a conclusion?

336
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,890
Besides, I have you.

337
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,160
If the team disappears, what will happen to everyone on the team?

338
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,869
Why?

339
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:27,339
I don't need someone who will be swayed by sympathy.

340
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,499
But this is my first time...

341
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,140
having an entire day to myself to focus on my drawings,

342
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,368
so I don't know when to stop and take a break.

343
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,579
I don't want to be good at drawing.

344
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,009
I just wanted to draw comics.

345
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:15,419
Everyone else seems so talented and competent.

346
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,319
But I'm nothing special.

347
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,960
I wonder if I'm just wasting my time here.

348
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,130
What are you staring at? You look so serious.

349
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,170
I'm so not used to this.

350
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,769
What?

351
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,039
That's your sister.

352
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,480
Right, she actually thinks these days.

353
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,680
A lot.

354
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Maybe she's sick or something.

(Top 5 Finalists)

357
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,659
Have you all thought about what we discussed at the meeting?

358
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,930
I picked...

359
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,969
this martial arts webtoon.

360
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,068
Martial arts, again?

361
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:06,299
I have a good feeling about this.

362
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,008
All it needs is a little fantasy.

363
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,210
My hunch tells me that this will become a masterpiece.

364
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,338
Your hunches are never right.

365
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,379
This time, I know it's right.

366
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,078
You always say that.

367
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,180
I've heard you say that 20,000 times.

What about you, Yu Mi?

369
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,649
I picked this. The story about a serial murder case.

370
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,088
There are so many people I want to erase from my life,

371
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,259
so I want to get vicarious satisfaction through this.

372
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,160
- I see. - I'm not one of them, right?

373
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,999
You said you had good instincts, so think about it.

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,099
I hope I'm not one of them either.

375
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,970
Well, what about you, Ma Eum?

376
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,910
I want to work with Goo Seul A.

377
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,409
I got a good feeling about her...

378
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,049
when I met her at the camp.

379
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,880
Also...

380
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,819
I know he's not one of the finalists,

381
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,318
but I would like to work with Sin Dae Lyug as well.

382
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,789
Sin Dae Lyug?

383
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,758
Gosh. You are an ambitious one.

384
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,258
By the way, have you convinced him?

385
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,799
I'm still on it.

386
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,660
I'm sure he will come around.

387
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,569
He'd better.

388
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,470
What about you, Producer Goo?

389
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,210
I'm not sure if I'm ready to work with a rookie artist.

390
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,180
Pardon?

391
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,519
I'm worried that I might ruin the chance...

392
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,650
of a rookie artist making a début as I'm a rookie producer too.

393
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,119
My goodness.

394

Why don't you join me and work with Lee Woo Jin for now?

395
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,930
Okay.

396
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,460
Why did you say that?

397
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,559
What?

398
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,890
You said you didn't want to work with a rookie artist.

399
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,769
It's just as you heard. I don't think I'm ready yet.

400
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,599
I'm as lost as you are.

401
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:23,140
I'm not the type to tackle my project without preparation.

402
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,180
I need some time to prepare everything perfectly.

403
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,079
On top of that, I'm still not sure if being a webtoon producer...

404
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,190
is something I can handle either.

405
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,089
Then...

406
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,960
does it mean you want to transfer to another team?

407
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,970
No.

408
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,639
Working as a webtoon editor isn't the only duty...

409
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,769
webtoon producers in this department have.

410
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,109
I need to find what I can do better to help this team.

411
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,818
I'll go over webtoons and their covers.

412
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,118
As you can see,

413
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,288
webtoons and the covers are different. Correct?

414
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,889
The lines are thin.

415
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,999
And they are more elaborate and have more details.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,469
I'm going to show you my work process again.

430

As for storytelling and staging skills,

491
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,808
you have to be born with them.

492
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:42,849
So you've never learned how to draw comics properly?

493
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,679
By the way, how long have you had this?

494
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,190
Does it even work?

495
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,059
You should use this for the time being.

496
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,629
No. It's okay.

497
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,369
I'm not okay with that.

498
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,940
Thank you.

499
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,950
You should practice drawing circles without the function.

500
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,650
Without the function? What do you mean?

501
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,849
Try this.

502
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,960
If you can draw circles neatly, your drawing skills will improve.

503
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,509
You should practice.

504
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,210
If you practice, you are bound to improve at drawing.

505
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,149
My goal isn't to become good at drawing.

506
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,249
I want to draw interesting comics.

507
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,380
What?

508
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:02,190
It's nothing. I'll practice hard.

509
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,460
You can do it!

510
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,999
Excuse me. Where is the editorial department?

511
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,429
It's on your left.

512
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,500
I see. Thank you.

513
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:52,940
You didn't have to get me anything.

514
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,578
Enjoy.

515
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,779
Thank you.

516
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,750
All right.

517
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,779
Well, shall we talk about your draft?

518
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,449
Sure.

519
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,890
I'm nervous too.

520
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,119
All right.

521
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,959
Overall, many people said they really liked the ambience...

522
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,329
and thought that your drawing style was pretty.

523
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,500
However, some people also thought...

524
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,899
that you seemed to be only drawing the kinds of scenes...

525
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,240
that you wanted to draw.

526
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,509
I see.

527
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,038
The scenes don't seem natural.

528
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,278
Like a movie trailer.

529
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,118
As if a number of different episodes were stitched together.

530
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,220
(Seems unnatural)

531
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,758
Also, the main female character...

532
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,088
doesn't seem to suit the romantic comedy genre.

533
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,788
Some mentioned that it'd be good to make her more cheerful.

534
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,459
That was one of the suggestions.

535
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,659
As for the scene where the male and female protagonists first appear,

536
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,630
they suggested that you make it a bit more impactful.

537
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,509
That was another feedback.

538
00:33:58,779 --> 00:33:59,940
Seul A.

539
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,250
Seul A.

540
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,419
Oh, yes.

541
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,678
I'm sorry. It must be confusing to hear all these things at once.

542
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,190
No, I'm sorry.

543
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,730
Do you mind telling me the suggestions again one more time?

544
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,440
You forgot to press the button.

545
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,110
Oh, thank you. Hello.

546
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,980
Did you have a meeting today too?

547
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,780
Yes, Mr. Seok Ji Hyeong and I went through the draft together.

548
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,519
I guess you mainly got good feedback.

549
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,489
Well, all of them were things that I was expecting to hear.

550
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,730
I just have to make some small changes, so it won't take long.

551
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,030
What about you?

552
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,030
Oh, well...

553
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,630
It looks like I'll have to make a lot of changes.

554
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,769
- Let's go. - Okay.

555
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,459
(1 box has been delivered to your door.)

556
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,929
What? They came just after I left.

557
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,079
Gosh.

558
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,019
So, you're saying you can't fulfill your contract?

559
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,550
That's right. I want to quit.

560
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,760
I can't do this anymore.

561
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,960
All right. We respect your decision.

562
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,769
(Recording 003, Save)

563
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,779
Hello, Producer On. Did you see the revised version?

564
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,979
Yes, I did.

565
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,619
The overall flow has definitely improved.

566
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,249
But as for the protagonist's personality,

567
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,090
I feel like the consistency is gone.

568
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,459
The tone and manner keep changing,

569
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,760
which creates a sense of instability.

570
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:06,929
"Tone and manner"?

571
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,199
What exactly does that mean?

572
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,869
Oh, tone and manner...

573
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,669
Well, what I meant was that the story's tone and manner...

574
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,840
keeps changing.

575
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,479
(Tone and manner)

576
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,610
Well...

577
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,049
Could you be more specific and tell me...

578
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,949
which scenes or cuts you're referring to?

579
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,419
Even the last time we spoke, you were very vague.

580
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,760
So I had a lot on my mind when I was making the revisions.

581
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,259
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

582
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,730
Just a moment, please. To be more specific...

583
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,530
I'll be more specific.

584
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,599
The fifth cut and...

585
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,809
Oh, this one. It's still not ready yet?

586
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,408
We had some issues with the illustrator.

587
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:58,909
I'll find a new one right away so we can publish it soon.

588
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,349
Do you have someone in mind?

589
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,050
I'm not sure. I'll pick one of the rookies.

590
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,319
All right. I'm sure you'll take good care of it.

591
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,319
I have to take out some clients for drinks.

592
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,788
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

593
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,329
Who would be good?

594
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,630
Oh, this one would be a good fit.

595
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,340
Hold on. What?

596
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,539
(Artist Name: Crystal)

597
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,980
"Crystal"?

598
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,809
My Crystal. Okay!

599
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,150
Producer On.

600
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,150
Bring the tablet.

601
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,849
Oh, okay.

602
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,238
(Hey, does that make you happy?)

603
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,638
(Whatever, I should mind my own business.)

604
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,969
I see.

605
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,050
The character is still quite weak.

606
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,820
And the artist tends to write lines...

607
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,349
just based on how the story unfolds.

608
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,489
Yes!

609
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:16,059
That's it. That's how I should've put it earlier.

610
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,460
Would you say Goo Seul A is reliable?

611
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,269
Yes. She's extremely hardworking. She's doing her best.

612
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,699
She tries her best to accept all the feedback. I feel bad sometimes.

613
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,139
But artists like that burn out easily if they don't see...

614
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,250
visible results soon.

615
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,329
Oh, dear. You're at it again?

616
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,000
Shouldn't you look for a job?

617
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,138
Or study for the civil service exam like your boyfriend is doing.

618
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:03,340
Mom, I don't want to start job hunting.

619
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,670
I want to become a webtoon artist.

620
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,480
What? I thought it was just a hobby.

621
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,819
No. I'm going to make my début as a professional webtoon artist.

622
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,718
You've never said this to me before.

623
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,749
I couldn't because I was afraid you'd be against it.

624
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,618
Of course, I'd be against it!

625
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,689
That's a job for the gifted few.

626
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,329
Do you think you're talented enough to make it?

627
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:26,630
Am I talented enough?

628
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,199
Maybe not.

629
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,638
I may not be talented enough, but I still want to do it.

630
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,709
Stop talking nonsense! Who gave you such a false hope?

631
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,409
It's not a false hope!

632
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,179
Neon is working with me to develop my webtoon.

633
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,849
Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm talented enough for the job.

634
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:52,119
But why must you say that?

635
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,659
Why can't you believe in your own daughter?

636
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,230
If my mother doesn't believe that I can do it,

637
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,429
who will believe in me?

638
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:15,010
Frankly, I'm the one who is the most desperate to believe...

639
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,250
- Don't cry. - that I have a special talent too.

640
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,460
What's wrong?

641
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,530
Oh, sorry.

642
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:41,099
Only the rookie artists I'm working with are not making any progress.

643
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,170
I'm not working with any.

644
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,980
Oh, I meant...

645
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,510
It's okay.

646
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,679
Objectively speaking, I'm not good enough...

647
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,519
to evaluate rookie artists' work...

648
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,019
and give them constructive feedback.

649
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,949
But you're already doing that.

650
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,230
I don't think I'm doing a good job though.

651
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,659
If they met another producer,

652
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:08,229
they wouldn't still be in the revising stage.

653
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,599
Then they'd be able to début sooner.

654
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,800
Gosh, I can't take this.

655
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,510
Do you want to join me?

656
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,809
Now?

657
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,579
My gosh.

658
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,019
Oh, my.

659
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,619
I got this.

660
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,659
Thanks. My gosh.

661
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,989
Wow, what is all this?

662
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,129
We figured you'd be all busy, so we just wanted to drop by.

663
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,169
Oh, it's okay. We'll enjoy this and work hard.

664
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,840
We were getting hungry. Thank you.

665
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,639
I guess you're here to see if Dae Lyug is doing a good job.

666
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,079
Oh...

667
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,050
Is he doing a good job?

668
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,679
Well, he hasn't...

669
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,780
made any big mistakes yet.

670
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:06,059
But he needs more time.

671
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,859
Unlike me, he won't take ten years. But for a few years...

672
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,630
I'll make my début before the end of the year.

673
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,229
If that wasn't in the picture,

674
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,300
I wouldn't have come here to work as an assistant.

675
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,639
Isn't that what you told me too?

676
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,610
I want to bet...

677
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,179
all my good luck on you.

678
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,280
Right. Yes.

679
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:38,649
But I didn't mean that you would make a début this year.

680
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,759
Despite that, we should all work hard together...

681
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,030
to make that possible, right?

682
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,260
I don't want to stay here for a long time.

683
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,530
If I can't start my own webtoon this year,

684
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,369
I'll go back to my old job.

685
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,139
I can draw comics on my own at home just fine.

686
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,538
My goodness. You're full of ambition.

687
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,109
If starting their own webtoon was that easy,

688
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,340
anyone would have done it.

689
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,579
I'm not just anyone.

690
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,179
Then I guess I'm just anyone seeing how I'm here for ten years.

691
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,019
If you think like that, that will happen to you.

692
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,260
And if you say that out loud, it will happen to you.

693
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,000
Words have power.

694
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,368
Fried chicken is the tastiest when you eat it hot. Right?

695
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,010
It's going to get cold. Dig in.

696
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,739
We'll get going.

697
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,079
If we stay longer, it will only distract you guys.

698
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,179
Can't we eat before we go?

699
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:45,689
Right. That's true.

700
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,259
We'll come back another time.

701
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,530
Good luck with your deadline. And enjoy the chicken.

702
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,860
All right. We'll get going. Bye.

703
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,199
Bye.

704
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,780
I bought a lot of chicken on purpose.

705
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,679
You can be quite clueless too.

706
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,118
What? It's just fried chicken. I bought a lot of fried chicken.

707
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,659
Sharing it all together would have been nice. That's all.

708
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,029
Not that.

709
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,989
Talking about Mr. Sin's début in front of Mr. Im.

710
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,730
If I were him, I wouldn't have felt good.

711
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,399
Is that why?

712
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,899
If you hurt his feelings, he might not teach Mr. Sin.

713
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,610
Anyway you look at it, doesn't Mr. Sin need Mr. Im's help?

714
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,239
Right.

715
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,210
Gosh.

716
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,178
But how did you figure that out?

717
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:47,920
Didn't you meet Mr. Im for the first time today?

718
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,289
It was just clear to me.

719
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,820
Ma Eum, you always tackle things head-on.

720
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,659
But most people can be a bit more complicated.

721
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,039
Is that what Sin Dae Lyug said?

722
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,639
That he would make a début this year?

723
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:15,280
Yes. Well, I don't know how he can be that confident.

724
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,650
Have you read his webtoon?

725
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,619
Yes. I read it on his first day.

726
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,780
My gosh. Oh, no.

727
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:26,049
Sir, when that happens, press Control and Z.

728
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,460
Then it comes back to you.

729
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,460
- I see. - Okay.

730
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,329
My goodness.

731
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:35,030
There are so many things I must learn even in this old age.

732
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:41,369
I'm sure he's also learning his way how to behave in a work environment.

733
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,409
Well, I would like to think that.

734
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,440
He's never learned anything from anyone.

735
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:53,119
But he knew how to stage the scenes.

736
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:57,489
It might not be unjustified confidence or arrogance.

737
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,690
He only lacks drawing skills.

738
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,259
Ms. On was the one who discovered him.

739
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,800
And she definitely has good eyes.

740
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,569
A lot of aspiring artists never get discovered...

741
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,730
even if they are talented.

742
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,449
Everything is up to him now.

743
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,909
Your drawing improved a lot.

744
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:01,320
That character is different from the main character, right?

745
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:02,820
Right.

746
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,859
He looks like the main character a lot,

747
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,719
so it's hard to separate the two.

748
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,488
What do you think about...

749
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:12,860
changing his hairstyle and clothes?

750
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:18,070
Actually, all the female characters look the same too.

751
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:21,138
Some might have long hair.

752
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,738
Some might put their hair up.

753
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:26,509
Or some might have short hair like me. Or the shape of their eyes.

754
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,809
You could also make them look different with their builds too.

755
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,979
And one more thing.

756
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,779
Since this webtoon is in black and white,

757
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,320
the details on the characters will make or break this webtoon.

758
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,118
When the readers look at your webtoon,

759
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,888
they should be able...

760
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:41,389
to tell the differences intuitively between the characters.

761
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,360
I see.

762
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,829
Actually,

763
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,369
I can't tell the differences between people's faces.

764
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:58,369
I have a hard time reading their faces too.

765
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,980
In my eyes, they look all the same.

766
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:06,349
So I think I tend to draw resembling characters.

767
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,019
(I'm happy.)

768
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,730
(That's so funny.)

769
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:27,399
(That's so funny.)

770
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,569
I'm angry.

771
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,769
Darn you.

772
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,610
(I'm angry.)

773
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,239
I'm sulking.

774
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,539
(I'm wailing and sobbing.)

775
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,678
(I'm wailing and sobbing.)

776
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,849
My goodness!

777
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:44,150
Don't make me run errands for you.

778
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,989
By the way, why are you doing this?

779
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,489
This might come in handy when Mr. Sin draws his characters.

780
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:54,699
I see.

781
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,238
Why are you wearing a school uniform?

782
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,239
This might come in handy for him to draw a variety of characters.

783
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,210
It's awkward to see me in a school uniform, right?

784
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,380
Let's start.

785
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:21,488
Great. Next.

786
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:24,489
You've never seen me in this before.

787
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,730
(On Ma Eum)

788
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,539
Great.

789
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,409
I think we're almost done.

790
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:44,009
Thank you.

791
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,010
It's your turn now.

792
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,579
What?

793
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:49,750
What?

794
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,289
Stand right there. And then...

795
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,030
She never hesitates to execute her ideas.

796
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:59,900
Let's start with happiness.

797
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,230
All right. Great.

798
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,569
Give me a bigger smile.

799
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,230
Great.

800
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:10,768
(That's so funny.)

801
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:13,440
Great. Thank you.

802
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,309
I'm running out of time. Why did I doze off?

803
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,780
I must have gone mad.

804
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,780
Get a grip.

805
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,610
What time is it?

806
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,989
Neon Webtoon?

807
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,159
Hello. I'm Producer Kwon Young Bae from Neon Webtoon.

808
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:05,889
I saw your work on the illustration board.

809
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,299
("The Law of Girls")

810
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,429
This web novel is really famous.

811
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,199
I read in the article that it hit 100 million views.

812
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:17,909
And this will be produced into a drama as well.

813
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,809
Before that, Neon will release a webtoon based on the novel.

814
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,808
I want you to be in charge of drawing the webtoon.

815
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,920
Your style is perfect for this.

816
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,218
- Me? - Well,

817
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:32,789
this could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a rookie like you.

818
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:38,359
Well, is Ms. On aware of this?

819
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,030
Ms. On? Why would she be?

820
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,198
She's in charge of my project.

821
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,630
What? Aren't you Crystal?

822
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,840
My real name is Goo Seul A.

823
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,809
And Crystal is my nickname as an illustrator.

824
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,569
I see. I do remember seeing you at the camp...

825
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:53,840
now that you mention it.

826
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,479
How long have you been working with Ms. On?

827
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,550
I met her at the Webtoon Camp.

828
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,920
It's been three months.

829
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,249
But I'm still working on the storyboard.

830
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,860
It's been three months. But you're still on the storyboard?

831
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,388
She's just wasting your time then.

832
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:14,360
You're a talented artist. My goodness.

833
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,000
Why don't you put a hold on your project with Ms. On?

834
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,238
- Pardon? - Getting a new editor...

835
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,038
before a début is quite common.

836
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,409
Besides, it's decided this webtoon will be released on our platform.

837
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,078
It will go up on our platform in two months.

838
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,409
Then they will start filming the drama once this goes live.

839
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,408
You can skip the contest or whatever.

840
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:32,949
You can make your début as a professional webtoon artist.

841
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,619
Once this webtoon starts, your success will be a done deal.

842
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,420
Will you just lose your opportunity?

843
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,920
I hope she doesn't get flustered when I make a surprise visit.

844
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,530
Is she busy working?

845
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,079
Why is Mr. Kwon...

846
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:17,090
Wait. What do you mean I should give you Ms. Goo?

847
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,859
I was shocked too.

848
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,199
She mentioned your name at the meeting.

849
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,868
Did she say yes to your offer?

850
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,399
I gave her a few days to think. If she says no, I don't care.

851
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,070
I can easily find someone else.

852
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,039
You can easily find someone else?

853
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,268
How could you ask me to give up on her webtoon with that attitude?

854
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,909
What about you? When will you help her début as an artist?

855
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,808
What if you ruin all of her chances to get a proper job...

856
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,750
after making her fix her storyboard over and over again?

857
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,789
Are you confident you can help her début with her current project?

858
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,190
It doesn't matter to you because you get a steady paycheck.

859
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,789
Even if she has no money, it doesn't concern you. Right?

860
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,999
What if she never gets a job and her life is ruined...

861
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,969
because of this false hope to début as an artist?

862
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,368
What will you do then?

863
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:01,639
Do you think you can be responsible for her life?

864
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,280
This is for Ms. Goo.

865
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,090
If you really care about her,

866
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,090
don't be petty. Just let her go.

867
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:37,170
Hey, Producer On.

868
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,840
Thank you.

869
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:55,989
What do you think is the right thing to do?

870
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:07,500
Well, in this situation,

871
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,309
Ms. Goo's opinion will be more important.

872
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:25,519
Ms. Goo.

873
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,719
Hello.

874
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:29,760
Ta-Da. This is for you.

875
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,800
Fixing the storyboard is tough, isn't it?

876
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,000
Well, yes. It's not easy.

877
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:44,510
You have something else on your mind too, right?

878
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,369
Pardon?

879
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:48,880
Mr. Kwon told me.

880
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,949
I see.

881
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,820
You always...

882
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:03,530
encouraged me and were supportive.

883
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,429
So I was able to make it this far.

884
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,269
"This far." Then...

885
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:17,639
Can I accept Mr. Kwon's offer?

886
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,179
You're pointing at me now?

887
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,448
I want to be like you, Mr. Seok.

888
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,218
Me? Why?

889
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,888
The artist you're in charge of, Lee Woo Jin,

890
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,230
will make her début too.

891
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,698
And if Ms. Goo had a competent producer...

892
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,269
just like you,

893
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,869
she could've made her début faster.

894
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:55,380
Hey.

895
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,949
Not all the artists I handled made their début.

896
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:02,349
There are numerous talented artists I failed to help...

897
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,550
their talent shine because I wasn't good at my job.

898
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,389
- Really? - Yes.

899
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,800
It feels like getting dumped by your boyfriend, right?

900
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:21,999
No. It hurts a lot more than getting dumped.

901
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,738
I see. Yes. And you will keep getting dumped.

902
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:25,808
What?

903
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:29,280
We're supposed to make 101 moves even if we get dumped 100 times.

904
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,710
Don't mope around just because you got dumped once.

905
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,320
Besides,

906
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,519
the artists you sought after might come back to you later on.

907
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,860
If you and Ms. Goo meet again and end up working together...

908
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,900
once you two gain more experience, won't that be cooler?

909
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:56,969
That will be pretty cool.

910
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:08,519
Every relationship has an appropriate timing.

911
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:12,219
And it just means it's not time for you to work together yet.

912
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:18,230
Grow as much as you can until that time comes.

913
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:23,300
So you can be a real help to her then.

Come back inside. Ramyeon is ready.

919
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,169
Why did you cook ramyeon at this hour?

What?

921
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,279
Nu Ri wanted some late-night food.

922
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,578
The noodles are going to get soggy. Come back in already.

923

Hurry before the noodles get soggy.

- Let's go inside. - Okay.

- Hey. - When did Dad get home?

926
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,460
A while ago. Be careful.

927
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:26,659
Why did you cook ramyeon at this hour? It's fattening.

Right.

What?

930
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:34,500
I didn't want you to gain weight. So I gave it to Nu Ri.

But I don't smell anything.

(On Ma Eum)

981
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,730
(Juwon City Hall)

982
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:15,448
Does it hurt?

983
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:16,750
Lift the stretcher.

984
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:24,190
(Pride of Juwon City Hall, On Ma Eum!)

985
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,780
(Neon, On Ma Eum)

986
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,710
Jun Yeong, you're early.

987
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:15,679
Did you cry?

988
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:19,010
- What? - You look like you've been crying.

989
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,750
Did something happen?

990
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:25,189
My face must be a little puffy now because I had ramyeon last night.

991
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,019
My gosh.

992
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,690
- Hello. - Hi, good morning.

993
01:06:31,429 --> 01:06:32,929
Good morning.

994
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:34,558
Hello.

995
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,400
Did you have ramyeon right before bed, On Ma Eum?

996
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,969
Yes.

997
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:45,010
I heard Goo Seul A decided to work with Mr. Kwon.

998
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:47,480
They're having a meeting now.

999
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,280
I see.

1000
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:57,320
Ma Eum, are you all right?

1001
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,389
Yes, of course.

1002
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,260
I just want what's best for her.

1003
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,829
- Bye. - Thank you.

1004
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,849
Gosh, I finally sealed the deal.

1005
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,558
You know that every rookie artist...

1006
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,090
is a valuable asset to us, right?

1007
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,030
What? That's random.

1008
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,440
Well, I just hope...

1009
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:54,480
that your nickname won't apply to Goo Seul A.

1010
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,340
My nickname? What is that?

1011
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,280
Rookie Artists' Grave.

1012
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:02,078
That's what those who failed, quit, and ran away say...

1013
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,050
to put the blame on me.

1014
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:07,019
Shouldn't the company call me by a better nickname?

1015
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,260
Midas Touch.

1016
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:11,789
Don't you agree?

1017
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,649
Will you be home late again?

1018
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:40,420
Everyone has a beautiful memory they want to remember forever.

1019
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,520
All right.

1020
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,899
Even if you fall and get hurt a little, it's fine...

1021
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:50,000
as long as you have fun!

1022
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,569
But this time, let's do it together. We'll go slow.

1023
01:08:55,869 --> 01:08:57,868
I don't want to see my daughter get hurt.

1024
01:08:57,869 --> 01:08:59,039
Okay.

1025
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,009
Good. Spread your arms. I got you.

1026
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:05,078
All right, let's go. Right foot first.

1027
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:07,778
- You can do it! - Look ahead. Right foot first.

1028
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:11,788
- You got this! - Okay. One, two.

1029
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:14,319
One, two.

1030
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,199
Before judo came between us,

1031
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:25,999
that was the last time my dad could smile...

1032
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,170
and accept my failure as a natural part of growing up.

1033
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,470
The moment when he thought it was lovely that I was trying.

1034
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,640
Whatever I chose to do,

1035
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,279
he supported my choice in and of itself.

1036
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,149
Would Dad know?

1037
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:47,520
The fact that such memories...

1038
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,859
helped me grow into a confident, honest person.

1039
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,130
There you are.

1040
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,569
What's gotten into you?

1041
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:00,069
You never want to come to the dojo with me.

1042
01:10:01,369 --> 01:10:02,640
Here.

1043
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,850
My, I can see that you've been practicing.

1044
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:29,789
Yes, because I like it.

1045
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:32,029
I still like it.

1046
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,699
Hey! Okay.

1047
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,760
Then let's...

1048
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,899
I got a job, Dad.

1049
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,239
It's already been a few months.

1050
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:47,939
(On Ma Eum)

1051
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,710
What do you mean?

1052
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,350
Sorry I'm just telling you now.

1053
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,550
Hey, Ma Eum.

1054
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:03,560
Hey, you know how long I've waited.

1055
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,229
You know how I felt while waiting for you to come around!

1056
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:11,069
Hey, so you'll just notify me that you got a job? That's it?

1057
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:15,169
I couldn't tell you because I knew how you felt.

1058
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:18,038
Getting injured is nothing new.

1059
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:20,209
Besides, it wasn't even a serious injury.

1060
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,010
It's nothing, compared to everything you've been through.

1061
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,710
If you give up like this...

1062
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:27,979
You'll regret this forever.

1063
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,919
I made a choice, Dad. I'm not giving up.

1064
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,420
- This is called giving up! - Why do you think I'm giving up?

1065
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,760
Becoming an Olympic gold medallist?

1066
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,630
It would've been nice to realize that dream. I would've shone.

1067
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,800
I'm sorry I couldn't do that, Dad.

1068
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:50,640
But that doesn't mean I'm a failure in life.

1069
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,210
And achieving that dream doesn't mean I'll live a successful life.

1070
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:59,779
Whether I achieve it or not, it was a dream that I cherished.

1071
01:13:00,449 --> 01:13:03,220
And now, I have a new dream. That's all, Dad.

1072
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:10,960
I didn't fail at life.

1073
01:13:11,789 --> 01:13:14,260
I wish to live a life where I can do what I want.

1074
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,359
You see,

1075
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:21,000
I've regretted all my life that I couldn't compete in the Olympics.

1076
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,470
And that opportunity...

1077
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:29,510
is right before your eyes.

1078
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,479
No.

1079
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,250
You're wrong, Dad.

1080
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,760
How tall are you, Dad?

1081
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:46,689
What's your height?

1082
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,560
I'm 164cm tall.

1083
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:54,640
How much do you weigh? I weigh 51kg.

1084
01:13:56,539 --> 01:13:59,670
See? You and I are two different people.

1085
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:02,680
We feel differently and make different choices.

1086
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,310
Things that don't bother you at all could be big problems for me.

1087
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:11,489
And I may truly cherish the things that mean nothing to you.

1088
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,960
I made such a choice because I love judo so much.

1089
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,689
Hey.

1090
01:14:21,229 --> 01:14:22,399
On Ma Eum.

1091
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:30,600
It's okay even if you think I failed...

1092
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:36,279
or gave up.

1093
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:44,920
But you see, Dad. This is my life.

1094
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,989
My life that I must experience,

1095
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,130
learn,

1096
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,100
and deal with on my own.

1097
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,810
(Today's Webtoon)

1098
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,009
"Notorious"?

1099
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:46,549
Anyway, it's already been decided. So please hurry.

1100
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,148
We must stay on the homepage no matter what.

1101
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:51,890
I need you to speed things up.

1102
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,550
"I'm good now."

1103
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:55,959
"It's all over."

1104
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,358
Something I hadn't seen before exuded.

1105
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,728
- Ms. Goo. - What happened to her?

1106
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:01,729
Hello, 911?

1107
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,198
Did you email our team's data through your personal email?

1108
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,630
The security team called me.

1109
01:16:05,029 --> 01:16:07,698
Rookie artists aren't some tools you can dispose of.

1110
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:09,339
Are you trying to lecture me now?

1111
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,939
Stop overstepping your bounds.
