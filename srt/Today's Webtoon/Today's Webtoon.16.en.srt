No. I'm on a diet.

I'll go back after I talk to Mr. Sin.

Of course.

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,169
He will wake up no matter what.

32
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,409
I haven't even thanked him properly.

33
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,280
He accepted me as an assistant who wasn't even good at drawing.

34
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,819
So...

35
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,919
he helped me get to where I am now.

36
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,960
Should we have tried to stop him from getting the surgery?

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,459
This surgery was Mr. Baek's courage...

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,799
to complete the Dragon series and to achieve his dream.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,699
And only he could have made that decision.

40
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,939
So no one could have stopped him.

41
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,139
Mr. Sin and Ma Eum seemed very shocked.

42
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,479
They pretended to be okay, but they didn't seem okay at all.

43
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,919
You too. Stop pretending to be okay.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,590
If it's tough on you, you can show it.

45
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,389
I'm sure he'll wake up. He's strong.

Jun Yeong.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,598
You mustered up the courage to fight...

48
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,770
because you wanted to protect the people you liked, right?

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,409
But what if the people you liked couldn't work with you?

50
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,710
Can you handle that?

51
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,319
We decided to fight this to the end.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,020
- So it's over now, right? - Yes.

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,939
Did you tell her about your feelings?

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
Pardon?

55
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,270
It looked like you were going to tell her soon.

56
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,210
You haven't told her yet.

57
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,120
If you hesitate like that,

58
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,020
I might beat you to the punch.

59
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,289
Do you...

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,529
like Ms. On?

61
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Come on.

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,069
Gosh. You're hopeless.

63
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,439
It looks like you need a coach.

64
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,910
I'll recommend you a few helpful videos...

65
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,279
about confessions.

66
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,838
Mom, I think it's time for us to order food.

67
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,449
- Write it down. - Okay.

68
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,519
Gosh. Hello.

69
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,649
Gosh. You're the handsome guy.

70
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,789
What? Jun Yeong? What brings you here?

71
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,959
Are you here to read comic books?

72
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,328
Hey, do some thinking.

73
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,629
Do you think that's the only reason?

74
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,429
- Goodness. - Seriously.

75
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,528
Actually, we were about to take a break...

76
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:26,698
as there are no customers.

77
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,028
I'll leave you two to talk.

78
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,599
Ma Eum, take care of the cafe.

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,169
- Wait. - Why pick a fight with me?

80
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,370
Come on. Your temper! Try to act like a lady!

81
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,569
What's wrong with her?

82
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,939
Sorry. I just need to clean up. Go sit down.

83
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,319
I'm going to move.

84
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,990
Really?

85
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,620
Yes.

86
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,990
I'm done paying off my student loan.

87
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,199
So I don't need to invest anymore.

88
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,000
I should congratulate you.

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,199
Do you need any moving supplies? I'll buy everything.

90

"Love your colleagues as much as your country"?

91
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,639
That's right. Love your colleagues as much as your country.

92
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,279
Can you just recommend me a comic book today?

93
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,279
Something to read when closing a chapter in life.

94
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,419
"Something to read when closing a chapter in life"?

95
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
What could that be?

96
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,019
Right here.

97
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,329
Maybe, you just need someone to talk to.

98
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,529
You're right. Then I'll keep it.

99
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,329
Keep?

100
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,139
I'll ask you for a favor when I'm done moving.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,699
Let me talk to you then.

102
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,639
Sure. Let's do that.

Ma'am, Mr. Goo Jun Yeong...

110
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,740
It was anonymous.

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,639
The anonymous reporter can stay anonymous...

112
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,980
and work hard.

Come on, Man Chul. You heard too, right?

116
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,889
About my vacation.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Well, we can't be sure...

Regardless of how or when we cross paths again,

my team and I will be much stronger than...

you'll ever think.

Don't walk such a difficult path.

127
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,460

You must prepare thoroughly.

134

Right. It's about that person who gave the critical tip-off.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,370
Apparently, he stayed anonymous.

136
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,110
No one ever met with him.

137
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,139
Maybe, he's Hong Gil Dong.

138
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,750
You must've been worried.

139
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
No.

The war isn't over yet. It's just starting.

141

Stay in your position...

142
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,429
and fight with us just like you have been so far.

143
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,230
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

144
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,440
Gosh. I'm definitely lucky to have the best people around me.

And this is about investments. Please read it later.

149
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,529
Did you think about the name of the company?

150
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,200
There is a name I have in mind.

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
What is it?

152
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,769
Ginger.

153
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,898
Ginger?

154
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,639
Yes. Studio Ginger.

155
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,779
I thought it would be nice to be remembered...

156
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,379
not as a painful end, but a new beginning.

157
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,019
It's a suggestion I can't turn down then.

158
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,590
I started at Ginger too.

159
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,059
Right. Mr. Baek still hasn't woken up yet?

160
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,299
Not yet.

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,969
I'm also a webtoon artist,

162
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,370
but I wouldn't have been able to make the same decision.

163
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,409
That just shows how strong-willed he is to finish his work.

164
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,580
He mustered up his courage,

165
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,350
so I really hope he gets to achieve his dream.

166

Gosh.

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,250
He should wake up soon.

168
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,090
He will.

Sir, can you see me?

172
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,870
We have the results for the contest.

173
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,740
Right. We just have to inform the winners.

174
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,278
By the way...

175
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,350
Wait. Isn't this the webtoon Mr. Kwon and Ma Eum picked?

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
What? Wait.

177
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,129
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:36,889
Yes.

179
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,529
I see.

180
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,100
Okay.

Mr. Sin.

184
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,190
Mr. Baek woke up.

185
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,759
Mr. Sin?

186
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,669
That's great.

187
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,700
That's really great.

192
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,149
Honey. Are you all right?

(This is important!)

195
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,230
Oh, my. Are you working right now?

196
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,829
Yes, I am.

197
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,070
Goodness.

198
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,369
These are the winning webtoons of the contest.

199
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,709
I have a meeting with the artist tomorrow. So I'm studying for it.

200
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,610
I see. This one is about day-to-day lives.

201
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,250
- Yes. - It's about traveling?

202
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,549
It's a story about a travel agency.

203
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,719
The story is so realistic.

204
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,418
And it's so full of life. It's really fun.

205
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,450
I see.

206
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,518
Right. People do need webtoons like this.

207
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,129
Something they can read casually.

208
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,299
A simple story people can relate to.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,169
You're pretty good.

210
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,499
Yes, I am.

211
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,499
What did you just say, Webtoon Witch?

212
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,539
Ordinary, but extraordinary at the same time.

213
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,840
Ordinary, but extraordinary...

214
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,038
- So being ordinary is special? - Yes. That's it.

215
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,750
- Being ordinary is special. Yes. - That's a great point.

216
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,979
- And what was that? Simple... - My story.

217
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,949
- My simple story? - Yes.

218
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,619
- "My simple story." - Yes. That's it.

219
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,460
That was an important point.

220
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:47,759
I'm pretty good.

221
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,298
- You're indeed the Webtoon Witch. - Yes. That's great.

222
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,830
Please go away. I need to focus.

223
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,829
So you got everything out of me. Is that it? I see.

224
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,569
- Thanks. - Bye.

225
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,538
All right. I should go?

226
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,409
- Thanks for your help! - Sure.

227
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,509
Ordinary... That's good.

"My simple story."

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,119
(My simple story)

230
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,759
(Thank you, Webtoon Witch.)

231
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,289
Hello.

232
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,490
- You're here. - You're here.

233
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:22,529
- Hello. - Hello.

234
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,230
Right. I'll take Ruby.

235
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,398
What?

236
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,940
I always handled the top three webtoons of contests.

237
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
You can step back from this.

238
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,940
Wait. I don't think that's fair.

239
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Fair?

240
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,480
Do you think I'm doing this for my own sake?

241
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,219
Do you think if we launch the webtoon as it is,

242
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,690
it will be a hit?

243
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,590
It will just end with a few fans without being a hit.

244
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,330
Once we change the gender of the main character and add romance,

245
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:57,799
don't you think it will be a mega-hit?

246
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,730
Right? You never thought about that, right?

247
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,898
Because you couldn't think like me,

248
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,500
Ms. Goo Seul A made a different decision.

249
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,309
They're talking about the artist of "Travel Trouble."

250
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,049
Mr. Kwon just told Ma Eum that he was taking her project.

251
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,350
- Gosh. - It will be different this time.

252
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,519
Is that so?

253
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,289
Based on what?

254
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,599
Well, why don't you submit proposals this time?

255
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,628
And we can pick the better proposal.

256
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,499
That is, if you agree to this, Mr. Kwon.

257
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,669
Come on. That will hurt his pride.

258
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,509
No.

259
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,309
Sounds good.

260
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,009
Let's do that.

261
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,919
We'll compete through our proposals.

262
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,320
But you can't change your mind because you can't accept the result.

263
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,620
Okay?

264
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,460
Okay. But I need you to promise me too.

265
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,289
You have to accept the result.

266
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,430
Okay.

267
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,329
That's cool.

268
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,849
Mr. Jang.

269
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,319
(Ruby, Goo Seul A)

270
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,460
You have to keep your promise this time.

271
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,630
I said I got it.

272
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,940
Have I ever gone back on my word?

273
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,670
I don't remember.

274
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
You don't...

275
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,539
Ms. Goo Seul A?

276
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,680
Ms. Goo!

277
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,650
It's been a while, Ms. On.

278
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,660
You were the webtoon artist of "Travel Trouble"?

279
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:13,700
Yes. It's the webtoon I drew working at a travel agency.

280
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,930
Gosh.

281
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,899
Your pen name and your drawing style changed!

282
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,440
So I had no idea.

283
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,939
Why didn't you tell me?

284
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,940
I wanted to do this on my own without anyone's help.

285
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,880
More importantly, it was fun to draw while working there.

286
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,079
(Starsand Tour)

287
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,519
Aren't you going to have lunch?

288
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,118
I'm okay. You should go eat.

289
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,390
- Okay. We'll be back. - Enjoy your lunch.

290
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,069
I felt really bad about my dream...

291
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,769
for the days I didn't draw.

292
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,809
Late nights or weekends. Instead of resting,

293
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,539
I drew the webtoon because that's what I wanted to do.

294
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,680
That's how I ended up with this webtoon...

295
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,220
and submitted it to the contest.

296
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,220
That's amazing, Ms. Goo.

297
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,089
You mustered up the courage for your dream again...

298
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,289
and to come here again.

299
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,059
You really are writing your own story.

300
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,269
I completed the story, hoping to work with you.

301
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,970
Gosh. This is...

302
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,269
This isn't easy.

303
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,440
I knew you had it in you.

304
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,039
You're talented.

305
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,650
Things were tough on you last time because we didn't have much time.

306
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,880
But this time, we can turn this into a well-made webtoon.

307
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,950
Let's take time to develop this.

308
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,089
I can assure you that it will be the top webtoon of the day... No.

309
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,029
It will be in the top three...

310
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,059
of all the webtoons at Neon.

311
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,970
I see.

312
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,839
Can I choose my own producer?

313
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,608
We haven't made any decision internally.

314
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:05,740
So you can.

315
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,880
But you must think carefully...

316
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,450
which producer can be more helpful.

317
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,250
You worked so hard for this.

318
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,420
Shouldn't you make it successful no matter what?

319
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,629
No. My decision...

320
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,589
Of course, you don't have to decide now.

321
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,660
Take your time to think about it. Your life depends on this.

322
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,170
What if you make an emotional decision and regret it later?

323
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,839
Don't you agree?

324
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,680
Of course, I want to work with you.

325
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,279
But you worked hard for this webtoon.

326
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:48,849
So you should carefully choose your producer too.

327
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,190
It's okay to make your decision after giving it a lot of thought.

328
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,230
Gosh. How can this happen?

329
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,430
Ms. Goo must have a lot on her mind too.

330
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,799
Isn't it obvious what her decision will be?

331
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,839
If I were you,

332
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,410
- I would work with Mr. Kwon. - What?

333
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,950
It wouldn't be unfair if I only got exploited for my talent.

334
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,549
Everyone knows that all the webtoons Mr. Kwon takes on become hits.

335
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,390
So this time, you can exploit his skills.

336
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,859
But still. I want to work with Ms. On this time.

337
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,630
I'm sure you will have more chances to work with her in the future.

338
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,869
Shouldn't you be more flexible for a bigger goal?

339
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,380
All the winning webtoons from the contest were great.

340
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,680
Did you read them?

341
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,048
Yes. And what was it? "Travel Trouble"?

342
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,490
That was really nice.

343
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,018
Did you think so too?

344
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,990
Yes. It will be a huge hit with some polishing.

345
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,589
How?

346
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,258
If I were the artist,

347
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,758
I would change the gender of the main character to male...

348
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,099
and change the storyline of him traveling the world...

349
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,000
instead of listening to the stories from the customers.

350
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,000
And I'll add romance at the travel destinations too.

351
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,140
That's similar to what Mr. Kwon said.

352
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,379
Webtoons are entertainment at the end of the day.

353
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,880
And there must be factors that will satisfy the readers' desires.

354
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:28,289
Any professionals would think like this.

Feel-good webtoons...

362
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,818
That should be the theme. Right?

(How many feel-good webtoons are there in the market?)

364
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,869
You have that much work?

365
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,500
Yes. There is a project I don't want to lose.

366
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,669
But still. It will affect your health.

367
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,839

368
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,170
Okay.

- Dad. - Yes?

(Comic Book Cafe On)

371
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,720
There's this webtoon artist.

372
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,720
I want to give her a chance to draw what she wants.

373
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,190
But another producer thinks...

374
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,490
the webtoon will reach more people if she changes her style.

375
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,170
If it were up to you, which would be a better decision?

376
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,599
I'm not sure.

377
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,309
I don't know much.

378
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,179
If you asked me before,

379
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,680
I would have said making a hit was the right thing to do.

380
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,410
But now,

381

Okay.

00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,240
Thanks for this.

388

392
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,348

(The youth is seeking to be comforted from webtoons.)

395
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,990
You wanted to prove your point. So you prepared a lot of data.

396
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,660
It looks like you accurately grasped the needs of our viewers.

397

400
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,940
Did you read the proposals we sent?

401
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,720
Yes. I could see you guys prepared a lot for them.

402
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,318
We're sorry.

403
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,048
We weren't trying to make things more difficult for you.

404
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,289
But it sort of happened this way.

405
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,990
It wasn't hard on me.

406
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,288
I knew that it was important...

407
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,859
for me to do a good job instead of relying on other people.

408
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:25,700
You're right.

410

I'm also subscribed to their channels.

411
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,399
I was surprised to read that.

412
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,440
Really?

413
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,769
That was the list of my subscriptions.

414
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:38,509
We must share the same taste!

415
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,379
No wonder! I could sense your unique, yet trendy vibe...

416
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,380
in your webtoon. I really loved that.

417
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,519
It's a feel-good webtoon for people around our age.

418
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,849
I knew you would sense that.

419
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,490
All right.

420
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,259
You've given it a lot of thought, right?

421
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:13,180
Then can I tell about my decision now?

422
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,650
Well,

423
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:23,420
could I work with Ms. On?

424
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:31,589
Of course.

425
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,630
I do believe...

426
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,769
Ms. On should be handling this.

427
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,269
Thank you.

428
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,309
I gained a lot of experience through you, Mr. Kwon.

429
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,079
And I learned how to center myself.

430
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,420
"The Law of Girls" was well-received...

431

432
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,019
Well, I won't be handling your webtoon.

433
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,130
But please consider the suggestions I made in my proposal.

434
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,789
Then I'll leave you two to talk.

435
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,839
I regretted a lot after giving up on the chance to work with you.

436
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,549
Then you can grab that chance back.

437
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,759
What is it?

438
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,829
Why do you think...

439
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,200
Mr. Kwon wanted to work with me again?

440
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,509
Mr. Kwon probably didn't need me.

441
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,039
He knew it.

442
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,410
That a lot of readers will love your webtoon.

443
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,479
I'm sure every webtoon producer wants...

444
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,420
to work on the webtoon when they see great potential.

445
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,789
By the way, Ms. Goo,

446
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,960
as long as you're okay,

447
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,529
will it be okay if Mr. Kwon and I handle your webtoon together?

448
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,469
Pardon?

449
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,869
I learned a lot from reading Mr. Kwon's proposal.

450
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,009
I mean, he really is a great producer.

451
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,779
I focused on how I could help you make your story more fun...

452
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,609
for the readers.

453
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,049
But Mr. Kwon...

454
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,318
focused on how he could help the webtoon reach more people.

455
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,250
That's the answer he found.

456
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:39,259
To be honest, I was surprised to read his proposal.

457
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,690
I could sense how much he cared about my webtoon.

458
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,500
We need two sides of everything.

459
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,529
Maybe, it's okay for you to have another producer.

460
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,440
Gosh.

461
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,980
What happened?

462
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,150
I lost.

463
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,019
Did I lose to youth?

464
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,048
She was passionate, observant to pick up trends,

465
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,390
and had a good approach.

466
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Her proposal was perfect.

467
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,059
Gosh. What do you say to a drink tonight? It's been a while.

468
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,598
What a surprise.

469
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,759
Right. I wouldn't mind some drinks.

470
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,569
Right. It might be better for you to get drunk tonight.

471
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,838
Why is that?

472
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,308
I'm going to ask you to be the assistant editor.

473
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,278
Come on. That again?

474
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,979
No. Don't ask me that.

475
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,009
Young Bae.

476
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,950
Our position in Neon is pretty good now.

477
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,579
Stop worrying about sales.

478
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,089
Just do everything you couldn't do before because of sales.

479
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,420
I'll let you get off on time too.

480
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,460
With Ji Hyeong gone, you're the only one who can do this.

481
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,258
Whatever. I won't do it.

482
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,099
Make Du Hee do it. I'm not doing it.

483
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
You're liking it.

484
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,038
- What? No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

485
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,469
I'm not smiling about that. I'm smiling about drinks.

486
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,179
- I know you're liking it. - What are you talking about?

487
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,079
Excuse me. Can I talk to Mr. Kwon for a second?

488
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,349
- Should I step out? - No.

489
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,720
Mr. Kwon, are you interested...

490
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,589
in handling Ms. Goo's webtoon with me?

491
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:23,289
- What? - But not like last time.

492
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,930
I want to be happy about the process and the result too.

493
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,430
I know that I can do that if I have your help.

494
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,609
- Do you mean that? - Yes.

495
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:40,640
Gosh.

496
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,309
This is why all my seniors are head over heels for me.

497
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,420
Goodness. I did it again.

498
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,619
What's wrong with her?

499
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,828
What was that? What did she just say?

500
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:57,630
I am head over heels for her.

501
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,130
My gosh.

502
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,140
Ms. Lee, you must be tired. Here, help yourself.

503
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,470
Oh! You're so thoughtful.

504
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,809
Thank you.

505
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,390
You should have one too.

506
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:26,660
- Here. - Thank you.

507
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,359
It's perking me up.

508
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,369
In this scene,

509
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,369
where the male lead tells the female lead about his feelings for her,

510
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,068
how about he gives her a gift?

511
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,609
No, that will make her uncomfortable.

512
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,549
In the love confession videos that are going viral these days,

513
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,319
you always see some kind of gift.

514
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,420
Ma Eum.

515
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,618
Would you be my girlfriend?

516
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,618
Ma Eum.

517
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,858
Would you be my girlfriend?

518
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,858
Let's officially become a couple.

519
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,858
Be my girlfriend. Let's date.

520
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,029
Would you be my girlfriend?

521
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,500
No.

522
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,769
Just something honest and simple would do, don't you think?

523
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,609
Something honest and simple?

524
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,619
I hope it goes well.

525
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,190
- Sorry? - For the male protagonist.

526
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,118
Everyone except for him...

527
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,160
knows that he's so in love.

528
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,259
Yes, you're right.

529
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,200
Do you know what my baby's nickname is?

530
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,539
- What is it? - Dumpling.

531
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,380
Really?

532
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,450
I adore you so much, you know? My dear Dumpling!

533
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,609
My gosh, Han Seul.

534
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,819
But you know, I won't be able to see you as often anymore.

535
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,058
- Why not? - When Mr. Na's company...

536
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,659
is up and running, he'll hire new producers...

537
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,289
Where do you think you're going?

538
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,439
You said you were happy to be the producer for "Princess Kumiho."

539
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,609
Have you already changed your mind?

540
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,279
No! It's not that...

541
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,079
Mr. Na. So can I keep being your producer?

542
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:37,289
Yes. I'll continue to work on "Princess Kumiho."

543
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,890
Of course, I have to work with you.

544
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,490
Mr. Na...

545
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,159
My gosh. I couldn't tell anyone, but I was so sad.

546
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,529
I'm so sad that Mr. Seok is leaving the team.

547
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,940
On top of that, I assumed you'd get a new producer, so I thought...

548
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,240
- You're too tenderhearted. - I was so sad...

549
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,710
Oh, no!

550
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,078
Gosh, my Dumpling is crying.

551
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,079
- Why is she crying? - My poor Dumpling. Don't cry.

552
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:05,919
- It's okay. - My Dumpling.

553
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,848
- My Dumpling... No! This Dumpling. - Gosh, you scared me.

554
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,250
- Did I scare you, baby? - Yes.

555
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,519
- Make Dumpling feel better. - Why are you crying?

556
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,900
- Are you done? - Yes.

557
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,340
Shall we head out together?

558
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,139
Sounds good!

559
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,750
- Let's go. - Okay.

560
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,730
Mr. Seok.

561
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,369
I was incredibly lucky to have you as my first mentor.

562
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,170
That's something you'd say at my farewell party.

563
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,079
I'm not leaving yet. I still have a few days left.

564
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,578
If we get busy,

565
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,949
I probably won't have another chance to tell you.

566
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,159
You know, I'm grateful for so many things.

567
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,360
But I have to say, I'm most grateful for something that happened...

568
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,400
while working on the team.

569
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,670
- What is it? - To tell you the truth,

570
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,739
my injury wasn't the reason I decided to quit judo.

571
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,579
Physically, I had fully recovered.

572
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,750
But emotionally, I was still wallowing in a slump.

573
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,650
Then, I met the team and my teammates.

574
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,090
I feel like working on the team has totally healed me.

575
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,260
I feel the same way.

576
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,460
Since you and Jun Yeong joined the team,

577
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,400
the wounds in my heart have totally healed.

578
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,769
That's why...

579
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,239
That's why you can leave, right?

580
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,699
Go ahead.

581
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,529
No, you go ahead.

582
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,869
I brought my car. Go on. Take this taxi.

583
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,440
So you walked all the way here to hail a taxi for me?

584
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,469
Hop in. He's waiting.

585
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,550
Okay. I'll get going, then.

586
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,519
Get home safely, Mr. Seok.

587
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,519
That moment, I realized...

588
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,090
that I was ready to cross the last threshold.

589
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,150
Excuse me. If Eun Ji is inside, could you tell her to come out?

590
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,559
Sure.

591
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,130

Well...

617
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:12,269
To tell you the truth, my injury wasn't the only reason...

618

I decided to quit judo.

619

Then what else?

620
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,119
There was a match where I had to win by ippon...

621

to avoid the referee's biased judgment.

622
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,590
I had to contend against my dear friend,

whom everyone called my rival.

624
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,570
And to win by ippon,

625
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,440
I targeted her injured ankle, which was her weakness.

Gosh, my mind went blank. I don't really remember much.

631

Then when I snapped out of the daze,

632
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,968
I saw that I was wearing a gold medal.

It was my first time seeing her after that incident.

638

I don't know about that.

00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:46,900
- Dad, the light. - What about it?

659
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,829
Can you make it a tad brighter?

660
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:51,868
- How's this? - Perfect.

661
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:53,069
This tea will protect your throat,

662
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,899
our YouTuber with 500,000 subscribers.

663
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,738
Oh, my. How thoughtful. Thank you.

664
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,539
Have a sip. It'll keep your throat moist.

665
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,349
- Blot your lipstick. - It tastes awful.

666
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:08,280
Hey, you've been recording this for hours. Aren't you tired?

667
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,619
I am tired. I really struggled to do this by myself.

668
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,459
Shall we take a quick break?

669
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,059
Yes, you should eat something and take a break.

670
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,059
My daughter sure takes after me. She has such good concentration.

671
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,169
My goodness. Nu Ri takes after me, from head to toe.

672
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,229
Look, she's so well-spoken. She got that from me.

673
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,170
Come on! Nu Ri is just like me, from her looks to her personality.

674
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,138
Why don't we go ask our neighbors?

675
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,139
That's the funniest thing you've said in a while.

676
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,009
What? It's funny?

677
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,809
I'm like half and half. Half Mom and half Dad.

678
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,150
Dad, if I looked like you, I wouldn't be a beauty YouTuber now.

679
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,750
Hi, everyone!

680
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,690
You all have to read "The Animal Junction."

681
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,459
It's number one in the comic webtoon category,

682
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,230
so maybe you've all read it already.

683
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,928
I knew it. Oh Yoon isn't just a pretty face.

684
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:57,400
Stop watching that. We need to have our meeting.

685
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,169
Hold on. Let me watch it once more. Just once more.

686
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,199
Just once more? How about twice?

687
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,779
Thanks to "The Animal Junction,"

688
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,038
more people are reading "The Beginning of Men" these days.

689
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,079
Really?

690
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,980
I'm glad to hear that people are finally taking an interest in it.

691
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,889
Although it's a little late.

692
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,619
Speaking of which,

693
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,089
why don't we try...

694
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,530
promoting "The Beginning of Men" again through Studio Ginger?

695
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,169
You said I should just give up on "The Beginning of Men."

696
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,400
A producer can never give up on his projects.

697
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:36,710
We just need to find a way to make it draw more interest.

698
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,509
- Excuse me, are you... - That's right. He's Oh Yoon.

699
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,779
- I'm Oh Yoon. - I love "The Animal Junction."

700
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,249
- It's a masterpiece. - Thank you.

701
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,650
Can we get your autograph?

702
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,949
- What is your name? - Lee Kyu Yeon.

703
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,349
Pull it, all the way.

704
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,019
Good. One more time.

705
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,860
All right. Here, like this.

706
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,959
Your butt can touch your heels.

707
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,300
Squeeze your glutes as you get up. Get up.

708
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,530
Straighten your arms.

709
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,499
Careful.

710
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,739
My goodness. Walk slowly.

711
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Mr. Baek.

712
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,340
It's good to see you.

713
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,110
Come here.

714
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,880
- Sit down slowly. - Okay.

715
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,820
I'm good now.

716
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:31,090
The Dragon series is finally coming to an end.

717
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,199
It made me think of you a lot.

718
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,369
Mr. Baek.

719
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,730
You know, your radiant dreams...

720
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,300
were all so precious.

721
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,739
But I couldn't help you protect your dreams.

722
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,849
Mr. Baek, I have a new dream now.

723
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,619
I think it's really nice.

724
00:46:56,449 --> 00:47:00,159
Waking up from a dream doesn't mean you can never have another dream.

725
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,389
Make sure you keep up with your physiotherapy...

726
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:07,460
so you can give courage and hope to everyone who has a dream.

727
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,039
Thanks. I really mean it.

728
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,309
Honestly, I really appreciate it.

729
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,579
I heard Mr. Baek Eo Jin would return to work soon too.

730
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,209
Yes. I think he's only been thinking about his work.

731
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,119
I believe we can expect a masterpiece this time.

732
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,750
You made your team a lot stronger as you had promised.

733
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,860
Isn't that office too small for your team now?

734
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,239
Yes!

735
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,170
(Swoosh)

736
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,009
(Tap)

737
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,639
Well, Ms. Im.

738
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,409
I went through your storyboard,

739
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,920
but your characters don't look catchy enough.

740
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,219
Oh...

741
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,689
Then should I redraw them?

742
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,328
I know it'll be a lot of work, but the outcome is what matters.

743
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:11,929
So could you do that?

744
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:15,099
Of course, I'll extend the deadline for you.

745
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,769
Will that be okay with you?

746
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,670
Yes.

747
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:20,169
Make sure you look after your health.

748
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,499
If you're having problems, you can call me anytime.

749
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,868
Okay. Thank you, sir.

750
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,578
Come on. Just call me Producer Kwon.

751
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:27,579
Okay.

752
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,380
What?

753
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,019
All right, then. I'll let you know when your new deadline is finalized.

754
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,259
I'm sorry I'm late!

755
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,760
Oh, don't worry about it.

756
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,159
Did you manage to meet the deadline for Mr. Na Gang Nam's project?

757
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,030
Yes. I got to see Assistant Editor Seok...

758
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,230
I mean, I saw CEO Seok.

759
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,239
It feels strange to see you guys here.

760
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,809
- Let's get started. My gosh! - Come on in.

761
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:05,909
Hello.

762
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,349
Mr. Sin Dae Lyug? Is that you?

763
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,189
I almost didn't recognize you.

764
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,860
Oh, Ms. On helped me out with this yesterday.

765
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,260
Do I look okay?

766
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:22,699
You look very stylish.

767
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:25,570
I did put this outfit together for you, but...

768
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,440
You are Mr. Sin, right?

769
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,968
Yes, it's me.

770
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,139
You look dashing. So stylish!

771
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:33,739
You all look very nervous.

772
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,179
Relax and just enjoy it.

773
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:40,348
- All right, then... - Relax, everyone!

774
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:43,119
- All right, relax. - You can do it!

775
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,489
Okay, then we'll begin the livestream now.

776
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,219
In 1, 2, 3.

777
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:50,389
(With Webtoon Artists)

778
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,589
Hi, it's Webtoon Witch here.

779
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,329
Today, I'm joined by three popular webtoon artists.

780
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:01,638
Please take turns and introduce yourselves.

781
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:04,139
Okay. Should I look at this camera?

782
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,139
I'm Lee Woo Jin. I wrote "Full Count." Nice to meet you.

783
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,409
Nice to meet you!

784
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,980
I'm Sin Dae Lyug. I wrote "Weapon Feeb."

785
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,420
Hello, everyone.

786
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:21,960
I wrote "Travel Trouble." My name is Goo Seul A.

787
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:27,198
Welcome. The live chat is blowing up already.

788
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,400
My gosh. Someone wrote, "I love 'Weapon Feeb' so much."

789
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,439
Everyone is saying you're all too good-looking to be true.

790
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,670
Literally, everyone is saying that.

791
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,010
They're saying you're so pretty and handsome.

792
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,809
My gosh, thank you.

793
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,710
They have everything, from amazing drawing skills to good looks.

794
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,880
Let's see.

795
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,980
This question caught my attention.

796
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,989
"I want to be a webtoon artist too,"

797
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:55,759
"but I don't know if I have what it takes to be a good webtoon artist."

798
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,630
That's the question.

799
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,000
This person must have a lot on their mind.

800
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,730
Ms. Goo, you just made eye contact with me.

801
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,440
May I ask you to answer this question?

802
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,480
Of course, it won't be easy.

803
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,820
You may struggle to the point that you end up hating webtoons.

804
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:27,659
And seeing your own incompetence might make you fall apart.

805
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:30,929
However,

806
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,828
if there's a story you want to tell through a webtoon,

807
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,530
don't be afraid before you even try it.

808
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,329
If you love it enough to want to pour your heart and soul into it,

809
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,699
your dream will come true.

810
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,840
Let's give her a warm round of applause.

811
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,448
I'm so touched. Your answer warmed my heart.

812
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:54,448
The person who asked the question thanks you.

813
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,889
They wrote that your answer really comforted them.

814
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:01,619
Oh, this is something I wanted to ask you about personally.

815
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,488
You know, you work very closely with webtoon producers.

816
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,459
Do they ever annoy you?

817
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,669
I mean, they can't even draw.

818
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,198
They don't know anything and can't come up with ideas for you.

819
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:14,698
But they act like they know everything.

820
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:15,899
Does that ever annoy you?

821
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,238
- Gosh, no. - It's okay. Don't worry.

822
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,679
It's just us here, you know?

823
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,479
There is a webtoon producer I know personally.

824
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,780
And I must say, she's such a handful.

825
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:32,650
I agree.

826
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,230
I knew it. She's got such a temper, right?

827
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:49,269
Congratulations, Chief Editor Jang Hye Mi.

828
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:53,009
Come on. You're a CEO now.

829
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,139
(CEO Seok Ji Hyeong)

830
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:55,780
A mere chief editor title isn't good enough.

831
00:52:58,179 --> 00:53:01,380
By the way, Ms. Kim Young Sin was involved...

832
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:04,519
in that unsavory scandal recently. Are you going to be okay?

833
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,489
I'll just have to put up with it.

834
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
I can compromise, unlike someone.

835
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,360
Youngtoon is a good company.

836
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,030
Rather than leaving the company because it's not perfect,

837
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:19,699
I'd like to stay in a position that gives me the power to run it well...

838
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,500
while maintaining balance.

839
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,110
That's the Jang Hye Mi I know.

840
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,179
Thanks.

841
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,780
Thanks.

842
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,159
What about Ms. Gi's stuff?

843
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,219
I think she already packed all her things.

844
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:46,229
How could she go on vacation, knowing we were moving today?

845
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,899
Ji Hyeong approved her vacation request before he left the team.

846
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,069
Come on. That's why I'm here to help you guys.

847
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,698
Stop making fun of me, will you?

848
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,569
Are you doing this because I'm no longer on the team?

849
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,010
No, it's because you're working so hard.

850
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:02,839
Oh, Ms. Gi. You're supposed to be on your vacation.

851
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,880
My gosh!

852
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,279
Mr. Choi, I knew you'd be bad-mouthing me,

853
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,118
so I came straight here from the airport.

854
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,150
- Oh! - But it's your vacation.

855
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,059
Well, everyone's here now. Let's get this done quickly.

856
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,289
- Don't forget my lizard. - Okay.

857
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,199
Should we take that down now?

858
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,599
Yes, we should.

859
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,069
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

860
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,170
I'll take it down.

861
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:31,469
Go for it!

862
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,949
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

863
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:40,249
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

864
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,079
A little higher, on the right. Higher.

865
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:43,619
- Better. - Higher.

866
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,920
Is this good?

867
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,659
I said I'd do it. You didn't have to get up there.

868
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,059
Do we really have to put this up on the wall?

869
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,829
It's like a cartoon, you know.

870
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:53,760
A cartoon?

871
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:56,729
When something unrealistic happens,

872
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,869
people say it's like a cartoon.

873
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,000
But in my opinion, what people really mean by that...

874
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:03,268
is something you dream about.

875
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:05,138
(Let's go! To Neon's Head Office!)

876
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:08,238
Going to Neon's head office? That's your dream?

877
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,480
No, what I really want to do...

878
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:14,780
is making sure good webtoons reach a wider audience.

879
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,788
How rewarding would it be? I'm so happy to do it with you guys.

880
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:21,218
- That made me cringe. - Goodness.

881
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:22,819
- What was that? - It made you cringe?

882
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,230
I can't believe you said that.

883
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,099
This is nice.

884
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,698
Look at this, guys!

885
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:34,900
This is like what you see in cartoons!

886
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,710
Hey, what's with you?

887
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,710
Cut me some slack today.

888
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,239
But you're like this every day.

889
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,280
Oh, hold on. What will you do now that your dream has come true?

890
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,749
Who says you can only have one dream?

891
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,619
I already have a new dream.

892
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,820
We're joining the head office as we've become Korea's number one,

893
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,960
so let's aim to become the world's number one.

894
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:02,099
Our goal is to become the world's number one!

895
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,570
That's right, friend. Let's go!

896
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:09,469
Hey! You too?

897
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:12,269
- Let's go. - Okay.

898
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,979
- Can you help me carry this? - Yes, I got it.

899
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,809
Thank you!

900
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:19,380
Let's go.

901
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:39,300
Good riddance!

902
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,469
Are you sure about that?

903
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,969
My gosh. We're finally going to the head office.

904
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,679
Oh, dear. We can finally eat in the cafeteria now.

905
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,908
All that work to cross this street.

906
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,050
There's a gym too.

907
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,150
Oh, Jun Yeong. Remember that day?

908
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:55,280
We came to work together on our first day.

909
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,489
Oh, right.

910
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,519
You thought I was following you.

911
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,789
Right. No, that was...

912
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,928
Hey, why are you carrying two boxes?

913
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:08,130
- Put one on top of this. - Stop. You're doing this again?

914
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,500
Why? Did you think I had a crush on you?

915
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,530
I guess it happens to you often, Jun Yeong.

916
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:16,500
No, I had a crush on you.

917
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:18,440
I'm still waiting for your answer.

918
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,050
Tell me about the On Ma Eum you know. What is she like?

919
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,619
A good person?

920
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,820
And she's the one I like.

921
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,860
I like you.

922
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,469
I can't pinpoint when it began, but it somehow happened.

923
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:54,739
You don't have to give me your answer right away.

924
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,110
I can wait, even if it takes a while.

925
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:13,760
What? My answer? Why...

926
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:25,139
We're all creating our own stories each day.

927
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:30,349
Some days, you feel like you took a wrong turn.

928
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:32,610
(Spend your boring day with Neon Webtoon.)

929
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,050
A few days later, you realize you've managed to turn it into your path.

930
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,019
I'll work twice as hard and do a better job...

931
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,059
to make sure that the team won't be disbanded.

932
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,389
Knowing that they might ditch you next year?

933
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:50,030
Because we can change the future.

934
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,500
And some of us persevere and keep trotting along each day...

935
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,969
even if we falter from time to time...

936
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:03,380
in order to achieve our longtime dreams.

937
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:08,050
(Hope was something that could be protected.)

938
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,699
Sometimes, we have to make a choice at crossroads.

939
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:26,369
Every day, we are creating our own stories...

940
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,739
because life is like a full-length book.

941
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,280
What is she staring at?

942
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,289
Come on, Ma Eum!

943
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,260
Producer On!

944
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:55,159
Just like today's webtoon, where a new story begins every day.

945
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,840
(Today's Webtoon)

946
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,030
(Today's Webtoon)

947
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:23,639
(Please look forward to "One Dollar Lawyer.")
