00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,660
(RAP: PUBLIC)

2
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:23,987
(The last match toward the finals, Crew Battle)

3
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,293
Crew Battle will start now.

4
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:29,363
Let's go!

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,803
(Padi Round: SINCE and DOMMIU versus O'Domar and JOONIE...)

6
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:32,134
(versus JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun)

7
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:38,374
(Padi Round: Block 3's SINCE and DOMMIU)

8
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:41,313
(Girl crush-worthy charms and addictive hook)

9
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:44,414
("BOWWOW" made the crowd cheer.)

10
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:51,094
(Padi Round: Block 6's O'Domar and JOONIE)

11
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:54,624
("Seon" moved the heart with its sincere lyrics.)

12
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,462
(O'Domar and JOONIE showed their teamwork...)

13
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,664
(as the only mixed-gender duo.)

14
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:03,687
(Padi Round: Block 2's JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun)

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,089
(Intense and explosive energy)

16
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:12,367
("Sizzle Sizzle" was made hotter with a feature by ZICO.)

17
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:16,395
(As a result of the 1st voting of the Padi Round, )

18
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:19,367
(the block that won 1st place will be revealed.)

19
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,313
(The result of the 1st voting, Padi Round)

20
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:22,405
- Gosh. - Goodness.

21
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,946
(It makes me nervous again.)

22
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:25,576
(Of course, I want to win.)

23
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:28,675
(We can't go home. Let's advance to the next stage.)

24
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,416
(We'll burn it up...)

25
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:32,747
(and move on to the finals.)

26
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:34,787
(Which block won 1st place in the Padi Round?)

27
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:38,386
(Block 2 wins 1st place in the 1st voting of Padi Round.)

28
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:40,696
(Yes!)

29
00:01:40,697 --> 00:01:42,425
(We have a good chance of taking 1st place.)

30
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,395
(I really want to win.)

31
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,166
(I really want to become the final winner.)

32
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:50,366
(We failed to win 1st place in the Padi Round.)

33
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:54,637
(So I definitely want to win 1st place in other rounds.)

34
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,247
The producer who produced...

35
00:01:57,477 --> 00:02:01,516
the three blocks' songs for this round of Crew Battle is...

36
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:04,516
Who is it?

37
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:09,315
I need a cha-cha beat, boy. Cha Cha Malone.

38
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:13,126
(The producer of Round Two of the Crew Battle, Cha Cha Malone)

39
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:17,267
(He produced multiple albums of Jay Park that became a hit.)

40
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,166
(He made hit songs such as "Joah" and "All I Wanna Do.")

41
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,813
(His music is the classic example of the stylish and trendy sound.)

42
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:24,837
(Star producer, Cha Cha Malone)

43
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,006
A hit song of mine.

44
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:32,845
All I wanna do is kick it with you

45
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,445
He's the one who made it.

46
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:39,446
Three blocks will compete with songs by Producer Cha Cha Malone.

47
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:44,187
The crew that'll give this round's first performance is...

48
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:48,355
Block Three's Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha.

49
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:50,916
(Cha Cha Malone Round: Block 3's Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha)

50
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,766
I'm sure everyone knows.

51
00:02:55,767 --> 00:03:01,106
I think we'll advance with good results.

52
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:04,076
Watch us win and go home.

53
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:08,776
Block Six's Kaogaii, Geegooin, and Kohway.

54
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:11,297
(Cha Cha Malone Round: Block 6's Kaogaii, Geegooin, and Kohway)

55
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,517
Good luck showing what you've prepared.

56
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,255
We need to win this round no matter what.

57
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:21,556
Block Two's ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom.

58
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:24,237
(Cha Cha Malone Round: Block 2's ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom)

59
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,966
Every member of my block has an incredible weapon,

60
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,767
so other blocks should be worried.

61
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,066
Apologies in advance.

62
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,336
(Cha Cha Malone Round: Chaboom, Reddy, and Roh Yun Ha...)

63
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:35,575
(versus Geegooin, Kaogaii, and Kohway...)

64
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,736
(versus ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom)

65
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:40,146
We have an outstanding balance as a team,

66
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:41,375
so watch out.

67
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,385
You don't think that we'll win either, right?

68
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,146
We'll turn things upside down.

69
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:48,217
We'll do it. We'll do it just once.

70
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:52,355
The song has a seriousness message, so the depth will be different.

71
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:56,096
Block Two will be successful, so you can look forward to it.

72
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,927
The crew that'll give this round's first performance is...

73
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:06,906
Block Three's Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha.

74
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,575
- Let's go. - Let's go.

75
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:13,646
They're so reliable.

76
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,616
- They're reliable. Good. - They're so reliable.

77
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:19,715
They prepared a performance with an addictive hook.

78
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:22,116
This crew is Block Three's Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha.

79
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,626
Let's go.

80
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,556
We're making this on our own, so I thought, "I'll do what I want."

81
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:31,025
Then I looked at the block members.

82
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:34,097
I realized that the song will come out well...

83
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:35,866
if I team up with Reddy and Chaboom.

84
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,306
I bet my wrists on the two-syllable name, Chaboom

85
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:40,606
I walk down the only path I fight for my way

86
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:44,075
Like that, I live and feel, I don't remember your face now

87
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,645
I laugh when you're nervous, See me on the stage

88
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,815
All three of us are groovy and bouncy.

89
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:51,015
We rap in a tasteful way.

90
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:53,416
I said, "I want to perform with Reddy and Chaboom."

91
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:56,686
The crews were chosen instantly.

92
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:59,227
I think it took us less than a minute.

93
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:02,796
Deciding on the crews went more smoothly than we expected.

94
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:05,965
We have the idea and hook Chaboom brought.

95
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:09,465
- That's right. - They saved us a lot of time.

96
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:11,065
We got done the day after we received the beat...

97
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,366
in terms of all the recording and the lyrics.

98
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:15,177
- Really? - All of us write the lyrics fast.

99
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:18,847
There was an idea I've had for a while.

100
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,006
It's teabagging.

101
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:22,815
It refers to the motion of sitting and standing...

102
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:26,416
on the fallen enemies in the first-person shooter games.

103
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,815
It's about catching the enemies and dancing on top of them.

104
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:33,326
We'll be like troublemakers, not villains.

105
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,326
(Crew Battle rehearsal)

106
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:39,597
There are many dancers.

107
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:46,306
Raise the glass, We were in the swamp of deathmatches

108
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:49,606
They're in a hurry, We'll have a happy ending anyway

109
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,307
I noticed the dancers first.

110
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,446
They made many preparations. The performance is well-planned.

111
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:59,486
Had I gone into real estate, I would've become a jerk

112
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:03,927
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

113
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:06,656
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

114
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,856
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

115
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:10,942
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

116
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:13,065
The hook was nice. I thought, "This is too strong."

117
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,565
It looked like they were determined to make the audience cheer.

118
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,866
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

119
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:21,976
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

120
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:24,806
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

121
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:28,116
- Teabagging, teabagging - Teabagging, teabagging

122
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:30,445
- Yes. - How nice. It was cool.

123
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,126
- They're strong. - They're strong, right?

124
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,715
It was the perfect performance.

125
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:37,926
The way they performed with the dancers was really nice.

126
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:42,395
Two middle-aged men and the younger member...

127
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:44,966
gave a stylish performance.

128
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:46,177
I became more wary of them.

129
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:49,597
I'm wary of Block Three.

130
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,205
They filled up the stage.

131
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:54,775
They moved in sync as they planned ahead of time.

132
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:56,177
They did well.

133
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:59,575
Our song isn't so heavy.

134
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,746
During our time on RAP: PUBLIC,

135
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:05,815
fun experiences and thoughts piled up.

136
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,956
We wanted to express them in a fun way.

137
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,602
You can't beat someone who enjoys himself.

138
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:13,826
However, we also put in an effort. We'll beat everyone.

139
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:19,696
Chaboom.

140
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:21,996
(The first performance of the Cha Cha Malone round...)

141
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,537
(by Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha)

142
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,477
Gosh, I'm scared.

143
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:31,407
There they go.

144
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:32,747
Let's go.

145
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:33,807
Come on. Let's go.

146
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:38,617
("Teabagging" by Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha)

147
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:40,917
Eight kids on Block Three!

148
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:42,885
Everyone, are you ready?

149
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:44,287
- Yes! - Hey.

150
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:48,626
Raise the glass, We were in the swamp of deathmatches

151
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,166
They're in a hurry

152
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,965
We'll have a happy ending anyway, We're the most relaxed

153
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,635
We colored our path with their blood, It's a red carpet

154
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,005
Our coughs make them fly away like birds

155
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,036
They brag like they're smart

156
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:02,635
But look at the way they act, They're snakes all right

157
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:04,775
Block Three's sniper has appeared for real

158
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,005
If you want to find me, Check the nearby areas

159
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:09,375
Had I gone into real estate, I would've become a jerk

160
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,747
My specialty is sending other blocks home

161
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:14,255
We party and dance, it's teabagging

162
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:16,515
We do it on top of your head, Be happy

163
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:18,786
VIP, ask why every day is an opportunity

164
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:21,125
Three is the magic number like DMC

165
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,496
- Oh, shoot your face - Your face

166
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:24,666
- Take 1st place - Number 1

167
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,796
- Daily basis - Every day

168
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,065
- I'm bulletproof - Pull up in my black beamer

169
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,265
- One blow for you - Winner, winner, chicken dinner

170
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,536
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

171
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,806
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

172
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,636
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

173
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:39,877
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

174
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:44,147
Good night, baby, I'm not done, baby

175
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:46,485
Yes, who's hot, baby?

176
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:48,355
Let's go, go, go, go, Roh Yun Ha, baby

177
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:50,585
Don't make me spark it out, I'm gonna dance on your body like

178
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:52,825
We'll get another holiday because of your blood

179
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,855
We just party, We don't care about the politics

180
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,496
We dozed off all day long and reached the top with rap

181
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,266
I'll give you a rich flow

182
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,995
If you're my dawg, I might not pester you

183
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,266
I can't do what I can't do, Yes, I'm a lil goat

184
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,937
Despite my looks, I have many senoritas

185
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,205
Nothing changes, It has been three years

186
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11,406
When opportunists test the waters

187
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,676
I just cook up every day, My work gets done

188
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,176
Don't hold off on your decision, Even Ahn Sung Jae will drool

189
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:18,315
- Oh, shoot your face - Your face

190
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,445
- Take 1st place - Number 1

191
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:20,585
- Daily basis - Every day

192
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:22,916
- I'm bulletproof - Pull up in my black beamer

193
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,186
- One blow for you - Winner, winner, chicken dinner

194
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,355
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

195
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,725
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

196
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:31,495
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

197
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:34,235
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

198
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,595
I'm balling on earth, I shoot deep three times into space

199
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:38,806
There's a reason why we're on another level

200
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,506
I do the money dance, Do the money dance

201
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:43,437
I ride behind the president G90, shoot the high-beam

202
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:47,975
Light it up, Honey, light it on fire, light it up

203
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:49,715
I do the money dance, Do the money dance

204
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,485
Thanks goodness we're going up, Going up, up, up, up

205
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:53,615
With the legendary aim, bang for the head

206
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,756
My skills are unrivaled

207
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:57,085
I farm and my map becomes the best, I shoot a mad movie

208
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:58,086
- Everyone criticizes me - Here it comes.

209
00:09:58,087 --> 00:09:59,156
Despite the aggravation, I survive until the end

210
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,427
I dance on your body, I eat chicken today as well

211
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,296
Stomp on everything

212
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,526
Take whatever you what

213
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,835
We started in the alley

214
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:10,637
Now, we're on top of your head

215
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:13,136
- Eight kids on the block - Three

216
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,406
- Eight kids on the block - Three

217
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,676
- Eight kids on the block - Three

218
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:20,046
Eight kids on the, hey

219
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,516
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Let's go!

220
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:24,546
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

221
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:26,315
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

222
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:29,215
- Let's go! - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

223
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:31,355
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

224
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,286
- What? - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

225
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,995
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

226
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,365
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Say what?

227
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,695
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Say what?

228
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:42,335
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

229
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:45,205
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

230
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,536
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

231
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:49,735
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - The three of them are like a team.

232
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,646
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

233
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,246
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

234
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:56,546
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

235
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:58,815
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

236
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,686
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

237
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,416
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

238
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:06,286
- Teabagging, go, go - Teabagging, go, go

239
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:08,695
- Teabagging, go, go - Let's go!

240
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:10,965
- Teabagging, go, go - Teabagging, go, go

241
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,166
- Teabagging, go, go - Teabagging, go, go

242
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,465
- Teabagging, go, go - Teabagging, go, go

243
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,735
- Teabagging, go, go - Teabagging, go, go

244
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,006
- Teabagging, go, go - This is wild.

245
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,507
- Teabagging, teabagging - Teabagging, teabagging

246
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,945
Block Three!

247
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:29,147
- Make some noise! - Okay.

248
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,417
We love you.

249
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,246
- Thank you. - Thank you.

250
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:38,186
(You can listen to "Teabagging" on all music streaming services.)

251
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,856
Go!

252
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,796
- Let's do our thing. - We can win.

253
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:44,866
They did well.

254
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,796
Gosh, it was nice.

255
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:49,235
- It was cool. - Yes, it was really cool.

256
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:51,465
It was neat. Nothing was overdone.

257
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,736
- It was cool. It was a cool show. - It was really cool.

258
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:56,735
- Their performance was perfect. - They did so well.

259
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:58,276
- It was perfect. - They did so well.

260
00:11:58,277 --> 00:11:59,406
- Seriously. - They're so reliable.

261
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:00,575
- They're reliable. - How nice.

262
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:04,315
The performance Reddy's crew gave was very solid.

263
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,916
It was impeccable.

264
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,955
It was nice because I could see how relaxed each rapper was.

265
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:10,056
The composition of the song...

266
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:12,855
and the performance on the stage were so well-planned.

267
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:13,926
They were a true team.

268
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:16,095
It's Block Three's characteristic.

269
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:18,865
They don't divide up the verse and go, "This is yours."

270
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,335
"This is mine." Their parts are all mixed up.

271
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,695
The crew that gave a performance of the highest level...

272
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,465
was Reddy, Roh Yun Ha, and Chaboom.

273
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:28,176
They prepared a good performance without any flaws.

274
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:29,735
My eyes and ears weren't bored for a second.

275
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,105
They captivated the audience.

276
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,205
- Say what? - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

277
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,546
- Say what? - Teabagging, tea, teabagging

278
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,546
I'll dance on your body, I'mma do my teabagging

279
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,116
My block is the best. Seriously.

280
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:41,816
Well done.

281
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:46,403
- All 3 of them are satisfied. - All 3 of them are very satisfied.

282
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:48,057
- It was insane. - They did so well.

283
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:51,466
Everyone, the first voting begins.

284
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:54,942
(The 1st round of voting begins for Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha.)

285
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:55,995
Block Three.

286
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:57,766
- Oh, no. Please. - Please.

287
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,335
- Please press it. - Please press it.

288
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,806
- Please press it. - Please press it.

289
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,176
- Please press it. - Please press it.

290
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,177
We don't want to lose.

291
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:05,277
Kaogaii is a jerk.

292
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,147
We'll win.

293
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:08,346
Chaboom is a jerk.

294
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,676
- Five, four, - Five, four...

295
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:13,215
- three, two, one. - Please press it.

296
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:15,216
- I bet they received many votes. - Thank you.

297
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,825
- Thank you. - Thank you.

298
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:19,856
- Yes. - Yes. They did so well.

299
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:21,672
- They did so well. - I'm so proud of them.

300
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:22,696
We can beat them.

301
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,777
- I think we'll win. Seriously. - I think we'll win.

302
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:27,027
My heart is beating so fast.

303
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,166
I met eyes with Chaboom and Yun Ha...

304
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,436
and saw their faces on the stage.

305
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:40,306
The two of them seemed to be having fun as well.

306
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:41,975
I could feel it from the looks and actions...

307
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:44,715
of the block members. "We did well."

308
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:47,085
"We did well. We had good teamwork." I had that thought.

309
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:49,956
I think that song will be like the announcement of our victory.

310
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:55,356
The crew that'll give this round's second performance is...

311
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:02,437
Block Six's Kaogaii, Geegooin, and Kohway.

312
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:08,537
Geegooin.

313
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:11,376
The three of them prepared a performance...

314
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:12,407
that'll make people jump.

315
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,046
Our song is titled "Covered in Sweat."

316
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:18,516
It means that we'll work hard on the stage until we're sweaty...

317
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,386
and party with the audience members.

318
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,356
We worked ourselves into a sweat...

319
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,426
and came this far.

320
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:27,127
We wanted to add a musical message.

321
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,626
Your interpretation of the sweat...

322
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:32,065
- was "Dad's sweat." - That's right.

323
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,866
When I think of the keyword, "Sweat..."

324
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:35,695
- My wife's water broke... - Right.

325
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,336
When I was on my way to work on the song.

326
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,807
I thought, "I could write this song..."

327
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:45,406
"and give a congratulatory message to my daughter."

328
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,245
- It's very meaningful. - How cool.

329
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:49,475
I rapped for many years as a member of Rhythm Power...

330
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:51,345
and persevered until I got this far.

331
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,845
I thought about the meaning of the sweat I shed...

332
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,386
during that time of survival.

333
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,485
My stinky sweat that built up over a long time...

334
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:59,226
turned into my experienced vibe.

335
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:03,225
The crew with Kaogaii, Geegooin, and Kohway...

336
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,166
has the energy that comes from years of experience.

337
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,866
They literally have that spirit.

338
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:11,307
Due to their energy, it'll be hard for other blocks...

339
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:14,137
to break that spirit.

340
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,007
(Crew Battle rehearsal)

341
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,376
There are palm trees.

342
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,376
- It's totally... - It's summer here as well.

343
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,416
You're right.

344
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:24,786
Kohway and Geegooin like performances that are...

345
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:27,956
upbeat and summery. And they're good at them.

346
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:29,786
It's an upbeat song, right?

347
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:30,916
Since there are dancers,

348
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,256
- it must be an upbeat song. - Is that so?

349
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:34,897
I bet he'll use that towel for the dance.

350
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,065
Block Six.

351
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,066
(Block 6's rehearsal is revealed to other blocks.)

352
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,566
My goodness.

353
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,297
Geegooin begins first.

354
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:46,735
Rhythm Power, team play until we D.I.E

355
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,276
- From 3 to 2, we began anew - Anew

356
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,277
It's now

357
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:51,676
- What hasn't come is a finale - A finale

358
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,945
They were much more relaxed than us.

359
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,877
By watching them, I learned...

360
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,715
that I shouldn't be nervous.

361
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,686
I didn't want to pass down the umbilical cord of dirt

362
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:03,056
I didn't want to show her the comments of my criticisms

363
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,325
There was a line by Kaogaii that was really cool.

364
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:08,195
It was like, "I can't pass down the umbilical cord of dirt."

365
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,325
I thought it was clever.

366
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:12,797
How's the weather out there?

367
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,565
- It's hot enough to burn here - It's nice.

368
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,296
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

369
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:19,835
- Say it, covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

370
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:24,676
I was surprised by how nice Kohway's hook was.

371
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,677
- It's nice. - Secret.

372
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:30,296
(Only the voice was revealed for the featured part.)

373
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:31,845
Who is it?

374
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,616
Who is the vocalist?

375
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:35,687
They used a feature.

376
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,486
It must be an idol.

377
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:40,386
It seemed like they had prepared a feature.

378
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:43,095
I can't wait to see their card.

379
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,527
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

380
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,266
- "Covered in Sweat." - My goodness.

381
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:51,306
- Yes. It was nice. - It was nice.

382
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:52,536
- It was nice. - It was like a DJ Khaled song.

383
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:56,036
Their mood was a bit similar but different from ours.

384
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:59,146
They brought a funky song that was fun and summery,

385
00:16:59,147 --> 00:17:00,307
so I became wary.

386
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:03,376
One way to sum up my crew's performance is...

387
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,617
the fighting spirit. Rawness. Energy.

388
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,316
Let's party with the audience.

389
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,785
We'll be covered in sweat.

390
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:11,627
We'll pour out our energy on the stage.

391
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:15,225
(The second performance of the Cha Cha Malone round...)

392
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:16,826
(by Kaogaii, Geegooin, and Kohway)

393
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,857
Let's go.

394
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:19,866
(Kohway's parents)

395
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:20,927
It's starting.

396
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,596
Here it comes.

397
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,597
I wonder what kind of a performance they prepared.

398
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:29,637
What?

399
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:31,106
What's this?

400
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,776
(How's the weather today?)

401
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:34,617
What?

402
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,537
(- I'm covered in sweat already. - Covered in sweat?)

403
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:41,887
("Covered in Sweat")

404
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:47,056
- Please do well. - They'll do well.

405
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:50,955
("Covered in Sweat" by Kaogaii, Geegooin, and Kohway)

406
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:53,427
Block Six! Hey.

407
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:54,996
Let's go!

408
00:17:56,437 --> 00:17:58,805
Rhythm Power, team play until we D.I.E

409
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:01,166
From 3 to 2, we began anew

410
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,576
It's time to wipe the cold sweat on my back

411
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:04,775
It's now

412
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,005
- What hasn't come is a finale - A finale

413
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:08,376
Next scene, Take Three Directed by me

414
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,816
Like a kick in Edward Lee's cooking

415
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:13,146
You can't ignore the sweat that built up for 15 years

416
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:15,485
Even though it stinks, it contains 10,000 hours of work

417
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:18,826
My strength, the growth rings that were made with desperation

418
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,955
No matter what anyone says, I'm on another level

419
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,096
My vibe has the fierceness, I rap like a master

420
00:18:23,097 --> 00:18:25,225
- My verse is like that - Yes, I like that

421
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:27,795
I cut things up, I'm the best, A full-time lover

422
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,166
I get wet like PSY

423
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,606
After I'm done rapping, I say it once more

424
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,936
The audience goes crazy and sweaty

425
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:36,505
Bring the fan because I'm hot now

426
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,535
Kohway!

427
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:39,005
My passion is so hot that I got heat rashes

428
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,045
Put your hands up!

429
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,215
- Short sleeves even in winter - Put your hands up!

430
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:43,316
Them boys going crazy

431
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:45,215
Things are insane, oh, no

432
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:47,515
- I go wild until I'm out of breath - Okay.

433
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:50,086
- I thirst despite all that drinking - Okay.

434
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,356
Give me everything, yes

435
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,525
- Because we're on our way now, hey - Hey.

436
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,827
How's the weather out there?

437
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:59,225
It's hot enough to burn here

438
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:01,437
How's the weather out there?

439
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,867
- It's so nice to watch. - We need ice

440
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,965
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

441
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,436
- Say it, covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

442
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:10,535
- Say it, covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

443
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,975
- Say it, covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

444
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,245
The water broke, You're covered in sweat

445
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:17,916
It's too cold outside now, Honey, why were you hot by yourself?

446
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,146
The shoot got canceled and I got congratulated

447
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:22,887
But it wasn't for me, My daughter, happy birthday

448
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,626
Variety shows, acting, I made money as much as I could

449
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:28,126
When I rapped, I did it properly, and made other rappers shut up

450
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,225
I didn't want to pass down the umbilical cord of dirt

451
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:32,995
I didn't want to show her the comments of my criticisms

452
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,225
No carrot, no freebies

453
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:35,465
- No matter what - Yes, sir.

454
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,735
- I got a nice stroller sponsored - Yes, sir.

455
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:39,765
I told you that I was a zombie, I turn a blind eye to a crisis

456
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:42,606
I run or make a deal if I'm going to fall down

457
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,876
I hated it in childhood, Hating the smell of Dad's sweat

458
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:46,045
- I smoked - He's cool.

459
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,146
I know it now

460
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,646
- What I dripped, it's sweat - Put your hands up.

461
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,816
My life is swipe, swipe

462
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:51,985
- I jumped over the wall - Put your hands up.

463
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:53,886
- Bring the fan because I'm hot now - It's nice.

464
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,255
- Put your hands up! - My passion is so hot

465
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:56,586
That I got heat rashes

466
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:58,255
Short sleeves in winter

467
00:19:58,256 --> 00:20:00,025
- Put your hands up! - Them boys going crazy

468
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:02,055
- Things are insane, oh, no - Okay.

469
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:04,455
- I go wild until I'm out of breath - Okay.

470
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:07,066
- I thirst despite all that drinking - Okay.

471
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,896
- Give me everything, yes - They're cool. This is fun.

472
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:11,436
- Put your hands up in the air! - Because we're on our way now, hey

473
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:13,666
- How's the weather out there? - Out there

474
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,976
- It's hot enough to burn here - Enough to burn

475
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:18,576
- How's the weather out there? - Out there

476
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,005
- We need ice - You know what comes next.

477
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:22,715
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

478
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,985
- Say it, covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

479
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:27,515
- One more time! - Covered in sweat

480
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,955
- What? - Covered in sweat

481
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:31,255
Yuju!

482
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:36,025
Cool wind blows at the end of this path

483
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:40,126
- When sweat runs down my cheek - Yuju of GFRIEND?

484
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,495
Finally, finally, all the way up

485
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:45,066
- Put your hands up like you made it - Everyone.

486
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:48,205
- Can you jump? Okay. - Higher, one more time

487
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,836
- One, two, three. - Hey!

488
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:52,245
- How's the weather out there? - Out there

489
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,606
- It's hot enough to burn here - Enough to burn

490
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,015
- How's the weather out there? - Out there

491
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:59,346
- We need ice - Say what?

492
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:00,945
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

493
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:03,485
- That's right! - Covered in sweat

494
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:05,725
- That's right! - Covered in sweat

495
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,656
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

496
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:11,426
(You can listen to "Covered in Sweat...")

497
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:14,167
(on all music streaming services.)

498
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:17,397
Make some noise!

499
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:23,137
Block Six! Oh, yes!

500
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:26,445
Well done!

501
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,976
You're so cool!

502
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,347
It was hot.

503
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:32,617
- It was a cheer song. - Covered in sweat

504
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,116
- It was nice, right? - It was nice.

505
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:37,785
- They did it. - It was very nice.

506
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:39,586
Block Six's performance...

507
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:42,055
started with messages.

508
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:44,326
I thought it was a unique beginning.

509
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,927
They maximized their strength.

510
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:50,566
It was a cool and fun song that reminded me of summer.

511
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:53,735
It was a song that'd be perfect for a drive during a summer trip.

512
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:54,976
It was really nice.

513
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:58,005
Kohway's ability to make the hook and melody...

514
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:00,305
was exceptional in my opinion.

515
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,476
It was easy on the ears.

516
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,945
I could feel that the audience was flowing with the stage.

517
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:05,746
I heard the group chants,

518
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,192
and I thought this was going to work.

519
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:10,157
It was a performance that made me think...

520
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:11,803
it would have been fun to be among the audience.

521
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:14,157
Let's start the first round of voting.

522
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:16,126
If you liked the performance you just saw,

523
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,765
please vote by pressing the circle button.

524
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,026
The voting begins.

525
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:22,067
Let's go!

526
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,583
(The 1st round of voting begins for Kaogaii, Geegooin, Kohway.)

527
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,976
Chaboom called me a jerk earlier.

528
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,505
That's right. But if you vote for me,

529
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:34,147
I can live as a human!

530
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,976
Let's go.

531
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,117
That guy.

532
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:41,117
He's really good.

533
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:43,256
He's so funny.

534
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:49,157
Five, four, three, two, one.

535
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:53,126
The voting is closed.

536
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:54,603
(The 1st round of voting ends for Kaogaii, Geegooin, Kohway.)

537
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,507
- Did you see that? - We won't go easy on them.

538
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:03,076
It was so much fun. When I made eye contact with the audience,

539
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:06,107
they all looked very happy, and that made me very happy.

540
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,106
All our members did well.

541
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:09,917
So I feel proud and happy.

542
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:12,945
Yuju, who featured for us, did really well.

543
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,363
It was a stage that left no regrets.

544
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:16,887
I think we might win first place.

545
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:20,486
The members that will perform last in this round...

546
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:25,427
are Block Two's ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom.

547
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:34,035
You'll be able to see a new side of ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom.

548
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:36,876
I wonder what they'll show us. You're all excited, aren't you?

549
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,107
- Yes. - Yes.

550
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:42,817
It's Block Two's stage. Let's go!

551
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:50,285
I'm on a team with Foggyatthebottom.

552
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:52,586
We both lived abroad,

553
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:54,887
so we had a clear message we wanted to deliver.

554
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:57,326
The crew was decided quite easily.

555
00:23:57,327 --> 00:24:00,265
It was an easy decision for Foggyatthebottom and me.

556
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,695
Right. What you two wanted to say...

557
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,795
- Was similar. - There was a common story.

558
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:06,366
- Right. - So it was easy.

559
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,207
- Our intentions were similar. - That's right.

560
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,077
You both lived abroad.

561
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:12,806
I cried after listening to their song.

562
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:14,475
- Goodness. - Darn.

563
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,677
- Your ears seem very open. - Tears rolled down.

564
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:20,046
- The lyrics were really touching. - That's right.

565
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:24,285
What ShyboiiTobii and I wanted...

566
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:26,157
was that we wanted the song to be sincere.

567
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:27,827
We wanted to tell our story.

568
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:31,256
So we tried to write truthful lines.

569
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:35,096
I put in all the emotions I felt...

570
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:37,036
while living abroad.

571
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:39,366
And naturally,

572
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,607
I wrote about my mom too.

573
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:46,406
Living in the US when I was young was hard.

574
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:48,176
Since we weren't financially well-off,

575
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,275
my mother was always busy working.

576
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:51,617
She suffered a lot.

577
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,545
I still can't forget...

578
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:56,087
how much she suffered.

579
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:58,086
We talked about all that...

580
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,256
in the lyrics of "Truth Hurts."

581
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:04,255
We wanted the message...

582
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,026
to be delivered to our beloved moms.

583
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:09,496
I wanted to show her that her son was doing well.

584
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:14,566
We'll go to the third one.

585
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,336
- Please go to your positions. - Okay.

586
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:19,017
(Block 2's stage was revealed for the first time at the rehearsal.)

587
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:21,246
They're going to appear like that too.

588
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,616
- I'm most excited about this stage. - I know.

589
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:26,117
- I'm curious about what they did. - I know.

590
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:30,015
They have the American style.

591
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:31,955
I thought they'd do something very amazing.

592
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:33,386
So I kept them in check.

593
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:35,156
They were a strong team.

594
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:38,025
I couldn't imagine...

595
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:39,666
what they would show us on their stage.

596
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,383
So I thought it was doable.

597
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,224
One. Music start.

598
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:47,536
It's raining.

599
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,077
- It has a great ambiance. - It's nice.

600
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,706
Goodness.

601
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:57,246
This is nice.

602
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:02,116
Messed up plenty times, Went too far, can't press rewind

603
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,856
Sick of seeing my mom cry

604
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:05,656
An unforgettable trauma

605
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:07,985
The memories keep disappearing

606
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:11,326
I just want to go home

607
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:14,127
To the arms of my mom who I missed so much

608
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:18,666
I enter the rain to hide the tears

609
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,436
I honestly didn't want to see the American ladies

610
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:23,475
The style of the song was completely different from ours.

611
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:25,346
It was new.

612
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:28,576
So I thought ShyboiiTobii would be acing on the stage.

613
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,376
Finally, the ShyboiiTobii...

614
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:33,516
that we and the people knew was there. I was worried.

615
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:35,616
I honestly didn't want to see the American ladies

616
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:38,215
My mother used to bend down to clean their toenails

617
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,687
She lived as a bug, A life that was trampled on

618
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:42,795
The dark path I light it up with my Cuban

619
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:45,465
The password for the free school lunch

620
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:47,225
How would I forget that?

621
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,566
I just want to go home

622
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,567
It's sad.

623
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,305
- It's so cool. - It's nice.

624
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:57,137
Foggyatthebottom is so cool.

625
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,846
I really liked Foggyatthebottom's rap.

626
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:02,245
He was very appealing...

627
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,775
when he rapped with truthful lyrics.

628
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,846
But we listened to it...

629
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,487
while reading the words that were behind.

630
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:09,956
That hit my heart.

631
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:11,686
There's anger in the lyrics.

632
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,157
There's anger in the lyrics.

633
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,326
It's nice that they show the lyrics.

634
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:16,456
- It's nice. - It's nice.

635
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:17,956
Clean.

636
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:21,796
Was it okay?

637
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:23,566
It was so good.

638
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:24,965
- It's cool. - You can leave...

639
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,413
- from the front of the stage. - The free school lunch!

640
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,006
They're all good. This is so hard.

641
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:30,337
Are you okay?

642
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:33,606
After I watched ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom's rehearsal stage,

643
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:34,776
I thought I was too rash.

644
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:36,817
I felt touched while watching them.

645
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:40,146
That was the strategy. We wanted to make a song...

646
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:42,886
that people could focus and feel the emotions.

647
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,527
We wanted to show them a different color.

648
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:46,927
We also have a strong weapon too.

649
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,995
This person came all the way...

650
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:50,157
to help us.

651
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:53,866
If I said I didn't have money, That would be a lie

652
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,735
The friend who helped us is young,

653
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:59,936
but he's someone who shows romance itself.

654
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:01,736
You'll be surprised.

655
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,637
You can look forward to it.

656
00:28:04,907 --> 00:28:08,006
I just want to do what we prepared and without regret.

657
00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:09,775
I want it to become a song...

658
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,776
that people remember when they're going back home.

659
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:14,545
One, two, three. Boom.

660
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:15,786
We came here to see this.

661
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:20,657
(The third stage is by ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom.)

662
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,225
I'm really looking forward to this.

663
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,826
It's Block Two now.

664
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,866
- I'm really excited about this. - I'm really excited.

665
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,566
I heard rumors that their stage is good.

666
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:29,496
I think this will be a strong one.

667
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:31,136
I think it will be really powerful.

668
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:34,836
They've never dealt with this kind of topic.

669
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:35,936
I'm so curious.

670
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:38,805
The stage is very different from the first two.

671
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:39,847
I think they will do well.

672
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:42,416
- It's already sad. - It's already sad.

673
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:43,546
- We know it. - It's sad.

674
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:46,046
Two members of our block that we're proud of.

675
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:47,986
Let's show them. Let's get it.

676
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,216
Let's go, Block Two.

677
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:53,927
(How will ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom's stage be?)

678
00:28:55,956 --> 00:28:57,856
(ShyboiiTobii's mother)

679
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:58,867
Let's go.

680
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,596
("Truth Hurts" by ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom)

681
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:02,837
You talk

682
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:12,077
Since the jump, Pain came through with money

683
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,006
Full cup muddy

684
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:20,486
Don't worry, Mom

685
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:22,786
Your son crawled all the way here

686
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:25,586
Fog everywhere, get popping

687
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:28,255
Even if I come to the other side of the world, I paralyze the crossroads

688
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,196
You know I get that moved

689
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,466
People choose what's real

690
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:38,236
Still missing my love, Yes, sir

691
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,366
Messed up plenty times

692
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,406
Went too far, can't press rewind

693
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,975
Sick of seeing my mom cry

694
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,805
An unforgettable trauma

695
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:49,376
The memories keep disappearing

696
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:52,186
I just want to go home

697
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:55,286
To the arms of my mom who I missed so much

698
00:29:57,556 --> 00:30:00,356
I enter the rain to hide the tears

699
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:02,396
I honestly didn't want to see the American ladies

700
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:04,995
My mother used to bend down to clean their toenails

701
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:07,666
She lived as a bug, A life that was trampled on

702
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,195
The dark path I light it up with my Cuban

703
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:12,265
I'm just reminiscing

704
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:14,765
My kitchen that I serve in the streets

705
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:17,305
My necklace, All the way to the North Pole

706
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:19,577
The broken relationships, It's my fault

707
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:21,745
Breakfast, too, I got at the courtyard

708
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,975
Made a quarter million dollars down the gallows road

709
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:26,745
Today's work is to bag it up, scale it out, and drop it off

710
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:29,485
I roll on the ground a few times thanks to the diligent civil servant

711
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,086
But people call them, he's the guy

712
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:36,097
I still remember 1546730

713
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:39,225
The password for the free school lunch

714
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,126
How would I forget that?

715
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,897
I just want to go home

716
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,735
I just want to go home

717
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:49,877
To the arms of my mom who I missed so much

718
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:55,106
I enter the rain to hide the tears

719
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:57,275
If I said I didn't have money, That would be a lie

720
00:30:57,276 --> 00:30:59,785
But there's no reason to be happy

721
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:01,646
If I didn't lie that I was happy

722
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:04,356
I wouldn't have anyone next to me

723
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:05,626
BIG Naughty.

724
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:07,755
People meet people they love

725
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:10,225
I always stick to one thing, Poverty I never experienced

726
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,725
That's why I know how beautiful Seoul is from above

727
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:15,566
I saw it so I will go in search of somewhere higher

728
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,265
Don't get me wrong, When I talk about romance

729
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,866
It's not that it doesn't need money

730
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:23,406
I don't care what follows it

731
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:25,975
So don't talk to me when I make money

732
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:28,545
Man quit all your thinking and all your talking

733
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:31,116
Without all your teaching, I'm already snitching

734
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:32,816
Dom Perry and Perrier Jouet

735
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:36,186
I'm sipping and sipping, But until last night I was

736
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:39,886
Messed up plenty times, went too far Can't press rewind

737
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,455
Sick of seeing my mom cry

738
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,396
An unforgettable trauma

739
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:45,765
The memories keep disappearing

740
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:48,836
- I just want to go home - I just want to go home

741
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:51,897
To the arms of my mom who I missed so much

742
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,136
I enter the rain to hide the tears

743
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:57,636
The recorded version will be really good.

744
00:31:57,637 --> 00:32:00,245
I won the Rookie of the Year award without a graduation certificate

745
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:02,745
Handcuffs around my wrist instead of a luxury watch

746
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:05,275
Feel so high, the view is good here

747
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:07,886
My mom doesn't even know if I'm alive

748
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:10,386
How many times, how many times

749
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,985
Do I have to make mistakes to realize what I've done?

750
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:15,386
Time goes too fast, Please wait for a moment

751
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:18,326
Time still

752
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,566
("Truth Hurts" by ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom is available...)

753
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,666
(on all music platforms.)

754
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,766
I love you, Mom!

755
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:30,776
Awesome!

756
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,577
I love you too, everyone!

757
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:37,546
Foggyatthebottom!

758
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,417
- That was cool. - That was cool.

759
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,055
This one sticks for a long time.

760
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,856
I didn't think they'd do something like this.

761
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,485
- ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom. - I know.

762
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:50,156
- They did something cool. - Seriously.

763
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:52,056
- It was the best stage. - It was the coolest.

764
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,306
- It was so cool. - It's touching.

765
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,706
It was cool. Block Two.

766
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,336
To put it into one word, it was moving.

767
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:08,205
In particular, I could relate...

768
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:09,975
to the lyrics of Foggyatthebottom.

769
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:11,775
ShyboiiTobii sang the melody.

770
00:33:11,776 --> 00:33:13,917
That was very cool.

771
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:16,455
It gave me goosebumps.

772
00:33:16,456 --> 00:33:19,955
ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom put their life into it.

773
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:24,156
I could feel the emotions that they were trying to deliver.

774
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:26,765
I was comforted.

775
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:29,366
It was moving, and I was teary.

776
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:33,407
We think ShyboiiTobii and Foggyatthebottom will win.

777
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:35,306
We will begin the voting.

778
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:38,386
(The 1st round of voting begins for ShyboiiTobii and Foggyattthebottom.)

779
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:45,916
I think that performance will be our competition.

780
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,386
- Right. - Me too.

781
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:50,116
The immersion they showed in this stage.

782
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,785
It really was a touching stage.

783
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:54,927
It was the most touching stage I've seen on TV.

784
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:59,597
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

785
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,465
(The 1st round of voting ends for ShyboiiTobii and Foggyattthebottom.)

786
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:06,205
The more I get to know ShyboiiTobii, I realize he's a great musician.

787
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:08,066
So I don't worry about him.

788
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,405
The depth of the lyrics was so different.

789
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:12,675
Out of everyone,

790
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,705
his lyrics were the best. His mood was the best.

791
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:16,116
I don't think we'd lose.

792
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:20,016
This round of the Crew Battle ended.

793
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:25,955
- Well done. - It was so cool.

794
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:27,785
All three blocks were so cool.

795
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:30,526
We have the second round of voting left now.

796
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,566
We'll invite all the three crews to the stage.

797
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:34,595
Let's go.

798
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:35,866
(Block 3, Block 6, Block 2)

799
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,476
They're cool.

800
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:50,316
- Our block is cool. - Right.

801
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:52,317
That aura is impossible.

802
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:56,386
- They're avoiding eye contact. - Why?

803
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:58,217
Where is your mother?

804
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:01,127
Say hello.

805
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,896
(Thumbs up)

806
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:07,167
We will begin the second round of voting.

807
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:09,236
(The 2nd round of voting begins for the Cha Cha Malone round.)

808
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:10,397
You have to press three.

809
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,135
- Number six! - No.

810
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:13,136
Sweating!

811
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:16,777
- Block 3. - Block 3.

812
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:24,576
We have to win.

813
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,526
- Six, five, four, - Six, five, four,

814
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,186
- three, two, one. - three, two, one.

815
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:37,587
(The 2nd round of voting for the Cha Cha Malone round ends.)

816
00:35:39,397 --> 00:35:40,426
Nice.

817
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,297
- They were all awesome. - Seriously.

818
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,035
The final result will be revealed in a moment.

819
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:46,266
- Thank you. - Thank you.

820
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:50,206
(What will be the results of the Cha Cha Malone round?)

821
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:51,877
Well done, everyone.

822
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,776
We told ourselves...

823
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,376
to have fun on the stage.

824
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:57,776
But people liked it too.

825
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:00,447
It went really well as we planned.

826
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:03,155
They came with a very fun...

827
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,785
and summer-style funky song. It was a bit similar to ours.

828
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:08,586
I think they brought out the strength of everyone.

829
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,226
But we won't lose.

830
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,166
I saw my mom after a long time.

831
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:17,035
Showing her this stage in front of many people...

832
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:19,305
where I was competing with many awesome rappers...

833
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,806
made me feel proud.

834
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:25,236
He was almost screaming and rapped a very appealing rap.

835
00:36:25,237 --> 00:36:26,646
They stuck in my heart.

836
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:27,906
I thought...

837
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:30,716
we wouldn't be that disadvantaged.

838
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,546
It's time we win. Yes, sir.

839
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:35,146
- Teabagging, tea, teabagging - Let's go!

840
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:38,055
All the people there were crazy.

841
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:41,256
It was a new and fun experience.

842
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:43,072
I think the number of the first round of votes will be high.

843
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:44,556
They really prepared a lot.

844
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:45,966
It would be a fierce competition.

845
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,127
It was really good.

846
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:49,495
It was very stylish.

847
00:36:49,496 --> 00:36:50,535
But what's certain is,

848
00:36:50,536 --> 00:36:53,636
it didn't feel like we were going to lose.

849
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,176
I'm nervous.

850
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:02,976
I will announce the block who won first place in the first round...

851
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:05,786
of voting for the Cha Cha Malone Producer Round.

852
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:07,616
Please.

853
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:10,507
Since it's our team, I'm getting nervous when it's not me there.

854
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:11,656
I'm nervous.

855
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:19,326
As a result of the first round of voting,

856
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,729
I think we had a good audience response.

857
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,453
The block that won first place...

858
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:26,967
We have to win this no matter what.

859
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:31,176
I'm the leader of Block Two. I should be confident.

860
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:33,076
Block Two.

861
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:36,345
(The results of the 1st round of voting)

862
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:37,547
I can't watch it.

863
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,656
It's Block Three.

864
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,663
(Block 3 won 1st place on the 1st round of voting.)

865
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:47,857
Goodness.

866
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,265
- You really can't predict this. - Seriously.

867
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:58,765
Fortunately, we had good results in the first round of voting.

868
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:02,905
I feel glad about that.

869
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,476
It's a relief. Thank you.

870
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:15,115
The moment we hugged, I got emotional.

871
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:17,515
We had fun, and I was happy.

872
00:38:17,516 --> 00:38:18,756
And we had a good result too.

873
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,156
It's perfect.

874
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:23,356
It made me have hope.

875
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:24,825
I thought,

876
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:27,127
"Perhaps we might be able to win."

877
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,667
It made me more nervous than I thought I'd be.

878
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:31,837
I don't know how it will go.

879
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:34,966
Now, are you ready...

880
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,606
to enjoy the final round?

881
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,405
- Yes! - Yes!

882
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:39,806
In this round of the Crew Battle,

883
00:38:40,076 --> 00:38:43,147
this producer produced the songs of the three blocks. It's...

884
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:47,245
Hukky.

885
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:50,687
(The producer of the third round is Hukky Shibaseki.)

886
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:54,487
(He produced all the songs in E Sens' 3rd album "Jeogeumtong.")

887
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:55,955
(Won Best Rap and Hip Hop Song Award...)

888
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:58,226
(in the 21st Korean Popular Music Awards)

889
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:01,697
(Producer Hukky Shibaseki with an unrivaled presence in hip-hop scene)

890
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,995
He's the producer who made the song that won...

891
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:06,736
Best Rap and Hip Hop Song Award in 21st Korean Popular Music Awards.

892
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:10,106
Three blocks will be competing with his songs.

893
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:12,575
The crew that will perform in the first stage of this round...

894
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:15,777
(The first crews that will perform are revealed.)

895
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:20,345
is Block Six's Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il.

896
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:22,186
(Block 6's Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il)

897
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:24,257
- Gosh. - Jo Gwang Il.

898
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:27,986
Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il have come together.

899
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:29,825
We three are enough.

900
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,496
The crew that will perform the second stage in this round...

901
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:36,095
are Block Two's Loopy, OSUN, and JP.

902
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:39,636
(Block 2's Loopy, OSUN, and JP)

903
00:39:40,237 --> 00:39:41,406
That's nice.

904
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:43,776
It's time Block Two wins.

905
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:46,905
Someone has to be eliminated today.

906
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:49,076
That person can pack their bags and go home.

907
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:51,947
The crew that will perform the last stage in this round...

908
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:55,955
is Block Three's HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An.

909
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:58,016
(Block 3's HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An)

910
00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:02,425
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have ambition.

911
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:03,726
Let's compete in good faith.

912
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:04,897
Let's enjoy this.

913
00:40:04,956 --> 00:40:08,697
(Hukky Shibaseki Round: Block 6, Block 2, Block 3)

914
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:10,535
I always told myself to do well as I have always done.

915
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:11,797
But this time,

916
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,236
I really want to do well and advance to the next step.

917
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,736
I trust that our team...

918
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:19,345
will perform better than we prepared.

919
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:20,946
It's my wish and prediction.

920
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,147
I think we'll win first place.

921
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:25,346
The crew that will perform first in this round...

922
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,987
is Block Six's Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il.

923
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,956
Let's go!

924
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:41,396
(Block 6's leader cheers for them by stamping his feet.)

925
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:44,936
The stage created by the rap machines of Block Six.

926
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:48,567
Let's go!

927
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,675
What can Hash Swan, Jo Gwang Il, and I...

928
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:53,776
show you in terms of rap?

929
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:54,782
We'll show you everything.

930
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:56,615
The title is "Saturation."

931
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:58,416
It means there are too many people in this scene.

932
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,845
It's too saturated.

933
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:01,646
We're trying to control that.

934
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:04,455
We'll reduce the number to half. That's the story.

935
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:07,425
That fits RAP: PUBLIC well too.

936
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:08,986
We started as 60 people,

937
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:10,825
- and the number kept reducing. - That's right.

938
00:41:10,826 --> 00:41:11,826
That's right.

939
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:14,696
- We're here, - Right.

940
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:16,035
- and we survived. - Right.

941
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,967
But there are still too many people.

942
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:21,366
We will keep reducing that number.

943
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,437
- Good. - That's cool.

944
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:24,405
For the Hukky Round,

945
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:26,245
I think our block is the strongest.

946
00:41:26,246 --> 00:41:27,845
Hush Swan, Jo Gwang Il, and Mckdaddy.

947
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:30,776
The harmony of their voices is very good.

948
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:31,777
I had no worries.

949
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:33,947
(Crew Battle rehearsal)

950
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,885
Block Six showed us proper rap...

951
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,426
with powerful energy.

952
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,087
I think they'll perform a strong rap.

953
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:43,096
It has a war vibe.

954
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:46,066
- They wore the suits? - When you stand here...

955
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:47,067
That's smart.

956
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:48,167
- Right. - This side.

957
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:49,536
Gosh, it's a flag.

958
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:51,946
- They prepared a lot. - That's Hash Swan.

959
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:55,405
We made the dancers wear...

960
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:58,406
the clothes and mask we wore during Mask Off.

961
00:41:59,076 --> 00:42:01,205
We wanted it to look like a riot.

962
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:03,075
We used the flags...

963
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:05,316
to make us look like rioters...

964
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,386
or the rebellion.

965
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:12,555
Warrior's anthem, I look for my enemies

966
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,056
It's like getting holiday cash

967
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:16,595
I still do my action without a body double

968
00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:17,956
It's too late to regret now

969
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:20,095
Swan, yes, it's stagnant

970
00:42:20,096 --> 00:42:22,026
It's contaminated and messed up, yes

971
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:24,035
Even the light is dark, yes,

972
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:26,036
There are holograms of supporting characters, yes

973
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,035
There's a long way to paradise

974
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:29,975
Why am I talking about paradise? I have a long way to go too

975
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:32,236
Okay, mumble rap began, and Auto-Tune took away the vocals

976
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:34,205
My artistry succeeded because they're a disappointment

977
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:35,506
I gave the middle finger to drug offers

978
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,046
Breaking them off into participles, I'm climbing up for my career

979
00:42:37,047 --> 00:42:38,547
In the end, it's all about money

980
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:40,986
Filter out half with drugs, drive them to the cliff, hold up

981
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:42,016
How does he do that?

982
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:46,925
- Everyone, make haste - Everyone, make haste

983
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:50,996
- Everyone, make haste - Everyone, make haste

984
00:42:51,397 --> 00:42:53,396
- Pop, make haste - Make haste

985
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:55,325
- Run away hastily - Hastily

986
00:42:55,326 --> 00:42:58,765
- Pop, make haste, racks on hastily - Racks on hastily

987
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:03,076
- Everyone, make haste - Everyone, make haste

988
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:07,877
They're all rap monsters too.

989
00:43:08,147 --> 00:43:12,146
They thoroughly prepared to fill the stage.

990
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:15,745
It felt like their best three members had joined.

991
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:18,357
I thought it wouldn't be easy.

992
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:20,626
Every rapper...

993
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,856
received a spotlight...

994
00:43:22,857 --> 00:43:24,455
and had a big impact.

995
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:27,026
And there was a harmony between the three.

996
00:43:27,027 --> 00:43:31,136
It was very complete and very energetic.

997
00:43:31,797 --> 00:43:34,506
We will win, and we want to win.

998
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:36,906
That's our goal.

999
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:39,006
We three gathered...

1000
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,745
to send the other crews home.

1001
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:42,507
That's our only goal.

1002
00:43:43,047 --> 00:43:44,246
So we'll show that to you.

1003
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:46,946
(Crew Battle, Hukky Shibaseki Round)

1004
00:43:46,947 --> 00:43:50,386
(First stage by Mckdaddy, Hash Swan Jo Gwang Il)

1005
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:52,486
I'm looking forward to their stage too.

1006
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:53,586
I'm really curious.

1007
00:43:53,587 --> 00:43:55,486
They're the ace members of Block Six.

1008
00:43:55,487 --> 00:43:56,955
- They're... - They're powerful.

1009
00:43:56,956 --> 00:43:58,257
They're powerful.

1010
00:43:58,496 --> 00:43:59,496
They're strong.

1011
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:05,897
("Saturation" by Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il)

1012
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:10,107
There they are.

1013
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:16,615
Talk to me nice

1014
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:18,646
Talk to me nice

1015
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:20,885
Warrior's anthem, I look for my enemies

1016
00:44:20,886 --> 00:44:23,086
It's like getting holiday cash

1017
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:25,115
I either run at full speed or lie down

1018
00:44:25,116 --> 00:44:27,126
Tracks make my blood pump

1019
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:29,086
I don't adjust my pace

1020
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:31,026
What I need to adjust is the number of the people

1021
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,626
I'm crushing those beats in a matching top and bottom outfit

1022
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:34,865
Blood on my fit

1023
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,336
- He's pretty cool. - I always get back up

1024
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:38,166
I'm still hungry, you pretend to be evil

1025
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,006
But who's really the evil one? Daddy

1026
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:42,135
You can get all worked up and foam at the mouth

1027
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:44,075
But I'm still better than you even if you're my senior

1028
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:45,905
You be an extra, the same block is on my side

1029
00:44:45,906 --> 00:44:47,946
You can just get out and watch

1030
00:44:47,947 --> 00:44:49,546
I still do my action without a body double

1031
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:51,147
It's too late to regret now

1032
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:52,546
Coming with the flames

1033
00:44:52,547 --> 00:44:54,546
It doesn't go like the script, overdosing on anger

1034
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,555
What time is the appointment? It's about time

1035
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:58,316
I've been waiting, and shooters come

1036
00:44:58,317 --> 00:45:00,385
Living with no escape

1037
00:45:00,386 --> 00:45:02,285
- No freedom, reason, or composure - My gosh.

1038
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:06,365
Red is about to be the color of this place

1039
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:09,667
Saturated population, hashtag fire

1040
00:45:10,337 --> 00:45:13,766
I don't believe in your dream, murder your breath

1041
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:15,766
Saturated population

1042
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:18,376
- Saturated population - They're doing well. Nice.

1043
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:20,276
Should I blow up all of their heads?

1044
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:22,345
If you're hiding there, you'd better hide well

1045
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:24,975
One, two, three, pop, make haste

1046
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:28,186
Pop, make haste, let's go

1047
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:30,316
Racks on hastily

1048
00:45:30,317 --> 00:45:34,356
Everyone, make haste

1049
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:38,526
Everyone, make haste

1050
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,995
Swan, yes, it's stagnant

1051
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:43,166
It's contaminated and messed up, yes

1052
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,135
Even the light is dark, yes,

1053
00:45:45,136 --> 00:45:47,106
There are holograms of supporting characters, yes

1054
00:45:47,107 --> 00:45:49,066
There's a long way to paradise

1055
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:51,075
Why am I talking about paradise? I have a long way to go too

1056
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:55,276
The Colosseum in ruins, I want Edward's automail arm, yes

1057
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:57,276
I won't go back to the basement in Mangwon

1058
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:59,277
No more aired clips on my channel

1059
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,346
- Adidas to Balenciaga - He's so laid-back.

1060
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:03,086
Cigars from Argentina

1061
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:05,356
Sorry, I'll avoid the middle of your forehead like a gentleman

1062
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:07,257
I can't trust those jerks

1063
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:09,285
Stop pretending to be perfect

1064
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:11,055
What's perfect is the unfurnished Mona Lisa

1065
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:13,396
People who avoided responsibility are doomed

1066
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,796
How beautiful is that? Everyone, cheers

1067
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:17,796
I say no thanks to your sweet smile

1068
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:19,635
Flame it up, and make me laugh

1069
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:23,075
I don't care about art, forget it, a scene from the phantasmagoria

1070
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:25,106
- I spit out sea fog - I spit out sea fog

1071
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:26,946
- I'll do sword dance in the middle - I'll do sword dance in the middle

1072
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:29,006
Okay, mumble rap began, and Auto-Tune took away the vocals

1073
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:31,075
My artistry succeeded because they're a disappointment

1074
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:32,745
Everyone copies my flow and tone, these copycats are trending

1075
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,115
But if anyone makes it big with this style of rap

1076
00:46:34,116 --> 00:46:35,446
He probably copied off me, right?

1077
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:36,615
It is saturated here

1078
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:38,486
- His rap is fast today as always. - I'm far from lip-syncing rappers

1079
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:39,825
And I'm diligent too

1080
00:46:39,826 --> 00:46:41,155
I gave the middle finger to drug offers

1081
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:42,885
Breaking them off into participles, I'm climbing up for my career

1082
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:44,626
In the end, it's all about money

1083
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:46,595
Filter out half with drugs, drive them to the cliff, hold up

1084
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,225
- Like my lyrics, too many rappers - It must be faster.

1085
00:46:48,226 --> 00:46:49,796
I'll rap slowly now, so disappear with my lyrics

1086
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:51,365
- How's that? - How's that?

1087
00:46:51,366 --> 00:46:53,336
Please stop talking with your fake energy

1088
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:55,236
You got lucky and made it far, but too bad

1089
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:56,535
No cap, you went on and on

1090
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:59,507
About how bad of a rapper I was, but your tongue is pretty dry

1091
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:01,705
- For the funeral photo, say cheese - Cheese

1092
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:03,646
- Everyone's sin will be see-through - See-through

1093
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:04,647
You nobles set

1094
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:05,647
- The standards - The standards

1095
00:47:05,648 --> 00:47:07,146
Yes, I had no idea

1096
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:09,015
But I've been here for a few years and looked under the red carpet

1097
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:11,086
I see a crowd of greedy pigs in a dark corner

1098
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:12,986
Guys, no one who took a shot at me was a real deal

1099
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:15,526
Other than kitsyojii who tried to bring me down

1100
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:18,870
Slay, then we're going to put up the flag

1101
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,765
I'm going to bury those jerks who have been copying me

1102
00:47:22,766 --> 00:47:24,595
Bury them all, make a grave with their names on it

1103
00:47:24,596 --> 00:47:26,506
By the time you catch a break and come out, you'll be in your 40s

1104
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:28,436
I'll return and smack you with a shovel, and you'll be in a coma

1105
00:47:28,437 --> 00:47:31,276
I'll throw you back into the hole and cover you up with the soil

1106
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:33,006
Even if you hide, I'll find you, how cruel, blur that thing

1107
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:35,006
Even if you run away, it will be in slow motion

1108
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:38,876
It'll come with some foul language, keep halving the population

1109
00:47:38,877 --> 00:47:40,586
I dash back to my spot after burying them all

1110
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:42,745
The only thing I don't need is a sense of guilt

1111
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:44,955
Everyone seems to rap fast, but they all slur

1112
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:46,256
My pronunciation is on another level

1113
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:49,797
- Saturated population, hashtag fire - Hashtag fire

1114
00:47:50,357 --> 00:47:52,256
I don't believe in your dream

1115
00:47:52,257 --> 00:47:54,396
- Murder your breath - Murder your breath

1116
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:56,436
- Saturated population - Saturated population

1117
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:58,436
- Saturated population - Saturated population

1118
00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:00,365
Should I blow up all of their heads?

1119
00:48:00,366 --> 00:48:02,265
If you're hiding there, you'd better hide well

1120
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:05,075
- One, two, three, pop, make haste - Make haste

1121
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:06,575
- Run away hastily - Run away hastily

1122
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:08,006
- Pop, make haste - Pop, make haste

1123
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:10,316
- Racks on hastily - Racks on hastily

1124
00:48:10,317 --> 00:48:14,345
- Everyone, make haste - Everyone, make haste

1125
00:48:14,346 --> 00:48:18,717
- Everyone, make haste - Everyone, make haste

1126
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:20,955
- Pop, make haste - Make haste

1127
00:48:20,956 --> 00:48:22,986
- Run away hastily - Hastily

1128
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:24,055
Pop, make haste

1129
00:48:24,056 --> 00:48:26,396
- Racks on hastily - Racks on hastily

1130
00:48:26,397 --> 00:48:30,365
- Everyone, make haste - Everyone, make haste

1131
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:34,766
- Say what? Make haste - Everyone, make haste

1132
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:42,546
("Saturation" by Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il...)

1133
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:46,246
(is available on all music platforms.)

1134
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:51,537
- That was cool. - That was cool.

1135
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:57,076
One of them rapped slowly while Gwang Il rapped fast.

1136
00:48:57,297 --> 00:48:58,526
- That was... - It was pretty good.

1137
00:48:58,527 --> 00:49:00,626
- They put on a great show. - This was cool.

1138
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:02,495
But I think we'll win this one.

1139
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:04,667
- Yes. - Gosh, of course.

1140
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:06,765
Good. We're done.

1141
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:08,736
Seriously. We did everything we could.

1142
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,353
That was the cream of the crop from Block Six.

1143
00:49:10,377 --> 00:49:11,753
Those three were their secret weapons.

1144
00:49:11,777 --> 00:49:14,076
The strongest rapper with a super fast rapping style.

1145
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:16,515
The strongest rapper with a slow rapping style.

1146
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:19,316
Those three super powerful rappers formed a group...

1147
00:49:19,317 --> 00:49:20,547
and put on a great show.

1148
00:49:20,886 --> 00:49:24,615
Their rapping styles were different, so it was fun to watch.

1149
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:27,555
It was a great show to watch because their synergy came together.

1150
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:29,825
There's no need to doubt their rap skills.

1151
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:32,626
Mckdaddy started off the performance.

1152
00:49:32,627 --> 00:49:33,627
Call me nice

1153
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:37,336
Right from the intro, it was really cool.

1154
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:38,635
I was especially looking forward to...

1155
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:41,906
the exchange between Gwang Il and Hash Swan.

1156
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:44,306
Their styles were so different.

1157
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:46,675
It was fun to watch.

1158
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:47,705
I thought we could win first place.

1159
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:49,405
We will now begin the vote.

1160
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,416
If you liked the performance you just watched,

1161
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:53,446
you can press the circle button.

1162
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,087
Let's vote!

1163
00:49:57,016 --> 00:50:00,127
(The 1st voting for Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il begins.)

1164
00:50:00,886 --> 00:50:02,627
I love you, Hash!

1165
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:06,096
- So cute. - So cute!

1166
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:08,325
Jo Gwang Il is cuter.

1167
00:50:08,326 --> 00:50:09,425
Gosh, no.

1168
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,837
Jo Gwang Il!

1169
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:14,306
They're so awkward because they're not good at that.

1170
00:50:15,706 --> 00:50:20,306
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

1171
00:50:20,547 --> 00:50:22,475
(The 1st voting for Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il ends.)

1172
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:24,846
- The first voting is closed. - Thank you.

1173
00:50:25,076 --> 00:50:27,216
Everything we planned was cool.

1174
00:50:27,217 --> 00:50:30,086
The flag, the stage movement,

1175
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:31,655
and the way we bounced off each other while rapping.

1176
00:50:31,656 --> 00:50:32,955
Everything was cool.

1177
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:35,032
I think we showed a good performance to the audience.

1178
00:50:35,056 --> 00:50:36,187
I'm glad it's over now.

1179
00:50:36,357 --> 00:50:39,425
First of all, I'm most grateful to Mckdaddy.

1180
00:50:39,426 --> 00:50:41,725
He did a great job at balancing the whole team.

1181
00:50:41,726 --> 00:50:44,237
So we delivered a performance we wanted and pictured.

1182
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:47,836
Hash and Gwang Il did their part very well.

1183
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,237
So I was grateful to them. They're the best.

1184
00:50:51,337 --> 00:50:54,406
All right. The second crew to perform for this round is...

1185
00:50:54,706 --> 00:50:58,115
from Block Two. Loopy, OSUN, and JP.

1186
00:50:58,116 --> 00:50:59,476
(Loopy, OSUN, and JP from Block 2)

1187
00:51:01,087 --> 00:51:03,955
I'm curious to check out the chemistry of the three.

1188
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:05,885
As they haven't performed together as a unit yet,

1189
00:51:05,886 --> 00:51:08,126
they prepared a performance that would leave an impression.

1190
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:12,396
Then let's check out the performance by Loopy, OSUN, and JP of Block Two.

1191
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:15,826
Let's go!

1192
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,206
JP, OSUN, and I formed a crew together.

1193
00:51:23,877 --> 00:51:26,876
I was the 1st leader of Block 2.

1194
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:28,305
They were the newest recruits of our block.

1195
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:30,646
And I was the first leader of the block.

1196
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:34,086
It's like tying up the entrance and the exit.

1197
00:51:34,087 --> 00:51:36,046
I thought that this would be a nice approach...

1198
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:38,055
to portray the sense of our unity.

1199
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,885
I told them I wanted to work with them.

1200
00:51:39,886 --> 00:51:42,055
My decision to work with them...

1201
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:45,226
was a huge motivation for me as well.

1202
00:51:45,996 --> 00:51:48,225
For us, we weren't so concerned about the story we wanted to tell.

1203
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:49,796
Firstly, we mainly thought about...

1204
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:51,365
what kind of beat we wanted to go with.

1205
00:51:51,366 --> 00:51:52,837
We focused more on that.

1206
00:51:52,996 --> 00:51:54,865
How many songs did we write? Four?

1207
00:51:54,866 --> 00:51:56,936
- Was it 5? We wrote 5 songs. - We wrote 5 songs.

1208
00:51:56,937 --> 00:51:59,075
We kept asking ourselves, "Is this the best we can do?"

1209
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:01,146
So we kept revising.

1210
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:02,675
But here's what we said to each other.

1211
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:04,646
However it happened,

1212
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:06,475
we became a team only a while ago.

1213
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:10,356
We tested out our chemistry within that short amount of time.

1214
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:12,486
It was nice that we got to know each other at a deeper level.

1215
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:13,487
- Right. - Yes.

1216
00:52:13,488 --> 00:52:15,187
And my rap improved.

1217
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:17,055
My rap keeps improving.

1218
00:52:17,056 --> 00:52:19,796
- We did write five songs. - Right.

1219
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:22,325
Right. That's why our song is a bit unique.

1220
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:25,936
It's like the song wove our 3 colors into 1,

1221
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:27,606
but with a distinct presence of each color.

1222
00:52:27,607 --> 00:52:29,865
- Right. You have distinct styles. - Yes.

1223
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:32,306
- You mixed them up into one now. - Right.

1224
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:35,245
- Right. - The synergy went through the roof.

1225
00:52:35,246 --> 00:52:36,277
- Right. - So true.

1226
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:38,816
When I was listening to the song, I kept getting curious.

1227
00:52:38,817 --> 00:52:40,086
- So I listened to it again. - Yes.

1228
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:41,727
- Right. - That's the charm of your song.

1229
00:52:43,346 --> 00:52:45,456
(The rehearsal for the Crew Battle)

1230
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:50,426
"OTL," please.

1231
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:53,667
It's "OFF THE LEASH."

1232
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:56,566
It talks about our desire to break free...

1233
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,697
from the things that oppress us.

1234
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:00,365
That's the theme of the song.

1235
00:53:00,366 --> 00:53:01,865
Before I knew it

1236
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:06,136
I tried to express the feeling of being oppressed by something.

1237
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:08,906
Toward the end of the performance, we'll break free

1238
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:11,816
and transition into three liberated individuals.

1239
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,487
That's the concept we had in mind.

1240
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:15,845
I pull up with the Ricks, I pull up with the bih, no

1241
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:19,086
Listen. We have to do our thing here.

1242
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:21,885
By the time OSUN comes out, we should just be over there.

1243
00:53:21,886 --> 00:53:24,202
- Should we get out of the way? - Yes. We'll give him the stage.

1244
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:26,655
We need to decide what we're going to do then.

1245
00:53:26,656 --> 00:53:29,966
You could be my vocal double and help me instead.

1246
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,265
I think that's better.

1247
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:33,365
Right? I know you practiced my part a lot.

1248
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:35,236
- Yes. - Okay. JP.

1249
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:37,777
I'm the oldest member. Although I'm not their leader,

1250
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:40,547
I wanted to execute my role well.

1251
00:53:40,777 --> 00:53:44,276
So I wanted to help them...

1252
00:53:44,277 --> 00:53:46,076
achieve their goal.

1253
00:53:46,377 --> 00:53:47,746
- Let's try it. - Okay.

1254
00:53:48,786 --> 00:53:50,357
You know, it's like...

1255
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:53,116
Hey.

1256
00:53:53,156 --> 00:53:55,917
I wonder what they're going to sing. I'm the most curious about them.

1257
00:53:56,257 --> 00:53:59,627
"What will the three of them do?"

1258
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:01,127
I couldn't even guess.

1259
00:54:01,426 --> 00:54:03,967
It would be a lie if I didn't feel threatened by them.

1260
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,666
We all know that Loopy is so professional.

1261
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,506
Knowing how great he is made me worry a bit.

1262
00:54:09,507 --> 00:54:10,777
Falling

1263
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:14,607
Falling in tears, surviving here is a bit ominous

1264
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:18,146
Feelings are trapped, the source is anonymous

1265
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:19,975
- They've got a great song. - What are we here for

1266
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:21,647
It's so unfamiliar

1267
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:24,587
- I love it. It's so annoying. - What are we here for

1268
00:54:24,956 --> 00:54:26,833
- He's rapping in falsetto? - Let's get out of here

1269
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:27,956
Was that at 20 just now?

1270
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:29,663
- They're going to sing straight up. - Was that at 20?

1271
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:31,647
Their song sounds much softer than I had in mind.

1272
00:54:31,956 --> 00:54:33,626
I left this cold city

1273
00:54:33,627 --> 00:54:35,297
I chose to escape to a new city, Atlanta

1274
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:36,865
I'm racing

1275
00:54:36,866 --> 00:54:38,337
My gosh, Loopy is so good!

1276
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,365
- I'm a rockstar, Kurt Cobain - Kurt Cobain

1277
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:42,667
My plate is full of

1278
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:43,877
He's killing it.

1279
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:46,007
His flow is insane.

1280
00:54:46,237 --> 00:54:47,377
Loopy's flow is crazy.

1281
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:50,316
It's time for me to dress up, where's my jewelry at?

1282
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:52,446
That chatterbox became a filler

1283
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:53,886
When I ink my body

1284
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:55,686
- They're good. - I'm a rockstar, Kurt Cobain

1285
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:56,955
My plate is full of

1286
00:54:56,956 --> 00:54:58,885
- Run the factory, earn a lot - Run the factory, earn a lot

1287
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:00,385
The era of keeping your ears shut, it's messed up

1288
00:55:00,386 --> 00:55:02,326
You're better off cheering for others

1289
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,527
- He's cool. - He is.

1290
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,756
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1291
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:08,666
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1292
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,535
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1293
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:12,265
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1294
00:55:12,266 --> 00:55:13,436
Loopy is crushing this.

1295
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:15,266
- Why do I hate Loopy today? - My gosh.

1296
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:17,075
- Okay. That's it for Block Two. - My gosh.

1297
00:55:17,076 --> 00:55:18,076
I hate you.

1298
00:55:18,636 --> 00:55:19,937
I hate you.

1299
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:21,777
Could you like me, please?

1300
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:26,246
"My gosh, Loopy. Why are you doing this to us?"

1301
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:31,087
"Go easy on us." That's what I was mainly thinking.

1302
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:33,986
I'm more threatened by Team Loopy's performance.

1303
00:55:33,987 --> 00:55:36,027
Their song sounded polished.

1304
00:55:38,426 --> 00:55:40,026
We're going to release our hidden energy...

1305
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:41,627
we haven't been able to demonstrate...

1306
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,567
with this performance.

1307
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:46,666
I'm going to prove today through my performance...

1308
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:49,607
that I was qualified to survive until this round.

1309
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:51,877
Thank you.

1310
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:52,877
Let's go.

1311
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:54,976
We got this.

1312
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,515
I have faith in my crew, and their performance...

1313
00:56:01,516 --> 00:56:04,357
will surpass what we've prepared to show the audience.

1314
00:56:06,786 --> 00:56:09,686
(The Hukky Shibaseki Round of the Crew Battle)

1315
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,596
(The second performance: Loopy, OSUN, and JP)

1316
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:17,696
- There they are. - There they are.

1317
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:19,265
- I'm so curious about their song. - I can't wait.

1318
00:56:19,266 --> 00:56:21,766
The combination was unexpected when I heard they were a crew.

1319
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,606
- I can't predict anything. - Go ahead.

1320
00:56:23,607 --> 00:56:25,106
Go ahead and try it. We'll win.

1321
00:56:25,107 --> 00:56:26,237
I'm curious, though.

1322
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:28,246
- Let's have fun now. Let's go! - Yes!

1323
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:31,046
Kill it, please.

1324
00:56:31,047 --> 00:56:32,647
They're the finale of our block.

1325
00:56:32,846 --> 00:56:34,486
Gosh, I'm so looking forward to this one.

1326
00:56:35,147 --> 00:56:36,916
- Let's go, JP! - JP!

1327

("OFF THE LEASH" by Loopy, OSUN, and JP)

1328
00:56:42,987 --> 00:56:44,357
Wait, JP is singing.

1329
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:51,996
Let's go.

1330
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:56,206
Locked in the studio, let's see how it goes

1331
00:56:56,266 --> 00:56:59,836
For tomorrow's me to be different from yesterday's

1332
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:03,376
I'm so thirsty, someone give me some water

1333
00:57:03,377 --> 00:57:07,016
I say what I want to say, turn on the light now, yes

1334
00:57:07,616 --> 00:57:11,285
Falling in tears, surviving here is a bit ominous

1335
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:14,825
Feelings are trapped, the source is anonymous

What are we here for, it's so unfamiliar

1337
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:18,096
Let's get out of here

1338
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:21,026
Let's get out of here

My plate is full of cash, face tattoos, but no BIBI

1346
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:35,675
I went on a tour, I count bills in different colors, fool

1347
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:36,676
They're going to be sick

1348
00:57:36,677 --> 00:57:37,916
I pull up with the Ricks

1349
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,217
- I pull up with the bih - No

1350
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:41,146
Ladies and gangsters, let's toast up tonight

1351
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:42,816
It will mess you and me, I'm with you

1352
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:44,416
The view of the Han River is nothing new

1353
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:45,455
I bag up the cash with that as a background view

1354
00:57:45,456 --> 00:57:46,515
That's my bag

1355
00:57:46,516 --> 00:57:47,885
I bet you thought I did wrong

1356
00:57:47,886 --> 00:57:50,396
You never see me like this, I hit a lick, bet

1357
00:57:50,397 --> 00:57:52,155
Yes, I was going to run, but I stopped

1358
00:57:52,156 --> 00:57:53,455
Because they'd catch up anyway

1359
00:57:53,456 --> 00:57:55,265
Oh, yes, I felt like I was falling behind

1360
00:57:55,266 --> 00:57:57,535
Somehow, I ended up listening to different music

1361
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,595
There's no way we're getting paid for this

1362
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:00,836
I don't want to trust anyone

1363
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:03,205
What's your next move? I was acting cocky

1364
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:04,936
And making a fuss, then I was stunned

1365
00:58:04,937 --> 00:58:06,436
I could show you more of the other me

1366
00:58:06,437 --> 00:58:08,245
- From New York, came from overseas - That's nice.

1367
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:09,845
Be careful around me like a chandelier

1368
00:58:09,846 --> 00:58:10,846
- Get it - I don't want to talk to you

1369
00:58:10,846 --> 00:58:11,846
If you're clueless

1370
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:13,785
Problems are stacking up, capper's city on

1371
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:15,486
What's going on? There's no answer

1372
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:16,515
I should let them know

1373
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:18,216
Is it an homage to Infinite Cypher?

1374
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:19,285
- I'm just making bars - Kick it

1375

I'm racing to avoid their gaze

1378
00:58:24,556 --> 00:58:26,396
Sipping Dani with my bro, Fani

1379
00:58:26,397 --> 00:58:28,225
Because I'm a rockstar, Kurt Cobain

1380
00:58:28,226 --> 00:58:31,135
My plate is full of cash, face tattoos, but no BIBI

1381
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:33,196
I went on a tour, I count bills in different colors, fool

1382
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:35,236
It's time for me to dress up Where's my jewelry at?

1383
00:58:35,237 --> 00:58:37,135
That chatterbox became a filler

1384
00:58:37,136 --> 00:58:38,936
- When I ink my body - Yes.

1385
00:58:38,937 --> 00:58:40,506
The feeling of becoming someone else intoxicates me

1386
00:58:40,507 --> 00:58:42,546
I'll peel off those who only look fancy on the outside

1387
00:58:42,547 --> 00:58:44,446
Run the factory, earn a lot

1388
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:46,146
The era of keeping your ears shut, it's messed up

1389
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,986
You're better off cheering for others

1390
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:49,345
Yes, I pull up with the Ricks

1391
00:58:49,346 --> 00:58:51,555
I pull up with the Ricks, I pull up with the bih, no

1392
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:53,385
I play with the ball like Trent

1393
00:58:53,386 --> 00:58:55,225
- It's a nice song. - New shoes, Hyundai store

1394
00:58:55,226 --> 00:58:57,095
I step on another land again

1395
00:58:57,096 --> 00:58:58,856
I live on Abbey Road, my young

1396
00:58:58,857 --> 00:59:00,526
Even if I wish for a lot

1397
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:02,466
I've got to take care of my whole team, already know

1398
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:04,436
My attitude is straight like Chung Mong Gyu

1399
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:06,095
I make a goal if I want to like Trent

1400
00:59:06,096 --> 00:59:08,035
My youth is worth 40,000 dollars

1401
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:09,805
Those who took my music are my opponents

1402
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:11,705
The emotions chain me up

1403
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:14,845
The wad of bills make it, karma on this thing

1404
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:17,277
- Karma on this thing - We on this thing

1405
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:18,916
Yes, money makes problems

1406
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,686
I get wiped before saying "Have a good day"

1407
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:22,546
A player standing here with just my potential

1408
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:24,455
I'm chrome hearted like my left wrist

1409
00:59:24,456 --> 00:59:26,155
This busy Seoul is a big catch

1410
00:59:26,156 --> 00:59:27,856
I arrived as a team

1411
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,785
Dodge it again, curves on the road

1412
00:59:29,786 --> 00:59:31,896
Dodge it again, curves on the road

1413
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:33,055
Good job.

1414
00:59:33,056 --> 00:59:36,496
Falling in tears, surviving here is a bit ominous

1415
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:39,836
Feelings are trapped, the source is anonymous

1416
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:42,166
- They're so good, though. - How come they sing so well?

1417
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,667
Let's get out of here

1418
00:59:43,877 --> 00:59:46,535
Let's get out of here

1419
00:59:46,536 --> 00:59:49,205
I had to get off that leash to find the punk who choked me

1420
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:50,876
Me and my twins and my siblings

1421
00:59:50,877 --> 00:59:52,975
Aside from them, die, punk, a lot of blood has been shed

1422
00:59:52,976 --> 00:59:55,285
I'm rich, I can feel you, I might reach the sky too

1423
00:59:55,286 --> 00:59:56,646
I built it up Babel

1424
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:57,916
The faded Louis V got me like

1425
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:00,216
The nickname "I'm King" is embarrassing, I'm sixteenth

1426
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:02,126
- I ran away from Seoul City - Seoul City

1427
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:03,856
- I got no backup, Sirasoni - Sirasoni

1428
01:00:03,857 --> 01:00:05,756
I almost got cancer, the others are sick

1429
01:00:05,757 --> 01:00:07,526
At least you shouldn't have lied

1430
01:00:07,527 --> 01:00:09,966
I can see it all, punk, you'll freak out if you stand here

1431
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:11,396
Different from you, I don't one bit

1432
01:00:11,397 --> 01:00:12,635
- I found the solution - Solution

1433
01:00:12,636 --> 01:00:14,966
Time to go home, come back home, run like Ohtani now

1434
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:17,175
What are you muttering, give me my crown

1435
01:00:17,176 --> 01:00:18,905
- I get free clothes from Atlanta - Atlanta

1436
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,776
- You're no match for me, young punk - Young punk

1437
01:00:20,777 --> 01:00:22,546
I'm the quarterback of the team, I can't with you

1438
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:24,276
They saw a dead body, completely different

1439
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:26,245
My brothers, dough, rest in peace, Bro, you know though

1440
01:00:26,246 --> 01:00:28,046
- Free thugger and all my bros - Free thugger and all my bros

1441
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:31,115
You're busy making money, I know though, get it

1442
01:00:31,116 --> 01:00:34,687
Falling in tears, surviving here is a bit ominous

1443
01:00:34,826 --> 01:00:38,127
Feelings are trapped, the source is anonymous

1444
01:00:38,456 --> 01:00:39,456
- What are we here for - Here for

1445
01:00:39,457 --> 01:00:42,095
It's so unfamiliar, let's get out of here

1446
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,736
- Let's get out of here - Let's go.

1447
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:45,836
- They're going to be sick - They're going to be sick

1448
01:00:45,837 --> 01:00:48,236
I pull up with the Ricks, I pull up with the bih, no

1449
01:00:48,237 --> 01:00:50,305
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1450
01:00:50,306 --> 01:00:51,936
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1451
01:00:51,937 --> 01:00:53,946
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1452
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:55,682
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1453
01:00:55,706 --> 01:00:57,475
Ladies and gangsters, toast up tonight

1454
01:00:57,476 --> 01:00:59,446
- You and me, I'm with you - You and me, I'm with you

1455
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,146
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1456
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:02,686
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1457
01:01:02,687 --> 01:01:03,955
- Everyone. - I pull up with the Ricks

1458
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:04,956
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1459
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:06,756
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1460
01:01:06,757 --> 01:01:08,325
- I pull up with the Ricks - I pull up with the Ricks

1461
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:10,425
- Louder. - I pull up with the bih, no

1462
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:11,495
- I pull up with the Ricks - One last time.

1463
01:01:11,496 --> 01:01:14,167
- I pull up with the bih, no - I pull up with the bih, no

1464
01:01:14,996 --> 01:01:18,265
(You can listen to "OFF THE LEASH" on all music streaming services.)

1465
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:19,297
Thank you.

1466
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:22,636
Make some noise!

1467
01:01:27,877 --> 01:01:29,346
- Yes. - Yes.

1468
01:01:30,476 --> 01:01:33,115
- That was nice. - It was good. Great job.

1469
01:01:33,116 --> 01:01:34,116
It was a nice song.

1470
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:35,746
- Yes. - Gosh.

1471
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:38,256
- That was amazing. - Yes, amazing.

1472
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:39,757
- Great job. - They were good.

1473
01:01:40,286 --> 01:01:42,526
I couldn't help but think the song was nice.

1474
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,426
It was my first time hearing JP sing.

1475
01:01:46,596 --> 01:01:48,865
That was a new side of him.

1476
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:51,836
Through this performance, Loopy proved that...

1477
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:55,205
he's the only one in Korea who can express such a vibe.

1478
01:01:55,206 --> 01:01:56,805
Tone-wise,

1479
01:01:56,806 --> 01:01:58,436
OSUN's deep tone balanced everything out.

1480
01:01:58,437 --> 01:02:01,446
The three rappers' teamwork was incredible on stage.

1481
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:05,075
All of them are different and have distinct personalities.

1482
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:06,776
That earned them more points.

1483
01:02:06,777 --> 01:02:09,716
A picture they hadn't shown before. The mix of different colors...

1484
01:02:09,717 --> 01:02:10,917
made the performance colorful.

1485
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:17,656
Take it off!

1486
01:02:18,456 --> 01:02:21,766
The three have wonderful fan service. Nice.

1487
01:02:22,027 --> 01:02:24,066
Can't you turn those lights on for me too?

1488
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,596
(Laughing)

1489
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:31,676
I feel like I can emcee cooler with them on.

1490
01:02:32,536 --> 01:02:35,647
The voting for the first round will begin.

1491
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:39,416
(The 1st round of voting begins for Block 2's Loopy, OSUN, and JP.)

1492
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:40,447
One!

1493
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:43,346
- I love you! - You're so handsome!

1494
01:02:43,746 --> 01:02:46,086
- I love you, Loopy! - I love you, JP!

1495
01:02:46,087 --> 01:02:48,126
- OSUN! - Thank you.

1496
01:02:48,127 --> 01:02:49,226
I love you!

1497
01:02:49,426 --> 01:02:51,956
This performance got the most love confessions.

1498
01:02:52,857 --> 01:02:55,466
The vibe of this round is totally different.

1499
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:56,566
It's really different.

1500
01:02:56,567 --> 01:02:58,736
I'm dying to know. I can't even guess the result.

1501
01:02:58,737 --> 01:02:59,766
Me neither.

1502
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:04,437
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

1503
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:08,175
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1504
01:03:08,176 --> 01:03:10,877
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1505
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:13,376
We all have different characters.

1506
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:15,716
But it all came together in the end...

1507
01:03:15,717 --> 01:03:17,785
and shined.

1508
01:03:17,786 --> 01:03:21,555
I thought we could expect a good result.

1509
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:24,397
The crew to perform last in this round are...

1510
01:03:26,627 --> 01:03:30,697
Block Three's HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An.

1511
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,236
- They're topping it off. - I'm...

1512
01:03:36,237 --> 01:03:37,705
- curious. - Me too.

1513
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:39,506
I wonder what they'll perform.

1514
01:03:39,507 --> 01:03:41,845
The three rappers with great teamwork...

1515
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:44,575
have prepared a tribute song for Block Three.

1516
01:03:44,576 --> 01:03:47,276
Is everyone ready for the last performance?

1517
01:03:47,277 --> 01:03:48,345
- Yes! - Yes!

1518
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:52,156
Then, let's go!

1519
01:03:54,226 --> 01:03:56,285
I hope their song is good.

1520
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:57,496
I want to watch them up close.

1521
01:03:58,726 --> 01:04:00,626
I have high expectations of HAON's crew.

1522
01:04:00,627 --> 01:04:02,796
- HAON's crew. - HAON's crew.

1523
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,936
I'm sure most look forward to HAON's crew.

1524
01:04:04,937 --> 01:04:06,297
If I'm being plain honest,

1525
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:10,107
the audience will cheer when HAON appears on stage.

1526
01:04:10,536 --> 01:04:11,837
Beating him won't be easy.

1527
01:04:12,107 --> 01:04:15,506
When I first formed Block Three,

1528
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:17,205
we were the first few rappers.

1529
01:04:17,206 --> 01:04:19,076
- Oh, really? - We started from there.

1530
01:04:19,317 --> 01:04:21,116
- I see. - Yes.

1531
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,217
(During the Block Formation)

1532
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:26,486
(Yang Kyle was the first to get recruited in Block 3.)

1533
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:29,526
(James An was recruited second.)

1534
01:04:29,527 --> 01:04:30,857
Who did HAON choose?

1535
01:04:31,697 --> 01:04:34,967
As the center figure of Block Three, when I recruited the members,

1536
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:37,697
I chose those 2 first to form Block 3.

1537
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:40,366
Three. I was captivated by that number.

1538
01:04:40,536 --> 01:04:42,805
The number three felt quite new to me.

1539
01:04:42,806 --> 01:04:44,606
Like The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1540
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:46,776
We three are one and have come this far.

1541
01:04:46,777 --> 01:04:48,377
I want to share the spirit of victory...

1542
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:51,916
- with the audience and viewers. - I see.

1543
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:53,676
That is why "three" is our concept.

1544
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:55,786
The title of the song is "3."

1545
01:04:55,987 --> 01:04:58,055
If I were to express this song in simple words,

1546
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,687
it'd be a grand bomb.

1547
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:01,686
The song is going to be a bomb.

1548
01:05:01,687 --> 01:05:03,587
It'll make everyone excited and jump.

1549
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:07,797
Block Three went through a lot of deathmatches.

1550
01:05:08,027 --> 01:05:09,595
We lost quite a few times.

1551
01:05:09,596 --> 01:05:14,406
While overcoming those difficulties, we kept going.

1552
01:05:14,636 --> 01:05:19,575
And in the end, we'll win. That's the kind of song it is.

1553
01:05:19,576 --> 01:05:21,776
We should be over there and form a triangle.

1554
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:22,947
I'm curious.

1555
01:05:23,306 --> 01:05:24,317
What will they be like?

1556
01:05:25,616 --> 01:05:26,816
Just looking at the trio,

1557
01:05:26,817 --> 01:05:29,317
I thought the song's vibe would be similar to ours.

1558
01:05:29,487 --> 01:05:32,917
Each rapper in this block is a real player.

1559
01:05:33,317 --> 01:05:36,056
Call the shot, target on sight

1560
01:05:36,386 --> 01:05:40,095
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1561
01:05:40,096 --> 01:05:42,265
They're taking three with them.

1562
01:05:42,266 --> 01:05:43,266
Put your hand up.

1563
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:46,337
- We're 3, they call us 3-oh-3 - It's cool.

1564
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,205
It's life, punk, I'm GOD

1565
01:05:50,206 --> 01:05:52,436
Stamp the number on, because we like freshman

1566
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:53,475
- Fresh - Actress

1567
01:05:53,476 --> 01:05:54,476
- Move it - Test me

1568
01:05:54,477 --> 01:05:56,245
- Talent - They be like, "Acknowledged"

1569
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:58,245
There's nothing I can't do, I got my twinski

1570
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,916
Me and my Block Three, Team Trinity

1571
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:02,385
Even if I look around, it's too easy to win this thing

1572
01:06:02,386 --> 01:06:04,046
Call the shot

1573
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:05,316
- Target on sight - Target on sight

1574
01:06:05,317 --> 01:06:06,356
Target on sight

1575
01:06:06,357 --> 01:06:08,425
- Put your hand up, three - Three

1576
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,063
- Up in the sky - They had the best teamwork.

1577
01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:14,127
It felt like they came up with the performance as a team.

1578
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:18,265
- Call the shot, target on sight - Call the shot, target on sight

1579
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:22,865
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1580
01:06:22,866 --> 01:06:26,276
(They performed a catchy hook following the number 3.)

1581
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:30,507
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1582
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:32,176
Greatest team, greatest

1583
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:37,087
They've got it all.

1584
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:39,416
- It's a full performance. - Yes.

1585
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,556
- The lyrics are all rap. - Right.

1586
01:06:42,156 --> 01:06:44,256
I was surprised at how much they prepared.

1587
01:06:44,257 --> 01:06:46,226
The hook was also catchy.

1588
01:06:46,496 --> 01:06:49,026
I thought the public would like it.

1589
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:51,836
Even quantity-wise, there's a lot of rap.

1590
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:55,936
There were parts where people would be wowed.

1591
01:06:55,937 --> 01:06:58,837
I held HAON's crew in check.

1592
01:06:59,607 --> 01:07:01,476
We titled the song "3."

1593
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:04,446
Three people working as one...

1594
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:06,245
is what we want to show.

1595
01:07:06,246 --> 01:07:08,487
"They're the real team."

1596
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:10,817
That's the kind of performance we prepared.

1597
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:13,515
Should I put it as going back and forth?

1598
01:07:13,516 --> 01:07:15,725
We'll try our best to put on a performance...

1599
01:07:15,726 --> 01:07:17,797
that leaves a long impression.

1600
01:07:18,596 --> 01:07:20,396
(Crew Battle Hukky Shibaseki Round)

1601
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:22,225
(3rd Stage, HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An)

1602
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:23,496
How cool!

1603
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:26,337
- I'm nervous. - Me too.

1604
01:07:26,636 --> 01:07:27,636
My heart is pounding.

1605
01:07:27,636 --> 01:07:28,636
What will it be like?

1606
01:07:29,067 --> 01:07:31,376
Loopy said Block Three had a good show.

1607
01:07:31,377 --> 01:07:33,676
Loopy saying that made me more curious.

1608
01:07:34,036 --> 01:07:36,075
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1609
01:07:36,076 --> 01:07:38,076
We're Block Three! Trinity!

1610
01:07:38,746 --> 01:07:43,717
("3" by HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An)

1611
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:46,156
It's going to be hot.

1612
01:07:46,357 --> 01:07:47,456
Let's go.

1613
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:57,396
We're 3, they call us 3-oh-3

1614
01:07:57,397 --> 01:07:58,397
Three-oh-three

1615
01:07:58,398 --> 01:08:01,305
It's life, punk, I'm GOD

1616
01:08:01,306 --> 01:08:02,306
- GOD - GOD

1617
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:05,236
HAON and James, we're DOGs

1618
01:08:05,237 --> 01:08:06,237
- DOGs - DOGs

1619
01:08:06,238 --> 01:08:09,506
We'll destroy you all, call the beep-bop-beep

1620
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:12,817
Call the shot, target on sight

1621
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:16,516
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1622
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:20,516
Slime, love all the time

1623
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:24,556
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1624
01:08:25,556 --> 01:08:28,066
Trinity, 24 until infinity

1625
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:29,795
Forever on the stage killing it

1626
01:08:29,796 --> 01:08:31,835
Already feeling it, the feeling right now

1627
01:08:31,836 --> 01:08:33,496
- Real recognizes real, the truth - How cool.

1628
01:08:33,497 --> 01:08:35,265
Everyone ends up knowing, it's a vibe

1629
01:08:35,266 --> 01:08:37,366
I'm a rags-to-riches type of guy

1630
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:40,175
Rather than far, should I go up high with HAON and Yang Kyle?

1631
01:08:40,176 --> 01:08:41,246
- That's me - Me too

1632
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,146
- Yes, we Block Three - Block Three

1633
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:46,616
We look familiar now, we always bounce together

1634
01:08:46,617 --> 01:08:49,045
- There's no script, rap society - Goodness

1635
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:50,885
We're the drama, flip the script, go straight

1636
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:52,786
Triple seasoning mixes RAP: PUBLIC

1637
01:08:52,787 --> 01:08:54,686
Fine dining is easy for us like it's delicious

1638
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:56,125
The black-haired foreigner is cooking it up in Korea

1639
01:08:56,126 --> 01:08:57,157
Who guessed it?

1640
01:08:57,327 --> 01:08:59,095
Versus what? Versus who?

1641
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:01,265
We've got no opponent with the three

1642
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,165
Standing on top, my two feet are steady

1643
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,095
Echoing forever, they call us Block Three

1644
01:09:05,096 --> 01:09:06,896
- Come close and witness - Come close and witness

1645
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:09,135
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, yes, that's three

1646
01:09:09,136 --> 01:09:12,736
Greatest team, greatest block, greatest team, greatest

1647
01:09:12,737 --> 01:09:14,946
Guess who's back, back to back, how many times

1648
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,076
The Q asks

1649
01:09:16,077 --> 01:09:17,915
So I break the break and stack my racks up

1650
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:20,116
Raise the pay, I thought from the top

1651
01:09:20,117 --> 01:09:22,486
"It's a top floor," another word for a dead-end

1652
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:24,885
Regardless of a wing or not, the young boy had to fly

1653
01:09:24,886 --> 01:09:26,286
- A high-altitude, auto-pilot - Auto-pilot

1654
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,055
Nitpicking the weather was when I was young

1655
01:09:28,056 --> 01:09:29,255
Now I'm feeling invincible

1656
01:09:29,256 --> 01:09:31,055
The rhythm is calling me Daddy, I feel like Bach

1657
01:09:31,056 --> 01:09:33,255
When it hits the ear, you blurt our "Delicioso"

1658
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,725
I will jump over the class wars, I'm sorry Chef Anh Sung Jae

1659
01:09:35,726 --> 01:09:37,765
This is al dente, people who know will know

1660
01:09:37,766 --> 01:09:39,536
Do half of what we do, and you can support yourself

1661
01:09:39,537 --> 01:09:41,606
I don't have to sweat to be well-seasoned

1662
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:44,336
I'm a drama baby, this isn't once or twice, it's three

1663
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,475
I can teach your ex a lesson, I'm excellent at my profession

1664
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,446
The drip professor, I put down my teammates' pressure

1665
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:53,675
I seeked it to chase after perfection

1666
01:09:53,676 --> 01:09:55,585
Now look, can't you tell who's precious?

1667
01:09:55,586 --> 01:09:57,516
Say something, has my passion ever stopped?

1668
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:59,385
Do you really think I can't make ten million dollars?

1669
01:09:59,386 --> 01:10:01,286
No matter how much Kyle eats it, he's never full

1670
01:10:01,287 --> 01:10:03,585
Turn up the bass, you can test me

1671
01:10:03,586 --> 01:10:05,925
I'm loving the taste, I turn up the tension

1672
01:10:05,926 --> 01:10:07,965
- Dash from Jamsil, I'm breaking - Dash

1673
01:10:07,966 --> 01:10:09,026
I show gesture

1674
01:10:09,027 --> 01:10:11,496
Hot in a while, it's been a hot minute

1675
01:10:11,497 --> 01:10:13,366
Guys with no content, I'll beat them by a minute

1676
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:15,406
I do my job properly, my value is in the frequency

1677
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:17,305
Overheating, too hot, now give me a minute, yes?

1678
01:10:17,306 --> 01:10:18,336
Put your hand up.

1679
01:10:18,836 --> 01:10:20,505
We're three

1680
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:22,805
- They call us three-oh-three - Three-oh-three

1681
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:25,675
It's life, punk, I'm GOD

1682
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:26,676
- GOD - GOD

1683
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:29,585
HAON and James, we're DOGs

1684
01:10:29,586 --> 01:10:30,616
- DOGs - DOGs

1685
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:33,915
We'll destroy you all, call the beep-bop-beep

1686
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:37,625
- Call the shot, target on sight - Call the shot, target on sight

1687
01:10:37,626 --> 01:10:40,595
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1688
01:10:40,596 --> 01:10:42,225
It's three

1689
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:44,997
- Slime, love all the time - Slime, love all the time

1690
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:48,906
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1691
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:49,965
The reaction at the site is fire.

1692
01:10:49,966 --> 01:10:51,805
We're arrogant on top of the keyboard

1693
01:10:51,806 --> 01:10:53,736
What are you talking about? We're in the city that we run

1694
01:10:53,737 --> 01:10:55,675
This is their first flash of light, so bright

1695
01:10:55,676 --> 01:10:57,706
Like sunlight, very different vision from our enemies

1696
01:10:57,707 --> 01:10:59,975
We're the hottest on the block, the three on stage

1697
01:10:59,976 --> 01:11:01,715
Stamp the number on, because we like

1698
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,716
- Freshman - Fresh

1699
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:03,746
- Actress - Move it

1700
01:11:03,747 --> 01:11:04,816
- Test me - Talent

1701
01:11:04,817 --> 01:11:05,885
- They be like, "Acknowledged" - "Acknowledged"

1702
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,826
I don't need to bow down, I get a knapsack full of it

1703
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:09,786
Better not test me on a drama, I'd rather die than be poor

1704
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:11,755
Being poor is no biggie, my feet are faster than your eyes

1705
01:11:11,756 --> 01:11:13,556
I don't stand still, nobody understands me

1706
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:16,265
We are the GOATs, every day isn't easy

1707
01:11:16,266 --> 01:11:17,266
But I feel amazing

1708
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:19,165
- We're the best at passing rhymes - Their teamwork is amazing.

1709
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:21,095
Bring them over, your featuring is all useless

1710
01:11:21,096 --> 01:11:23,305
Now you for sure can tell who is the greatest

1711
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:25,236
There's nothing I can't do, I got my twinski

1712
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:26,875
Me and my Block Three, Team Trinity

1713
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:29,305
Even if I look around, it's too easy to win this thing

1714
01:11:29,306 --> 01:11:31,446
I'm not even tripping for none of your stupidity

1715
01:11:31,447 --> 01:11:33,276
No Diddy, but I got love for my brothers, not biddies

1716
01:11:33,277 --> 01:11:34,915
I'm no longer a high schooler, but wait a minute

1717
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,915
Too litty, we're possessed as kings in Seoul city

1718
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:38,415
We're three

1719
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:39,755
- They call us three-oh-three - Three-oh-three

1720
01:11:39,756 --> 01:11:40,816
- Three-oh-three - Three-oh-three

1721
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:43,656
It's life, punk, I'm GOD

1722
01:11:43,657 --> 01:11:44,755
- GOD - GOD

1723
01:11:44,756 --> 01:11:47,625
HAON and James, we're DOGs

1724
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:48,626
- DOGs - DOGs

1725
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:51,596
We'll destroy you all, call the beep-bop-beep

1726
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:53,567
HAON, you've got something to say?

1727
01:11:53,568 --> 01:11:54,867
Who still has their hand down?

1728
01:11:56,766 --> 01:12:00,306
- Call the shot, target on sight - Call the shot, target on sight

1729
01:12:00,336 --> 01:12:03,305
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1730
01:12:03,306 --> 01:12:05,015
It's three

1731
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:08,316
- Slime, love all the time - Slime, love all the time

1732
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:12,817
Put your hand up, three up in the sky

1733
01:12:13,256 --> 01:12:15,125
Versus what? Versus who?

1734
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:17,125
We've got no opponent with the three

1735
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:19,156
Standing on top, my two feet are steady

1736
01:12:19,157 --> 01:12:21,095
Echoing forever, they call us Block Three

1737
01:12:21,096 --> 01:12:22,866
Come close and witness

1738
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:25,036
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, yes, that's three

1739
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:28,966
Greatest team, greatest block, greatest team, greatest

1740
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:34,676
(You can listen to "3" on all music streaming services.)

1741
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,716
Block Three! Let's go!

1742
01:12:43,586 --> 01:12:45,187
They prepared a lot.

1743
01:12:46,386 --> 01:12:47,716
- So cool! - Respect.

1744
01:12:48,086 --> 01:12:49,256
Good job.

1745
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:50,586
You should advance.

1746
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,397
(To the finals)

1747
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:53,896
- These two are sulking already. - No.

1748
01:12:53,897 --> 01:12:55,496
We can advance together.

1749
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:57,465
- You should've said, "Let's go up." - Let's go up.

1750
01:12:57,466 --> 01:12:59,397
Why are my members excited?

1751
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,336
(ICHILLIN' is having a blast at Block 3's performance.)

1752
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:04,736
- Discipline them, JOONIE. - What are you doing, JOONIE?

1753
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:06,875
- I'm dumbstruck. - Don't they like HAON?

1754
01:13:06,876 --> 01:13:08,276
Aren't you the leader of ICHILLIN'?

1755
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:16,647
- They did it. - It's over.

1756
01:13:17,046 --> 01:13:18,055
- Three. - Three.

1757
01:13:18,056 --> 01:13:20,416
They were much better than they were at the rehearsal.

1758
01:13:21,216 --> 01:13:22,287
It was legendary.

1759
01:13:22,926 --> 01:13:24,027
Is Reddy crying?

1760
01:13:24,726 --> 01:13:27,896
- Hey. - Oh, no.

1761
01:13:27,897 --> 01:13:30,725
- Why are you there alone? - Hey.

1762
01:13:30,726 --> 01:13:33,095
You were crying alone.

1763
01:13:33,096 --> 01:13:35,237
- Come on. - Oh, no.

1764
01:13:36,067 --> 01:13:37,567
He suffered a lot emotionally.

1765
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:40,706
He got emotional. Why are you crying too?

1766
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,346
He was crying alone.

1767
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:45,616
Reddy.

1768
01:13:45,617 --> 01:13:46,646
(He burst into tears after watching their performance.)

1769
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:48,247
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1770
01:13:49,817 --> 01:13:50,886
Oh, my gosh.

1771
01:13:54,886 --> 01:13:56,657
I don't know. It felt strange...

1772
01:13:57,027 --> 01:13:58,625
when I was watching their performance.

1773
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:02,125
I owe HAON many apologies.

1774
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:05,096
I felt bad for him many times on RAP: PUBLIC.

1775
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:08,635
"Did I make him handle..."

1776
01:14:08,636 --> 01:14:12,505
"too much pressure by himself?"

1777
01:14:12,506 --> 01:14:14,606
I often thought like that.

1778
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:18,345
Personally, the performance made me emotional.

1779
01:14:18,346 --> 01:14:19,376
I loved it.

1780
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:22,545
They expressed the meaning of the number three...

1781
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:24,415
like a tribal ritual.

1782
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:25,856
It was mystic.

1783
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:27,755
It gradually captivated me.

1784
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:30,026
The audience already put their hands up.

1785
01:14:30,027 --> 01:14:32,456
Three Kyle, James Three, HATHREE.

1786
01:14:32,457 --> 01:14:34,996
The way they performed together...

1787
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:35,997
- Freshman - Fresh

1788
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:37,026
- Actress - Move it

1789
01:14:37,027 --> 01:14:38,066
- Test me - Talent

1790
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:39,265
- They be like, "Acknowledged" - "Acknowledged"

1791
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,737
This won't be easy.

1792
01:14:42,006 --> 01:14:43,066
It made me realize it.

1793
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:46,475
"Oh, right. We're performing as a team. They're showing it well."

1794
01:14:46,476 --> 01:14:49,606
It was something we didn't think about. All of them were amazing.

1795
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:52,146
- I thought they'd definitely win. - Wasn't it perfect?

1796
01:14:52,147 --> 01:14:53,545
Wasn't it just perfect?

1797
01:14:53,546 --> 01:14:55,015
Yang Kyle did Yang Kyle.

1798
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:56,915
HAON did HAON, and James did James.

1799
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:58,286
All of them shined.

1800
01:14:58,287 --> 01:14:59,886
They couldn't do it better than that.

1801
01:15:00,256 --> 01:15:02,003
I think it was the most perfect performance.

1802
01:15:02,027 --> 01:15:04,657
It feels like I should hold a mic like this. Right?

1803
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:07,996
The first round of voting will begin.

1804
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:11,067
(The 1st round of voting begins for HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An.)

1805
01:15:11,226 --> 01:15:13,595
- James An! - You got this!

1806
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,566
- Yes! - HAON!

1807
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:18,037
- I love you, HAON! - Yes.

1808
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:20,436
Yang Kyle, you're cool!

1809
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:22,577
Let's go!

1810
01:15:22,846 --> 01:15:24,715
- This show... - Yes.

1811
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:26,447
- is interesting. - It's great.

1812
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,686
- It makes you cry and laugh. - It makes you cry and laugh.

1813
01:15:28,687 --> 01:15:30,787
- It drives you crazy. - Yes.

1814
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:36,157
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

1815
01:15:36,556 --> 01:15:37,686
(The 1st round of voting for HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An...)

1816
01:15:37,687 --> 01:15:38,826
(in Block 3 ends.)

1817
01:15:38,827 --> 01:15:42,165
- Oh, my. - It's over.

1818
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,496
- It was the best way to finish it. - Seriously.

1819
01:15:44,497 --> 01:15:45,537
We can win.

1820
01:15:46,037 --> 01:15:47,295
I don't know what the audience...

1821
01:15:47,296 --> 01:15:48,805
- will think about it. - Yes. They might have...

1822
01:15:48,806 --> 01:15:50,037
different opinions.

1823
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:52,406
It was a well-thought-out performance.

1824
01:15:52,407 --> 01:15:54,305
It had a nice structure...

1825
01:15:54,306 --> 01:15:56,107
and included a good amount of rap.

1826
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:58,576
I had no regrets.

1827
01:15:58,577 --> 01:16:02,045
We performed exactly how we wanted to.

1828
01:16:02,046 --> 01:16:03,385
I realized we were truly a team.

1829
01:16:03,386 --> 01:16:06,856
We shared the same feeling.

1830
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:09,585
The 3 rappers from Block 3...

1831
01:16:09,586 --> 01:16:11,496
became one through the performance.

1832
01:16:11,497 --> 01:16:13,456
We could create a moment like that.

1833
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:16,566
This round of the Crew Battle has ended.

1834
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:18,936
Everyone worked so hard.

1835
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:20,996
You worked hard.

1836
01:16:20,997 --> 01:16:22,913
- I think everyone did a good job. - I think so too.

1837
01:16:22,937 --> 01:16:24,736
Nobody lacked anything. It's going to be very intense.

1838
01:16:24,737 --> 01:16:26,606
All three crews showed amazing performances.

1839
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:28,036
Please come up.

1840
01:16:28,037 --> 01:16:29,407
Give them a big hand.

1841
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,987
Yes, sir.

1842
01:16:37,386 --> 01:16:39,255
Please vote for us a lot.

1843
01:16:39,256 --> 01:16:40,556
Vote for our block.

1844
01:16:41,117 --> 01:16:42,226
Oh, my gosh.

1845
01:16:42,386 --> 01:16:43,486
It's HAON!

1846
01:16:43,487 --> 01:16:46,197
- Hey! - You got this!

1847
01:16:46,426 --> 01:16:48,526
Look at OSUN, JP, and Loopy.

1848
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:50,426
- Yes. - They're shining in the middle.

1849
01:16:50,827 --> 01:16:53,736
The second round of voting begins.

1850
01:16:53,737 --> 01:16:54,737
Let's go.

1851
01:16:54,738 --> 01:16:57,305
(Crew Battle Hukky Shibaseki Round)

1852
01:16:57,306 --> 01:16:59,986
(The 2nd round of voting begins for HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An.)

1853
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:03,947
JP!

1854
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:05,916
JP!

1855
01:17:07,117 --> 01:17:11,787
Five, four, three, two, one.

1856
01:17:12,617 --> 01:17:14,486
(Crew Battle Hukky Shibaseki Round, the 2nd round of voting ends.)

1857
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:15,656
You worked hard.

1858
01:17:15,657 --> 01:17:17,085
- Everyone did a great job. - Well done.

1859
01:17:17,086 --> 01:17:18,726
You worked hard.

1860
01:17:19,096 --> 01:17:21,156
You worked hard.

1861
01:17:21,157 --> 01:17:23,566
The final result will be announced later.

1862
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:25,165
Thank you, everyone.

1863
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,867
Please give them a big hand.

1864
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:29,666
- You guys worked hard. - Thank you.

1865
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:38,916
It feels like everyone poured everything into it.

1866
01:17:39,216 --> 01:17:40,247
It was amazing.

1867
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:42,317
I'm so relieved.

1868
01:17:43,147 --> 01:17:45,956
They rapped a lot. Think about the amount of rap they did.

1869
01:17:45,957 --> 01:17:48,225
They surprised us.

1870
01:17:48,226 --> 01:17:51,085
Their music has a similar style to ours.

1871
01:17:51,086 --> 01:17:54,626
I honestly want to win so badly.

1872
01:17:54,857 --> 01:17:59,036
I think our performance was good enough to win.

1873
01:17:59,037 --> 01:18:00,997
I think we're also potential winners.

1874
01:18:01,237 --> 01:18:03,465
I think it effectively showed...

1875
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:05,675
each of their strength.

1876
01:18:05,676 --> 01:18:07,407
They're not easy opponents, as expected.

1877
01:18:07,577 --> 01:18:09,846
I want to compete against them properly.

1878
01:18:10,046 --> 01:18:12,915
Our block stands out in a good way.

1879
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:14,577
Our team is the best.

1880
01:18:14,817 --> 01:18:17,446
Their song was really good, so I felt they were our biggest rivals.

1881
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:18,885
It's going to be a matter of taste.

1882
01:18:18,886 --> 01:18:21,056
Okay. It's going to be fun.

1883
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:22,327
We can win this fight.

1884
01:18:26,457 --> 01:18:30,027
I'll announce the block that took first place...

1885
01:18:30,327 --> 01:18:33,066
in the first round of voting for the Crew Battle Hukky Shibaseki Round.

1886
01:18:33,067 --> 01:18:34,465
How will it go?

1887
01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:36,366
I'm looking forward to it somehow.

1888
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:37,406
This is important.

1889
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:38,806
Please let it be us.

1890
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,176
They're making me anxious.

1891
01:18:43,277 --> 01:18:44,306
I don't know.

1892
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:45,875
Please.

1893
01:18:45,876 --> 01:18:47,676
- I have no idea how it'll turn out. - Right.

1894
01:18:47,976 --> 01:18:49,746
The result of the first round of voting...

1895
01:18:49,747 --> 01:18:51,515
for Crew Battle of the Hukky Shibaseki Round.

1896
01:18:51,516 --> 01:18:54,656
I thought it really wouldn't be easy.

1897
01:18:54,657 --> 01:18:57,126
Loopy and HAON.

1898
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:59,496
These two are so strong.

1899
01:18:59,497 --> 01:19:02,266
All the strong rappers were competing against us in that round.

1900
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:05,936
So I was under a lot of pressure.

1901
01:19:05,937 --> 01:19:07,596
It didn't seem easy.

1902
01:19:07,997 --> 01:19:09,906
The block that takes first place...

1903
01:19:09,907 --> 01:19:11,806
"If we don't take first place here,"

1904
01:19:12,037 --> 01:19:14,106
"we're very likely to be eliminated."

1905
01:19:14,107 --> 01:19:15,406
I was calculating in my head...

1906
01:19:15,407 --> 01:19:17,206
while thinking that.

1907
01:19:17,207 --> 01:19:19,345
If we win, it'll be like a present to us.

1908
01:19:19,346 --> 01:19:22,715
Everyone's performance was of high quality.

1909
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:26,157
I'm nervous because I don't know what will happen.

1910
01:19:27,716 --> 01:19:29,726
- We're the key. - We're the key.

1911
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:34,497
- Please be us. - Block Three.

1912
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:36,527
- Block 2. - Number 2.

1913
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,937
Come on.

1914
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,367
- Oh, gosh. - It's Block Six.

1915
01:19:42,766 --> 01:19:44,906
(According to the result of the 1st round of voting...)

1916
01:19:44,907 --> 01:19:47,507
(for Crew Battle Hukky Shibaseki Round, Block 6 takes 1st place.)

1917
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:50,146
"Is it real?" I crouched down.

1918
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:52,875
My legs gave in. So I just sat down.

1919
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,915
We took first place. It felt great.

1920
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,016
- Oh, my. - Oh, my gosh.

1921
01:19:56,787 --> 01:19:57,846
This is amazing.

1922
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:00,457
Good job.

1923
01:20:00,716 --> 01:20:02,687
Is it possible?

1924
01:20:03,287 --> 01:20:04,327
Can we go to the finals?

1925
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:07,225
- Is it possible? - This is crazy?

1926
01:20:07,226 --> 01:20:08,296
Is it possible?

1927
01:20:11,997 --> 01:20:13,336
I really don't know.

1928
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:15,706
- It makes me so nervous. - My heart...

1929
01:20:15,707 --> 01:20:17,067
is pounding so much. What do I do?

1930
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,436
The other teams did such a great job,

1931
01:20:19,437 --> 01:20:22,346
so we didn't have high expectations.

1932
01:20:22,476 --> 01:20:24,777
I'm so happy about the result.

1933
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:28,216
Everyone worked so hard. Thank you.

1934
01:20:32,117 --> 01:20:33,416
Gosh, this is...

1935
01:20:34,357 --> 01:20:36,357
I was like, "What's going on?"

1936
01:20:36,886 --> 01:20:38,826
"Can we go to the finals?"

1937
01:20:38,827 --> 01:20:40,795
I had hopes like that.

1938
01:20:40,796 --> 01:20:42,373
The second round of voting can change the result.

1939
01:20:42,397 --> 01:20:44,397
Won't it have more effect...

1940
01:20:44,827 --> 01:20:48,237
on determining the winner?

1941
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:52,635
I was hoping for a better result from the second voting.

1942
01:20:52,636 --> 01:20:55,206
I thought that we had a chance to turn the tables.

1943
01:20:55,207 --> 01:20:56,447
We were the last to perform,

1944
01:20:56,707 --> 01:20:58,676
and we had a big impact.

1945
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:02,386
As a result of the first voting for each round,

1946
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:05,287
all blocks have placed first once.

1947
01:21:06,317 --> 01:21:10,086
The block that placed first in the Padi Round is...

1948
01:21:10,726 --> 01:21:11,997
Block Two.

1949
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:16,166
The block that placed first in the Hukky Shibaseki Round is...

1950
01:21:17,027 --> 01:21:18,466
Block Six.

1951
01:21:19,096 --> 01:21:23,037
The block that placed first in the Cha Cha Malone Round is...

1952
01:21:23,636 --> 01:21:24,907
Block Three.

1953
01:21:25,876 --> 01:21:29,546
Now, I'll announce the final ranking...

1954
01:21:29,647 --> 01:21:32,016
based on votes from all rounds.

1955
01:21:34,147 --> 01:21:35,546
Goodness.

1956
01:21:36,247 --> 01:21:37,247
Let's go and do this.

1957
01:21:37,248 --> 01:21:39,255
All the blocks started...

1958
01:21:39,256 --> 01:21:40,555
to get nervous.

1959
01:21:40,556 --> 01:21:42,086
Every block placed first once.

1960
01:21:42,287 --> 01:21:45,126
I couldn't predict the overall voting result.

1961
01:21:45,226 --> 01:21:49,226
To be honest, I felt very confident at first.

1962
01:21:49,867 --> 01:21:52,067
However, I can't predict the result.

1963
01:21:52,636 --> 01:21:53,897
This won't be easy.

1964
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:56,037
We won't know until we hear the result.

1965
01:21:56,407 --> 01:21:58,436
The first block to advance to Final Block Match...

1966
01:21:58,437 --> 01:22:02,407
for winning the most number of votes...

1967
01:22:02,747 --> 01:22:03,846
will be revealed.

1968
01:22:04,247 --> 01:22:08,546
(Blocks to advance to the finals)

1969
01:22:09,117 --> 01:22:10,215
Please, let's go.

1970
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:12,156
They play with your heart.

1971
01:22:12,157 --> 01:22:13,687
I feel so nervous right now.

1972
01:22:13,756 --> 01:22:15,556
Let's trust ourselves.

1973
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:17,756
We can advance. I bet we'll place first.

1974
01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:23,296
(Block 2's JTONG, KHAN, Nosun placed 1st in the Padi Round.)

1975
01:22:23,997 --> 01:22:28,265
(With crew performances of refreshing groups, )

1976
01:22:28,266 --> 01:22:33,636
(Block 2 left a strong impression.)

1977
01:22:33,777 --> 01:22:36,005
Our performance was high in quality.

1978
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:37,305
We have one step to go.

1979
01:22:37,306 --> 01:22:40,317
We've made it this far, so let's do our best and win.

1980
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:42,346
- Whatever the result may be... - Right.

1981
01:22:43,386 --> 01:22:44,386
We can do it.

1982
01:22:44,516 --> 01:22:45,586
We can do it.

1983
01:22:45,756 --> 01:22:47,256
If Block Six comes up...

1984
01:22:50,027 --> 01:22:52,326
(Block 6's Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il placed 1st...)

1985
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:54,596
(in the Hukky Shibaseki Round.)

1986
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:58,866
(By making each crew's personality stand out, )

1987
01:22:58,867 --> 01:23:03,037
(Block 6 showed off diverse charms during the performance.)

1988
01:23:03,136 --> 01:23:05,576
I really want to win.

1989
01:23:05,577 --> 01:23:06,976
I want to do it one more time.

1990
01:23:07,176 --> 01:23:10,147
- The tension is suffocating. - Goodness.

1991
01:23:10,207 --> 01:23:11,207
I can't watch this.

1992
01:23:12,577 --> 01:23:14,576
(Block 3's Reddy, Chaboom, and Roh Yun Ha placed 1st...)

1993
01:23:14,577 --> 01:23:16,617
(in the Cha Cha Malone Round.)

1994
01:23:17,187 --> 01:23:21,116
(Block 3 dominated the stage with powerful and addictive hooks.)

1995
01:23:21,117 --> 01:23:25,397
(Block 3 dominated the stage with powerful and addictive hooks.)

1996
01:23:25,556 --> 01:23:29,296
I really hope that we will be called.

1997
01:23:29,626 --> 01:23:30,726
Please.

1998
01:23:31,197 --> 01:23:34,966
The total number of votes from three rounds.

1999
01:23:35,336 --> 01:23:37,367
My heart is pounding so hard.

2000
01:23:40,136 --> 01:23:41,976
I was very nervous.

2001
01:23:42,846 --> 01:23:43,907
Darn it.

2002
01:23:44,046 --> 01:23:45,046
Block Two.

2003
01:23:45,216 --> 01:23:46,317
Let's go.

2004
01:23:48,886 --> 01:23:51,146
The block to place first is...

2005
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:52,467
(Blocks to advance to the finals)

2006
01:23:58,426 --> 01:24:01,197
(The 1st block to advance is Block 2.)

2007
01:24:02,226 --> 01:24:04,226
- It's Block Two. - Oh, my goodness.

2008
01:24:05,737 --> 01:24:07,166
I told you not to worry.

2009
01:24:07,567 --> 01:24:08,806
I said that we'd make it.

2010
01:24:09,937 --> 01:24:11,306
I told you not to worry.

2011
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:12,737
I said that we'd make it.

2012
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:15,176
Block Two?

2013
01:24:16,647 --> 01:24:17,777
I agree.

2014
01:24:21,716 --> 01:24:22,787
I said that we'd make it.

2015
01:24:23,046 --> 01:24:24,117
I told you not to worry.

2016
01:24:25,317 --> 01:24:26,687
What on earth?

2017
01:24:27,787 --> 01:24:29,086
- Well done. - Don't worry.

2018
01:24:29,657 --> 01:24:31,755
(Padi Round: 339 votes, Hukky Shibaseki Round: 237 votes)

2019
01:24:31,756 --> 01:24:34,397
(Cha Cha Malone Round: 225 votes, Block 2's total: 801 votes)

2020
01:24:34,796 --> 01:24:36,965
With 801 votes,

2021
01:24:36,966 --> 01:24:39,737
Block Two placed first in the Crew Battle.

2022
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:43,607
It's a result that we got as a team.

2023
01:24:43,806 --> 01:24:44,806
Block Two.

2024
01:24:46,107 --> 01:24:47,737
I like you.

2025
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:50,046
- Did all of us make it? - Yes.

2026
01:24:50,306 --> 01:24:52,577
- I worried for nothing. - We did it.

2027
01:24:53,016 --> 01:24:54,516
It's my first time winning.

2028
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:56,586
My legs feel weak.

2029
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,617
Gosh.

2030
01:25:00,256 --> 01:25:01,657
This is difficult.

2031
01:25:01,987 --> 01:25:03,467
I want to advance to the final round.

2032
01:25:03,626 --> 01:25:04,686
It's hard.

2033
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:06,596
- I want to move to the finals. - We can do it.

2034
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:09,366
Between the two remaining blocks,

2035
01:25:09,367 --> 01:25:11,397
the block to advance to the Final Block Match...

2036
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:15,737
and continue RAP: PUBLIC until the end will be revealed.

2037
01:25:18,136 --> 01:25:19,407
Goodness.

2038
01:25:20,006 --> 01:25:23,207
This is quite nerve-racking. My goodness.

2039
01:25:23,907 --> 01:25:26,046
- Is it this nerve-racking? - Seriously.

2040
01:25:27,647 --> 01:25:30,186
Either it will be over, or we will compete until the end.

2041
01:25:30,187 --> 01:25:31,247
It'll be 1 of the 2.

2042
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:33,317
I want to advance.

2043
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:34,787
I really want to win.

2044
01:25:35,216 --> 01:25:36,925
I want to win very much.

2045
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:40,157
(Blocks to advance to the finals)

2046
01:25:40,397 --> 01:25:44,166
Based on the total number of votes from three rounds,

2047
01:25:44,827 --> 01:25:46,936
the block that placed second...

2048
01:25:46,937 --> 01:25:49,836
and that will advance to the Final Block Match is...

2049
01:25:54,876 --> 01:25:59,447
(Blocks to advance to the finals)

2050
01:25:59,846 --> 01:26:03,216
(Block 3 is the 2nd to advance to the Final Block Match.)

2051
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:04,716
It's Block Three.

2052
01:26:06,157 --> 01:26:08,056
- Goodness. - Good job.

2053
01:26:08,687 --> 01:26:09,827
Well done.

2054
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:14,296
Don't cry.

2055
01:26:17,926 --> 01:26:18,997
This is really...

2056
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:20,796
incredible.

2057
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:21,867
We got it.

2058
01:26:23,037 --> 01:26:24,965
Thankfully and fortunately,

2059
01:26:24,966 --> 01:26:27,005
we will advance to the final round.

2060
01:26:27,006 --> 01:26:29,675
I made up my mind.

2061
01:26:29,676 --> 01:26:31,276
We worked so hard to get here,

2062
01:26:31,277 --> 01:26:32,947
so we must win the final round.

2063
01:26:33,016 --> 01:26:34,376
I'm so grateful...

2064
01:26:35,147 --> 01:26:37,385
that my blockmates and I reached...

2065
01:26:37,386 --> 01:26:39,086
the final round together.

2066
01:26:39,957 --> 01:26:42,425
(Padi Round: 232 votes, Hukky Shibaseki Round: 278 votes)

2067
01:26:42,426 --> 01:26:44,866
(Cha Cha Malone Round: 279 votes, Block 3's total: 789 votes)

2068
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:48,457
Compared to the number of votes for Block 2 that placed 1st,

2069
01:26:48,827 --> 01:26:51,626
the difference was only 12 votes.

2070
01:26:52,136 --> 01:26:53,367
It's very close.

2071
01:26:53,867 --> 01:26:55,067
A difference of 12 votes?

2072
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,635
Twelve votes? Seriously?

2073
01:26:57,636 --> 01:27:00,505
Things are still uncertain. We should stay alert.

2074
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:03,746
I thought that the result was unpredictable.

2075
01:27:03,747 --> 01:27:06,545
We must do something extra...

2076
01:27:06,546 --> 01:27:09,116
in order to defeat the other team.

2077
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:10,845
We had pretty much the same number of votes.

2078
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:14,156
As expected, Block Two is our eternal rival.

2079
01:27:14,157 --> 01:27:17,626
We will pour our everything during the final round.

2080
01:27:18,457 --> 01:27:20,056
As a result,

2081
01:27:20,096 --> 01:27:22,526
Block Six no longer has a chance...

2082
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:23,796
to occupy RAP: PUBLIC.

2083
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:26,595
(Padi Round: 106 votes, Hukky Shibaseki Round: 246 votes)

2084
01:27:26,596 --> 01:27:29,036
(Cha Cha Malone Round: 189 votes, Block 6's total: 541 votes)

2085
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,707
First of all,

2086
01:27:34,037 --> 01:27:37,306
it's a total bummer.

2087
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:41,816
We worked hard, and it was an honor...

2088
01:27:41,817 --> 01:27:43,415
that we got this far.

2089
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:46,085
We worked so intensely,

2090
01:27:46,086 --> 01:27:48,515
and we couldn't have worked harder.

2091
01:27:48,516 --> 01:27:50,226
It's a bummer, but I have no regrets.

2092
01:27:52,827 --> 01:27:54,296
What's wrong?

2093
01:28:01,697 --> 01:28:04,367
I saw the look in Kaogaii's eyes.

2094
01:28:06,707 --> 01:28:08,876
They looked so sad to me.

2095
01:28:09,147 --> 01:28:10,646
I had so much fun.

2096
01:28:10,647 --> 01:28:11,647
Are you all right?

2097
01:28:12,216 --> 01:28:15,247
This is not the end, though.

2098
01:28:15,586 --> 01:28:16,647
So I...

2099
01:28:16,846 --> 01:28:19,157
Anyway, I was in Block Six once.

2100
01:28:21,386 --> 01:28:23,527
I felt very upset.

2101
01:28:24,886 --> 01:28:27,556
When I organized the team,

2102
01:28:27,857 --> 01:28:31,497
not many people came to join me...

2103
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:33,367
that it hurt my pride a lot.

2104
01:28:33,567 --> 01:28:37,466
I wasn't a good team leader for the current team members.

2105
01:28:37,537 --> 01:28:40,836
I'd like to give thanks to them.

2106
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:43,246
I wish it could've been different, but I have to accept it.

2107
01:28:43,247 --> 01:28:46,675
We were really fierce and awesome.

2108
01:28:46,676 --> 01:28:48,987
At the same time, we had more fun...

2109
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:52,916
than anyone else, and we advanced very cheerfully.

2110
01:28:53,216 --> 01:28:56,386
(Block 6 was shunned by many rappers.)

2111
01:28:57,357 --> 01:28:58,426
Wait a minute.

2112
01:28:59,457 --> 01:29:00,896
(After many twists and turns, )

2113
01:29:00,897 --> 01:29:05,067
(members were recruited one by one, and Block 6 was completed.)

2114
01:29:06,296 --> 01:29:08,856
(With the wonderful performance by Kaogaii in Infinite Cypher, )

2115
01:29:09,006 --> 01:29:11,183
(Block 6 left a lasting impression and took the first step.)

2116
01:29:11,207 --> 01:29:14,805
Block 6 was the most fun among all 8 blocks.

2117
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:16,545
Every match was tough for us.

2118
01:29:16,546 --> 01:29:18,806
And we had so much trouble in everything.

2119
01:29:18,976 --> 01:29:21,053
(Starting with recruiting Mckdaddy to strengthen the team, )

2120
01:29:21,077 --> 01:29:23,757
(they succeeded in recruiting SINCE and reinforced their position.)

2121
01:29:24,716 --> 01:29:29,857
(They went to the deathmatch after failing Block Competition, )

2122
01:29:30,487 --> 01:29:32,755
(but they united and cooperated, )

2123
01:29:32,756 --> 01:29:35,027
(and everyone in Block 6 survived like a miracle.)

2124
01:29:35,256 --> 01:29:36,425
(They felt relieved for a while, )

2125
01:29:36,426 --> 01:29:38,602
(but with SINCE leaving the block, they faced a crisis again.)

2126
01:29:38,626 --> 01:29:42,835
(While devising a solution)

2127
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:43,836
(We have 30,000 dollars now.)

2128
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,406
(We can divide it by 15,000 dollars.)

2129
01:29:45,407 --> 01:29:46,436
(No, we can't.)

2130
01:29:46,437 --> 01:29:47,707
(We will do a Beef Challenge.)

2131
01:29:48,037 --> 01:29:49,923
(By strategically using a Beef Challenge, they took back spirit.)

2132
01:29:49,947 --> 01:29:51,907
(They also recruited the last member, Hash Swan.)

2133
01:29:52,077 --> 01:29:54,423
(Increasing their presence by reinforcing and with Block Money, )

2134
01:29:54,447 --> 01:29:56,492
(Block 6 took most active and various parts in RAP: PUBLIC.)

2135
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:59,987
(Dominant performance in Kill Them All)

2136
01:30:00,056 --> 01:30:02,555
The first place goes to Geegooin. Let's go!

2137
01:30:02,556 --> 01:30:07,357
(Block 6 took 1st place in Kill Them All for 5 times in total.)

2138
01:30:07,556 --> 01:30:10,026
With 58,000 dollars, Block Six takes...

2139
01:30:10,027 --> 01:30:14,836
(Block 6 was in 1st place in Block Money and advanced to Crew Battle.)

2140
01:30:15,806 --> 01:30:18,436
As I made it this far, I felt confident...

2141
01:30:18,437 --> 01:30:21,536
and broke the limits, which I couldn't do by myself...

2142
01:30:21,537 --> 01:30:22,946
with the help of the team members.

2143
01:30:22,947 --> 01:30:24,907
So I felt truly happy.

2144
01:30:25,147 --> 01:30:28,317
Thinking back, I feel so thankful to my team members.

2145
01:30:29,386 --> 01:30:31,947
Next level, a polished upgrade

2146
01:30:32,147 --> 01:30:39,856
(JOONIE grew as a rapper with Kaogaii's detailed advice.)

2147
01:30:39,857 --> 01:30:43,165
The team members changed my way of thinking a lot.

2148
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:46,165
I could get more confident...

2149
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:49,406
and go back to myself who had nothing to hide.

2150
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:50,437
That makes me proud.

2151
01:30:50,806 --> 01:30:53,336
Being on RAP: PUBLIC,

2152
01:30:53,777 --> 01:30:55,806
I earned so many things.

2153
01:30:56,707 --> 01:31:00,117
I made good friends, good memories,

2154
01:31:00,277 --> 01:31:01,746
and good songs.

2155
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:05,915
As I continue my music career, many things from here...

2156
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,687
will have a huge influence.

2157
01:31:07,787 --> 01:31:09,527
- Covered in sweat - Covered in sweat

2158
01:31:09,926 --> 01:31:11,225
Okay. You can do it.

2159
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:13,696
- Keep up the good work. - Thanks a lot.

2160
01:31:13,697 --> 01:31:15,826
- You can go now. - Keep up the good work.

2161
01:31:15,827 --> 01:31:16,966
You went through a lot.

2162
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:18,526
I was so glad to meet you.

2163
01:31:18,527 --> 01:31:20,937
- Hey. - Hey. You worked so hard.

2164
01:31:21,466 --> 01:31:24,836
SINCE was smart. SINCE was right.

2165
01:31:25,006 --> 01:31:27,606
We didn't play a supporting role. We played an awesome lead role.

2166
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:31,246
What really matters is our next move.

2167
01:31:31,247 --> 01:31:33,116
By making great music,

2168
01:31:33,117 --> 01:31:35,946
let's become awesome artists...

2169
01:31:35,947 --> 01:31:38,116
whom many people love.

2170
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:42,356
Block Six was chaotic, troubled, and haphazard,

2171
01:31:42,357 --> 01:31:45,857
and I was their leader, Kaogaii.

2172
01:31:47,397 --> 01:31:49,765
Members of two blocks...

2173
01:31:49,766 --> 01:31:52,897
that advanced to the Final Block Match.

2174
01:31:53,897 --> 01:31:56,567
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2175
01:31:57,867 --> 01:31:59,005
Happy.

2176
01:31:59,006 --> 01:32:00,937
In the fifth Block Match,

2177
01:32:01,237 --> 01:32:04,206
Crew Battle, two surviving blocks...

2178
01:32:04,207 --> 01:32:07,246
will be given Block Money of 50,000 dollars.

2179
01:32:07,247 --> 01:32:09,147
- Gosh. - That's insane.

2180
01:32:10,716 --> 01:32:12,346
(Block 3)

2181
01:32:12,516 --> 01:32:14,515
- Money! - Hello.

2182
01:32:14,516 --> 01:32:16,585
No, I'm not getting a loan.

2183
01:32:16,586 --> 01:32:17,756
We have a lot of money.

2184
01:32:17,886 --> 01:32:18,987
Great.

2185
01:32:19,426 --> 01:32:21,095
Money of my mind

2186
01:32:21,096 --> 01:32:22,665
- Next. - I'm so excited.

2187
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:24,696
- Is it going up? - That's 100,000 dollars!

2188
01:32:24,697 --> 01:32:27,666
(Block 3's accumulated Block Money increases to 95,000 dollars.)

2189
01:32:28,037 --> 01:32:30,906
It's 95,000 dollars.

2190
01:32:30,907 --> 01:32:34,506
We have only one step left until we make it ours.

2191
01:32:34,937 --> 01:32:35,947
I'm delighted.

2192
01:32:36,546 --> 01:32:38,806
We advanced to the finals. Come here now.

2193
01:32:38,976 --> 01:32:41,375
What did you say? I can't hear you.

2194
01:32:41,376 --> 01:32:43,147
We advanced to the finals? Okay.

2195
01:32:45,016 --> 01:32:48,657
- Yes, we're going to the finals! - Let's go.

2196
01:32:49,016 --> 01:32:50,787
This is it. Loopy!

2197
01:32:55,926 --> 01:32:57,426
It was meant to be like this.

2198
01:32:58,796 --> 01:33:01,236
(Block 2's accumulated Block Money is 93,000 dollars.)

2199
01:33:01,237 --> 01:33:02,265
It's 100,000 dollars.

2200
01:33:02,266 --> 01:33:05,236
The Block Money of Block Two...

2201
01:33:05,237 --> 01:33:07,406
increased to 93,000 dollars.

2202
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:09,805
We're thinking about increasing it three times more.

2203
01:33:09,806 --> 01:33:11,646
(1st place: 59,000 dollars, 2nd place: 43,000 dollars)

2204
01:33:11,647 --> 01:33:14,675
(1st place: 95,000 dollars, 2nd place: 93,000 dollars)

2205
01:33:14,676 --> 01:33:16,545
We'll make it the best final match...

2206
01:33:16,546 --> 01:33:19,085
and wrap up RAP: PUBLIC nicely.

2207
01:33:19,086 --> 01:33:21,486
It's victory, or it's death.

2208
01:33:21,487 --> 01:33:22,625
That's the mindset.

2209
01:33:22,626 --> 01:33:24,657
I still aim to win.

2210
01:33:24,827 --> 01:33:26,026
I'll fight for it.

2211
01:33:26,027 --> 01:33:30,125
I think the winner of RAP: PUBLIC is in fact fixed.

2212
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:32,196
I'd like to have a fun performance for the last one.

2213
01:33:32,197 --> 01:33:33,836
I want to make it a happy ending.

2214
01:33:34,037 --> 01:33:37,737
I will win with a performance...

2215
01:33:37,907 --> 01:33:39,547
that lives up to the name of RAP: PUBLIC.

2216
01:33:40,336 --> 01:33:41,336
(If you watch our performance, )

2217
01:33:41,337 --> 01:33:43,675
(you'll see why we made it this far.)

2218
01:33:43,676 --> 01:33:45,915
(I'll show them something awesome on the stage.)

2219
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:48,715
(Block 2 can never beat Block 3.)

2220
01:33:48,716 --> 01:33:51,246
(I'm sorry, but we'll take the win.)

2221
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:53,885
(The last battle to find the winning block of RAP: PUBLIC)

2222
01:33:53,886 --> 01:33:55,055
(Final Block Match)

2223
01:33:55,056 --> 01:33:58,085
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2224
01:33:58,086 --> 01:34:00,625
(I made it this far while aiming for victory.)

2225
01:34:00,626 --> 01:34:02,303
(I'll beat them and take the win, no matter what.)

2226
01:34:02,327 --> 01:34:04,996
(We have a winning DNA in our bodies.)

2227
01:34:04,997 --> 01:34:06,757
(We'll bring it to a successful conclusion.)

2228
01:34:07,437 --> 01:34:10,706
(Duet Match where the aces of each block perform)

2229
01:34:10,707 --> 01:34:12,835
(Loopy and JTONG of Block 2)

2230
01:34:12,836 --> 01:34:14,976
(Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle of Block 3)

2231
01:34:17,346 --> 01:34:19,947
(I'm so confident. I'll win for sure.)

2232
01:34:20,147 --> 01:34:22,146
(From the beginning, my goal was to win.)

2233
01:34:22,147 --> 01:34:23,687
