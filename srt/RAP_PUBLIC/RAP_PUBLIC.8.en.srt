1
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,989
(RAP: PUBLIC)

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,800
(I will move to Block 5.)

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,569
(I'm thinking of changing blocks.)

4
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,198
(Who cares if other people get offended?)

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,839
(Honestly, you're the most persuasive.)

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,508
(Come to Block 1. Everyone wants you.)

7
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:35,608
(I'm not lying.)

8
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,109
(Rapper Double Down of Block 5 was recruited to Block 1.)

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,739
(Then I want to be the leader.)

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,578
(Rapper OSUN of Block 3 was recruited to Block 5.)

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,279
(It's upsetting that you moved when we only had 5 minutes left.)

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,049
(If I stayed in Block 3, you would've eliminated me.)

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,060
(Rapper SINCE of Block 4 was recruited to Block 6.)

14
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,728
(RappersHippie Kunda and Drain K of Block 8...)

15
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,090
(were recruited to Block 4.)

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,099
(Rapper JTONG of Block 1 was recruited to Block 2.)

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,069
(Another new guest is here.)

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,328
(Rapper Foggyatthebottom of Block 7 was recruited to Block 2.)

19
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,845
(Block 2 absorbed Block 7's Block Money.)

20
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,399
(Members of RAP: PUBLIC.)

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,938
(After the previous match, )

22
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,310
(3 leaders were replaced.)

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,279
(9 members moved their blocks.)

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,818
(Through this process, )

25
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,589
(the society began to change once again.)

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,318
(I'm 120 percent satisfied with the changed block.)

27
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,759
(We became the most enjoyable team.)

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,559
(I'm loving it. My team got stronger.)

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,429
(We won't lose from now on.)

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,899
JTONG, are you doing well?

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,798
How's the atmosphere? Is it fun?

32
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,238
The atmosphere? While the members are friendly,

33
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,569
they're quiet and calm overall.

34
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,408
- And since the oldest one, Loopy, - Yes.

35
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,479
Is neat, the younger ones take the initiative...

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,180
to keep the room tidy.

37
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,279
Since all the members have lived abroad,

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,089
I didn't think that there'd be a hierarchy by age.

39
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,120
But the group was divided by age. I could sense that there were rules.

40
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,598
- Guys, new members joined. - Yes.

41
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,328
So the luggage and such...

42
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,399
- Shall we clean up? - Shall we clean up?

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,128
I think it'd be nice to use things more cleanly...

44
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,168
and keep the atmosphere that way.

45
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,199
- Okay. - Yes.

46
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,840
Loopy said, "New members joined,"

47
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,080
"so let's tidy up the room."

48
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,878
They went, "Yes, Loopy," and tied up the room.

49
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,780
It was something unfamiliar, but familiar.

50
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:25,949
(Neat)

51
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,250
Thank you for your hard work.

52
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,849
- It's so clean. - Nice.

53
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,159
Compared to Block One, the living space was clean and neat.

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,829
Everything was organized.

55
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,359
When I woke up in the morning in Block One's living space,

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,299
drinking glasses, cup noodles,

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,199
and shoes were all over the place.

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,169
I used to be in that condition.

59
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,569
- Are you going to stretch? - Yes, sir.

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,508
I was fascinated...

61
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:55,109
as people who didn't seem that way were organized.

62
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,918
Find a different path because this is a dead end

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,918
Get me on your back, let's get it

64
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,418
My favorite seafood is sea cucumber guts

65
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,388
Dive deep into the sea and find it

66
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,860
It's good to practice like this.

67
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,830
The atmosphere is very nice.

68
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,969
And all the members have different nationalities.

69
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,169
- Thailand, Japan... - You're right.

70
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,309
Seriously, our hometowns are pretty global.

71
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,210
Busan, Tokyo, Vancouver,

72
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,780
Bangkok, New York...

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,279
- Hanam, Gyeonggi Province. - Hanam.

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,990
I love the diversity.

75
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,489
Block Two has various colors.

76
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,330
Foggyatthebottom was one of the new members.

77
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,559
Since he could communicate in English,

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,800
he seemed to be adjusting with ease.

79
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,198
I'm going to drink Red Bull.

80
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,999
Raf, can you give me a Red Bull?

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,139
- Which one do you want? - I want a purple Red Bull, please.

82
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,468
I can understand English.

83
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,840
I just can't speak it.

84
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,979
Still, I'm communicating with them and adjusting to the new block.

85
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,848
Does Double Down understand Korean 100 percent?

86
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:05,849
No.

87
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,370
He must be confused right now since I'm not there to translate.

88
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,758
You need to get up. It's past nine.

89
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,059
What's "Nine?"

90
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,658
"Nine?" It's nine o'clock.

91
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,529
- Nine o'clock? Really? - Yes.

92
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,599
How did you communicate when you were in Block Seven?

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,898
I had a translator.

94
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,369
- Owen? Foggyatthebottom. - Foggyatthebottom.

95
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,540
- Chaboom can do it too. - Owen.

96
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,969
So in Block Seven, I got better at understanding English.

97
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,379
- You hear a lot of English here. - Yes.

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,850
Let's use English only from now on.

99
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,018
Let's talk only in English.

100
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,849
- Only in English. - Yes.

101
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,619
Until we finish the show.

102
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,919
- Yes. - "Until we finish the show?"

103
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,960
JEFFERY WHITE is like, "What on earth is going on?"

104
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,360
Do you know what "Gas" means?

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,790
- Gas? - This is gas.

106
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,859
It means that something is tasty.

107
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,398
It's more like, "This is fire."

108
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,828
- I see. - This is fire.

109
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,198
This is fire.

110
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,439
(Polodared learns the phrase.)

111
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,698
What's "It is what it is?"

112
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,938
- It is what it is. - It's like...

113
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,708
- "Whatever?" - Our friend lost. It is what it is.

114
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,980
You can't do anything about it. It is what it is.

115
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,910
- I understand. - I dig.

116
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,448
- I dig. - I dig.

117
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,119
"I understand" is "I dig."

118
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,148
- I dig. - You dig?

119
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,619
- Do you understand? - You dig?

120
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,790
Yes, I dig.

121
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,888
I'm a good teacher.

122
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:19,758
Yes, you're a good teacher.

123
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,889
Double Down's English class...

124
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,698
was quite helpful.

125
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,629
The students all get an A plus from Mr. Double Down.

126
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,768
Double Down, do you also type in Korean...

127
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,369
when you use your phone?

128
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,508
I don't know Korean.

129
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,240
- Don't you type in Korean? - No.

130
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,180
This is "Clothes."

131
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,149
- Clothes. - Clothes.

132
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
Do you want to go and buy...

133
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,089
- Designer clothes. - Designer...

134
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,689
I'm wearing designer clothes

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,989
You have a song that goes, "Ha, ha, ha backward is F, F, F."

136
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,429
- This is the shape. Kiyeok. - Backward.

137
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,730
- Laughing. - Laughing.

138
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,799
So many funny things happened after Double Down joined the block.

139
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,068
I think the chemistry improved.

140
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,810
- You know the English alphabet. - Yes.

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,378
I don't know the Korean alphabet.

142
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,540
- Okay. - I don't know.

143
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,750
- Giyeok. - Giyeok.

144
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,350
- Bieup. - Bieup.

145
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,479
- Giyeok. - Does it go like this?

146
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,448
- The pronunciation is A. "Ah." - "Ah."

147
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,758
- So it's like G, A. - A.

148
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,489
- When you put them together... - "Ga."

149
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,088
- Yes. - I see.

150
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,588
This is like T. This is like P.

151
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,328
- So this is "Cha." - Yes.

152
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,360
Yes.

153
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,669
This is "Deo."

154
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,470
- Yes. - All right.

155
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,899
Why don't you read that?

156
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,638
- Hold on. - Just one line.

157
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,110
- Just 2 syllables. - Just 2 syllables.

158
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,809
- "Be." - Yes.

159
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,810
"Be."

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,750
"Be."

161
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,560
- "Ef." - Yes.

162
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,758
(Double Down, well done.)

163
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,628
That's "Beef."

164
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,929
Beef Challenge.

165
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,860
I speak a little bit of Korean.

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,269
Digeut. Do you know what I'm saying?

167
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,338
I wouldn't say that the previous block wasn't fun.

168
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,068
It was very fun, but it was also very stressful.

169
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,939
And I was lonely.

170
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,810
That was when I moved to Block Three.

171
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,720
I regretted it every morning. "Why did I cry yesterday?"

172
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,049
I cry a lot, to be honest.

173
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,050
Really? I guess I wasn't the only one.

174
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,359
- Do you know "Queen of Tears?" - Of course.

175
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,028
- Every episode made me cry once. - That's right. I was the same.

176
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,398
How did you cry only once? I cried nonstop.

177
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,100
Since I joined the block belatedly,

178
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,929
I focused on...

179
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,469
alleviating the awkwardness as soon as possible.

180
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,099
When I had the first meeting,

181
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,239
they asked me if I had my eyes on any rappers.

182
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,509
I said that there was one, and that was Roh Yun Ha.

183
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,149
Really? Let me get out of the bed. here.

184
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,649
My goodness.

185
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,219
Kyle was on "BBULKUP," right?

186
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,989
(Where did BBULKUP come from?)

187
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,818
- You mean "RAPCUP." - Right.

188
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,559
BBULKUP is on the board.

189
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,259
BBULKUP, are you doing well?

190
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,560
He's about to fall off the board.

191
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,028
He's very considerate of people around him...

192
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,469
and adjusts himself for them. He seems like a cheerful man.

193
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,239
I think he'll improve the atmosphere.

194
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,838
They say every cloud has a silver lining.

195
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,939
I feel like I flew economy and arrived at the Maldives.

196
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,448
(Meanwhile, SINCE joined Block 6.)

197
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:30,049
Hey, JOONIE,

198
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,119
I almost cried while talking about it during the interview.

199
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,049
- You had an interview yesterday? - Yes.

200
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,888
- JOONIE, when I say such a thing... - Yes?

201
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,960
You're hopeless.

202
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,789
Prepare for the deathmatch.

203
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,759
This block is so scary.

204
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,369
I wasn't lying about yesterday.

205
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,629
This block has a dictator.

206
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,469
The Block Four members were like...

207
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,169
SINCE, just you wait.

208
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,609
They were kindhearted, diligent, and friendly.

209
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,908
- Is it okay if I visit? - Of course.

210
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:00,849
I'm still used to this place.

211
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,079
I'm more comfortable at Block Four.

212
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,518
When SINCE does her makeup here,

213
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,950
she looks so comfortable.

214
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,960
- She always sits there. - Seriously.

215
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,758
(skyminhyuk passes by SINCE without noticing.)

216
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,629
See? He didn't even question it.

217
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,829
SINCE is doing her makeup there.

218
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,099
He didn't think about it. He didn't question it.

219
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,528
It was so natural.

220
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,399
I always do my makeup at Block Four.

221
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,969
I feel comfortable there as if it's my parents' house.

222
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,038
(SINCE does the same the next day.)

223
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,909
- You always do your makeup here. - Yes, I like it here.

224
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:31,969
I feel the most relaxed here.

225
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,049
Where have you been? The women's living space?

226
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,649
I chatted at Block Four.

227
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,418
- Block Four? - My family's house.

228
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,158
- Did you visit your family's house? - Yes, I did.

229
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,360
When I first entered Block Six, I was surprised by how dirty it was.

230
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,359
It was so dirty.

231
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,199
When I was in Block Four, other blocks' members came and said,

232
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,768
"You guys live so cleanly."

233
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,969
So I thought, "What? Isn't this average?"

234
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,508
But I understood what they meant when I entered Block Six.

235
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,109
Things are so hectic here.

236
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,470
I see that it's on the dirty side.

237
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,509
It's on the dirty side.

238
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,980
(Thanks to SINCE, Block 6's table becomes clean.)

239
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,690
You know, you guys are too dirty.

240
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,519
Clean up, okay?

241
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,558
- This is... - You guys are too dirty.

242
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,789
- I'm sorry. - What's this?

243
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,089
- I'm sorry. - I mean...

244
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
I feel like Mom is here.

245
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:23,659
I didn't know that we were so dirty.

246
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,658
Let's hurry up and empty out these bottles.

247
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,100
I reuse it.

248
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,269
I boil water here and use it for cup noodles.

249
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,169
- Would that be okay? - Sure.

250
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,169
- We'll fix our ways. - It's okay.

251
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,470
She's a bit like a mom.

252
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,378
Shall we clean the table a bit?

253
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,279
- We're usually clean. - Yes.

254
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,479
Do you need a bandage?

255
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
- No. I'm not interested. - You're not interested?

256
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,678
After SINCE joined,

257
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,250
the atmosphere improved so much.

258
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,989
JOONIE, aren't you going to eat? Let's go and eat.

259
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,059
Okay.

260
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:56,059
You're tired, right? It's understandable.

261
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:58,700
Let's go.

262
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,840
For how long have you been in Korea?

263
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,470
I moved to Korea in 2019.

264
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,678
So you went to school abroad. How old were you when you came back?

265
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,980
I was 17 years old.

266
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,409
I'm comfortable around the male members.

267
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,119
But if I become closer to SINCE,

268
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,249
I'll be able to learn around.

269
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,250
You just need to do it during the last hook.

270
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,918
Stay still during the first hook.

271
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,089
When it's time for the last hook, everyone will go,

272
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,888
"Up, up, up, going up, up, up, up, going down."

273
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,128
When you do it, you have to be very excited.

274
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,798
- Okay. - And...

275
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,370
It can be like an intro. "Su Jin."

276
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,798
"Upon meeting a woman like you..." You say it once more.

277
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,038
- It's cool. - Yes.

278
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,110
- Let's start a bit later. - Yes.

279
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,610
Are you entirely done?

280
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,956
When did you get done with the interview?

281
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,079
- And you, JOONIE? White? - I want to wear this.

282
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,148
This.

283
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,579
- I want to wear white inside. - A white T-shirt?

284
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Okay.

285
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,221
I got it. Okay. Our outfits look similar.

286
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,619
Once this night passes

287
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,990
SINCE, thank you so much for coming to Block Six.

288
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,299
I feel so relieved since you're here.

289
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,600
I love you.

290
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,830
The third Block Match is...

291
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,269
the Block Competition.

292
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,808
For the Block Competition, everyone from the block will participate.

293
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:18,239
It's a match to show your teamwork.

294
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,479
(There will be 8 rounds.)

295
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,378
Two blocks will face off...

296
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,979
in an eight-round showdown.

297
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,326
(Each round will feature the same beat.)

298
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,789
There is no limit to the number of participants...

299
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,389
per round.

300
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,120
It's an unlimited fight.

301
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,018
We need to prepare multiple options.

302
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,888
This is crazy.

303
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,798
Teamwork will be important in this match.

304
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,059
I think teamwork is the key to victory.

305
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,768
As for the block that loses this match,

306
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,869
everyone including the leader...

307
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,740
will go through a deathmatch.

308
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,849
- Including the leader? - It's including the leader.

309
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,739
My goodness. I got goosebumps. What should we do?

310
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,879
- This is too much. - I got goosebumps.

311
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,250
The whole block?

312
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,320
I don't want to do the deathmatch again.

313
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,619
(Block Competition, Match 1: Block 6 versus Block 3)

314
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,518
(Block Competition, Match 2: Block 5 versus Block 4)

315
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,789
(Block Competition, Match 3: Block 2 versus Block 1)

316
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,799
- This match is insane. - This is driving me crazy.

317
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,299
I feel so bad for OSUN.

318
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,369
- He was promised survival. - I know.

319
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,870
Even when you're the leader, you can be eliminated.

320
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,639
OSUN, let's do one more.

321
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,289
- I want to enter many rounds. - Okay.

322
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,178
- How cute. - Come on out and pretend to shoot.

323
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,308
- That's a good idea. - And...

324
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,548
Think that this gang is making a compilation album.

325
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,229
- That's right. - And it has eight tracks.

326
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,889
- We're having a concert today. - Yes.

327
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,590
Can't we come up with the hooks on the spot?

328
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,820
Then we'll need new verses.

329
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,289
I think so.

330
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,059
I thought of something.

331
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,159
- Okay. Let's talk later. - It's impactful.

332
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,629
An enemy is here.

333
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,099
- The enemies' source is here. - I should go.

334
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,970
- The enemies' informant. - Informant.

335
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,069
Come and get it like that

336
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,439
(Each block practices passionately due to the all-member deathmatch.)

337
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,239
That's how it is

338
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,080
But I ruin the atmosphere

339
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,979
Tell them that they're dead today.

340
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,549
- Okay. - "Tell them."

341
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,649
Shall we do a cheer?

342
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,319
One, two, three.

343
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,450
- Let's go. - Let's go.

344
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,059
The timing was insane.

345
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,028
- This sound brings a dopamine rush. - I know.

346
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,659
- I know. - Yes.

347
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,299
Let's go.

348
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,970
Members of RAP: PUBLIC.

349
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,538
The third Block Match will begin soon.

350
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:26,638
- Let's go. - Let's go.

351
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,508
- Please come to the arena. - What's up?

352
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,869
- Let's go. - Let's go.

353
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,110
- Let's go. - Let's go.

354
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,308
- Let's go. - Yes.

355
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,049
- Good luck. - Let's win.

356
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,320
I'm so nervous.

357
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,090
My heart is pounding.

358
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
JTONG would be nervous despite such looks, right?

359
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,460
He practiced nonstop even in the arena.

360
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,489
I want to hurry up and do it. Seriously.

361
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,128
Members of RAP: PUBLIC.

362
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,099
The third Block Match,

363
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,629
the Block Competition, will begin.

364
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,469
- Let's go. - It's scary.

365
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,940
- Let's go. - Let's go.

366
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,970
Let's go.

367
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,539
Our block became much stronger, so we can win.

368
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,109
We'll win this time.

369
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,479
I don't need to pick the elimination candidates.

370
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,920
We'll go to the deathmatch together.

371
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,389
We'll never die.

372
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,460
(The third Block Match is fiercer than ever.)

373
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,330
(It's an inescapable match with the block's fate on the line.)

374
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:28,669
(Six blocks' match of teamwork will begin now.)

375
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,970
The next match is...

376
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,100
- Block Six... - Is your condition okay?

377
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,169
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

378
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,210
Versus Block Three.

379
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,740
Let's go.

380
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,349
- Like naengmyeon with meat. - Give us a refreshing performance.

381
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,178
Block Six's strategy is...

382
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,918
the spirit. Kaogaii and Block Six came this far with the spirit.

383
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,936
In this match as well, the spirit is very important.

384
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,120
Punk, beat me if you can.

385
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,459
Punk, beat me if you can.

386
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,836
(Kaogaii is practicing something other than rap.)

387
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,429
- Punk, beat me if you can. - Practice rap, not swear words.

388
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,128
What? This is the only thing I need to practice.

389
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,138
Punk, beat me if you can.

390
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,199
You punk, beat me if you can.

391
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,769
Block Six's vibe is like,

392
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,508
"Hey, aren't you going to do that?" It's the rough kind of friendliness.

393
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,210
There's that vibe.

394
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,750
(Block 6 is working with SINCE for the 1st time.)

395
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,080
It's cool.

396
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,720
I think it'll be so cool.

397
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,888
I feel dependable because SINCE joined the block.

398
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,519
I have high expectations for SINCE.

399
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,018
Since I joined Block Six, I'll do everything I can do...

400
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,360
and win no matter what. I had that thought.

401
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,730
(JOONIE practices rapping by herself.)

402
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,899
With Mom, I came this far

403
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,299
When should I enter?

404
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:41,970
Sit down.

405
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,479
Just spit it out whenever.

406
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,240
You can listen some more before you do that.

407
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,619
Black hole, shining like a star

408
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,449
Addicted like, what? Lighting a cigar

409
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,219
Next level, it's a new upgrade

410
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,819
- It's good. - I'm really confused...

411
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,459
about when to enter.

412
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,289
You don't need to enter right away.

413
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,828
- Come up with ideas for this part. - I see.

414
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,630
- The rap was nice. - Okay.

415
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,130
What is it about?

416
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,599
Do you know what a black hole is?

417
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,298
A black hole? Yes.

418
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,609
That's what my life feels like.

419
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,578
I thought I'd be a shining star...

420
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,709
for my mom.

421
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,719
It's a bit lonely.

422
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,319
But I became my mom's wound.

423
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,720
It's like that.

424
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,419
JOONIE's lyrics are insane.

425
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,858
When I think about it,

426
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,960
I picked JOONIE in order to eliminate her.

427
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,758
But I began to wonder if I have more passion...

428
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,828
than her...

429
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,700
since she did so well.

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,599
I think that was why her lyrics were more touching.

431
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,940
One more time, the show is not yet over

432
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,970
- You're so good. - It stays in you

433
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,038
- Black hole, shining like a star - It's game over.

434
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,585
- Addicted like, what? - They match perfectly.

435
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,979
- You guys have insane teamwork. - Nice.

436
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,249
- Nice. - Nice.

437
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,779
O'Domar's rap is so nice.

438
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,250
It's so tasty.

439
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,818
- Don't stutter. - Okay.

440
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,049
- Keep practicing. - Okay.

441
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,088
I've shown bad results...

442
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,559
so far.

443
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,460
(From Mask Off to Block Tournament, )

444
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,469
(O'Domar kept making a mistake with the lyrics.)

445
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,499
Unless O'Domar proves himself in this match,

446
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,200
I won't keep him in the block.

447
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,170
I practiced nonstop...

448
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,150
to keep myself from stuttering.

449
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,279
I'll do my best in order to win.

450
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,109
I had this idea about James An.

451
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,818
(He shares his idea regarding James An!)

452
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,479
He does have cheesy looks.

453
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,025
Anyone will agree that he has cheesy looks.

454
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,250
We can talk about how he went to Harvard University.

455
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,258
- Right. You're the opposite. - I'm a high school graduate.

456
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,889
That's right.

457
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,288
"What's so great about high education?"

458
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,229
"Only thing that matters here is rap."

459
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,559
- Yes. - It needs to be funny.

460
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,159
- You need to aggravate him. - You need to aggravate him.

461
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,269
Yes.

462
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,528
James An!

463
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,768
(James An!)

464
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,338
I'll aggravate James An...

465
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,209
and bring down his mental fortitude. That's one strategy.

466
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,709
And lastly,

467
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,879
I prepared something to show off my English skills.

468
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,249
Block Six, let me introduce myself

469
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,508
My name is Baek Han Sol,

470
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,629
I'm a second-grade student from Geumgok Middle School

471
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,919
He'll rip up the stage.

472
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,318
- You have to do it. - Do it.

473
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,490
- Do it. - The members loved it,

474
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,558
so I decided to do it.

475
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,220
It's perfect. It's very nice.

476
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,329
- I'm tired. Do you want Red Bull? - Okay.

477
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,899
- Good. - Thank you.

478
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Thank you.

479
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:20,960
Haven't you tried it?

480
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,470
People drink it a lot for work.

481
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,929
Is it effective?

482
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,799
Of course. Red Bull is the real deal.

483
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,309
I love Red Bull.

484
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,268
The purple one is grape-flavored.

485
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,608
The taste is different from the original Red Bull.

486
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:32,778
- Is it tasty? Is it different? - Yes.

487
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,838
It's good.

488
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,380
- Is your energy recharged? - Yes.

489
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,008
- Let's go. - Okay. Let's get back to work.

490
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,449
Okay.

491
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,048
It'll be the first mission after moving to a new block,

492
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,490
so I want to do well.

493
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:47,088
We've always won. We can this match as well.

494
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:49,130
Also, we need to win to avoid the deathmatch.

495
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,059
We'll make Block Three regret choosing us.

496
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,099
Let's show everyone what we prepared.

497
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,069
Block Three.

498
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,569
You guys are dead.

499
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,969
We need to put ourselves...

500
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,409
in the shoes of those who are voting.

501
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,409
What strategies should we use...

502
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,848
for people to go, "I'll vote for them?"

503
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:11,849
When you give a performance, it's best...

504
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,318
- to liven up the atmosphere. - That's right.

505
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,989
In the beginning, let's show our solid skills.

506
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,088
- Then teamwork will enter. - The audience members...

507
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,758
It'll liven up the atmosphere.

508
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,288
It's a matter of how well we can deliver the highlights.

509
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,258
To be honest, I think directions will be more important.

510
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,298
- Everyone's good at rapping. - Yes.

511
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,598
So we need to do something that's witty and clever.

512
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,630
So performing well is important.

513
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,300
Let's come up with a good strategy.

514
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,368
During the last match,

515
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,109
we experienced the risks that came with the lack of composition.

516
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,150
(Block 1 strategically placed the hook for the Block Tournament.)

517
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,249
(Block 3 filled the stage with rap only.)

518
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,989
How we fill up the performance...

519
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,118
will be an important point.

520
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,129
Rapping well is the basics.

521
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,059
We also need to add the elements that keep the audience entertained.

522
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,098
Yes, I'm the one, The one because my flow is toxic

523
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,930
I can follow up with this flow.

524
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:07,798
Yes, I'm really on par, Test, I've got to go

525
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,508
Just like Jessica

526
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,709
Hey, I could've taken my crews down the city

527
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,308
Kick up, I can do better

528
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,308
- You're in charge of the vibe - You're in charge of the vibe

529
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,979
- The 2 of you can go. - The 2 of you can go.

530
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,719
You guys have so many verses.

531
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,619
- We should use many verses. - Let's do that.

532
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,858
We piled up different verses on a new beat.

533
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,430
Kyle's and my verses went pretty well together.

534
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,129
HAON and I have the best teamwork.

535
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:39,068
I wanted to do something for the team.

536
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,299
I loved that...

537
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,470
the timing was perfect.

538
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,879
(Block 3 listens to the next beat.)

539
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,139
Let's use that strategy.

540
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,409
- The new verse. - Shall we use it?

541
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,649
I think we can do this if the ending is more important.

542
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,618
All members can participate...

543
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,788
- and write 2 lines each. - Write 2 lines each.

544
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,689
If we make it cool, it'll be a very strong performance.

545
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,758
We can attack them too.

546
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,028
- That's a great idea. - Kaogaii, whatever, that loser

547
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,828
- A new verse is definitely a plus. - It's definitely a plus.

548
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:05,829
He doesn't disappoint.

549
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,328
I thought it was important to show our teamwork...

550
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,239
in an impactful way.

551
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,469
We came up with an idea. For the last performance,

552
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,909
we'll take turns and deliver two bars each.

553
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,939
It'll be a new verse.

554
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,209
We'll attack Block Six.

555
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,278
Kaogaii's facial hair is so...

556
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,180
If we go on like that, we'll win.

557
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,979
We can attack every member's looks.

558
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,950
People will love it if we keep it funny.

559
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,419
Is there something we can attack each one for?

560
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,788
Leave the diss track to me.

561
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,659
I can tie down a stranger I've just met and attack with rap.

562
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,328
Jo Gwang Il used to be my judge

563
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:41,059
Now, he's my

564
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,028
- It's nice. - You're a lunatic.

565
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,368
Let's come up with a line to attack both of them.

566
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:48,068
JOONIE, you're pretty, so

567
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:51,068
O'Domar, as for you

568
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,639
- Hey. - So cute.

569
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,479
That was insane.

570
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,449
Let's attack everyone and ask SINCE to join our block.

571
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,450
That's a good idea.

572
00:22:58,451 --> 00:22:59,980
Let's praise SINCE.

573
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,649
SINCE, men will fall for you

574
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,149
Your block doesn't deserve your incredible rapping skills

575
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,790
You know that Kaogaii's facial hair is weird, so hurry up and come

576
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:10,729
- As for that... - People will burst out laughing.

577
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,258
- Seriously. It's bound to happen. - Okay.

578
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,858
I'll send a Cupid's arrow.

579
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,268
Good.

580
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,329
Okay. Come to our block.

581
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,798
We only have one goal.

582
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,709
Beat them up and bring SINCE.

583
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,109
I think we'll win.

584
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,639
- New block - New block

585
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,080
(Block 3 is practicing with their new lyrics dissing others.)

586
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,848
Kaogaii so ugly

587
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,749
His beard is a nuisance

588
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,049
What are you looking at?

589
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,088
Seriously, he's such a big help.

590
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,929
We would've been ruined if he hadn't come.

591
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,059
- Thank you. - Seriously.

592
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:48,229
The kids are so warmhearted.

593
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,470
It's the greatest.

594
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,768
- Hurry up, let's go - Hurry up

595
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,469
- New block, hey - New block

596
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,439
This match has a stage...

597
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,179
where everyone can shine. So I'm confident.

598
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,048
We'll be able to prove through this match...

599
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,719
that the bond we showed the others...

600
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,849
isn't empty.

601
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,220
We'll win. Yes, sir.

602
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,390
Please say what you want to say to the other block.

603
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,858
- Block Six, AKA! - AKA!

604
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,829
- This is AKA! - AKA!

605
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,598
- What does that mean? - I don't know.

606
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,269
How cool.

607
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,210
May we do a cheer?

608
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,039
- Go ahead. - Let's do it.

609
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,909
Everyone prepared a cheer.

610
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,230
I know. I guess we were too focused on practicing rapping.

611
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,750
- Shall we do a cheer? - No.

612
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,518
It'll look like we're copying them.

613
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,999
"It'll look like we're copying them."

614
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,258
Let's go, Block Three! Team...

615
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,419
- Trinity! - Trinity!

616
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,490
Let's go.

617
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,430
It's cool to see that they're so tight.

618
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:00,539
Now, the Block Match between Block 6 and Block 3 will begin.

619
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,149
I can't predict the result.

620
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,879
Kaogaii is an entertainer,

621
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,038
so I think Block Six will do well.

622
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,379
But Block Three has strong rappers...

623
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,720
such as HAON and Reddy.

624
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,950
Ready.

625
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,750
Start.

626
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,219
DJ, drop the beat.

627
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,119
(Block 6 performs first.)

628
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,490
Special forces member.

629
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,798
The badge looks like the UDT mark.

630
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,368
I don't rest like Park Ji Sung

631
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,969
Fierceness is the default for me

632
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,439
I wrote history like "Gangnam Style"

633
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,169
I told you to wait just a year

634
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,538
My flow is like Eul Yong's slap

635
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,209
I always win and you always fight well and lose

636
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,608
Spend all the money you earn, Live fiercely

637
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,239
An overlapping run on the stage I can't settle down

638
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,778
That's right, who's hot?

639
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,508
Who's not? Oh, my

640
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,879
If I want something, I get that, I make my belly fat

641
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,149
I discard the smell of poverty

642
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,219
- This Asian boy must go global - His vocalization is solid.

643
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,818
I'm 33, but she calls me a heartthrob

644
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:52,419
I don't know how to take it easy

645
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,789
I fill all the empty spaces

646
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,288
Adebayor, shooting like Adebayor

647
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,328
Dribble like Adebayor, Go rush, rush, rush

648
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,460
Emmanuel Adebayor, Adebayor

649
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,868
- Adebayor, shooting like Adebayor - How is he so good?

650
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,828
Dribble like Adebayor, Go rush, rush, rush

651
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,868
Emmanuel Adebayor, Adebayor

652
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,169
If you do the popping dance in front of me

653
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,768
I'll tear you to pieces

654
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,508
I can ticket your weak style

655
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:13,308
No, let's put it behind bars

656
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,278
Kaogaii is a cop, He has the role of a police car

657
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,548
I remember all the losers, I'll kick them when I see them again

658
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,179
HOFGANG will go up

659
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,118
No matter what you say, HOFGANG will go up

660
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,259
I'll go up, Even without words, I'll go up

661
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,058
My passion is my scarf, Shut it when I make up my mind

662
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,828
I'm a fool, so I make decisions based on my hunch

663
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:33,200
HOFGANG, Beggar Gang, We'll go from the ground to the sky

664
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,469
Adebayor, shooting like Adebayor

665
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,429
Dribble like Adebayor, Go rush, rush, rush

666
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,768
Emmanuel Adebayor

667
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,038
- Adebayor - It's like two people's voices.

668
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,169
- Adebayor, shooting like Adebayor - Adebayor

669
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,108
Dribble like Adebayor, Go rush, rush, rush

670
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:45,608
- Emmanuel Adebayor - Adebayor

671
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:47,239
- Adebayor - Adebayor

672
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,879
- Adebayor - Adebayor

673
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,980
- Adebayor - Hey, hey!

674
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,349
Gosh.

675
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,750
My goodness.

676
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,189
Adebayor was nice.

677
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,220
"Say it?" I didn't understand him.

678
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,689
Wasn't it, "Say it?"

679
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,689
"Don't glare?" "Look down?"

680
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,690
What's "Don't do it?"

681
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:02,788
- Adebayor. - Adebayor?

682
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,629
- A soccer player. - It was a soccer player's name.

683
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,099
- I don't know much about soccer. - Shooting like Adebayor

684
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,828
Whatever you're talking about, bro.

685
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,899
Let us talk this time. Drop the beat.

686
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,469
- All right. - My turn

687
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,239
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

688
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,768
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

689
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,469
- My time, baby, my turn, set, go - Yang Kyle is so cool.

690
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,278
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

691
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,508
- Everyone should come out. - My time, baby, my turn

692
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,078
- My time, baby, my turn, set, go - Set, go

693
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,679
Smoke a pack then running to the sky

694
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,318
I waited for my time, my turn

695
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,749
I don't want this smoke, no way

696
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,449
Because I'm not really trying to catch anybody

697
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,118
Doctor Strange, this is the timing

698
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,190
If I get my hand on something, I won't let go

699
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,328
I'm ready to go wild, I was born to make it big

700
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,199
Get lost, go away, back up

701
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,758
I've been number 1 for 10 years like Faker

702
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,368
Keep it, a hunnit and one hundred more

703
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,969
Since I'm a hungry punk, I got no manners

704
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,999
Signing them papers

705
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,098
- CEO, I'm bossing, mine is mine - He's really good.

706
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,008
I fix things on my own, Now, you can tell who's up next

707
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,979
I run this like the top dog, top of the top

708
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,508
Hide-behind-a-bush type of guy had no hope

709
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,048
Come before the microphone

710
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,548
Let's have a showoff, You're all going to die

711
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,209
- After one slap each - I enjoyed it too much.

712
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,778
Now, I can go and sleep tight

713
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,088
Your rap only has red captions But you say, "Cham, cham, cham"

714
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,788
- Let's go! - My time, baby, my turn

715
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,389
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

716
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,058
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

717
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,729
- My time, baby, my turn, set, go - Set, go

718
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,358
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

719
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,899
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

720
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,659
- My time, baby, my turn - Turn

721
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,298
- My time, baby, my turn, set, go - Set, go

722
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,768
- We want more - We want more

723
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,008
- We want more - We want more

724
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,568
- It's good. - I'm already nominated

725
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,739
- KHA, Korean Music Awards - Korean Music Awards

726
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,209
I already know that I'll win, Get lost with your beat

727
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,549
- We want more - We want more

728
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,920
It was so nice. What are they going to do?

729
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,889
Yang Kyle rapped really well this time.

730
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,789
- I was surprised when HAON entered. - I know. They're really good.

731
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,220
It's fierce.

732
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,890
You're pretty good.

733
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,829
- Yes, sir. - My goodness.

734
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,358
I'll go right away. Let's go.

735
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,459
(Block 6's performance begins.)

736
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,970
- Yes. - Mckdaddy!

737
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,569
Let's go.

738
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,315
- Let's stand behind him. - Let's go.

739
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,739
Let's stand behind him.

740
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,309
Daddy, daddy.

741
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,169
Girls want to talk, but they're suffocating

742
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,778
It's like the sea on the sea, I live like I'm on a run

743
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,379
Like a smoke, I go up and disappear, You keep living on the ground

744
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,048
Look at my face, see it properly

745
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,578
I can't change my nature I do things properly

746
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,318
I'd rather die than lose, I've been up for four nights

747
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,949
I lost everything yesterday

748
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,919
Today, I achieve something bigger, Merchandise

749
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,459
Look at my blonde hair and necklace

750
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,118
They talk, but I act

751
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,788
Put the past in the coffin, Every time I kill it

752
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,389
I won't give them excuses

753
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,028
- He's so good. - Like stepping on a hill

754
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,660
I'm hardcore, Uzi in my mouth

755
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,429
I have the homeless soul

756
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,539
I have high standards, so I feel like a beggar

757
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,740
Time passed, so I need a new watch, I always want new time

758
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,639
If you don't know me, just die Trust me

759
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,479
I'll beat my enemies

760
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,308
Wait, who on earth are you?

761
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,179
Cigarette tastes like ash these days

762
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,149
I'm still young, but I need to be like Benjamin Button

763
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,419
After two months of rest, I'm out of energy

764
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,818
I need to get a sense of it again, Turn on the beat

765
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,649
Fill up the magazine and shoot like Rambo

766
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,419
That's right, this is your mountain now

767
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,118
I'll clean it up for the next turn

768
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,489
I changed like this

769
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,088
Because I'm still reminiscing

770
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,098
You think you hid it, but I can see you calculating

771
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,558
I'd rather attack than show my back

772
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,499
These dogs can't turn over a new leaf

773
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,969
My tango is beautiful

774
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,639
I channel Rambo once more

775
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,068
I'm sorry, but forget the handshake

776
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,598
I'd rather act alone than join a team

777
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,209
If I had a chinchilla, it would've danced

778
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,739
To this beat

779
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,008
If you're dissatisfied, I respect that

780
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,939
I collect that fire and burn my job

781
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,508
I don't think I'll find a lover

782
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,449
My tongue gets heated up only when there's a beat

783
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,979
- I find rap more fun than sex - He's a technician.

784
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,078
- Spin the roulette again - He's incredible.

785
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,190
Shoot like Rambo

786
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:18,619
It's fast.

787
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,618
- I got goosebumps. - That was cool.

788
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,129
- That's fast. - It's fast.

789
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,829
I can go faster.

790
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,089
He said he could go faster.

791
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,630
He replied to that.

792
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,028
You have no chance against Yang Kyle with the hook. Give me the beat.

793
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,029
(Block 3's stage starts.)

794
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,038
- Bang on me, not going to - They have the fast Yang Kyle.

795
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,669
You try me, then you're a goner

796
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,209
On my big boss thing because I want to get millions

797
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,808
I just be stunning

798
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,409
Trying to get millions

799
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,979
I just be stunning

800
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,879
- Trying to get millions - They all think they're something

801
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,348
And they leak their song on stage

802
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:47,318
It's a waste of time, can't you see the audience frowning?

803
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,249
The air is awkward, You should be responsible

804
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,189
- Hands in the air, how awkward - He came prepared.

805
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,588
- Fun for you, but punishment for us - Nice.

806
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,489
Disappointed at the paid performance But he's still cool

807
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,858
- I wasted my time on your half show - Half show

808
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:59,828
Stop being stubborn and go away, My fans are getting sleepy

809
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,328
Let me tell you how bad it is, They either have somnosis

810
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,098
Or they're mermaid princesses since they can't scream

811
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:04,298
They're all standing on their legs

812
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,399
They want to stand away from you, They want to throw up

813
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,038
They clapped to see you leave, But you think they want more

814
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,939
Just splash cold water on your face

815
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,439
The atmosphere is cold below sea level

816
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,409
It's under the sea, quit it

817
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,608
- Why are they picking... - I want you to say bye

818
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:15,778
- on JOONIE? - Kindergarten is better than this

819
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,078
That's it, escape all the single people in this building

820
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,879
And you have to edit your setlist, There are too many things to edit

821
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,950
Let's see

822
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,489
Shut up and just pour, Phony, that a dub

823
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,359
Why you stutter, Are you nervous now that you do it?

824
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,429
- Better pack up and walk out - Aren't they crazy?

825
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,098
Before you go bankrupt, you stupid

826
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,699
Ganging with the clique, we stick with it

827
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,328
Pop out and pop bottles, We're too lit

828
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,528
Turn up to the millions

829
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:38,268
Keep up then I extend to the double

830
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,868
Your opinion, I do my thing

831
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:41,745
I earn from 10 thousand to million, then 100 million

832
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,308
Your pockets get light too easily

833
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,939
I keep starting things like I'm crazy

834
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,139
Smith and Wessons tucked in my pocket

835
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,139
- It's his best stage today. - But I don't keep me a burner

836
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,649
Got stunned, I'm the stunner

837
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,179
Bank on me, not going to

838
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,778
You try me, then you're a goner

839
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,859
On my big boss thing, Because I want to get millions

840
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,818
I just be stunning

841
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,419
Trying to get millions

842
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,189
- He's good. - I just be stunning

843
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,690
Trying to get millions

844
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,390
Goodness.

845
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,130
Awesome.

846
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,730
That was good.

847
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,699
- He was so good. - Kyle.

848
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,598
He's determined to win two rounds by rapping.

849
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,298
It's scary.

850
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,268
- It's scary. - You're attacking us all at once.

851
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,269
(They're stirred as SINCE suddenly acts cute.)

852
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,078
What's that? It's scary.

853
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,108
It's scary.

854
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,278
SINCE is cute.

855
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,479
Okay. Block Six we're going up.

856
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
Let's go.

857
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,490
(Block 6's starter stage starts.)

858
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,719
Block Six, we're going up

859
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,089
We're going up

860
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,929
You can see that I go straight to success

861
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,758
Desperation and confidence built on that

862
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,568
I was ready to lose everything, Actions brought me

863
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,899
Something different from the previous life

864
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,499
Those who say I came up by luck

865
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,169
- That's awesome. - Just say you're jealous

866
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,508
They want to criticize but lose the spirit after hearing me

867
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,268
My future expectations keep going up

868
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,108
I'm a corpse without hustle, I stay away from being lazy

869
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,179
I don't sing "Excuses" even in karaoke

870
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,548
My face is sunken every night

871
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:58,409
But they're busy envying my notes

872
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,848
They leach on the company without any skills

873
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:02,118
That's just disrespectful to my veins, I hate that attitude

874
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,548
My name is quite well-known now

875
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,588
They know my journey even if I don't say it, It's not one day

876
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,088
I'll get there over a long time, I bet on that

877
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,835
I hit the jackpot in the end Like Gangwon Land

878
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,528
You should be proud to have my name next to yours

879
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,929
I don't plan on having brothers who are losers

880
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,799
- Up, up - We're going up

881
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,239
- Opp, opp - Opp, opp

882
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
They're going down

883
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:23,439
- Up, up - Up, up

884
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
We're going up

885
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:26,608
- Opp, opp - Opp, opp

886
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:27,680
They're going down

887
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,809
I come out of Deungchon-dong like a cowboy

888
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,849
Hold up your hands I hunt you all, a reckless Rambo

889
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:35,789
In exchange for my youth

890
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,518
My mom does groceries with my card

891
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,189
My dad goes around to check mountains instead of houses

892
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,889
My ambition is big and thick

893
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,288
Like it's mine, like it will all be

894
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,929
Like Mick Jagger, I do it like it's new

895
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,629
Just quit it, I'll be considerate

896
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,769
And donate five dollars every day

897
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,740
Every day

898
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,608
In my way, yes, in our way

899
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:59,409
Even if I fall behind, I won't be a moocher

900
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,909
Been there and done that, I've earned enough

901
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,379
What's my dream? Dreaming all my life, dream concept

902
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,719
A clear concept, Dreaming all my life

903
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,979
- Up, up - Up, up

904
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,988
We're going up

905
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,089
- Opp, opp - Opp, opp

906
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,090
They're going down

907
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,288
- Up, up - Up, up

908
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,289
We're going up

909
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,360
- Opp, opp - They're going down

910
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,260
Make some noise

911
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,530
Great.

912
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,800
My brother from another mother.

913
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,899
- You did well. - Sorry.

914
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,239
It's okay.

915
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:30,469
Don't let it bother you.

916
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,639
It's me, right?

917
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,609
Shall we go right away? Are you ready?

918
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,079
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

919
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,408
Let's go.

920
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,980
(Block 3's stage starts.)

921
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,789
Hey, let's go.

922
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,428
Oui, we on the magazine

923
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,058
Search a magazine

924
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:55,928
- Chanel limousine - Camera flash

925
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,899
Heat, heat, heat it up, set me free

926
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,868
The recipe is always a secret

927
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,098
Keep it on the lowkey

928
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,439
Top shot, I won't miss it like block

929
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,768
Shut it if you can't rap

930
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,709
Watch what we do

931
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,009
Cracking like Bukaya Saka

932
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,578
Quickly put down the mic if you're gone

933
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,279
You talked big

934
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,249
But you try to buy approval with money

935
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,618
Like Instagram

936
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:15,948
Never lose, we are A team

937
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,549
What a brothership, see my bestie

938
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,158
Pull them all down, I step over them

939
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,788
Still rap on the main street

940
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,388
Southside, baby, real K

941
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,959
Got black hair and Y skin

942
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,459
My flow is always tasty

943
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,759
I have all kinds of things Try it like this

944
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,069
Trap or boom bap, rap and singing

945
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,899
They're all in my pocket

946
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,038
Take out anything and it will be good

947
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,468
Do you want a bite?

948
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,469
More delicious than the rappers

949
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,439
- Who say they're good - Cute!

950
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,308
Maybe I will be the next rap star

951
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:41,779
You've never seen the bad one like me

952
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,408
A path that others don't go because they're afraid

953
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,279
I came all the way here with two suitcases

954
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,618
That's the spirit

955
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,118
I was looked down on just because I'm a foreigner

956
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,919
I just look down on them now

957
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,888
Your pronunciation is bad

958
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:53,218
How would we understand?

959
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,189
Oui, we on the magazine

960
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,689
Shining Louis V

961
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,459
- Catch me if you need - Camera flash

962
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,359
Heat, heat, heat it up, set me free

963
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,428
The recipe is always a secret

964
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:05,069
Keep it on the lowkey

965
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,238
I'm here again.

966
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,569
- Ring, take the call, ring, ring - He's here again.

967
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,468
Who is it at this hour? Are you crazy?

968
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:11,238
Step aside You'll die if you block my way

969
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,609
I go straight, I don't go back

970
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,178
Darn this goofy looking

971
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,339
- You slack off - Yang Kyle is really good.

972
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,549
That's why I took you out

973
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,650
I steal it because she's hot, crazy

974
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:21,848
- I bet she's crazy - I bet she's crazy

975
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,348
Blowing back out

976
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,948
Rappers all tap out, I wait for my time

977
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,488
Moving in the time to think, My waves are wavy

978
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,158
I'm all in but this isn't gambling

979
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,629
To an older girl born in 1994 I say, "Trust me, my baby"

980
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,030
But if it goes sour, I'll say bye too, it's a matter of time

981
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:36,069
Boom.

982
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,269
Yang Kyle is crazy.

983
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,950
You were possessed by something.

984
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,138
You were possessed by something.

985
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:42,138
- He was possessed. - Yes, he was.

986
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:43,710
I think Block Three has the momentum.

987
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,518
Okay, let's go.

988
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,649
(Block 6's starter stage start.)

989
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,050
Let's go.

990
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:02,059
It's a macho combination.

991
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,558
Scarboy, almost there

992
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,198
Bring my place, my crown

993
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,799
I won't give you any space, Not even a step

994
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,729
King Kohway, ABS, we're top notch

995
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,368
There's more than money in my head every day

996
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,069
I think of tomorrow rather than today

997
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,768
I use it as I earn, I endure my poverty

998
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,368
Wash away my miserable memory Rain, rain

999
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,908
A new tattoo on my left arm

1000
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,609
- Airforce1 still on my feet - He's good.

1001
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,138
From 0 to 100, Step on 200 if it's not enough

1002
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,209
I'm almost there, how can I go slow?

1003
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,848
Do or die, do or die

1004
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,618
Don't stop, don't stop

1005
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,649
Let them know, let them know

1006
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,865
- I'm ready, New song and plan - His voice is strong and audible.

1007
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,589
Come and get money, bad to the bony

1008
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,189
Still I'm saucing, chase one hunnit

1009
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,859
Failure is my mother, My head in my pocket

1010
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,658
I still have lots of opponents

1011
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:39,399
Come and get money, Bad to the bony

1012
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,058
Still I'm saucing, chase one hunnit

1013
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,768
Failure is my mother, My head in my pocket

1014
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,429
I still have lots of opponents

1015
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,738
I do my own, I'm on my boss

1016
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,510
- His clothes come off? - Bigger build

1017
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,839
- Skt like a humvee - Did he tear his clothes?

1018
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,509
Can't touch me, I'm a beehive

1019
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,109
Call the hurricane

1020
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,848
My words are the law

1021
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,678
I follow many things and want more

1022
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,348
If they ask my number, I tell them my account number

1023
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,078
I just go straight, I'm not far

1024
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,819
Don't imitate me, just come with me It'll be hard for you

1025
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,518
Don't imitate me, just come with me It'll be hard for you

1026
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,189
You pretend to be new, but we've seen them somewhere

1027
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,388
If you want something new, look at me

1028
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,288
Do double and eat double, You become hungry soon

1029
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,259
I don't change, I came like before, But my position is higher

1030
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,129
- I'm a young stunner - He's really good

1031
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,129
I crossed the line a long time ago

1032
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,629
The enemies blame me

1033
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,439
Your failure isn't my fault, no

1034
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,198
Do double, earn double

1035
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,038
Carry the friends and family

1036
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,738
I can never stop

1037
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:25,940
My only option

1038
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,678
That's someone from Block Five.

1039
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,319
Bring him back.

1040
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,719
Here's Mckdaddy's clothes.

1041
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:36,989
You're sexy.

1042
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,658
Come back home, Dad!

1043
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:40,659
Come back, Dad!

1044
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,960
All right.

1045
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,659
We're on fire, so let's go.

1046
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,099
(Block 3's stage starts.)

1047
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,299
Get Block Six.

1048
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,968
Get Block Six.

1049
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:54,698
Get Block Six.

1050
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,439
Get Block Six.

1051
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,139
Get Block Six.

1052
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,908
Yes, I'm really on fire, test me

1053
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:02,848
They got it, burn the bones and ride

1054
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:04,509
Change the asphalt road to lava on a hot day

1055
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,118
It's alchemy, don't mind if I do

1056
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,779
Their brain is fried, Endless scrolling

1057
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,689
Bring it up using all the energy, Purify the minds

1058
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,388
People are buzzing, Fireflies are attacking

1059
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:12,959
Under my light, yes, I'm on fire

1060
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,658
My money, racks steady like Dabotap

1061
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,928
You're like an idiot, Why show me 9 to 5?

1062
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,959
I'll go with 5 to 5, burn them all

1063
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,428
It's ride or die, the repetitive rhythm all sound the same

1064
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,428
The rhyme is off, But they're just bad at rapping

1065
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,029
Kind of tired of it, Look for something else

1066
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,039
I can tell the result, You are out of with it

1067
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,469
Baby, what do you smoke?

1068
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,570
Flip flap worse than that

1069
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,479
Left and right, walk strange

1070
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,909
Look at him, walk in zigzags

1071
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,379
He says let's smoke one together

1072
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,480
Let's burn it, it's from abroad

1073
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,518
Why are you saying that now?

1074
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,618
I leave the place

1075
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,249
No

1076
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,888
I just run, I don't look back

1077
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:45,488
What do you mean, "just once?"

1078
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,218
I'll soon see you on the news, Good luck

1079
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,959
Coughing in front of you, Coughing in front of me

1080
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,788
Line up, all the people who went to their doom

1081
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,558
- This is hard. - It's no competition, they just die

1082
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,360
I'm the only one full thanks to you

1083
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,399
Because I'm VVIP

1084
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,669
Shawty I'm a BRB

1085
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,729
Let me do some business talk

1086
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,299
They can't never play me with my money

1087
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,538
- He's doing it all. - I move smarter, LE SSERAFIM

1088
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,308
- He's really good. - Walk in this I'm VVIP

1089
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:05,839
Walk in this I'm VVIP, VVIP

1090
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,979
Can't get too close to my section

1091
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,039
I'm VVIP

1092
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,348
Can't get too close to my section

1093
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,510
I'm VVIP

1094
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:13,650
Yes.

1095
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,349
- VVIP. - He's very good.

1096
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,119
He's so good.

1097
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:19,889
It's me, right? I'll go.

1098
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:24,260
I really have a bad stomach now.

1099
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,099
- What is he trying to do? - I don't know why but...

1100
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,030
Okay, Block Six, let's go.

1101
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:31,428
(Block 6's starter stage starts.)

1102
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,868
Hey, James An. Yang Kyle.

1103
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,909
You guys are so cheesy.

1104
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,510
I'll give you kimchi.

1105
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,179
Open your mouths.

1106
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,738
Okay? It's going in.

1107
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,509
- Open your mouth. Kimchi is going. - Open your mouth

1108
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,649
This is a money-making rap

1109
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,319
I'm a money bug from a village with many pill bugs

1110
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,189
The Namyangju guys who were proud

1111
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,888
With the lunch money aid they got, I confirm them

1112
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:53,718
Put the poker faces on, And bring out the money

1113
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,459
They keep bringing out guns, Out of their mouths

1114
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,229
Republic of Korea, read your passports

1115
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,158
They all went as public service workers

1116
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,899
I earn money with my thing for 11 years

1117
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,070
You had fun and now you yell, You're a loser

1118
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,968
- What is that? - Why won't it work? Do it properly

1119
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,289
- He's so good. - Drunk every day

1120
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,238
If you want to be groggy, Give me your chin

1121
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,839
It's obvious what they do

1122
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,379
But it's thanks to you that I became rich

1123
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,779
Okay, okay

1124
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,549
Some people say Kaogaii as a big head

1125
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,249
Man, are you jealous? What will you do?

1126
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,178
Just watch what I'll ride now

1127
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,018
A stupid rapper, another hater

1128
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,848
What did you do when I was earning? Keep behaving like that

1129
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,488
The album is ready, Let's go to the next one

1130
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:28,518
I'm here to act, SINCE, go

1131
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,158
From newbie to rookie, Korean hip-hop I wanted to be with

1132
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,029
Booking until it works, Lonely all night but cooking

1133
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,658
My specialty is to endure with the determination to go up

1134
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,529
I get a rookie artist award about the time the first digit changes

1135
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,229
I achieved one goal, And go to the next step

1136
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,169
Ne-Yo Miss Independent, CEO who takes care of everything

1137
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,768
I travel more than 20,000km with my manager

1138
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,109
I rid the worry of his unemployment, go up records career

1139
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,308
So bass up, let it go up The black favorite horse

1140
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,408
Make it ring, The black favorite horse

1141
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:50,249
Solve it with my experience, And end up in happiness

1142
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,948
Plus and minus, Too close to the calculator

1143
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,779
Professionally surviving between the big companies

1144
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,319
Popularity votes covered with capital

1145
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,988
I still keep 2 and 4 amid that

1146
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:59,759
- Why - Why

1147
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,460
- Why - Why

1148
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,206
How is it to be beaten by a high school graduate?

1149
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,899
Harvard.

1150
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,099
Harvard.

1151
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,799
- Good. - Are you okay? Can you do it?

1152
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,669
- Good? - Good?

1153
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,169
That's it?

1154
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,010
It's okay. Kaogaii didn't earn a million by rapping.

1155
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,868
He was the winner of "VERSE BATTLE RAPCUP."

1156
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,138
Do you think so?

1157
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:22,380
Okay, I feel like water, let's go.

1158
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,348
(Block 3's starter stage starts.)

1159
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:26,949
Water

1160
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,249
I flow like water, I wake up from sleep and walk

1161
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,988
I just skip through the lyrics and beats as I want

1162
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:35,118
When I pull up, they shake their legs instead of being afraid

1163
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,129
It's different when it's with H1GHR GANG, hold up

1164
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,928
I don't trip, drip slide

1165
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:40,959
- Why you peep, look at my eyes - That's so cool.

1166
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,029
I churping and churping and swerving and curving on them

1167
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,968
Eyes keep rolling and they fall

1168
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,698
Look and see who's in front of you

1169
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,698
Like Finn and Jake, I might hit you with a stick

1170
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,368
I can be a freak for you

1171
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,339
The growing light, This can be your story

1172
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,009
What are you worried about? I'm trustworthy

1173
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,109
I'd rather be an idiot than be smart

1174
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,808
What can I do? You already know my age

1175
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,448
Same age as Lil Pump, It's the end of a day

1176
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:00,279
How many verse, many flow be loco

1177
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,779
- He's so good. - Y skin and black hair, local words

1178
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,718
- It's delicious. - My goal is to revive this scene

1179
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,788
Make the gap smaller than before

1180
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,859
There's nothing I can't do, Tear off the blinds

1181
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,828
- I think they have similar styles. - Got my back, baby I'm superfly

1182
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,158
Get lost if you won't do well

1183
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,029
Advice to you, But just a lullaby to me

1184
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,129
One, two, three, four, five Bite it, so how

1185
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,029
Even if I just spit it without looking back, score high

1186
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,828
What are you chasing? I'm just high

1187
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,499
Even when they suffered in recession

1188
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,299
I don't try to mock anyone until I'm sweating

1189
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,839
- Raining it - It's Yang Kyle again.

1190
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,308
- It's like a sauna here. - Yang Kyle goes many times.

1191
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,678
Hot, hot, it's hot here Trap money good

1192
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:27,979
Even if money is dirty

1193
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,678
I'm in six, I just flip the

1194
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,479
- He's cool. - That drip, I just lick the

1195
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,779
One more sip, I'd be geeked up

1196
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,218
Come do it with a freak

1197
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:36,948
I might put the team on, Shawty with the team

1198
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,848
Get Block Six, a rash team

1199
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,789
You're always going backward since you keep doing rash things

1200
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,129
Get Block Six, a rash team

1201
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,359
You're always going backward since you keep doing rash things

1202
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,199
You're backward

1203
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,299
Hey.

1204
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,899
That guy who can't study.

1205
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,599
- I'm sorry. - He's good.

1206
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,340
It does sound similar.

1207
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,039
KaoKyle.

1208
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,178
- KaoKyle. - KaoKyle.

1209
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:05,078
- The war of nerves. - He's working hard.

1210
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,649
- Let's go. - Okay.

1211
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,389
(Block 6's starter stage starts.)

1212
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,549
- Give us the beat. - This time...

1213
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,920
They're going with that style too. What do we do?

1214
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,219
That's right.

1215
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,389
Shout out to team Block Six.

1216
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,730
To our families, to my wife.

1217
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,269
This is all for them. How about you?

1218
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,940
Shout out to my team ICHILIN'.

1219
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,239
Whoever is watching this show.

1220
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,980
Check this out. Come on.

1221
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,948
Show's not over, it stays in y'all

1222
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:41,649
Ambiguous answers and calling, We reflected that

1223
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,388
Because we drink that water, And not many wonder

1224
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,788
Talks about faith, reality, and value, you keep fighting

1225
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:48,319
The declaration and orders that spread

1226
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,828
Personality and language divided into sections

1227
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:52,259
They develop more, The algorithm data

1228
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,598
Knows me better than myself, Make us forget about reason and will

1229
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,098
My hardened brain keeps seeking for convenience

1230
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,268
Supports convenience and doesn't ask Who rules?

1231
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:00,868
Dying youth, it means you Or maybe not, I'm not the truth

1232
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,238
- I'm just the essence of truth. - O'Domar is showing us today.

1233
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,569
I just dig up the properties

1234
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,468
It's unknown, Most end up to nothing

1235
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,439
This question and our knocks

1236
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,038
Starts the fire to the real meaning of truth

1237
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,479
It's complicated, You think you're not related

1238
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,819
Endless changes in scenes in the same screen

1239
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,118
A life trapped in the two sides of a coin

1240
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,919
You and I, can't define Wrong or right, truth or lie

1241
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,348
- One more time, show's not yet over - The beat is crazy.

1242
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,389
It stays in y'all

1243
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,419
Black hole, I'm shining like a star

1244
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,788
- I got chills. - Addicted like what

1245
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,189
Lighting a cigar

1246
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,558
- O'Domar came prepared. - Beyond next level

1247
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,959
A stylish upgrade

1248
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,629
I get the top level feeling, Like a lemonade

1249
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,439
My suffering that came so far, To taste that

1250
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,169
The world's polite treatment, Giving you sour after sweet

1251
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,408
They say no pain no gain

1252
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:38,808
- She's focused - I buried my pain, my brain

1253
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:41,578
Thought I'd be the biggest star, Now I'm mama's biggest scar

1254
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,109
Wake up same thing, Everything on replay

1255
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,479
Hate to admit, know, It's always going to be this way

1256
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,948
No color, everything just the same, so grey

1257
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,549
- That's right. - No hope, but I guess

1258
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,948
They say no pain no gain

1259
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,288
I buried my pain, my brain

1260
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:54,589
Thought I'd be the biggest star

1261
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,329
- Now I'm mama's biggest scar - Scar

1262
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,760
He got the exact timing at the end.

1263
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,799
Goodness.

1264
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,599
JOONIE is cool.

1265
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,169
- I think JOONIE improved here. - She improved.

1266
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,769
She improves as she goes.

1267
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:12,269
They're doing the same thing.

1268
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,079
- The same thing? - What?

1269
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,270
- They planned that now. - Give us the beat.

1270
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,520
- They're doing the same. - They're doing the same.

1271
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:22,049
- They're doing a similar thing. - It's the same.

1272
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,288
(Block 3's stage starts.)

1273
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:25,919
I just want to be all right

1274
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,440
- No matter what I dream about - The formation is the same too.

1275
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,829
- I just want to be all right - She has a nice tone.

1276
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,299
Don't wanna be afraid tonight

1277
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,658
- It sounds like there's a tune. - Don't lose your determination

1278
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,058
Even if you change, I dream again

1279
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,669
I'm standing on the stage, I'm painting my dreams

1280
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,399
I have to do, I have to do I just, dreams come true

1281
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,869
Make you want to stay true, I'm going to lose you

1282
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,339
- If they have a church - If they have a church

1283
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,348
I have an opportunity, Hip-hop is my sanctuary

1284
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,509
- Thank you very much - He doubles everything.

1285
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,678
Even in hardships

1286
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:55,519
The studio is my shelter, I'm not in need when on stage

1287
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,218
I give my everything without leaving out anything

1288
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,459
I get a strong determination, And skills

1289
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,058
- Will DOMMIU be better... - One step

1290
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,658
- than JOONIE? - All of a sudden, what's dirty?

1291
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,058
- That's the point. - It's the world's habit

1292
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,500
To open our eyes to fear

1293
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,099
I just want to be all right

1294
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,670
No matter what they talk about

1295
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:14,570
I just want to be all right

1296
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,839
No matter, I'm not fancy, right?

1297
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,738
That's why I changed, I'm painting my dream

1298
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,408
I'm standing on this stage, painting my dream

1299
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:25,009
I have to do, I have to do, It just feels so

1300
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,249
Make my music on my voice, I'm lost in you

1301
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,988
Listen, Me being me

1302
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:33,589
My only bucket list, Live the life you were given, a lie

1303
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,260
What's there in life?

1304
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,529
Take all you have, but on your way

1305
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,328
Give the world some change

1306
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:41,658
What they need is change, not money

1307
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,699
Internalize it, And it's all obvious vain result

1308
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,939
Aim for a deeper will, not winning

1309
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,409
Keep the change, those who have, Show me the love and peace

1310
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:53,679
- Gosh. - That was cool.

1311
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,578
Nice.

1312
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,948
- They had the same position. - I know.

1313
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:00,078
If they have the same formation, I prefer the previous one.

1314
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,249
Me too.

1315
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,380
Is this the last round?

1316
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,519
This is the last one. Let's tear it up.

1317
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,618
- What would this be like? - This is the highlight.

1318
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,159
- What is it? - One more?

1319
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,760
- What would it be? - Do it.

1320
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,658
Okay, Block Six, let's go.

1321
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,899
(Block 6's starter stage starts.)

1322
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,369
This is the last one, right?

1323
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,868
What

1324
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:26,110
What, yes

1325
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,078
Make it you know it, Take you far away

1326
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,808
Who am I? I'm the guy who messes you up

1327
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:31,279
We're flowing, I also have motion sickness

1328
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,808
Enemy on my side, The finish line in front of me

1329
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,379
Subscribe for my updates, Hear the good news

1330
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,589
More news, yesterday hardens, Time flows, my fame

1331
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,319
It's a matter of time Time is on my side

1332
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,488
Geegooin in the building, Everybody, say kimchi

1333
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,589
I came to show you the qualities of a leader

1334
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,689
It's easy to seduce

1335
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,259
My perms during "Show Me The Money 4"

1336
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,828
The curls are long gone I'm a different person

1337
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:50,368
I just trust in a different person, My path is just like BewhY

1338
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,529
It's similar, my mom also knows this

1339
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,968
You wouldn't be able to do this You would have given up

1340
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,468
You wouldn't have earned Or earned dirty money

1341
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:55,698
It wouldn't be good You wouldn't have seen me before

1342
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,768
- Fast Jo Gwang Il. - My values are

1343
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,109
Rappers who can't rap are enemies

1344
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,178
If you're bad, a crime, if you're good, a criminal for not paying

1345
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:01,538
- They all get offered another job - He's fast.

1346
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,879
What I can do is hope it works out if you're good

1347
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,948
- He's surely fast. - Hope all payments go well

1348
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:05,578
The spotlight always on the other side, I was determined

1349
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,779
Half my anger is out of a rebellious spirit for what I don't have

1350
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,549
I trusted it before, To get attention on Instagram

1351
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,988
You need to fish it To make millions here

1352
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,919
But I can't do that I can't do it if I want to

1353
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,319
I was pure to try to fix that, Becoming famous was the goal

1354
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,158
But I fooled myself hard, It's only a matter of time

1355
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,658
- Block Six, AKA! - AKA!

1356
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,198

Yes.

1364
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,279
This is Block Six

1365
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,439
Let me introduce myself

1366
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,308
My name is Baek Han Sol, I'm second grade student

1367
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,408
In Geumgok Middle School

1368
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,150
Soccer is my hobby, you hear that?

1369
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:45,049
- I understood everything. - Me too.

1370
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,789
- Was he always good in English? - His hobby is playing soccer.

1371
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,189
I understood that your hobby is playing soccer.

1372
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,550
- Nice. - Did I pronounce it well?

1373
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,098
He's so funny.

1374
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,828
All right.

1375
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,159
I can't say anything. All right.

1376
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,070
Let me bomb on these goofy-looking people.

1377
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,110
- KaoKyle. - KaoKyle.

1378
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,678
Give us one beat so we tie them up and rip them apart.

1379
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:09,339
(Block 3's stage starts.)

1380
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,948
- Block Six - Block Six, let's go

1381
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:12,578
- Block Six - Block Six, let's go

1382
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:14,118
- Goodbye - Goodbye

1383
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:15,749
- Block Six - Block Six

1384
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,348
- Goodbye - Goodbye

- Block Six - Block Six

1386
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:22,118
Kaogaii is so ugly

1387
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,428
His face and beard, the worst

1388
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:27,999
You're poop, you're fart

1389
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,281
- You're a stinking person - He went to the wrong person.

1390
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,969
Who are you, you fool?

1391
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,868
A one-sided love line sent by Geegooin

1392
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,439
If you want to seduce SINCE

1393
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,169
Beat Double Down

1394
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,879
- He wrote a new line. - I thought you had grills

1395
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,609
Yellow teeth Mckdaddy

1396
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,249
- Betrayed Block Five - What is this?

1397
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,779
- A bad snake - A bad snake

1398
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,979
Kohway

1399
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,919
- They all wrote a new one. - You're just a water dispenser

1400
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,988
The high season won't ever come to your music

1401
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:53,658
JOONIE, your face looks pretty

1402
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,218
- So don't rap - This is good.

1403
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,359
O'Domar

1404
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,388
Just don't say anything

1405
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,859
- He's fast - Fast

1406
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,459
- Jo Gwang Il - Gwang Il

1407
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,058
- He's fast - Fast

1408
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,729
- Jo Gwang Il - Gwang Il

1409
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,198
- He's fast - Fast

1410
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,799
- Jo Gwang Il - Gwang Il

1411
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,399
- He's fast - Fast

1412
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,908
- Jo Gwang Il - Gwang Il

1413
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:14,178
- It's really good. - Block Six, goodbye

1414
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:17,050
- Block Six, goodbye - This is awesome.

1415
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:20,518
- Block Six, goodbye - Block Six, goodbye

1416
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,039
- Block Six, goodbye - Look at JOONIE.

1417
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,789
- This is crazy. - Welcome, SINCE.

1418
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,558
- Hurry up. - Come here.

1419
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,229
- Come here. - We love you.

1420
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,559
I don't know why you're suddenly dissing us here.

1421
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,769
Be quiet, JOONIE. Come here.

1422
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,738
Be quiet, JOONIE.

1423
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:43,099
- I'm sorry, JOONIE. - I complimented JOONIE.

1424
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,440
I'm sorry.

1425
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,440
The match between Block 6 and Block 3 ended.

1426
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,079
I'm so tired.

1427
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,379
Well done.

1428
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,860
- It was so great. You did so well. - You did really well too.

1429
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:56,690
The voting begins.

1430
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,590
It's really amazing that they wrote new lyrics.

1431
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,829
Yang Kyle beat all the rounds in the beginning.

1432
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,388
It was a moment...

1433
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,230
when the artist called Yang Kyle shined.

1434
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,769
His gesture was good, he was relaxed,

1435
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,570
and he controlled the strength perfectly.

1436
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:16,139
He's really charming. He's a charming rapper.

1437
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:20,679
By my standards, HAON did really well.

1438
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,738
HAON was crazy.

1439
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,209
I normally get jealous instead of thinking it's cool,

1440
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,348
but this was really cool.

1441
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,819
The opposing team chose a strategy...

1442
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,419
that uses Yang Kyle and HAON a lot.

1443
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,289
They went well together.

1444
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,460
It was annoying, but it was a good strategy.

1445
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:38,288
At first, Block Three was good.

1446
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:39,589
- That's right. - But in the middle,

1447
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,860
Block Six did well.

1448
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,829
I think O'Domar's rap was nice.

1449
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,899
I think O'Domar showed something he hadn't shown so far...

1450
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,768
on that stage.

1451
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:50,808
They mostly won because of the hook.

1452
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:54,038
Kohway made a very kitsch hook.

1453
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,879
His voice.

1454
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,609
He had a loud voice,

1455
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,710
but it was also strong. I was shocked.

1456
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,379
There were a few rounds when this block was really good.

1457
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,420
I know.

1458
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:05,749
The last one...

1459
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,419
Block Three's criticizing rap at the end.

1460
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,759
That was really fun.

1461
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,459
How did they think...

1462
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,459
of writing new lyrics over that short time?

1463
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,929
But all the lyrics were fun.

1464
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,869
It's so difficult.

1465
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,368
- It's so hard. - It's so difficult.

1466
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,469
Okay.

1467
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:28,079
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1468
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:32,409
I really didn't want to go to the deathmatch.

1469
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,349
It was really difficult for us.

1470
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,178
I thought we should win...

1471
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,250
this third match.

1472
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,090
I got a bit nervous. It's okay. We can win.

1473
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,960
As a result of the match between Block 6 and Block 3,

1474
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,530
the block that won is...

1475
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:54,440
Block Three.

1476
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:56,840
We did it!

1477
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:01,780
(Block 6 loses with 2 votes, and Block 3 wins with 28 votes.)

1478
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,949
MVP Yang Kyle.

1479
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,449
Yang Kyle was amazing.

1480
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,050
He was at his best.

1481
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,218
Yes.

1482
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:12,348
We finally won.

1483
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,519
We won.

1484
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:17,460
We won.

1485
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,900
We finally tasted true victory.

1486
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,869
After a long wait, Block Three did it.

1487
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,840
We finally don't have to go to the deathmatch.

1488
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,238
We finally won.

1489
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,649
I first thank our block members...

1490
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,010
who did so well.

1491
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,849
It'd be tough for you all, but cheer up.

1492
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,389
I hope we all endure it to the end.

1493
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,760
Thank you.

1494
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,289
Congratulations.

1495
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,659
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1496
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,630
SINCE. What will SINCE do?

1497
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:58,230
She left home and...

1498
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,699
- SINCE's decision. - My decision.

1499
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:03,968
Everyone will go to the deathmatch.

1500
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,408
I really wanted to deny that.

1501
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:07,709
When I was in Block Four,

1502
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,879
I almost got eliminated.

1503
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,879
So I decided to go to a block...

1504
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,549
that had a higher chance of winning.

1505
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,149
But I was again at the risk of being eliminated.

1506
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,820
And this time, it's the entire block.

1507
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,719
I thought it was the price I had to pay for switching blocks.

1508
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,590
The blocks that will be on the match...

1509
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,489
are Block 5 and Block 4.

1510
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,759
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1511
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,929
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1512
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,468
Let's go.

1513
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:32,698
- I'll watch you, OSUN. - OSUN.

1514
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:34,339
Let's see how well he does the Five Line.

1515
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,669
Don't feel pressured.

1516
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,569
- I like those things. - You do?

1517
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,840
COCONA messed up at the battle last time.

1518
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,500
You won't do that today as well, right?

1519
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:43,339
I wrote a letter.

1520
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,779
- She even wrote a letter. - Why are you attacking me again?

1521
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,449
Okay. I love you.

1522
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,049
- I love you too. - What was that?

1523
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,488
We had so much fun while preparing for this.

1524
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,488
So we even forgot...

1525
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:55,320
who our opponent was.

1526
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,230
So, we'll do our best. Let's go.

1527
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,459
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1528
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,559
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1529
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,030
We lost against Block Four in the first Block Match.

1530
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,370
(Block 4 wins, Block 5 loses.)

1531
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:08,969
We got this.

1532
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,169
We failed when we thought we'd win.

1533
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,078
So we made another attempt.

1534
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,908
About two of them haven't rapped...

1535
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:19,480
ever since Mask Off.

1536
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:23,518
The situation would come in which they'd have to rap.

1537
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:26,519
I think there are some weak rappers.

1538
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,388
I didn't think Block Five...

1539
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,359
was stronger than us.

1540
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,199
I was all smiles thinking that we'd win.

1541
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,598
We will begin the Block Match between Block 5...

1542
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,869
and Block 4.

1543
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:42,500
(Block 5)

1544
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,639
(Block 5 listens to the beat.)

1545
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,578
I plant an apple tree

1546
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,279
- I clear my path - Go.

1547
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,448
My friends push my back, I don't accept help

1548
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,049
- I should do it with you. - I fixed the shed

1549
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,779
After losing the cow

1550
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,549
- It's a song I know. - Of this era

1551
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,689
The leader

1552
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,988
The source that comes and goes, It's mine but everyone knows

1553
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,689
- That's nice. - This is the first round, right?

1554
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,389
- Yes. - I think these two can go.

1555
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,300
Can I suggest the hook for this?

1556
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,730
This one? How?

1557
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:14,238
I live for romance and die for romance again

1558
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,698
I live for romance and die for romance again

1559
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,039
Isn't it nice?

1560
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:20,980
I think it's nice because it sounds similar.

1561
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,609
(Block 5 continues to listen to the beats.)

1562
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,050
Who can do this one?

1563
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,118
I don't remember my verses now.

1564
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,650
I have some, but I think they'll be short.

1565
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,089
We had new members.

1566
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,988
We had a new leader too.

1567
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm not sure if OSUN would be proactive.

1568
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,730
Owen and OSUN for number five.

1569
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,158
Owen and OSUN? Right.

1570
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,929
- Good. - We're Block Five.

1571
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:46,900
A Korean mad in rap, I let the tackles go through

1572
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,268
I can't stand the awkwardness

1573
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:50,939
The country is still

1574
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,670
- We are on - He raps well.

1575
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,578
- He's good. - Throw it out

1576
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:56,109
Before it changes

1577
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,779
I think I can go after JP.

1578
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,649
- After me? - After the eight bars.

1579
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,018
Let's all change our identities and have fun

1580
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:03,948
- This is nice. - All that's left are apple trees.

1581
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:06,249
I enter with my verse after resting for two beats.

1582
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,618
Should I be like this and suddenly rap?

1583
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,959
Can you show your middle finger as you start?

1584
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,988
- While you go. - As if to say that was a lie.

1585
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,359
- Okay. - That's nice.

1586
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Pretend like you messed up the words.

1587
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,069
Give me the word

1588
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,899
(Block 5 practices using OSUN and Owen's idea.)

1589
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,570
Where is the ball?

1590
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,440
Hating and pooping on you

1591
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,539
Very busy, Page 16

1592
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,340
That's the best.

1593
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,109
It's legendary.

1594
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,879
We'll put this at the end, so it'll be good.

1595
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,379
- It would stick at the end. - Right.

1596
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,919
- You have a plan. - What?

1597
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,320
You have a plan.

1598
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:38,690
- I do. - A plan for the future.

1599
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:42,018
I like that OSUN...

1600
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,118
became the leader.

1601
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,029
He listens well, and it's easy to talk to him.

1602
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,058
He was enjoying it at his pace.

1603
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:49,530
He had a clear character.

1604
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,069
- I plant an apple tree - Plant it

1605
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,670
I give it to them

1606
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:56,738
(Block 5 is practicing until late at night.)

1607
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:58,509
I still can't

1608
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,139
We can hold hands at the front

1609
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,009
and stand like making a barrier.

1610
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,538
We can stretch it...

1611
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,549
- so they can't touch it. - This would be fun.

1612
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,549
You can think of us as the fence.

1613
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,218
- Like this. - That's nice.

1614
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,518
- Nice. - I think that would be nice.

1615
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:11,519
Okay.

1616
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,959
It felt like the block became more complete...

1617
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,429
after Owen joined the block.

1618
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,230
When should we meet on Saturday? Okay.

1619
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,199
Even if we make plans, I have no business with you

1620
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:26,999
Wait.

1621
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,269
- He prepared a lot. - I know.

1622
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:32,170
- It's amazing, right? - We have great teamwork.

1623
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,239
People who rap well like people who rap well.

1624
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,009
After we received the mission, we barely rested.

1625
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,579
We practiced until 4am.

1626
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:45,650
All we thought was to show them the best we can.

1627
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,218
- Okay. - Well done.

1628
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,460
Well done.

1629
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,189
After I switched teams,

1630
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,729
I thought I should do well since I was the leader.

1631
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,730
I'll nail it.

1632
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:58,169
They've been maintaining it for too long now.

1633
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,099
It's about time some of them went home.

1634
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:04,069
Shall we all gather?

1635
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,468
- Focus, everyone. - Okay.

1636
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:06,980
Focus, kids. Come on.

1637
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,840
- Kids? - Sorry.

1638
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:11,079
They're not kids. They're our cool guys.

1639
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,579
Honestly, the team almost broke up.

1640
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,719
I'll be the trash.

1641
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,090
After SINCE suddenly left...

1642
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,760
I'm thinking about it.

1643
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:26,090
- I have a similar thought. - I think we have the same thought.

1644
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,229
PUNCHNELLO and Boi B...

1645
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,698
might be leaving the block.

1646
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:32,299
Then our block would become really weak.

1647
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,500
I acted while thinking of the worst-case scenario.

1648
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,210
(Should we change the leader first?)

1649
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,808
After I became the leader, it was clear what I had to do.

1650
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,709
I had to look for more rappers to recruit for our team.

1651
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,579
(If you join us, I can promise you that our performance will be great.)

1652
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,319
Come on in.

1653
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,988
(In the end, skyminhyuk recruited 99' Nasty Kidz.)

1654
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,788
In the end, Boi B and PUNCHNELLO said...

1655
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:59,589
that they weren't going to leave. I was grateful for their decision.

1656
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:03,459
We can show other blocks that we're also a strong team...

1657
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,468
as long as we prepared good performances for the next mission.

1658
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:09,868
Our block has many combinations other blocks might find refreshing.

1659
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:12,610
So I was feeling confident.

1660
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,839
There's something I want our block to focus on.

1661
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,178
The rappers who aren't performing should shout out the punchline...

1662
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,109
- together at least once. - That sounds good.

1663
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,948
- This will keep their energy down. - Right.

1664
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:24,988
We just have to practice. I'm sure we can catch up then.

1665
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:26,819
Let's come up with a lot of punchlines.

1666
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,718
You know what? This guy is...

1667
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,058
- Right. - Yes.

1668
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:31,388
- He's a great dancer. - He can hype up our performance.

1669
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:32,788
- Gosh. Then... - He's a great dancer.

1670
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,129
Remember how Daniel did twerking during our performance?

1671
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,729
- Gosh. Can you do that too? - Twerking?

1672
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,629
We're not talking about twerking. You can do breakdancing.

1673
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,768
- You can do everything you want. - Or you can do steps and perform.

1674
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:42,769
What about you, VIIN?

1675
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,069
- I can do some steps too. - VIIN is a great dancer too.

1676
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,238
Anyway, Block Five will probably focus more on individual rap.

1677
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,908
I think they'll focus more on their own thing...

1678
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:52,579
- rather than a team performance. - So...

1679
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,948
- I'll summarize it and share it. - Okay.

1680
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,749
If you need to practice, you can start now.

1681
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,789
Okay.

1682
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:01,419
If I can do a good job at showcasing the strength...

1683
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,518
of each rapper on our team,

1684
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,328
losing SINCE...

1685
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:07,859
would actually work in our favor.

1686
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,699
So I had a bigger sense of responsibility.

1687
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,368
Who wants to take the first round? You should see if you can do it.

1688
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,598
To surprise them, you guys should take the first round.

1689
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,709
- Right. I agree. - That's true.

1690
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:20,839
People don't know what kind of rapper they are.

1691
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,121
- They'll be a breath of fresh air. - Right. Those two...

1692
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:25,349
The rappers on our block...

1693
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,779
tried to give me and VIIN a lot of chances...

1694
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,849
because we didn't get a chance to rap after the Mask Off.

1695
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,719
(During Block Breaker, Block 4 versus Block 5)

1696
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,530
(I didn't even get to rap. It's already over.)

1697
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:41,529
(During Block Tournament, Block 4 versus Block 1)

1698
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,599
Great.

1699
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:47,269
I really wanted to rap, but I never got a chance.

1700
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,198
I didn't let it show,

1701
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,769
but I was a bit frustrated.

1702
01:02:51,909 --> 01:02:53,670
When will we get to rap?

1703
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,679
Gosh, I have no idea.

1704
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,380
I'm not sure if we'll get a chance.

1705
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,618
I wanted to rap for the other rappers on the show.

1706
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:05,090
I'm really happy to get a chance to be able to rap on stage.

1707
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,988
The first thing that crossed my mind was...

1708
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:08,820
to take initiative to be in the performances.

1709
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,158
One of my verses starts like this. "Hey."

1710
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,828
- I'll just put that in. - That's nice.

1711
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:16,328
- We can start after that. - That's great.

1712
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:17,399
Or how about this?

1713
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,429
(VIIN and Kim Ryul actively share ideas.)

1714
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,570
- I see. Then it'd be perfect. - Oh, my.

1715
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:25,569
It's a bit embarrassing, but should we do the Hit Dem Folks?

1716
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,738
- The Hit Dem Folks? - Yes.

1717
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:28,880
(What will Kim Ryul say?)

1718
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:33,579
(He answers with his body rather than in words.)

1719
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:38,949
- That's good. - I'll stand next to you.

1720
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,319
(The two of them share ideas for the performance.)

1721
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,359
I'll go like this.

1722
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,459
- Afterward, you can... - Then I'll do this and keep up.

1723
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,030
Yes. That would be perfect.

1724
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,399
Walking it, racing, but I won't stop

1725
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,928
(Amazed)

1726
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:54,868
I could tell that Ryul and VIIN were excited that they had a chance...

1727
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:57,440
to perform in front of the other rappers.

1728
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:01,178
We're going to reveal our hidden gems...

1729
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:02,678
and lead the performances.

1730
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:03,779
Start here?

1731
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,678
(Block 4 works on their team performance.)

1732
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,879
- Shock - Shock

1733
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,718
I bet Block Five is thinking, "We can just kill it with our rap."

1734
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:14,158
"We can beat them with our rap."

1735
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:15,820
They're probably focused on that idea.

1736
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:17,759
Just sing it like crazy

1737
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,360
But we tried our best to focus on putting on great performances.

1738
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,860
If we show them...

1739
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,368
interesting performances with a lot of fun factors,

1740
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:28,468
we would leave a good impression.

1741
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,969
So that's the strategy we're working on.

1742
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:33,710
- Gosh, this is so fun! - It's going to be fun.

1743
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:36,238
- I can't wait to do it. - My gosh.

1744
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,650
Goodness, I can't wait to perform.

1745
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:41,679
Everyone will be surprised if we perform like this on stage.

1746
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,519
I'm looking forward to it.

1747
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,119
I thought, "Block Four's teamwork is pretty good."

1748
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,690
I can finally rap.

1749
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,260
I'm going to show them.

1750
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,340
We'll beat Block Five no matter what.

1751
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,328
No one from Block Four will get eliminated.

1752
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:56,699
We'll continue to survive.

1753
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,599
Ready.

1754
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,829
My gosh.

1755
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:01,799
Start.

1756
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,110
Five Stars, let's go. DJ, drop the beat.

1757
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,939
(Block 5 performs first.)

1758
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,209
Even if I die today

1759
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,479
- I'll plant an apple tree - Plant it

1760
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,049
I pave my path, and my friends push me forward

1761
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,249
No one tells me what to do, I'm independent

1762
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,678
They put him in charge

1763
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:14,679
He tightened up his ship...

1764
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:15,679
- but lost his gem - Look at him

1765
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,319
There are no perfect leaders now

1766
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,988
- But I'm your girlfriend's leader - Cool

1767
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:20,689
- I'm not humble, don't ask my size - I can suddenly hear everything.

1768
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,319
You can still hear my voice even if I'm in cuffs

1769
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,888
Alcohol, nicotine, coffee, and kiss

1770
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:25,689
- Isn't this the reason we live? - Hey

1771
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,299
We were on the verge of death a few times

1772
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,058
We can't slip now, let's focus

1773
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,558
Who said 0 times 100 is 0?

1774
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,399
I came here empty-handed, but I've got everything

1775
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,098
Starred, scripted, and credit by Luci Gang

1776
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:35,768
- A movie with a one lead actor - A movie

1777
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:37,439
The plot is about a self-made woman who started from the bottom

1778
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,109
Bottom to the top, you can cry when you watch it

1779
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,109
Even if I die as an ace, I'll leave behind the spirit of D

1780
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,538
- My fan is Monkey D. Luffy - Hey

1781
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,049
- When I'm gone - When I'm gone

1782
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,779
- Write Luci Gang on the tombstone - Write it

1783
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,249
- When I'm gone - When I'm gone

1784
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,218
- Write JP on the tombstone - Say

1785
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:50,718
- When I'm gone - When I'm gone

1786
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,618
- Write Luci Gang on the tombstone - What?

1787
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:53,988
- When I'm gone - When I'm gone

1788
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:55,788
- Write JP on the tombstone - Yes, JP

1789
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:58,129
Kind of nonsense, fly without the feet off the ground

1790
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,859
Are you part of this? I'll mess up you all night

1791
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,229
Trying to get this money off the hills

1792
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,129
I might need some sleep, but we're about to sauce it

1793
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,729
Wait, you've got to go and do your dirty business

1794
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,368
Go ahead and do it, what have you been on?

1795
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,038
No clue, but I'm sure that I'm about to get beaten up

1796
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:10,038
By these few stupid clout chasing fools

1797
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:12,709
What have I realized after looking at my silly self?

1798
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:14,078
I don't know, but what should I do more?

1799
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,079
I'd rather smear poop on my face

1800
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,079
- Than be on the same level as you - Do it

1801
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,549
They are the worst, after I run away, I do something

1802
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,049
It's a mess anyway, everyone seems to be in a frenzy

1803
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,980
You're messing with the wrong faith, Illuminati

1804
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,219
He's good.

1805
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:30,319
JP already rapped a lot on the show.

1806
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,359
But it's still nice...

1807
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,666
- to listen to him. - That guy is consistent.

1808
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:33,960
DJ. Drop the beat.

1809
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,859
(Block 4 performs next.)

1810
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,070
My gosh. What's going on?

1811
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,209
- Gosh. - Okay.

1812
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,809
Okay.

1813
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,439
Where did all the chatterboxes go?

1814
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,948
I've been patient and am here to show you

1815
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:52,949
- We'll finally get to hear him rap. - So what if you're pretty?

1816
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:53,949
But you're annoying

1817
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,518
If you kill, you end up in prison

1818
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:57,218
I wanted to show off my rap too

1819
01:06:57,219 --> 01:06:59,189
- But they won't let me be - Nice.

1820
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:00,988
It's the birth of a rap master, I'm new

1821
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:03,260
I can cut these guys all in halves

1822
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,388
Of course

1823
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,129
- That's just me - Yes!

1824
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,899
- I get it done when I say I will - Hey!

1825
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,598
- Yes, run that - Hey!

1826
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:12,268
- I wrote this rap - Hey!

1827
01:07:12,269 --> 01:07:13,868
- In one day - Hey!

1828
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,800
- I get it done when I say I will - Hey!

1829
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:17,669
Hey, I'm done playing, I said

1830
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,070
People tell me to sit tight

1831
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,709
I'm saying, cover your face

1832
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,209
Your facial expression changed

1833
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,348
- Hey! - Hey!

1834
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:25,649
You're drowning

1835
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,779
- When I tell the others, - He danced.

1836
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,819
They react the same way

1837
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,879
I'm not even halfway there yet, you still got to say?

1838
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,118
Hey, shoot, let's go, I got this

1839
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,158
Yes, I'm still running

1840
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:36,558
- There's always a light at night - Great!

1841
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:37,629
Is that a warning? You're asking me that again

1842
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,129
- My gosh, they're fighting. - I tell you to your face

1843
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,736
- That we're not like you - They're fighting.

1844
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,759
Walking it, racing, but I won't stop

1845
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,729
I'll be chasing slowly, they want to know about me

1846
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,229
- Try to tap me out - He's good.

1847
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,230
- You've got nothing to say - He's good!

1848
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,512
You keep looking at the sky wondering if you'll get lucky

1849
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:51,709
Oh, shoot, 100 times,

1850
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,808
There were a lot of things you wanted to say

1851
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:53,969
But you couldn't say anything

1852
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,908
Just remember that for that moment

1853
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,039
I know that's a nobody

1854
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,050
That was nice!

1855
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,948
- Hey, he's good. - You mean VIIN?

1856
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:04,288
- Yes, I told you! - He's good!

1857
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,618
- I told you he was good! - Why didn't they let him rap?

1858
01:08:05,619 --> 01:08:07,590
The two of them will get their spotlight now.

1859
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,420
Give us the beat now. Let's go.

1860
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,058
He's angry.

1861
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,189
- JP is angry. - It's been a crazy year

1862
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,828
I'm exhausted, I'm going to stay out, So I'm not taunted

1863
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,499
Anything I inhale feels so toxic

1864
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,799
Toxins are eating me up, now I'm locked in

1865
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,139
I'm spending more hours on this, take a cold shower

1866
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,969
I'm shaking my head own, I see the bottom

1867
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,868
I'm good, don't you bother, I cleanse off my sins

1868
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:25,938
Give me your head

1869
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,538
I won't cave in now that I know better

1870
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,139
More pain more gain is my motto

1871
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,148
This shrimp is going to get bigger

1872
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,179
- Says Jin Yang Cheol - Jin Yang Cheol

1873
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,318
You're doing this for fun, but this is a matter of survival

1874
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,978
Those pretenders say

1875
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,618
- Hip-hop is dead - Hip-hop is dead

1876
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:40,118
What are you saying? I'm back, still alive and breathing

1877
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,559
- Like Oh Tae Sik - Like Oh Tae Sik

1878
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,658
Unstoppable like Noriaki

1879
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:45,559
I'm an OG restaurant that's been open for 27 years

1880
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,499
Among the chain restaurants that are about to close down

1881
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,059
I'm elevated to the sky

1882
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,629
- I don't see any bottom floors - Floors

1883
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,368
- Okay. - Honey, how far will you let me go?

1884
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,438
- Let me know - Let me know

1885
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:55,469
- Wake me up - Wake me up

1886
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,799
When the sun comes up

1887
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,169
- I need another blow - Another blow

1888
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,639
Pass it up and focus on the progress

1889
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,139
Don't you let me choke

1890
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:05,478
I'm elevated to the sky, I don't see any bottom floors

1891
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:07,278
Honey, how far will you let me go?

1892
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,049
- Let me know - Let me know

1893
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,078
- Wake me up - Wake me up

1894
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,389
When the sun comes up

1895
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,719
- I need another blow - Another blow

1896
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,988
Pass it up and focus on the progress

1897
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:16,318
Don't you let me choke

1898
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,590
- Choke - Okay.

1899
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,460
Drop it.

1900
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,228
(Block 4 will perform next.)

1901
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:24,270
He'll perform right away.

1902
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:26,369
I'm really curious what they're going to do.

1903
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:32,809
Good time, I used to get on Line Two to perform in Hongdae

1904
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,679
Good time, I used to sit in my Carnival

1905
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,538
And turn on the Bluetooth speaker like I owned the world

1906
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,278
I was always suspicious, but the reason changed every time

1907
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,849
I don't care about that anymore

1908
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,118
We party and mess up, even when the months go by

1909
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:44,919
I'll be the same, always true to myself

1910
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,818
- Hoping it would always be the same - Hoping it would always be the same

1911
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:48,318
Just like love and sex aren't the same thing

1912
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,818
- I'll continue what I said - I see. So that's their strategy.

1913
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,328
In the back of my classroom for the first time

1914
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:54,299
Good time, raise the glasses for all of our dreams

1915
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,429
- Boi B. - Good time, raise the glasses

1916
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,528
- For the dreams of the eyebrows - Yes!

1917
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:00,299
We're up and say "adios" to the long tunnel

1918
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,139
Get rid of all the bad energy that's denying me

1919
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,068
So sweet is the syrup on the pancakes

1920
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:05,868
Maybe, life is sweeter than we think

1921
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,209
I'm in the beat

1922
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,778
- My microphone is on my left hand - His lyrics are crazy.

1923
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:09,879
Yes, you already know

1924
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,849
Now, signed, sealed, and delivered, You can open it

1925
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,648
- Where's my soul? - What was that?

1926
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:19,849
- I still remember this frame - Darn it. I got goosebumps.

1927
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:22,658
I want to forget it, but I still miss it

1928
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:24,929
- I can't stop thinking about it - Hey.

1929
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,459
- Where's my soul? - She's interesting.

1930
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,658
- Where's my soul? - Yes

1931
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:30,198
Hello, my pretty girl, good morning, baby

1932
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,929
Even if we're far away, our chemistry is hot

1933
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,629
I'm busy, but I made time and came to see you

1934
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,669
Don't compare me to those guys because I'm different

1935
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,438
Okay, it's your birthday, I'll surprise you

1936
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:39,209
I wrote this song in one day, and this is for you

1937
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,978
My adrenaline keeps rushing out, I'll keep recording

1938
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:43,139
I want to be cool, so I wear perfume

1939
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,908
It's not the US, but I party in Korea

1940
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:46,778
I must succeed, so I can go to a different country

1941
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:48,648
Topping the Billboard Charts is a given, I aim higher

1942
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:50,519
I don't think I'm far, though

1943
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,349
Okay, money is coming at you

1944
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,219
- Okay, I must join the big league - COCONA is good.

1945
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,019
You're my one and only artwork, my collection

1946
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,858
- You can show off your fashion - Let's go.

1947
01:10:57,859 --> 01:10:59,728
Okay, money is coming at you

1948
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,559
- Okay, I must join the big league - Okay

1949
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,158
You're my one and only artwork, My collection

1950
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:05,430
- You can show off your fashion - Okay

1951
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,399
Yes, that's what's up

1952
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,368
Yes, that's what's up

1953
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,969
- COCONA, don't be quiet! - Amazing!

1954
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,438
What was that, COCONA?

1955
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,839
- COCONA! I believed in you! - COCONA! I'll call you.

1956
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,538
- It's pretty good. - She had to sing.

1957
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,608
It's only Round Two.

1958
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:19,449
My gosh, I'm so relieved.

1959
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,980
Block Five is going to do something too.

1960
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,350
- What's this? - What is this?

1961
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,350
- Security, cover them up. - What's going on?

1962
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:26,419
Drop the beat now!

1963
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,519
(Block 5 will perform.)

1964
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,720
They're going to do something.

1965
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:35,429
Where am I? I wake up as usual

1966
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,228
- I can't go away from this paradise - Paradise

1967
01:11:37,229 --> 01:11:38,728
Either die or take it, bring it and cry

1968
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,228
- You'd better cry like - Better cry like

1969
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,868
Who, only good ones will survive

1970
01:11:42,869 --> 01:11:44,769
No matter how things changed

1971
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,810
- Only the weak ones beg - Beg

1972
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:48,938
You left your credit as if you were chased out

1973
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:51,049
Your rap means nothing like humming and scatting

1974
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,749
- At the beginning of my fall - My gosh, he's such a good rapper.

1975
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,549
I don't have a place to lie down comfortably

1976
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,818
But I'm not falling back

1977
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:57,719
I look at my old self when I was driven by my energy

1978
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,648
Revenge and success, I've got two things on mind

1979
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,520
I majored in two subjects, I'm a multi-tasker

1980
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:04,288
The one and only, get lost if you're not a buyer

1981
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:06,188
When my story opens, Pandora's box opens

1982
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:07,629
- By the way, - Even when I get cheated,

1983
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:08,929
- I'm back on my feet - he's such a great rapper.

1984
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,228
- Through the wire - He's so good.

1985
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:11,568
Stay still, it's not a trial

1986
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:12,828
- A creepy choir - I'll protect you guys.

1987
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:13,969
- Signals my resurrection. - I'll protect you. Don't come.

1988
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,469
- I'll protect you. - "How could he?" I'm a mystery

1989
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,908
Like the grand mystery from the ancient Maya

1990
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:19,669
It's as if I've become Dante, I made it

1991
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,179
I began writing at 16, I'm with it

1992
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,009
I still need more information to end the story

1993
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,749
You'd better shut it before I release it, shut it

1994
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,648
Whom can I trust? Throw money at them as bait

1995
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:28,578
Put everything you got on the table, come on more, feed the kitty

1996
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:30,478
I put my 20s into the pages before I forget those days

1997
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,488
Feel like Dante, it's still awful when it gets published

1998
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:33,948
But I won't speak

1999
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:36,118
Because look at my inbox, they're all paparazzi

2000
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:37,788
They say I must be miserable, but I made a fortune

2001
01:12:37,789 --> 01:12:39,828
But guess what crossed my mind, I'm far from finishing it

2002
01:12:39,829 --> 01:12:41,228
I'm only on Chapter One, Yeouido, my quiet sanctuary

2003
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:42,499
- How did he do that? - I park my ride there

2004
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,469
I was a valet before I wrote my book and my mom

2005
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:45,499
Wanted me to be an alchemist

2006
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,839
In the end, I got it back, the gold from the economic crisis

2007
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,669
- Do I deserve - Do I deserve

2008
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,568
Maybe, that's a dangerous question

2009
01:12:51,569 --> 01:12:53,469
I still write, like I feel Dante

2010
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,839
I pop up at fake emotions, like it's misery

2011
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,538
The information is all out there

2012
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,108
It will come true if I keep at it

2013
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:00,809
- I'll keep them safe. - Maybe, their diary

2014
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,578
- Was also a novel in the beginning - She's a great ally to have.

2015
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:06,148
- Where am I? I wake up as usual - Wake up

2016
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:07,889
- I can never leave this paradise - Paradise

2017
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,759
- Paradise - Either die or take it and bring it

2018
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,188
- You'd better cry like - Bring it

2019
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:13,589
Only good ones will survive

2020
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,328
No matter how things changed

2021
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,158
- Only the weak ones beg - Beg

2022
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,170
Go tell them now

2023
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,069
- That was fun. - Right?

2024
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,198
Block Five has great rappers.

2025
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:25,868
- They're so good. - They're good.

2026
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:27,039
They're neck and neck.

2027
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,579
I think he's up to something.

2028
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:29,880
Drop the beat.

2029
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,449
(Block 4 performs next.)

2030
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,349
Hey, motivation

2031
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,019
I'm getting into this war

2032
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,549
Hey, watch out

2033
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,688
I'm the one to beat

2034
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,389
- Hey - Hey, I'm fooling you

2035
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:44,559
I'm fooling the higher-ups

2036
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,929
You're all in on it together

2037
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,828
Now that I'm here, you'd better give up

2038
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,099
Go and cry in the corner, my mind

2039
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,969
Being born was the penalty for you

2040
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,868
Just install my stage

2041
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:56,738
And just wipe the dust here

2042
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,709
Go to church instead of your recording studio

2043
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,538
I'll keep making my babies

2044
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:02,408
But you've been here too long

2045
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:03,909
We should be friends

2046
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:06,778
It's a long life for me to put up with your nonsense

2047
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:08,648
I will kill you on the cutting board

2048
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:10,519
Even when you breathe, it's far

2049
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,389
- I control you and all your money - Hey.

2050
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,049
Where are you?

2051
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,019
You're on your enemy's camp, ready to die

2052
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,929
Bad memories push me again

2053
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:19,959
But I won't beg like that time

2054
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,799
Dive into them, into their necks

2055
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,658
- Slay them, but it's chaos - This is his signature vibe.

2056
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,129
I can't find the answer

2057
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,599
I want a stakeout to catch you next time

2058
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,538
The play is over, check the time

2059
01:14:28,539 --> 01:14:30,339
It's raining on the hill in the back

2060
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,209
You kill the cockroaches

2061
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,108
As if they're nothing, why are you making a fuss now?

2062
01:14:34,109 --> 01:14:35,879
All lives are equal

2063
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,679
Insects and you better bow down to me

2064
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,549
You kill them when you don't need them

2065
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,519
If you don't want to die, just watch

2066
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,278
This is how it is in Korea

2067
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,188
Why are you acting surprised? How ridiculous

2068
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,488
Hey, motivation

2069
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:48,288
I'm getting into this war

2070
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:49,889
- Hey, watch out - Hey

2071
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,889
- I'm the one to beat - Hey

2072
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,389
- Hey - Hey, I'm fooling you

2073
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,599
- I'm fooling the higher-ups - Hey

2074
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,858
You're all in on it together

2075
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:57,999
- Now that I'm here - He got this one.

2076
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,170
You'd better give up

2077
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:00,600
You witch!

2078
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,799
- Man. - My gosh.

2079
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,299
Block Four has good performers.

2080
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,368
- They're so good. - Right.

2081
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:06,609
They're determined to win.

2082
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,078
- They're totally determined. - Yes, they are.

2083
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:09,409
This is crazy.

2084
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:11,810
Gather up. Let's go.

2085
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,050
My gosh, this is so fun.

2086
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:15,319
I'm nervous.

2087
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,979
Bring the beat, man. Let's go.

2088
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,550
(Block 5 begins performing.)

2089
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,119
Gosh, this is the beat?

2090
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,559
Stuck in this loop

2091
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,658
If you blink

2092
01:15:26,659 --> 01:15:27,728
- You'll miss my next move - Move

2093
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:29,129
You're all trying to hide the truth

2094
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,698
Those little ones grow up to do the same thing

2095
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:32,299
Grounding all day to get a better impulse

2096
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,068
While training, it exploded like Mentos

2097
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:35,868
In Coke, I don't know much about myself

2098
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:37,799
But I never accepted any help

2099
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,509
Oh, make a pose, I got no hours left until my chores

2100
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,778
- To mess it all up - You fool

2101
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:43,509
It's a dog-eat-dog world anyway

2102
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,209
- You got to climb up in the system - System

2103
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,809
I've been too tough on youngsters

2104
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,448
- Don't worry, keep your conviction - Conviction

2105
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:50,849
Paint the picture from a blank canvas with nothing on it

2106
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:51,889
- Let's go - Hey

2107
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,688
Yes, I'm careful, one, two, three

2108
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:54,689
- Tap and take another - Take another

2109
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,288
When you smile, good luck comes, say cheese

2110
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:58,089
My dollar keeps splitting as if I cloned them

2111
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,759
You take a picture from the bottom, keep the angle diagonal

2112
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,599
Because she's so fly, She flies higher than Icarius

2113
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,059
Even if I mess it up, I still rock with my usual beat

2114
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,068
I can write masterpieces as long as I have two bars, look

2115
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:06,799
Me, 35, from the Andong Kwon clan

2116
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,438
I'll slit off the oldies' necks

2117
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,269
- Let's swap positions and have fun - Have fun

2118
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,809
Give me the royal meal, and you can pack up the leftovers

2119
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,669
- My parents made me - Hey, you're good.

2120
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,278
Their no expectations brought them fortune

2121
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,978
Look at your short pants

2122
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:18,909
- He's got raw energy too. - Who's your daddy?

2123
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,180
Fresh

2124
01:16:20,181 --> 01:16:21,519
I don't need to do a microphone check

2125
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,879
After my cigarette break

2126
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,519
There's no doubt with me, A rookie? Get rid of it

2127
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,188
Like a parking ticket

2128
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:27,389
I'll be at the top first

2129
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,188
I kill, I'm gentle with the nice thing

2130
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:30,919
Your hot head needs an ice pack

2131
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,959
Unfortunately, I'm also known as the Golden Boy

2132
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,459
It looks like you're about to fall just like the cake on display

2133
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,259
Their mindset is like that of stupid carp

2134
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,868
When they rap, they stutter, they're mere successful hype men

2135
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:41,269
All right, then show me what you got like you did

2136
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,640
On "Show Me the Money 9"

2137
01:16:42,869 --> 01:16:44,969
You may be all over the stage, but no one can tell who's who

2138
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,970
Your fans ought to take a blind test

2139
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,380
- Oh, my. - Hey.

2140
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,079
- Goodness! - Oh, my!

2141
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,948
- Hey. - Oh, my.

2142
01:16:54,949 --> 01:16:56,649
What was that? I just got goosebumps.

2143
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,118
Hey, my brain got goosebumps.

2144
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,589
- He totally won this one. - He just crushed them to pieces.

2145
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,460
- Quiet now. - Drop the beat now.

2146
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:05,659
Let's go.

2147
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:10,100
(Block 4 will perform next.)

2148
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,930
- Is she going to rap? - Gosh, she's so annoying.

2149
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,979
- What? - I can't watch it.

2150
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:26,379
- I can't watch this. - Khundi Panda.

2151
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,078
- He's so scary. - Are they going to perform now?

2152
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:29,350
- Will they perform? - Yes.

2153
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:31,049
- It's their turn. - I can't wait.

2154
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,050
Stretch out the red carpet

2155
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:33,549
I've already mastered walking

2156
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,259
I hang a lot of trophies in my room

2157
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,788
The air feels fresh now, I have to be careful when watching

2158
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:38,959
- P2P - MIC SWAG

2159
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,259
- The Rise - Those on an elite course

2160
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,599
- Let's trample on them - HIPHOPLE to rise the most

2161
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,259
Who cares about those flies?

2162
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,969
I'm the boss, so you'd better care

2163
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,669
One look at my juniors, I know how they are

2164
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,368
Lock down every door right now, if we're not the ones

2165
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:51,169
- To judge, it would irritate us - Like crazy

2166
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,738
Follow me with everything we're going to do

2167
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:53,739
- Everywhere we want to go - They're good.

2168
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,278
- You get us in a bite like a bagel - That's so cool.

2169
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:56,938
I'm on a party watch where alcohol runs out fast

2170
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,249
- Who goes through? - I got brand new moves

2171
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,549
We do it so rude

2172
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,379
We're so nasty, what?

2173
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,919
How did you make this cool?

2174
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,219
I just kept working like a dog

2175
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,549
Embarrassing rappers hate our legacy, don't act like

2176
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,219
We don't matter, fools, You should just keep pushing

2177
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,188
- You've got to smack that - Take your money in one scoop

2178
01:18:10,189 --> 01:18:11,858
You should really need to care about our basic root

2179
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,728
- Make body bags - Body bags

2180
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:15,499
- Body bags - Body bags

2181
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,158
How cruel, you pull out your foot like how the knife pierces through

2182
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:18,568
I always cover up my vital points to survive

2183
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:20,228
No more playing hide-and-seek, because I already did that

2184
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,470
- Stab - Stab

2185
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,470
- Stab - Stab

2186
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,680
What?

2187
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,649
I've had enough.

2188
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,979
- Oh, my! - I've had enough.

2189
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:37,119
I don't believe it!

2190
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,648
I'm tearing up.

2191
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:40,420
- There were so many highlights. - My gosh.

2192
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,060
- That was good. - Nice.

2193
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,559
For not-so-famous rappers like us...

2194
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,959
to go after famous rappers like them,

2195
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,688
this is what we have to bring to the table, guys.

2196
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,630
You'd be great if you just don't talk.

2197
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,568
- I'm sorry. - That was great.

2198
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:53,569
Drop the beat.

2199
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:54,969
(Block 5 will start performing.)

2200
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,969
- Hello? - Owen.

2201
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,270
- What? RAP: PUBLIC? - Hey.

2202
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:02,108
I see. You want me to watch Block Four's performance? Okay.

2203
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:03,978
Don't rush me. I'm on my way.

2204
01:19:03,979 --> 01:19:06,350
- I promise. Here. - Swag

2205
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:08,219
Even if you're on my schedule, I'll have nothing to do with you

2206
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,919
- That I promise you - Promise you

2207
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,618
If you doubt my blueprint,

2208
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:13,318
- I'm going to perish you - Perish you

2209
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:14,889
There's no way I'll lose my touch

2210
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,460
- I'm on a parachute - Parachute

2211
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,389
Don't you play me, if you're real, then I'm going to be real

2212
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,430
- With you - With you

2213
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:21,929
Name the price first, the color of my heart is black

2214
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,629
- It's pretty expensive - Expensive

2215
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,368
If you back me up, I'll do the same

2216
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:27,169
Keep the street code That's my peace sign

2217
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:30,099
Skin the back tree, roll it, make a bonfire, and gather up

2218
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,139
- Yes - I can't stop now

2219
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,238
- Delete your fake friends right now - Right now

2220
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:37,408
Oh, what got you into thinking

2221
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:38,879
- It's your time now? - What's your time now

2222
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,979
A timeout

2223
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,948
It's me under the limelight, your lyrics are empty words

2224
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:44,179
Just an empty magazine

2225
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,818
I can't see eye to eye with these kids

2226
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:47,448
I think those fools have nothing in their heads

2227
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,059
- My mom always fed me full - His voice is so cool.

2228
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,089
I got what those kids want

2229
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,759
Koreans are all about looking pretty and fancy

2230
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,389
But that's not me, I can easily dodge an attack

2231
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:57,228
I can't stand being awkward, I still sell my CDs in other countries

2232
01:19:57,229 --> 01:19:59,528
They say I'm from the street, how ridiculous is that?

2233
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:01,269
- You carry a knife, you witch - You witch

2234
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,898
Once I'm on the stage, I'll cut your throats

2235
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:04,769
Not with a knife but with microphones

2236
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,368
I don't care if it goes under or over

2237
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,089
Whatever you think is cool is the real deal

2238
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,749
I got a commercial, I could've become a businessman

2239
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,779
Remove the makeup, I'd better see myself at 16

2240
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:16,618
So your fans want to talk to you? Don't be a fool

2241
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:18,149
You're not a celebrity

2242
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,188
I'm stacking my payments, I'm trying to mess with them

2243
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:22,089
Go bring them, someone to close in the gaps

2244
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:24,059
You'd better sharpen your instincts before we switch the generation

2245
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,529
Take off the chain

2246
01:20:25,789 --> 01:20:29,299
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2247
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,698
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2248
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:36,139
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2249
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:39,568
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2250
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:43,009
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2251
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:46,478
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2252
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,818
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2253
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:53,288
- I live and die for romance - I live and die for romance

2254
01:20:53,289 --> 01:20:54,889
Block Five, let's go.

2255
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,618
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

2256
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,260
- They were so cool. - OSUN was amazing.

2257
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,159
- He's cool. - OSUN is cool.

2258
01:21:00,859 --> 01:21:02,358
- It's fun. - Right?

2259
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:04,158
- It's really fun. - It's fun.

2260
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,199
Let's start right away.

2261
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,800
This one's real.

2262
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,769
Was it fake until now?

2263
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,869
I know, right?

2264
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:12,809
(Block 4 starts performing next.)

2265
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:16,278
Yes, Asian raindrop, the other rappers' compensation

2266
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:19,578
We're the wheels of Carnival, the wheels rode the whole country

2267
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:23,148
From a rented room to the rooftop, clink the glasses together

2268
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:24,648
My iPhone always rings

2269
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:26,948
But don't expect me to reply

2270
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,618
Life is unfair, it's selfish

2271
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:30,259
Only the three of us get it

2272
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,419
- Look at Owen. He's so funny. - Despite

2273
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,589
My packed schedule, my girlfriend is so sweet

2274
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,199
Following the instincts

2275
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,500
The rapper who flunked five years ago with a dance song is back

2276
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,198
When I feel different from those walking down the path others have

2277
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,068
I say, "What?"

2278
01:21:45,069 --> 01:21:47,038
A new car contract is waiting for me

2279
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:50,608
Not talented and lazy are far from who I am

2280
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:53,478
I'm an iceboat breaking all the ice

2281
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:55,979
- Back - Back

2282
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,148
I know you want to be a gang, you keep looking up at my head

2283
01:21:59,149 --> 01:22:00,389
I said you're trying like a habit

2284
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,759
Too much showing, you copy me

2285
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,089
Even your outfit, just added baggy jeans

2286
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:07,129
Got too much headache, thinking how to take credit

2287
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,198
Saying this excuse again and selling the show

2288
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,199
I can sell it again, so what do you want?

2289
01:22:12,069 --> 01:22:15,038
I said, "Take this mic for sure," they say, "Wait, pause"

2290
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,568
Return it again, shoot it, and lay up, this is just basic

2291
01:22:17,569 --> 01:22:19,238
There are no twice in this part

2292
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,868
Top of the top, there's nowhere to go now

2293
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,608
It's too high that I can't breathe

2294
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:24,779
I've got a long way to go, so I take a short break

2295
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:30,179
- What? - What's that?

2296
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,289
- COCONA's addition is nice. - Back

2297
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,240
- We're going to hit like to back to - Her voice is great.

2298
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,118
- Back - Back

2299
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,188
- Back - Back

2300
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:41,858
- We're going to hit like to back to - Back

2301
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:43,759
- Back - Back

2302
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,929
- We're going to hit like to back to - Back

2303
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,969
- Back to back - Back to back

2304
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,799
- Back - Back

2305
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,709
- Back - Back

2306
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:54,310
- Let's go. - Back up, guys. Back up.

2307
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:57,608
Back

2308
01:22:57,609 --> 01:22:58,680
Back the heck up.

2309
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,850
Back the heck up.

2310
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:03,020
- He's serious. - Okay, chill.

2311
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:05,448
I can't decide.

2312
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:07,849
- What now? - I'm not sure who will win.

2313
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,859
Are you ready?

2314
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:10,960
DJ, let the beat drop.

2315
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:15,028
Hey

2316
01:23:15,029 --> 01:23:18,398
- Hey - Hey

2317
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:20,028
- Hey - Block Five, let's go

2318
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:21,868
Block Five, let's go

2319
01:23:21,869 --> 01:23:25,408
Owen, Hash Swan

2320
01:23:25,409 --> 01:23:28,379
There are bands in my Gucci, I bend the brim of a 50-hat

2321
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,108
In a way, we shop quite heavily

2322
01:23:30,109 --> 01:23:31,679
They ask who I am if I'm not resigning

2323
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,148
Benjamin Franklin, stop it since it's embarrassing

2324
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:35,818
Hunnit bands in the pocket, I forgot and hung it up again

2325
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:37,679
Illionaire way, Bition way, foreign car, foreign cash

2326
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,749
Not enough, I needed Porsche, next was Mercedes Benz

2327
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,459
I indulge myself, if you can't earn, the air turns

2328
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,788
- Cold - You're too mad to worry about me

2329
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:46,188
Nobody cares about your Hollywood living

2330
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,188
Your little sister became my fan

2331
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,999
I became a criticized celebrity in vain

2332
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,528
I had a short one-sided crush when I was young

2333
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:53,829
But now I'm her ex-boyfriend

2334
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:56,438
Do not enter, Bition boys play the pipe at the club

2335
01:23:56,439 --> 01:23:58,269
I'm completely cured of the fatal disease of remembering

2336
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,246
- Hash Swan is good. - The money lost without a source

2337
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:04,010
I keep earning, that's how we treat and honor the money we spent

2338
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,448
- Hey - Hey

2339
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:08,050
- We Bition boys - Hey

2340
01:24:08,779 --> 01:24:09,850
- Hey - Hey

2341
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:12,520
Hating and criticizing everyone

2342
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,688
Life is tough, pay feature DM

2343
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,389
I bet my life on it, going to make it rain

2344
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,259
This goose is from Canada, do the one-dance

2345
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,988
Holding up on my right hand

2346
01:24:19,989 --> 01:24:21,759
Evolve into a Dark Lord, possessed by Shin Hae Chul

2347
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,559
You know how sticky it gets, it's drizzy

2348
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,698
Dripping, either you're dripping or drowning

2349
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:27,699
Either in the zone or numb all over

2350
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,198
Vices, each person's sweet way

2351
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:32,169
Choose, decide, and check the next chapter

2352
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,608
I pray to the deity and seal my resolution

2353
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:35,068
Estimate value, no Amiri

2354
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,879
- Loaded with artistry, I'm serious - He's so good.

2355
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,108
Call up my sister

2356
01:24:38,109 --> 01:24:40,009
What's this song? It's Owen and Xrfy

2357
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,818
Quality check and the score is perfect again

2358
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:42,978
The limits are outside of Earth, a new genius

2359
01:24:42,979 --> 01:24:45,220
- He's so good. - You search hard like

2360
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,089
"How did he do that?"

2361
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,890
I win them all, there is no assortment

2362
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:50,658
- Trap singing, flowing boom bap - Boom bap

2363
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:52,858
Many faces, no, a poker face

2364
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:55,199
- Gosh. - Let's go.

2365
01:24:56,029 --> 01:24:57,158
Owen is unbelievable.

2366
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,569
- He's amazing. - Owen is incredible.

2367
01:24:59,729 --> 01:25:01,769
Owen is beyond great.

2368
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:03,610
He's good at rapping. He should be good at it.

2369
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,019
Give us the beat right away.

2370
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:09,479
(Block 4 will perform next.)

2371
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,710
Owen

2372
01:25:13,449 --> 01:25:14,479
Owen

2373
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,578
I don't mess with nobody

2374
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:18,318
Change flow, I change the flow and explode everything

2375
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:19,988
Let's get smashed and drunk, so what?

2376
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:21,889
I'll probably go to the fiery pit, not paradise

2377
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:23,389
- Pick out deadly words now - He's good.

2378
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,328
I make bombs with dull eyes

2379
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,158
Same old thing, nothing has changed

2380
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:28,828
Same old thing, pipe up like a machine

2381
01:25:28,829 --> 01:25:30,698
Same old thing, my notebook gets filled

2382
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:32,528
You're surely living in delusion

2383
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:34,198
Follow me, hurry up, leave the stragglers

2384
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:35,999
Keep up with my pace, walking drunk again

2385
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,738
I work and drink again to work

2386
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:39,639
What am I to these boys? An eyesore

2387
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,339
This spotlight, I'm fly, becoming more viral

2388
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,139
Feeling the vibe, yes, 9 to 5

2389
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,879
Drunk, high, cook it, fly

2390
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,679
Feeling the vibe, yes, 9 to 5

2391
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,519
Drunk, high, cook it, fly

2392
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,380
Feeling the vibe, yes, 9 to 5

2393
01:25:50,949 --> 01:25:52,318
Yes, 9 to 5

2394
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:54,119
- Hot - Hot

2395
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,889
Yes, 9 to 5

2396
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,760
- Hot - Hot

2397
01:25:58,359 --> 01:25:59,488
Nine to five

2398
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:01,089
- Hot - Hot

2399
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,829
Yes, 9 to 5

2400
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:04,599
Nine to five

2401
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,529
- Hot - Hot

2402
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:08,099
Nine to five

2403
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,469
- Hot - Owen's good.

2404
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,669
Nine to five

2405
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,309
- Hot - Hot

2406
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:15,538
What? Nine to five

2407
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:17,309
- Hot - Hot

2408
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,549
- Bam. - Yes.

2409
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,179
This block has great performance.

2410
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,948
- They have good performance. - Right?

2411
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:24,148
Their performance is entertaining.

2412
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:25,350
Block Four is fierce.

2413
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,590
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2414
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:31,688
- Hot - Hot

2415
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:34,059
- It's another track beat. - Hot

2416
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,759
- Hot - Hey

2417
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,129
Hey

2418
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:40,929
Go get it!

2419
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:42,698
My focus is always on work

2420
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:44,438
My path is always unprecedented

2421
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:47,709
I'll use my Adam's apple to get something bigger

2422
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:51,009
When greed was masked by ambition, bombarded with change

2423
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:54,509
Some members are on their own path, we're indebted to an inn named faith

2424
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,019
I'm sorry, ACACY, there's something more important than money to me

2425
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,549
So we can't talk money

2426
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:01,188
I get along with money just fine, but my eyes turn to someplace else

2427
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:03,858
Wavisabiroom, being closer mentally than physically

2428
01:27:03,859 --> 01:27:05,488
Only then am I comfortable

2429
01:27:05,489 --> 01:27:07,129
Even if you say it's pathetic point of view

2430
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:10,599
Tools are always a one-shot, Then I'll be used as a tool

2431
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,969
Is it better to get used up or left as a part of history?

2432
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:15,669
I don't get outdated because of it

2433
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:18,068
Don't judge failure and success with numbers

2434
01:27:18,069 --> 01:27:20,839
I draw out a more valuable dream, I live in "Inception"

2435
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,738
Guys, go to Harlem as you are right now

2436
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:23,938
Behave yourself well

2437
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:25,879
We hide behind the bad customs created by the environment

2438
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,349
The reality that I lack education

2439
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,648
I can't brag about it, your etiquette hasn't changed

2440
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:34,589
I was born a trap, the empties get fooled by my methods

2441
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:36,389
Yes, everyone is hanging to be cool

2442
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:38,059
Cut the stomach, censor the blood

2443
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:39,089
I can't talk

2444
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:41,459
To the guys who can't understand, but the thing is it's all right

2445
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,728
Is anyone running wild with baggy clothes on saying it's the trend?

2446
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:46,429
The two tigers in my dream was a foreshadow

2447
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,099
An organic combination of idealism and reality

2448
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,069
- Amazing - It's great.

2449
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:53,108
- He's good. - That punk is amazing.

2450
01:27:53,109 --> 01:27:54,310
I'm starving, COCONA.

2451
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:56,309
Oh, no. Are you hungry, Ryul?

2452
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,608
I'm literally starving.

2453
01:27:57,609 --> 01:27:59,509
But we're not hungry.

2454
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:01,409
I don't care. What do we do?

2455
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:07,288
There are many delicious-looking fresh things.

2456
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:08,788
How did she know I was tasty?

2457
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:09,960
You don't look tasty.

2458
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:11,759
It's okay. Give me a second, Ryul.

2459
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,158
I'll slice them up really nicely.

2460
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,188
Give me the beat.

2461
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:16,959
(Block 4 will perform next.)

2462
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,729
COCONA has the fingertips on.

2463
01:28:19,069 --> 01:28:20,929
Yes, who do we have right here?

2464
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:23,599
- What's with you, COCONA? - COCONA, hey

2465
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,608
It's yummy

2466
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:28,778
It's so yummy, Block Five is in trouble

2467
01:28:28,779 --> 01:28:30,538
- Push - Push

2468
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,809
"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," guys started gossiping about us one day

2469
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:36,818
Blah-blah-blahing next to me, What? Who are they?

2470
01:28:36,819 --> 01:28:38,519
- Who are you? - Keep watching us

2471
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,648
- Breathing the same air - Are the lyrics on her nails?

2472
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:40,788
- As I am right here - I know.

2473
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:42,488
- That fact will be something - Her rap isn't bad at all.

2474
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:44,219
To boast about

2475
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:45,858
What's wrong with the phonies the whole time?

2476
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:47,589
Leave them to talk so they get caught red-handed

2477
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,129
You'll know how low you are with just a few conversations

2478
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:51,158
It's hard to differentiate with how similar everyone is

2479
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,398
Can't handle it, the phone explodes

2480
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:54,969
You can't bear how hot it is and drop it, too hot

2481
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,099
I'll reply later

2482
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,698
First, I will eat steak, yum

2483
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,209
- First, I will eat steak, yum - Steak, yum

2484
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:01,009
- They brought instant rice. - First, I will eat steak, yum

2485
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:02,879
- First, I will eat steak, yum - Yum

2486
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,278
Yum, yummy

2487
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:08,250
- Yum - I'm getting riled up.

2488
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:10,978
All right, stop, listen, what's my major?

2489
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:12,719
I'm a rapper, I just want to be famous

2490
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,519
My left hand gestures on the West Coast

2491
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,158
I can't rap OG, but I don't care

2492
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,688
- Accept it, under pressure - He's good.

2493
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:19,188
Exciting, let's make them

2494
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:21,059
What's in the bag? Don't question

2495
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,629
Where you at? Where is my best friend?

2496
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:24,528
I wanted money, I was extremely scared

2497
01:29:24,529 --> 01:29:26,269
But I realized walking on eggshells wasn't cool

2498
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,698
Yes, diss me

2499
01:29:27,699 --> 01:29:29,969
- Wake up, stop drooling, yes, okay - He's good at rapping.

2500
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,698
How's this vibe?

2501
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,709
I grow every day, yes, what's in the bag?

2502
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:35,509
Don't question, where you at?

2503
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,408
Where's Block Five?

2504
01:29:37,409 --> 01:29:40,108
- Where you at? - Thank you for the food.

2505
01:29:40,109 --> 01:29:41,649
It was yummy.

2506
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,648
- They're good. - Yes, they are.

2507
01:29:43,649 --> 01:29:44,818
The unexpected rappers...

2508
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:47,188
It's exciting when unexpected rappers do well.

2509
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:48,250
That was cool.

2510
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:50,359
Give me the beat.

2511
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:52,688
Hi.

2512
01:29:52,689 --> 01:29:55,260
The promising kids on RAP: PUBLIC.

2513
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:58,459
You had it tough, watching...

2514
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,828
and dozing off at Block Four's boring stage.

2515
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,800
It's time to wake up.

2516
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:05,339
- It's a wake-up call. - Let's go.

2517
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,538
- Let's go. - Saying it was boring hurts.

2518
01:30:07,539 --> 01:30:08,839
- In the morning - In the morning

2519
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,679
- In the morning - In the morning

2520
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,209
- In the morning - In the morning

2521
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:14,108
- In the morning - In the morning

2522
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,408
In the morning, I wake up and smoke

2523
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:16,948
- Eat up the vitamins - Vitamins

2524
01:30:16,949 --> 01:30:18,478
- If my brain doesn't work - He's incredible.

2525
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:19,919
I get up and change the environment

2526
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,889
When my mouth gets dry from getting lost deep in thought and agony

2527
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:25,988
I drank a set of 6 2L water bottles at night

2528
01:30:25,989 --> 01:30:27,459
Now, I'm all about money and business

2529
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:28,759
If you can't top me now, we've got no business

2530
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,368
I block all of the noise around me and let it go

2531
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:35,228
My anger is telling me where I feel powerless, I know

2532
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:38,038
I can't lose when I haven't even started, I can't fall

2533
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:39,368
Trend flies, time flies

2534
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:40,868
- Youth flies - Flies

2535
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:42,578
I just can't be a lacking man, when I'm forgotten

2536
01:30:42,579 --> 01:30:44,108
- I've got to bounce it back - Hey

2537
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,679
Hey, rap dummies, put your seatbelts on

2538
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,948
You're going to feel the wrath of a loco

2539
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:52,078
- They act funny - They act funny

2540
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:53,688
- They act funny - They act funny

2541
01:30:53,689 --> 01:30:55,118
- They act funny - Luci.

2542
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:57,459
- They act funny - I got a bomb, a big bomb

2543
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,158
I'll pop it, shut it, and move

2544
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:00,589
The beat and my rap are GGM and Kimbo

2545
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,158
Your rap is valueless, it's 0kg

2546
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,499
Tick-tock

2547
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,198
I even exchange time with money

2548
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,599
Watch me as I prove myself

2549
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,129
My whole body is frozen with gems

2550
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,568
I'm called heartless

2551
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:11,099
Contrary to what I want, I overflow will coolness

2552
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,639
I'm sorry I can't live a lousy life

2553
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,139
This game is easy with a bunch of fakes

2554
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,578
I'm up like a balloon

2555
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:17,179
You climb up hard with a rotten rope

2556
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,639
Cling to me, pretty boy like boom

2557
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,250
Shawty twerk, the rhythm is staccato

2558
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:23,579
- Block 4 act funny - Block 4 act funny

2559
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,419
- Block 4 act funny - Block 4 act funny

2560
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,090
- Block 4 act funny - Block 4 act funny

2561
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,665
- Block 4 act funny - Block 4 act funny

2562
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:30,818
- Block 4 act funny - Block 4 act funny

2563
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,359
Block Four, you phonies are not funny.

2564
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,130
- Yes. - No. Block Four, we're up.

2565
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:35,459
Block Four, we're up.

2566
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,005
- Block 4, we're up - Block 4 act funny

2567
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:38,358
Block Four act funny

2568
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:39,430
He's the boss.

2569
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,170
Okay.

2570
01:31:44,369 --> 01:31:45,539
Give us the beat.

2571
01:31:46,539 --> 01:31:49,510
(Block 4 starts performing next.)

2572
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:59,349
I hang up the phone, I'll be right there, I never slow down

2573
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,219
Click that clicker, put it in the shopping basket

2574
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,220
Put it in, sell whatever

2575
01:32:02,221 --> 01:32:03,358
Bombarded with product questions

2576
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:04,889
Close the shutters, where do we go?

2577
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,358
Wherever cross border, let's go there tomorrow morning

2578
01:32:06,359 --> 01:32:07,858
I go out to the streets to throw it away with money

2579
01:32:07,859 --> 01:32:09,028
To get it with a whistle

2580
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:12,028
- Darting in and out of places - Darting in and out of places

2581
01:32:12,029 --> 01:32:15,099
- Darting in and out of places - Darting in and out of places

2582
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:18,038
- Darting in and out of places - Darting in and out of places

2583
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:21,038
- Darting in and out of places - Darting in and out of places

2584
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:22,478
Shut it, zip your lips, fall over fast

2585
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:23,738
After us like a domino

2586
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:25,179
A duo grown with high-degree, nobody can stop us

2587
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,709
- They're so cool. - It's a Tommy Gun in your mouth

2588
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,809
If I want to make things bigger, I carry my sword with me

2589
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,318
Even with fast strides, I pronounce properly

2590
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:31,448
This is your only chance to run away

2591
01:32:31,449 --> 01:32:33,789
The winner and loser are decided again as soon as we begin

2592
01:32:34,119 --> 01:32:35,519
We can't be classified separately

2593
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,019
You can't blend it right away

2594
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,488
Losers can pour me drinks

2595
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:39,629
Discipline the fools

2596
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:42,228
Talking about nonsense again, I haven't met you to adore you

2597
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:43,999
We're not one bit interested

2598
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,358
Nasty, I'm nothing to mess with

2599
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:46,929
There's no next time, go do whatever you were doing

2600
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:48,698
Suck it, stuck in the bottom at the same place

2601
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:49,868
Who would follow you?

2602
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:51,398
We don't mess with you, wake up

2603
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,809
Butterfinger, you lose what you had

2604
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:54,309
I keep earning, and you lose what's so easy

2605
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,639
I pickpocket the lazy kids

2606
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,640
Even with so many people, nobody can talk after me

2607
01:32:58,409 --> 01:33:01,279
We're running this city, we can't stop this until our feet wear out

2608
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,349
We made it easy, we're the best team, see that?

2609
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:07,389
We're running this city, we can't stop this until our feet wear out

2610
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:09,858
We made it easy, look, we're the best team, see that?

2611
01:33:09,859 --> 01:33:11,988
- Put it in the nasty bag - The cash, the gun is always

2612
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,488
On my shoulder, put a name tag, differentiate

2613
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:15,059
Collaboration, the installation art's skin

2614
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:16,499
Narrowness, I can't get on a running away train

2615
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,028
A delay, no matter what happens, we can't call

2616
01:33:18,029 --> 01:33:19,499
The police, rise again, I'm the last train

2617
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,129
Going up, a messy fool's

2618
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,568
Chappa, a messy fool's

2619
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:24,169
Chappa, lie low, then appear

2620
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:25,599
- Pow, handling the work swiftly - No way.

2621
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,209
My plate, I catch the nasty

2622
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:28,769
Fools, those who criticize me

2623
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,339
Are fakes, put me by your side, and your sense

2624
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:32,038
Will grow, double nine kids, we grow with our

2625
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:33,879
- names, but instead of apologizing - names, but instead of apologizing

2626
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,719
- We sell body bags - We sell body bags

2627
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,118
99' Nasty Kidz.

2628
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:38,520
We're still here.

2629
01:33:40,819 --> 01:33:42,020
Sparkle.

2630
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,489
"We're still here."

2631
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,459
- It's chilly in here. - Those two are a team.

2632
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,460
What was that?

2633
01:33:47,729 --> 01:33:49,429
How they rapped together...

2634
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:51,359
- was emotional. - You can't perfect that...

2635
01:33:51,529 --> 01:33:53,029
with just a day or two of practice.

2636
01:33:54,699 --> 01:33:58,069
The battle between Block 5 and Block 4 has ended.

2637
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,069
It's over.

2638
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:01,539
Is it already over?

2639
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,810
Already? I had fun.

2640
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:06,249
Block 5 versus Block 4.

2641
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,879
I didn't think it would be good.

2642
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,849
I thought it was going to take a lot of time.

2643
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,819
But time passed by really fast.

2644
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,519
I believe the rappers...

2645
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,688
in Block Five are the best.

2646
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:19,889
I doubt anyone on this show...

2647
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:22,630
is looking down on the rappers in Block Five.

2648
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,800
Owen has the musical skills to support...

2649
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:30,199
Block Five's whole strategy.

2650
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,669
What gave me goosebumps was that...

2651
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:34,639
Owen was on the beat...

2652
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,609
every single time.

2653
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,850
I was impressed by his performance once again.

2654
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:43,978
As for Khundi Panda... You call it rapping.

2655
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:48,288
He's a whiz with solid, excellent rap skills.

2656
01:34:48,289 --> 01:34:51,359
I think OSUN is incredible.

2657
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,560
He exceeded my expectations.

2658
01:34:53,859 --> 01:34:57,259
I could tell he was trying to show...

2659
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,659
all the charms he had.

2660
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:02,670
If only he had rapped like that in Block Three, you know?

2661
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,038
Speaking of their name value,

2662
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:10,609
one can think Block Four is in an unfavorable position.

2663
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:12,648
But while watching the battle,

2664
01:35:12,649 --> 01:35:15,278
each and every performance they did...

2665
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:17,579
was as good as Block Four's.

2666
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,419
That scene really stuck to me.

2667
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,788
Block Four stomping.

2668
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:23,288
They had their backs to us and sang acapella while stomping.

2669
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:25,520
That was seriously cool.

2670
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:27,590
I had a new impression about COCONA.

2671
01:35:27,729 --> 01:35:29,559
She's fantastic.

2672
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,698
COCONA gave me goosebumps.

2673
01:35:31,699 --> 01:35:33,699
She sounded like a CD.

2674
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,399
COCONA killed it.

2675
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:36,938
Kim Ryul and VIIN.

2676
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:38,538
The two finally shined.

2677
01:35:38,539 --> 01:35:40,269
They didn't just shine.

2678
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:43,879
The two picked a fight like they were driving them in.

2679
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,078
Watching them at a competition,

2680
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:48,049
them as a team like a machine...

2681
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,818
was phenomenal.

2682
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:53,118
I felt like they were finally showing off their talents...

2683
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,220
in this battle.

2684
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:57,189
Block 4 and Block 5's battle...

2685
01:35:57,319 --> 01:35:59,559
was a competition between rap and performance.

2686
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,829
I don't know who will win.

2687
01:36:01,659 --> 01:36:03,499
- Great job. - Great job.

2688
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,398
- Good work. - Good work.

2689
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:06,728
You were really cool.

2690
01:36:06,729 --> 01:36:08,270
- Great work. - Good job.

2691
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,039
- You were the best. - I was quite nervous.

2692
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,868
- Really. - Great job.

2693
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:15,569
- Good job. - Good job. You were the best.

2694
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:18,099
- I love you. You were the best. - You were the best.

2695
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:21,109
Great work. You did an amazing job.

2696
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:23,519
It's tough.

2697
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,090
The rap was more memorable than the performance.

2698
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:28,250
Please vote for Block Five.

2699
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:30,219
The rap was great.

2700
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:33,659
But speaking of formation and entertainment, Block Four killed it.

2701
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:36,359
This is a style preference.

2702
01:36:39,529 --> 01:36:41,829
The result of the vote will be revealed.

2703
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,340
- I'm nervous. - It's only natural.

2704
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:46,408
Let me survive. I'm fine with getting eliminated...

2705
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:47,469
but not this time.

2706
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:50,239
The result of Block 5 and Block 4's battle.

2707
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,039
I'm dying to know.

2708
01:36:52,409 --> 01:36:53,549
Please.

2709
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:55,310
The vote margin between the two blocks is...

2710
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:57,319
only...

2711
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:02,050
three.

2712
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,789
- "Three?" - Goodness.

2713
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:07,960
- Three. - I'm glad it isn't a tie.

2714
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:09,429
- Three? - Gosh.

2715
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,936
- Is this how he announces? - Only three votes?

2716
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,770
It's a difference in style preference.

2717
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,368
The winning block with three more votes...

2718
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:16,340
in which all members survive is...

2719
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:18,270
Block Four.

2720
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:21,310
Block Four.

2721
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:23,209
(Block 5 loses, Block 4 wins.)

2722
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:24,439
- No. - Oh, no.

2723
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:25,948
Oh, no.

2724
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:27,279
- Did we win? - Yes.

2725
01:37:27,579 --> 01:37:28,978
- Finally! - This is cool!

2726
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:31,719
(Block 5 loses with 14 votes, and Block 4 wins with 17 votes.)

2727
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,989
Oh, my goodness.

2728
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,750
Did we really win?

2729
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:36,859
It was a piece of drama.

2730
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:39,020
Great work.

2731
01:37:39,489 --> 01:37:41,358
- I'm really happy for them. - Their strategy won.

2732
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:43,629
They really went all out.

2733
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:45,858
You can really tell how much effort they put in.

2734
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:46,868
Good job.

2735
01:37:46,869 --> 01:37:48,169
- We won. - I can't believe it.

2736
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:49,840
Goodness, great work.

2737
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,309
- What a bummer. - Good job.

2738
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:56,739
- Good job. I have no regrets. - Great work. Same here.

2739
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,639
I kind of predicted it.

2740
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,850
We had to show teamwork.

2741
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:02,579
Yes. They prepared well.

2742
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:08,219
I always thought many believed...

2743
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:11,188
our block was the weakest.

2744
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:14,828
With that in mind, we did our best.

2745
01:38:14,829 --> 01:38:17,229
Thank you for your high opinions of us.

2746
01:38:19,029 --> 01:38:20,729
- They're impressive. - I agree.

2747
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,339
How cool. It must mean a lot to him.

2748
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,368
I know, right?

2749
01:38:24,369 --> 01:38:25,699
Skyminhyuk is extraordinary.

2750
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:29,238
Rap alone, Block Five is better at it.

2751
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:32,179
But Block Four prepared really well.

2752
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,049
Their performance was excellent.

2753
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,948
Do I choose the better rappers?

2754
01:38:36,949 --> 01:38:39,288
Or do I choose the better teamwork?

2755
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:42,759
Block Four put tons of effort into teamwork...

2756
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,890
and demonstrated it well.

2757
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:45,859
I couldn't help but choose them.

2758
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,040
- It's largely thanks to you all. - You're all gems.

2759
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,658
So this is what it tastes like.

2760
01:38:49,659 --> 01:38:52,205
- "So this is what it tastes like?" - "So this is what it tastes like."

2761
01:38:52,229 --> 01:38:55,600
It was the first victory of the former Block Eight members.

2762
01:38:56,069 --> 01:38:58,169
I was reminded of our Block Eight members...

2763
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:00,770
who had to leave without proving anything.

2764
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:04,209
We won by showing off everything we had.

2765
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,210
It was priceless.

2766
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:07,408
I'm really happy.

2767
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,648
Thank you for coming to Block Four.

2768
01:39:09,649 --> 01:39:12,249
Thanks to the members who did great, we won.

2769
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,488
Fortunately, we won't need to do the deathmatch.

2770
01:39:14,489 --> 01:39:16,488
That fact alone made me really happy.

2771
01:39:16,489 --> 01:39:18,719
It could be because we won while I was the leader,

2772
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,130
but I was on cloud nine.

2773
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:22,489
What could be the deathmatch?

2774
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,500
Three votes.

2775
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,369
It's a shame.

2776
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:30,199
Block 2 and Block 1...

2777
01:39:30,739 --> 01:39:32,769
will proceed with a match.

2778
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:33,909
It's a big match.

2779
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:36,278
- Let's go. - Good luck.

2780
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:37,538
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2781
01:39:37,539 --> 01:39:38,738
Have fun.

2782
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:39,779
Good luck.

2783
01:39:39,909 --> 01:39:41,148
Just look at them.

2784
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:42,409
Good luck!

2785
01:39:42,579 --> 01:39:44,278
You can tell the performance...

2786
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:46,648
will get aggressive by looking at the members.

2787
01:39:46,649 --> 01:39:49,589
They say everyone on Earth likes watching fights.

2788
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,789
It will be entertaining.

2789
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:53,159
This match is sort of like the main one.

2790
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:56,358
JTONG moved to Loopy's block. What will he perform there?

2791
01:39:56,359 --> 01:39:58,658
- Come here. Come inside. - Is it just us?

2792
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,698
It'll be a bloody match between Block One.

2793
01:40:00,699 --> 01:40:01,828
- A bloody match? - Yes.

2794
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,269
Let's sit like we did earlier.

2795
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,499
Okay.

2796
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:07,039
"JTONG derby." That's the title of this match.

2797
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:09,309
We successfully recruited JTONG.

2798
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:11,140
Our block will never lose our spirit.

2799
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,880
Whoever is ready, spit your verses.

2800
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:15,579
- I'm turning it on. - Okay.

2801
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,720
Genius

2802
01:40:18,449 --> 01:40:20,720
Goodness

2803
01:40:20,789 --> 01:40:21,849
Listen carefully.

2804
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,659
(JTONG goes first.)

2805
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,059
I've been enduring for a long time underground

2806
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:30,599
I was born to thrive

2807
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,728
- But I was always starving - Starving

2808
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:33,829
A pupa

2809
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:35,769
When JTONG started,

2810
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:37,539
everyone clicked right away.

2811
01:40:37,939 --> 01:40:39,299
Journey

2812
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,408
Rap is

2813
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,438
"This was it."

2814
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:43,309
I can end it here or continue.

2815
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:44,310
Let's go.

2816
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:45,738
Just like earlier,

2817
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:47,648
let's repeat what JTONG rapped.

2818
01:40:47,649 --> 01:40:49,078
- Does that get in your way? - No.

2819
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:51,520
- Okay. - Let's give it another shot, JTONG.

2820
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:54,720
We brought Block One's core to our block.

2821
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:57,419
JTONG won't regret a thing.

2822
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:01,359
Deciding the parts was pretty smooth in Block Two.

2823
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,659
Overall, I had so much fun while practicing.

2824
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,029
Block Two seems more united too.

2825
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,039
(In Block 1 before he moved to Block 2)

2826
01:41:11,739 --> 01:41:13,868
(Unlike how he is in Block 2)

2827
01:41:13,869 --> 01:41:16,108
(JTONG had to practice alone all the time.)

2828
01:41:16,109 --> 01:41:18,010
They were working so hard.

2829
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:21,680
I was totally motivated and thought I should work harder.

2830
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:24,419
I'm still a little kid, But I deliver myself after all

2831
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:25,478
The past scars

2832
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:26,919
- KHAN! - KHAN!

2833
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,750
KHAN, please come out just once.

2834
01:41:28,989 --> 01:41:31,318
(Fleeky Bang and Polodared, Block 1's leaders, come to Block 2.)

2835
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:33,988
We're going to practice in the lounge. Please don't watch it.

2836
01:41:33,989 --> 01:41:35,358
- We won't go there. - Make sure you don't.

2837
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:36,430
- Promise it. - Okay.

2838
01:41:36,699 --> 01:41:38,158
They came to ask not to come to the lounge.

2839
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,399
- Are they practicing there? - They will practice there.

2840
01:41:42,369 --> 01:41:44,398
- You know what I just thought? - They asked to change the beat?

2841
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:47,009
Aren't those punks asking to change the beat after listening to us?

2842
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:48,069
I thought the same thing.

2843
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:51,938
(Block 1)

2844
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,509
Shall we go to the lounge right now?

2845
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:54,510
- To the lounge. - They're not coming?

2846
01:41:54,511 --> 01:41:56,196
We promised not to watch each team's practice.

2847
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:58,550
(Block 1 goes to the lounge, avoiding Block 2.)

2848
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,119
I really want to put everything I have into it.

2849
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,260
We shouldn't lose.

2850
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:07,059
It wasn't easy to reach this point.

2851
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:10,359
When JTONG left earlier, I had a mental breakdown.

2852
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,660
I'll see you around from the next block.

2853
01:42:14,069 --> 01:42:15,430
- You can do it. - We can do it.

2854
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,369
Do your best.

2855
01:42:19,470 --> 01:42:20,470
Gosh.

2856
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:21,951
(Block 1 saw JTONG going to Block 2.)

2857
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:25,039
As Fleeky Bang said, everyone came here to be with JTONG.

2858
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:27,380
And after that person left,

2859
01:42:27,779 --> 01:42:30,849
it sort of felt empty.

2860
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:33,020
But what can we do about it? We just need to win.

2861
01:42:33,289 --> 01:42:34,948
And we're going to go against him today.

2862
01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:37,090
- It truly is a drama. - That's what I'm saying.

2863
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,729
He has some idea of the verses we have...

2864
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:46,269
and knows our weak points. So we held him in check even more.

2865
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:47,499
(Block 2)

2866
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,970
To be honest, I have only a few killer verses left.

2867
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:53,439
- Let's listen to it first. - Okay.

2868
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:55,238
It's because you might think it's not that good,

2869
01:42:55,239 --> 01:42:57,139
but it could be good when we listen to it.

2870
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,948
We need to discover each other's strength and cooperate.

2871
01:42:59,949 --> 01:43:01,648
Since those who pay more attention...

2872
01:43:01,649 --> 01:43:04,379
to the rap elements gathered here,

2873
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:07,389
the best ones on the track are trying to do it.

2874
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,118
Best and better now

2875
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:10,589
Someone please kill me

2876
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:12,158
I achieve one by one

2877
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,459
ShyboiiTobii, 1, 2, let's go.

2878
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,059
Awesome

2879
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,799
- Didn't know how to bark - Oh, my goodness.

2880
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,929
- Loopy might have something. - I actually do.

2881
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:24,438
Play with me

2882
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:27,209
- Inside and outside - Yes, our block is terrific now.

2883
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:29,538
- Let's break up - Lift the mood.

2884
01:43:29,539 --> 01:43:31,679
Everything went smoothly in our team.

2885
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,380
We had great teamwork.

2886
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:35,509
I guess I just trusted them.

2887
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:39,379
We decided to fight with awesome music rather than a performance.

2888
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,049
Of course it was Block Competition,

2889
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:43,318
but we just decided to show a good rap.

2890
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:45,159
That was a more advanced strategy.

2891
01:43:48,289 --> 01:43:50,828
Can you write down "Maybe" next to my name?

2892
01:43:50,829 --> 01:43:52,629
I think you should do this no matter what.

2893
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:54,568
Because this one is a sort of moving beat.

2894
01:43:54,569 --> 01:43:56,339
And you can go like you're appealing.

2895
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:57,669
- You can go like this. - I know. That's what I like.

2896
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:59,938
You rap like you have deep resentment.

2897
01:43:59,939 --> 01:44:01,238
- Resent? - Resentment.

2898
01:44:01,239 --> 01:44:03,209
Your rap expresses so much pain.

2899
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:05,608
- I see. - It was hard.

2900
01:44:05,609 --> 01:44:06,955
(The conversation with blockmates gives Nosun confidence.)

2901
01:44:06,979 --> 01:44:11,078
Two of you can go like this, like you're in New York.

2902
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:12,749
These two have their own characters.

2903
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:15,389
If they utter something serious like this,

2904
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,890
it will be delivered to everyone.

2905
01:44:18,289 --> 01:44:19,889
Now I see that I was such a fool

2906
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:22,889
I didn't listen to my mom and repeated fooling around

2907
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,898
Both Foggyatthebottom and I are from New York.

2908
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:27,868
We said that we could do it in our style and just show...

2909
01:44:27,869 --> 01:44:30,269
just like how we make an album and how we perform.

2910
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:31,999
If we were going to perform differently from other blocks,

2911
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,169
we could focus more on music, I thought.

2912
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:38,709
The raps of those two give a message expressing resentment.

2913
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:40,709
They create synergy too.

2914
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:44,778
I wanted to show people their honest stories.

2915
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:46,589
- You mean this? - Yes.

2916
01:44:46,590 --> 01:44:47,648
(Loopy and Raf Sandou of Block 2 leave the place for a while.)

2917
01:44:47,649 --> 01:44:48,969
- You can do it. - You can do it.

2918
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:50,960
(Smoking area)

2919
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:52,789
- I feel a bit anxious. - You do?

2920
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:57,799
I guess that team might have prepared something special.

2921
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,228
- Like dancing? - Yes, something like that.

2922
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:03,000
What we're doing is showing awesome music.

2923
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:07,640
We utter rap nicely, so to speak.

2924
01:45:08,909 --> 01:45:10,778
We're actually planning some moves.

2925
01:45:10,779 --> 01:45:11,909
- Right. - But...

2926
01:45:13,909 --> 01:45:16,978
The rapper will come forward and prepare.

2927
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:18,679
We'll just jump a lot,

2928
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:21,049
the rapper will come forward, and start just like that.

2929
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:23,288
They should not figure out who's coming forward among us.

2930
01:45:23,289 --> 01:45:25,818
The only part we won't move is number eight.

2931
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:29,159
And if there's a teasing line like Foggyatthebottom does,

2932
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:31,000
only then we can approach them.

2933
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,770
We're talking about when to jump, and moving freely...

2934
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,868
but to the extent of not disturbing the rap.

2935
01:45:36,869 --> 01:45:39,599
That's about the concept we're preparing.

2936
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,539
So it makes you feel it will be similar to the former performance.

2937
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:43,779
That's right.

2938
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,349
But I think the leader is the one who decides.

2939
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:50,750
I tried my best to make up for where I can be of help.

2940
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:53,188
Please listen to this.

2941
01:45:53,189 --> 01:45:57,520
(Meanwhile, Block 1 keeps practicing in the lounge.)

2942
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,041
(Fleeky Bang, Block 1's leader, suddenly stops the beat.)

2943
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:02,130
Why?

2944
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,629
- I heard KHAN's voice. - I hear ShyboiiTobii's voice too.

2945
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:06,310
- What? - I hear ShyboiiTobii's voice too.

2946
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,630
Goodness.

2947
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:17,510
(Tray B is looking around here and there.)

2948
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:22,979
(After making sure others are not around, he goes back to the lounge.)

2949
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,349
- Shall we try it? - All right.

2950
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:28,988
I don't remember a loser, You ignored me before

2951
01:46:28,989 --> 01:46:30,719
Now our situations have changed

2952
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,589
The city of Seoul has too many con artists

2953
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:35,188
Let's change Seoul to Busan.

2954
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:36,260
Good.

2955
01:46:36,699 --> 01:46:38,398
The city of Busan has too many con artists

2956
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:40,868
I think the timing is quite nice.

2957
01:46:40,869 --> 01:46:43,169
The lyrics target JTONG directly.

2958
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:46,199
Your fake loyalty is so weak

2959
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,339
Okay, good.

2960
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:49,510
We don't know much about them.

2961
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:53,310
So with respect to information, we have a handicap.

2962
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:57,879
JTONG performed with us before.

2963
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:01,090
So much style flows like coffee

2964
01:47:01,989 --> 01:47:05,960
(In the last match, Block 1 won with JTONG.)

2965
01:47:06,859 --> 01:47:09,430
That's why I held him more in check.

2966
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,528
I'll go first,

2967
01:47:11,529 --> 01:47:13,728
give trash to JTONG, and say, "Pick it up."

2968
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:15,969
Then I rap, "Your fake loyalty is so weak."

2969
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,499
I think it will be fun if I do this.

2970
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,738
- It sounds fun. - "Pick it up."

2971
01:47:18,739 --> 01:47:20,210
It's because it expresses an idea.

2972
01:47:21,569 --> 01:47:24,140
But I think their team...

2973
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,408
will give various performances.

2974
01:47:26,409 --> 01:47:27,409
What?

2975
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,679
I think they'll give a lot of provocative performances.

2976
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,720
- Provocative? - Yes.

2977
01:47:30,979 --> 01:47:32,649
Do they have anyone who can dance?

2978
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:35,488
For example, he dances, and someone there imitates it.

2979
01:47:35,489 --> 01:47:37,649
Then you should dance in a way they can never imitate.

2980
01:47:38,189 --> 01:47:39,488
(You can never imitate my dance!)

2981
01:47:39,489 --> 01:47:40,569
Are you going to dance too?

2982
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:43,300
"In a way they can never imitate."

2983
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:45,260
(Giving a wink)

2984
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,969
(Official dance fighter of RAP: PUBLIC)

2985
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:49,129
- We can do this. - I feel so reassured.

2986
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,500
- I mean it. - I know.

2987
01:47:50,699 --> 01:47:52,339
(Feeling proud)

2988
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,068
We have a lot of people with an intense personality.

2989
01:47:55,069 --> 01:47:57,139
(Intense personality 1, intense personality 2)

2990
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:58,140
(intense personality 3)

2991
01:47:58,141 --> 01:48:01,108
- We'll get many personal attacks. - Then we'll have a showdown.

2992
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:02,350
Excuse my language.

2993
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,350
- In freestyle? - Yes.

2994
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,120
We'll see what happens. Try it now.

2995
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,448
You bold-headed pig, you need to lose some weight.

2996
01:48:08,449 --> 01:48:09,889
You could die if you stay like that.

2997
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:12,720
(Upset)

2998
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,158
- He has a mental breakdown. - What did he say?

2999
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:18,158
- I didn't hear it. - He lost.

3000
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,630
Let's try it.

3001
01:48:20,270 --> 01:48:22,398
Come right to the front.

3002
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:23,698
Start from here.

3003
01:48:23,699 --> 01:48:26,169
Doing this for my Koreans

3004
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,469
- This looks all right. - Yes.

3005
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:29,608
I'll put my arms around your shoulders and move together.

3006
01:48:29,609 --> 01:48:31,478
When we practiced, Polodared...

3007
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:34,549
set up a strategy about various elements...

3008
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,908
such as moving directions, moves, and performances.

3009
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:38,648
All stand still, and move all together when the rap starts.

3010
01:48:38,649 --> 01:48:40,489
That sounds good. I love it.

3011
01:48:41,689 --> 01:48:45,560
I thought we needed a performance to make a difference.

3012
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:48,590
I also thought spirits and unity would matter.

3013
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:53,158
This clock 26, This is fantastic

3014
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:56,738
I didn't listen to my mom and repeated fooling around

3015
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:58,139
I lose only money but freedom

3016
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,915
They're so loud that I can hear everything. Is it okay?

3017
01:48:59,939 --> 01:49:01,139
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

3018
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,969
Can you hear all the rapping?

3019
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:04,778
- Yes. - I see.

3020
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:06,109
- So... - Okay.

3021
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,948
Polodared just came...

3022
01:49:09,949 --> 01:49:12,680
and said, "They're so loud that I can hear everything. Is it okay?"

3023
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:15,519
Is it another way of saying we're making too much noise?

3024
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,390
- Maybe. - So what?

3025
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,728
JTONG derby, only available on RAP: PUBLIC, is happening.

3026
01:49:20,729 --> 01:49:22,236
- That's true. - You have no time to sleep now.

3027
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,499
Although it's my team, I admired watching how they did it.

3028
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,129
We're amazing now.

3029
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:28,969
There's no way we're going to the deathmatch.

3030
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:31,170
We'll advance to the end like this and win the victory.

3031
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:32,599
We're going to do a good job.

3032
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,408
Polodared has such great ideas.

3033
01:49:39,409 --> 01:49:40,909
Polodared, as expected.

3034
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:43,618
And we have a new face called Double Down.

3035
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,719
I have no sip of my soju

3036
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,149
We have to win, no matter what.

3037
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:52,689
If the team loses, all of us have to go to the deathmatch.

3038
01:49:52,890 --> 01:49:56,859
If I were to survive, I had to beat my former colleagues.

3039
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:58,930
Those who gathered because of JTONG...

3040
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,429
are trying to beat him now.

3041
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:04,640
Let's contend properly to see which team is truly strong.

3042
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:08,069
It's going to be fun.

3043
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,210
I love the look on his face.

3044
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:13,648
I really love that look.

3045
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:15,009
He sort of looks like a Chihuahua.

3046
01:50:16,279 --> 01:50:18,380
I have nothing much to say to the other block.

3047
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:23,118
Welcome to the Block Two's compilation album performance.

3048
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,560
- Gosh. - Word.

3049
01:50:25,659 --> 01:50:26,728
That's awesome.

3050
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:29,490
I also have nothing much to say to the other blockmates in Block Two.

3051
01:50:30,029 --> 01:50:31,760
JTONG who preserves nature.

3052
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:36,568
You always pick up trash, and I can see you got a lot of them.

3053
01:50:36,569 --> 01:50:38,270
(You picked up a lot of trash.)

3054
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:46,340
He slayed it.

3055
01:50:46,779 --> 01:50:47,809
He won already.

3056
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:49,879
Darn it. I need to learn from him.

3057
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:52,618
Has ZENE THE ZILLA gone crazy?

3058
01:50:52,619 --> 01:50:54,219
I guess he prepared that comment for two days.

3059
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:57,089
His comment was so sensational and provocative.

3060
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:58,858
Gosh, it was intense.

3061
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:02,389
The provocative comments were pretty much influential.

3062
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:04,658
Yes, JTONG. We'll make you feel sorry...

3063
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:06,770
for leaving us and make you regret it.

3064
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,729
JTONG, goodbye.

3065
01:51:09,569 --> 01:51:10,600
Now,

3066
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:15,169
the Block Match between Block 2 and Block 1 will begin.

3067
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:18,409
Let's do this as if it's our last battle.

3068
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:20,050
It must be so much fun.

3069
01:51:20,909 --> 01:51:22,010
Ready.

3070
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:24,799
- What if they get into a fight? - This will be fun. It's legendary.

3071
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,289
- Start. - I'm looking forward to it.

3072
01:51:27,689 --> 01:51:28,689
Let's go.

3073
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:30,188
(Block 2 starts rapping first.)

3074
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:31,560
The beat is so good.

3075
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,658
- Let's go. - This is XWALLY's style.

3076
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,130
Let's go.

3077
01:51:35,329 --> 01:51:37,760
- Let's go. - Hey, XWALLY!

3078
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:39,459
- XWALLY! - This is cool.

3079
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,929
Let's go.

3080
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:43,568
I ain't sip for the best and I'm better now

3081
01:51:43,569 --> 01:51:45,169
Who'll protect me? On my own now

3082
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:46,769
Things are being accomplished, one by one, calm down

3083
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:48,408
A sleepless night because my thoughts are loud

3084
01:51:48,409 --> 01:51:49,908
Took a loss now, I'm being a little cautious

3085
01:51:49,909 --> 01:51:51,639
I'm here to earn money alone now I make a profit

3086
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,238
Make it twice and thrice, saucing

3087
01:51:53,239 --> 01:51:54,849
Fill up with small happiness, no losses

3088
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:56,278
I imagine every day

3089
01:51:56,279 --> 01:51:58,148
Because my brother and I, we've been paving our way

3090
01:51:58,149 --> 01:51:59,648
Ian is flying

3091
01:51:59,649 --> 01:52:01,448
Let's keep it like this, they be speaking our names

3092
01:52:01,449 --> 01:52:02,818
Slide with the team that made a bet

3093
01:52:02,819 --> 01:52:04,318
There's nothing to fear if we're together

3094
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:05,889
Because this life is like Russian roulette

3095
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:08,028
And now we're going to blow this up, renegade

3096
01:52:08,029 --> 01:52:09,589
Eyes like binoculars, I see far

3097
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:11,528
I had to fly overseas needed an alibi

3098
01:52:11,529 --> 01:52:12,929
Can't breathe the thick smoke

3099
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:14,599
I acted ridiculous just to make money

3100
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,198
Shining life, paparazzi

3101
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:18,068
But I still can't look at the camera

3102
01:52:18,069 --> 01:52:19,469
Hard times have passed

3103
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:21,368
Now I chase for things that are beyond my reach

3104
01:52:21,369 --> 01:52:22,738
Febreze removes fragrance

3105
01:52:22,739 --> 01:52:24,478
I live in a rush, chased by time need a timepiece

3106
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:26,139
I'm used to lacking, I can't see something going to waste

3107
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,809
If I don't succeed, it's RIP

3108
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:29,509
Without the worries in my head, there's nothing else

3109
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:30,919
That took a part of me

3110
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:33,989
Ice hockey, let my time freeze

3111
01:52:35,189 --> 01:52:36,789
- He did well. - Freeze!

3112
01:52:37,289 --> 01:52:38,920
It's their beat.

3113
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,158
- It's nice to see them together. - Yes, they look good together.

3114
01:52:41,159 --> 01:52:42,689
Gather around, everybody.

3115
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:46,398
- All right. - I think I should join. No?

3116
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:49,970
Block One, we already won!

3117
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:52,970
Let's go!

3118
01:52:53,710 --> 01:52:55,210
(Block 1 starts rapping.)

3119
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:57,339
Is he going to rap?

3120
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,278
I'm Polodared. You jerks.

3121
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:01,180
(I'm Polodared.)

3122
01:53:03,079 --> 01:53:05,478
- Okay. - You're good!

3123
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:06,749
Okay. Let's go.

3124
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:07,850
What? How did he do that?

3125
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:10,419
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3126
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:12,059
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3127
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:13,658
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3128
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:15,429
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3129
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:17,028
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3130
01:53:17,029 --> 01:53:18,158
Who wants to fight us?

3131
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,368
- How is he moving like that? - Who wants to fight us?

3132
01:53:20,369 --> 01:53:22,069
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3133
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:24,698
Be careful, you'll get caught

3134
01:53:24,699 --> 01:53:27,238
But I'm too cool for school, so every day is Saturday

3135
01:53:27,239 --> 01:53:28,839
My life is blessed

3136
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,538
My bank account is playing with zeros like football

3137
01:53:30,539 --> 01:53:32,179
I'm so busy

3138
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,778
You're in hot water now

3139
01:53:34,779 --> 01:53:37,419
I show off in my neighborhood, Bomnae, you're scared

3140
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:38,849
The more you do that, the more I scold you

3141
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:40,589
- You can't mimic it - Nice!

3142
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:42,148
Sam Bong is annoying

3143
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:43,759
Sam Bong grew up a lot

3144
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,419
Girls send me DMs

3145
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:47,159
Boys send me jealousy

3146
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:49,889
- Who wants to fight Tobii? - I don't want to

3147
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:51,599
- Who wants to fight Foggy? - I don't want to

3148
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,198
- Who wants to fight Loopy? - I don't want to

3149
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:54,898
- Who wants to fight XWALLY? - I don't want to

3150
01:53:54,899 --> 01:53:56,646
- Who wants to fight KHAN? - I don't want to

3151
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:58,739
- I don't want to - But I don't know this jerk

3152
01:53:58,869 --> 01:54:00,408
Who wants to fight JTONG?

3153
01:54:00,409 --> 01:54:02,069
Oh, shoot.

3154
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:04,539
- Who wants to fight? - Me.

3155
01:54:08,649 --> 01:54:10,249
- He's kind. - A gentleman.

3156
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:11,850
- Yes. - Mother, father, gentleman

3157
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,220
Let's have fun. Let's go.

3158
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:15,788
Where on earth? Where are you?

3159
01:54:15,789 --> 01:54:17,389
Where on earth? Where are you?

3160
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:18,759
I've been looking for you, where is he staying at?

3161
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,459
Styrofoam double cup sipping syrup

3162
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:22,328
You're a citizen, stay out

3163
01:54:22,329 --> 01:54:24,028
- I'm a ghost that disappears - What's with ShyboiiTobii?

3164
01:54:24,029 --> 01:54:25,158
Where on earth? Where are you?

3165
01:54:25,159 --> 01:54:27,198
I'll be like ain't got no break and keeping it all the heat

3166
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,868
Hop on it, I just keep it going

3167
01:54:28,869 --> 01:54:30,499
- This isn't enough get me some more - What's this?

3168
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,169
This isn't enough get me some more

3169
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,769
Cover my head up and I need a settlement

3170
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:35,469
You ain't never top of it, I'm about to blow

3171
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,038
How are they professionals?

3172
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:38,879
Too loud, they would be locking on my door

3173
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,448
How many bags? How many Raf?

3174
01:54:40,449 --> 01:54:42,148
And how many stacks? And how many checks?

3175
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:43,849
- Stance doesn't change - Raf Sandou is so good too.

3176
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:45,448
Just move first, you all chit chat

3177
01:54:45,449 --> 01:54:47,049
Word around town, I'm going to bring it all back

3178
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:48,788
I won't listen to yours, I'm going to send them all back

3179
01:54:48,789 --> 01:54:50,488
I'm just saying because you all lack

3180
01:54:50,489 --> 01:54:52,260
All I see is all these rat

3181
01:54:52,359 --> 01:54:53,889
Where on earth? Where are you?

3182
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:55,629
Where on earth? Where are you?

3183
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:57,198
I've been looking for you, where is he staying at?

3184
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:59,028
Styrofoam double cup sipping syrup

3185
01:54:59,029 --> 01:55:00,469
You're a citizen, stay out

3186
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:02,429
I'm a ghost that disappears

3187
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:04,038
Where on earth? Where are you?

3188
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:05,568
Where on earth? Where are you?

3189
01:55:05,569 --> 01:55:08,809
Mug shot, they all lie down

3190
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:11,738
People full of badges are always fat

3191
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:15,108
I got two missed calls, Where from my bro, Ak or Kartier

3192
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:18,079
I need to go buy a new suit for the court hearing

3193
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:19,749
What was that?

3194
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,188
Please let me go

3195
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:23,419
Dang it, even though I pay

3196
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:25,220
I'm a busy man

3197
01:55:25,289 --> 01:55:26,959
Where on earth? Where are you?

3198
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,528
Where on earth? Where are you?

3199
01:55:28,529 --> 01:55:30,188
I've been looking for you, where is he staying at?

3200
01:55:30,189 --> 01:55:32,059
Styrofoam double cup sipping syrup

3201
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:35,368
You're a citizen, stay out, I'm a ghost that disappears

3202
01:55:35,369 --> 01:55:36,929
Where on earth? Where are you?

3203
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:38,698
Where on earth? Where are you?

3204
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:40,219
- Make some noise. - This was so good.

3205
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:43,038
My gosh, ShyboiiTobii.

3206
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:44,359
ShyboiiTobii's hook is addictive.

3207
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:45,509
Let's go right away.

3208
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:49,148
(Block 1 starts rapping.)

3209
01:55:49,149 --> 01:55:50,619
Let's play a game.

3210
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:55,449
- I am ground, introducing myself - I am ground, introducing myself

3211
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:58,788
I'm Sang Hyun, you're fools

3212
01:55:58,789 --> 01:56:02,129
Get lost, freaks, I earn more than your dad

3213
01:56:02,130 --> 01:56:03,698
I don't give a darn, I live however I want

3214
01:56:03,699 --> 01:56:05,429
- Losers - Okay!

3215
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:07,299
Losers talk behind my back

3216
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:08,799
But they get nervous around me

3217
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,099
You know I dirty play

3218
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:11,999
I call your girlfriend at night

3219
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,639
Because I'm younger and cute

3220
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,238
- Cutie. - I never change

3221
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:18,180
Things go well for me naturally

3222
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:19,679
I like rich cougars

3223
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,709
I don't like Hongdae girls like you

3224
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:22,849
Everyone recognizes me now

3225
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:24,750
A stylish person from Dongducheon

3226
01:56:25,449 --> 01:56:28,749
I'm not your brother, I'm not your friend

3227
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:32,059
Put a red dot on your head like a Hindu

3228
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:33,658
- He's so cool! - My necklace is like ice

3229
01:56:33,659 --> 01:56:35,429
- Feeling like bingsu - We should go too.

3230
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:39,528
- Double Down spitting twice - This is so good.

3231
01:56:39,529 --> 01:56:42,169
Doing this for my Koreans

3232
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:45,499
You talking crap and your girlfriend is going to be single

3233
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:48,839
She wants a ring, she wants a ring too

3234
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,509
You all say I'm cheating

3235
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:52,179
- This is crazy. - But I'm playing by the same rules

3236
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:55,509
Big brother is on a shark, everybody is seafood

3237
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:58,818
Rocking gentle monster, feeling like a monster

3238
01:56:58,819 --> 01:57:00,448
Double Down is crazy

3239
01:57:00,449 --> 01:57:02,118
Double Down, flip it

3240
01:57:02,119 --> 01:57:05,760
If you're not talking about money, shut it

3241
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,788
Didn't you say that you had something to say?

3242
01:57:07,789 --> 01:57:08,789
Yes.

3243
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:10,858
Hey, Nosun and ShyboiiTobii,

3244
01:57:10,859 --> 01:57:12,228
are you two dating?

3245
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:13,260
Congratulations!

3246
01:57:13,529 --> 01:57:14,969
Congratulations!

3247
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:15,999
What was that?

3248
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,669
Is he a comedian?

3249
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:19,000
We're here for the rap battle.

3250
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:20,510
Then, just rap.

3251
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:23,340
Let's go. I'll show you. Let's go.

3252
01:57:23,739 --> 01:57:24,810
It's scary.

3253
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:26,278
Okay.

3254
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:27,310
(Block 2 starts rapping.)

3255
01:57:27,609 --> 01:57:28,710
JTONG is rapping.

3256
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:32,778
I'm a freak from Busan, I'll handle whatever comes my way

3257
01:57:32,779 --> 01:57:34,818
Immediately and on my own terms

3258
01:57:34,819 --> 01:57:36,318
Something that's tightly gripped in my right hand

3259
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:38,089
Is a large black bag and inside there's a pinecone

3260
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:39,688
Never looking back, moving forward, stubborn as a mule

3261
01:57:39,689 --> 01:57:41,828
I'm concrete, steel, and a crowbar

3262
01:57:41,829 --> 01:57:42,959
I was playing the acoustic guitar with a bit of rhythm

3263
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,898
Then grabbed the microphone naturally

3264
01:57:44,899 --> 01:57:46,559
Brush my teeth, my teeth are shiny

3265
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,228
Brush my hair all the way back

3266
01:57:48,229 --> 01:57:51,038
Big uncle of the scene, a seasoned macho in a flashy shirt

3267
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:53,068
JTONG IK and Buckwilds

3268
01:57:53,069 --> 01:57:54,069
I don't even know what I want to be

3269
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:55,845
- When I grow up, So what? - I feel a sense of relief.

3270
01:57:55,869 --> 01:57:57,478
A six-person dining table is my desk

3271
01:57:57,479 --> 01:57:59,278
My hair clippers clean up my buttocks

3272
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:01,009
My ripped pants, perfectly in my own way

3273
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:02,749
No matter how I look at it, I've gone far.

3274
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,578
To put it nicely, I'm a lone wolf or else I'm a reckless troublemaker

3275
01:58:04,579 --> 01:58:06,379
Whatever happens, I'm enjoying the present and stubbornly here

3276
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,350
A green leaf on the asphalt, its head lifted

3277
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:11,688
Same order every time, Big Mac combo full cup of Coca-Cola

3278
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:13,419
Highway downtown, we dobox them

3279
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,129
I see a lot of problems when turning at the corners

3280
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:16,688
Every day I get paid, I get paid, what you want

3281
01:58:16,689 --> 01:58:18,499
Bad, excuse me, what's up baby?

3282
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,358
The one who challenged AK was Cardi

3283
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:22,169
How could you rap like that? It's not California

3284
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:23,969
Here, the sky is clear with many greeneries

3285
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:25,438
Back at my crib, been a minute

3286
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:27,309
We sit back, we chilling west, west we're building

3287
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:29,108
I don't care about anybody, my minds be another

3288
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:30,809
- He's so good. - I haven't said this recently

3289
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:32,778
Every day I'm pulling up, and working again

3290
01:58:32,779 --> 01:58:34,549
Lazy Cali rapper, but I'm a rebellious character

3291
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:36,309
Show it through your actions not work again

3292
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:37,920
Disappointing K-rapper's underdog

3293
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:45,159
My gosh.

3294
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:48,560
- Good job. - It's good that we sent JTONG away.

3295
01:58:48,659 --> 01:58:49,659
Drop the beat.

3296
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:51,100
JEFFERY WHITE.

3297
01:58:51,699 --> 01:58:53,430
(Block 1 starts rapping.)

3298
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:56,600
I think JEFFERY WHITE will nail it.

3299
01:58:58,569 --> 01:58:59,899
Everyone moved there.

3300
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:01,340
He's coming.

3301
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:04,038
She said she's doing the Pilates

3302
01:59:04,039 --> 01:59:05,839
I'm going Sicko Mode like Travis

3303
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,908
Triple, double booty made me a sandwich

3304
01:59:07,909 --> 01:59:09,749
Fat and juicy booty

3305
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,949
Love me, want it

3306
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,988
She said don't stop it

3307
01:59:13,989 --> 01:59:15,919
Can't give you promise

3308
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,519
Okay

3309
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,988
POLO, let's go Don Mills, yes, boy

3310
01:59:20,989 --> 01:59:22,828
Went to Dingo after Show Me the Money

3311
01:59:22,829 --> 01:59:24,599
We're ready uno, tres, cuatro

3312
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,328
From JM to Mine Field, just as I learned

3313
01:59:26,329 --> 01:59:28,299
Entering the charts with an R-rated label

3314
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,669
Everyone knows DPR LIVE nowadays

3315
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:32,639
I'll teach you how to live a smooth life again

3316
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,339
Contrary to the doubts everyone had

3317
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:36,309
New clothes, new shoes, a new label

3318
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,908
I had borrowed it, but I'm sorry

3319
01:59:37,909 --> 01:59:39,379
For making you wait so long to wear it

3320
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,448
- I don't need to say stay strong - This is really good!

3321
01:59:41,449 --> 01:59:43,108
SNL Track Six said stay cool

3322
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:45,078
- My mom says I'm the - Best!

3323
01:59:45,079 --> 01:59:46,419
Mom, I'm doing the same thing

3324
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:48,089
From the playground to the studio, every stage

3325
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:49,889
The basement room, the studio, and freight forwarding company

3326
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:50,959
A funny type beat

3327
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,389
- What's with her sense of rhythm? - Same behavior

3328
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,259
Why are you treating me like that? They say I'm a celebrity

3329
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:56,129
The best rapper, I'm just for rap, people

3330
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:57,858
I'm weak when it comes to men, I'm your own baby girl

3331
01:59:57,859 --> 01:59:59,698
Small and dark but full of talent

3332
01:59:59,699 --> 02:00:01,398
AP in the building, This building is owned by AP

3333
02:00:01,399 --> 02:00:03,169
No One Likes Us, Video of the year is AP's

3334
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:05,038
The compilation album is released and listeners grade it

3335
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:06,868
Even though I'm successful, the comments annoy me

3336
02:00:06,869 --> 02:00:08,438
Game over, hip-hop is cool

3337
02:00:08,439 --> 02:00:09,669
Get rid of that jerk's rap

3338
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:11,179
Left for conservative, right for progressive, record it

3339
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:12,839
DAMINI is a four-leaf clover in a minefield

3340
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,409
This year is ours, bring it

3341
02:00:14,579 --> 02:00:16,010
This year is ours, bring it

3342
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:18,118
Block Money is ours, bring it

3343
02:00:18,119 --> 02:00:19,978
- The victory is ours, bring it - Bring it!

3344
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:22,090
Block One is ours

3345
02:00:22,189 --> 02:00:24,390
JTONG was ours but you can have him.

3346
02:00:25,319 --> 02:00:26,789
- My goodness. - This is wild.

3347
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,460
- JTONG is getting attacked a lot. - I know.

3348
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,929
DAMINI is my love.

3349
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:32,260
My gosh, she's good.

3350
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,229
- Let's run for it now. Let's go. - Okay.

3351
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:36,029
Let's bring back our energy.

3352
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:37,270
Give me that beat.

3353
02:00:37,869 --> 02:00:40,839
- Link up with the plug, hello - Hello

3354
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,769
- I can't go out - He's good.

3355
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:43,939
I got no visa

3356
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:46,278
I can't date girls easily

3357
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:47,279
Come on

3358
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,449
Darn it

3359
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:51,118
Expensive meal

3360
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:52,448
Nun on my wrist

3361
02:00:52,449 --> 02:00:54,618
Holly is trying to take my piece

3362
02:00:54,619 --> 02:00:56,049
- I am no fuss - He's cool.

3363
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:58,118
I'm a darn goofy witch

3364
02:00:58,119 --> 02:01:01,760
I'm going to tour on a tourist buddy business

3365
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:05,099
Counting Blue Benjamins

3366
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:06,499
If you're confident try it, please, Try me

3367
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,528
I'll make sure you can't lift your head again

3368
02:01:08,529 --> 02:01:10,028
I'm confused when I hear you rap

3369
02:01:10,029 --> 02:01:11,938
You're not blood-related but it's like decalcomania

3370
02:01:11,939 --> 02:01:15,309
From the start, I'm different by nature

3371
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:16,809
You all meet up frequently

3372
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:19,038
In reality, you're always in your room doing nasty

3373
02:01:19,039 --> 02:01:22,148
We keep going, ShyboiiTobii and I

3374
02:01:22,149 --> 02:01:23,879
Even if you count on everything, you won't be able to make it

3375
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,618
We always lay low while moving

3376
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:27,389
Money is always sweet like candy

3377
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:29,188
When I chase money like I'm Django

3378
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:30,889
You know I started with bare hands

3379
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:32,920
In my game, I'm always the main boss

3380
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:36,658
For a long time I endured my time underground

3381
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:40,259
A hungry appetite with potential, but always runs out of food

3382
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:43,969
Full of vigor and energy, Like a strong young person

3383
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:47,568
Growing rapidly with high energy, Like mushrooms sprouting

3384
02:01:47,569 --> 02:01:50,908
Life is just a continuous repetition of the same days

3385
02:01:50,909 --> 02:01:54,578
I thank the Almighty, reflect and seek enlightenment

3386
02:01:54,579 --> 02:01:57,978
Bend the back that was once straight under the vast sky, be humble

3387
02:01:57,979 --> 02:02:01,618
Be prepared in time for a journey to devote your entire life

3388
02:02:01,619 --> 02:02:05,059
Two stone, baby, I don't know

3389
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:08,459
I always throw a fist even when I lose at rock-paper-scissors

3390
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,899
I always throw a fist even when I lose at rock-paper-scissors

3391
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:15,398
Get it, hit it, call me

3392
02:02:15,399 --> 02:02:19,099
Hit a bullet on his darn dome

3393
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,100
Bring it on.

3394
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:23,568
Foggy!

3395
02:02:23,569 --> 02:02:25,810
Foggyatthebottom is showing off his skills.

3396
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:28,350
- Don Mills almost threw a fist. - It's so scary.

3397
02:02:28,649 --> 02:02:29,949
It's so scary.

3398
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:31,279
Are you all ready?

3399
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:33,319
He's cute.

3400
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,590
Drop that beat.

3401
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:37,688
(Block 1 starts rapping.)

3402
02:02:37,689 --> 02:02:39,590
I'm looking forward to this.

3403
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,560
Hello?

3404
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:48,499
Same number, who this? do I know you?

3405
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:52,068
Know you can't even have one sip of my soju

3406
02:02:52,069 --> 02:02:55,509
I'm good-looking, I don't need a mirror

3407
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:59,078
Be a good brother, listen to what I told you

3408
02:02:59,079 --> 02:03:02,578
I'm the darn boss, to US to Seoul

3409
02:03:02,579 --> 02:03:06,148
Didn't you know? Now you know

3410
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:09,420
Didn't you really know? Now you know

3411
02:03:09,689 --> 02:03:13,119
If you don't know, well, Khan, now you know

3412
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:16,828
I lower my pants by 3mm and get out the road like my room

3413
02:03:16,829 --> 02:03:17,959
Timberland boots on my feet

3414
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,259
Duffle bag on my shoulders, and I wear my hoodie Phat Farm

3415
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:21,469
I'm here again

3416
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:24,170
The gold-plated chain which always shines at night isn't forgotten

3417
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:27,399
The cubic-studded earrings are, of course, diamonds now

3418
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:31,278
Tell me later, I don't even have time to think right now, I'm busy

3419
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,679
Add wasabi powder, pour it all in

3420
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:34,749
Then add an appropriate amount of water, so proper

3421
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:36,379
My image from the time I held the knife

3422
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:37,879
Now this flow is my chopper

3423
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,549
Cash at the woo, babe, meeting the boss

3424
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:41,818
I'll be setting then shooting the vision like Pop Smoke

3425
02:03:41,819 --> 02:03:45,389
Pop, let's go

3426
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:48,929
Pop, let's go

3427
02:03:48,930 --> 02:03:52,398
Pop, let's go

3428
02:03:52,399 --> 02:03:54,969
Pop, let's go

3429
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:56,130
Let's go

3430
02:03:57,670 --> 02:03:59,599
- What was that? - Let's go.

3431
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:03,009
They're both powerful when the whole block raps together.

3432
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:04,939
They seem the same but different.

3433
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:06,680
DJ, drop that beat.

3434
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:08,049
Okay.

3435
02:04:08,050 --> 02:04:09,949
(Block 2 starts rapping first.)

3436
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:11,880
Loopy will be so good.

3437
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:14,920
I like this combination.

3438
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:16,250
Let's go, Raf!

3439
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:18,890
Let's go!

3440
02:04:19,090 --> 02:04:21,559
I said skip the breakfast, wake up late, about to throw up

3441
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:23,228
I pretend to be busy and ignore, call up

3442
02:04:23,229 --> 02:04:24,828
Your Rickey Owens, get the dust off

3443
02:04:24,829 --> 02:04:26,358
Popping another bottle, I'm not going, it's too far

3444
02:04:26,359 --> 02:04:28,068
These dry as need me water

3445
02:04:28,069 --> 02:04:29,799
I would rather walk than getting in that car

3446
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:31,469
Open up Google Maps, walk for an hour

3447
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:33,269
Get me some fresh air pass

3448
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:36,038
Yes, babe, stash that, drop that bass hard and make these boys clap

3449
02:04:36,039 --> 02:04:37,709
They're never going to find me because it's matte black

3450
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:39,408
Business talk or no talk, call back

3451
02:04:39,409 --> 02:04:40,948
Hit the Henz took a shot of Bombay

3452
02:04:40,949 --> 02:04:42,709
Make the ground shake, thought it was an earthquake

3453
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:44,379
Mine is fresh sipping

3454
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:46,818
Roughly hit and run, I'm going to play it bad

3455
02:04:46,819 --> 02:04:49,988
I'm not interested in you all who talk a lot, it's new, you know it

3456
02:04:49,989 --> 02:04:53,288
I'm not interested in you all who talk a lot, it's new, you know it

3457
02:04:53,289 --> 02:04:56,559
I'm not interested in you all who talk a lot, it's new, you know it

3458
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,328
Did he forget the lyrics?

3459
02:04:58,329 --> 02:05:00,868
I'm not interested in you all who talk a lot, it's new, you know it

3460
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:03,270
You're going to feel the pain

3461
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:06,469
Today, I'm growing a seed on a random beat

3462
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:08,339
I'm not interested in you all who talk a lot

3463
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,108
It's new, my Prada, you know it

3464
02:05:10,109 --> 02:05:11,978
I'm not interested in you all who talk a lot

3465
02:05:11,979 --> 02:05:13,579
It's new, my Prada, you know it

3466
02:05:14,279 --> 02:05:15,310
My goodness.

3467
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:17,079
Loopy.

3468
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:20,579
- Brother, go - Know it

3469
02:05:20,819 --> 02:05:21,850
What's going on?

3470
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:23,789
Oh, no. Loopy.

3471
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,189
That's too bad.

3472
02:05:26,859 --> 02:05:27,859
Let's go.

3473
02:05:28,489 --> 02:05:29,988
(Block 1 starts rapping.)

3474
02:05:29,989 --> 02:05:32,960
- Tray B is rapping. - Kim Tae Hee.

3475
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,630
Kim Tae Hee!

3476
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:36,330
- Kim Tae Hee! - Kim Tae Hee!

3477
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,270
- Kim Tae Hee! - Yes.

3478
02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:39,899
- Kim Tae Hee! - Yes.

3479
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,509
Everyone's Kim Tae Hee here

3480
02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:44,339
Because every day, it rains in their lives

3481
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,839
They're always below me

3482
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,339
I got no dot, it's a waste of time

3483
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:49,108
- Fools talk about me - He's so good.

3484
02:05:49,109 --> 02:05:50,948
Your words prove the opposite, Tray B getting rich

3485
02:05:50,949 --> 02:05:52,849
SCH YEL I always shine

3486
02:05:52,850 --> 02:05:54,318
We get money for nothing

3487
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:56,749
Baaw, tell me where the opposite block is

3488
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:58,158
Me and my boy, we going pop out

3489
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,318
Yes, Fleeky like, Fleeky you beat them

3490
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:02,728
I beat them twice, Polo, you beat them up

3491
02:06:02,729 --> 02:06:03,959
- We smoking on too many - His vocal projection is good.

3492
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,799
- We're already successful - Tray B is too good.

3493
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:07,769
Pop, we're going to pull up and beat them up

3494
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:10,868
SCH YEL whipping up in the studio, always rapping

3495
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:14,339
Club people are tripping on me, bad little girl, I'm not interested

3496
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:17,568
BIG YEL knows the vibes, see the sky if you want to see your enemy

3497
02:06:17,569 --> 02:06:20,809
Diss me if you don't like me, I can make you a star

3498
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:24,209
Everyone's Kim Tae Hee because every day it rains in their lives

3499
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:27,478
They're always below me, I got no dot, it's a waste of time

3500
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:29,148
Fools talk about me

3501
02:06:29,149 --> 02:06:30,788
Your words prove the opposite, Tray B getting rich

3502
02:06:30,789 --> 02:06:33,959
SCH YEL I always shine, We get money for nothing

3503
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:37,389
They're always below me, I got no dot, it's a waste of time

3504
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:40,060
- Yes! - Yes!

3505
02:06:40,659 --> 02:06:42,829
This makes me furious.

3506
02:06:43,069 --> 02:06:44,738
- They're good. - It's all about the energy.

3507
02:06:44,739 --> 02:06:45,840
They're different.

3508
02:06:46,039 --> 02:06:48,140
- Their chemistry is amazing. - That was crazy.

3509
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:49,710
Let's go.

3510
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:52,479
(Block 2 starts rapping.)

3511
02:06:53,479 --> 02:06:54,750
TSP, shoot.

3512
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:58,119
Bring that 212 to the 82, you heard me

3513
02:06:58,579 --> 02:06:59,979
They're so cool.

3514
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:02,590
- Dang it. - If ain't with us,

3515
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:05,890
you're against us. You heard me?

3516
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:08,189
Nosun.

3517
02:07:09,029 --> 02:07:10,029
Let me get it.

3518
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:13,099
Young jit, grew up from the east coast

3519
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,828
I didn't learn well, so my thoughts are all illegal

3520
02:07:15,829 --> 02:07:17,269
- He's so awesome! - I hid under the chair

3521
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:20,698
When the police are gone, I sipped it, my purple cereal

3522
02:07:20,699 --> 02:07:21,868
Everything is boring

3523
02:07:21,869 --> 02:07:25,010
This isn't an internet cafe but jail county PC

3524
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:27,538
I refill through the drive-through

3525
02:07:27,539 --> 02:07:30,549
This clock 26, never been a vintage

3526
02:07:30,550 --> 02:07:33,478
I was a fool thinking how I didn't listen to my mom

3527
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:35,488
Repeating foolish behaviors

3528
02:07:35,489 --> 02:07:37,788
Losing money and freedom

3529
02:07:37,789 --> 02:07:41,059
I'm fed up, I know my goons from 5,000, going straight

3530
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:44,188
It's on the ground, and the apartment name is Skyline

3531
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:46,129
I went to pick it up when I was 15

3532
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:48,269
AR go far as 300

3533
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:50,299
This AR goes hard as 300

3534
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:52,639
Yesterday, I put my pride on the line with the challenge

3535
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:55,139
Pouring out the blood that has been building up, covering everything

3536
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:56,438
I never look back

3537
02:07:56,439 --> 02:07:57,738
- They're so cool. - I keep looking up

3538
02:07:57,739 --> 02:08:00,608
Give a darn about you jerks, always keep a heater

3539
02:08:00,609 --> 02:08:01,849
I'll be on my own

3540
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:04,349
You talk too much for the whole day, You won't do anything

3541
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:06,818
Sliding with my brothers, see the headlights through my own

3542
02:08:06,819 --> 02:08:09,488
I'll be getting a lot of money, throw it in the ocean

3543
02:08:09,489 --> 02:08:11,589
I'll be in the ocean

3544
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:14,060
I'll be stacking all my money for the whole day

3545
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:16,460
For my family, I do this 24

3546
02:08:16,659 --> 02:08:19,059
Now I'm all alone, I don't even know where to go

3547
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:21,699
Now all the gang behind me, so I sip

3548
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:25,199
For the gang, so I stay up

3549
02:08:25,869 --> 02:08:27,599
We still going all the way up, you heard me

3550
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,640
Yes, sir!

3551
02:08:28,869 --> 02:08:30,009
- Yes, sir! - DTF.

3552
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:31,209
Yes, sir!

3553
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,810
- TFP. - That was...

3554
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:35,409
- This is so cool. - It was touching.

3555
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:39,249
It was the best performance of all.

3556
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:40,478
My goodness. I might cry.

3557
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:41,818
- I teared up. - Me too.

3558
02:08:41,819 --> 02:08:43,419
- I teared up. - What's going on?

3559
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:46,100
It was the most realistic stage out of all the raps we heard today.

3560
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:47,720
It was so cool.

3561
02:08:48,659 --> 02:08:49,859
Let's go.

3562
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,259
(Block 1 starts rapping.)

3563
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:54,470
- How will they rap? - I'm looking forward to it.

3564
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:02,709
Clink, the sound of something rolling in

3565
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:05,179
Brr, the sound of shivering in my dream, full of goosebumps

3566
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:07,908
Grr, the sound of rinsing the mouth to eat that

3567
02:09:07,909 --> 02:09:10,448
She says it's funny that I drag my pants

3568
02:09:10,449 --> 02:09:12,948
I'll do the settlement once I reach the top

3569
02:09:12,949 --> 02:09:15,648
- His rhythm is amazing. It's crazy. - I took care of the production cost

3570
02:09:15,649 --> 02:09:17,419
This flow is extraordinary

3571
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:20,589
The mountain to climb next will be sweet, like a candy mountain

3572
02:09:20,590 --> 02:09:23,559
Even the face of the rough guy got prettier

3573
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:26,259
Failure is the mother of success, period

3574
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:29,198
I just tested, and buried the past in a casket

3575
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:31,368
Going to buy a new necklace and bracelet

3576
02:09:31,369 --> 02:09:33,738
Pass me the lighter, breathe in

3577
02:09:33,739 --> 02:09:36,169
- Reach the top, dance with my cash - Why is he so good?

3578
02:09:36,170 --> 02:09:38,908
I only know of moving forward like the castle of a chess board

3579
02:09:38,909 --> 02:09:40,438
No cancel, let's go

3580
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:42,948
Even with water leaking into the house and the ship sinking

3581
02:09:42,949 --> 02:09:45,519
The notepad is still full, and I never bow down

3582
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,988
I continue talking

3583
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:50,589
I always talk about facts

3584
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:53,090
I always talk about facts

3585
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:57,759
Yes, okay, it's too sophisticated boys, be ambitious

3586
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,499
The public is smart enough to know it's not that great right away

3587
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,929
Okay, it's too fast, others aren't attractive

3588
02:10:02,930 --> 02:10:05,438
What I'm doing is a consideration don't listen to them, and ignore

3589
02:10:05,439 --> 02:10:08,139
Throw the cannonball at our trajectory and hit your ear

3590
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:11,038
Their rap is mild like Coca-Cola

3591
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:13,379
Pick up your girlfriend and move up and down

3592
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:17,079
She finds you mild like Coca-Cola

3593
02:10:18,949 --> 02:10:20,618
He's cool.

3594
02:10:20,619 --> 02:10:22,349
It's too difficult to vote.

3595
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:24,420
- It touched my heart. - His mistake made it nicer.

3596
02:10:24,789 --> 02:10:26,519
- I almost teared up. - Me too.

3597
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:30,060
The match between Block 1 and Block 2 has ended.

3598
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:33,529
As expected, it was neck and neck.

3599
02:10:33,659 --> 02:10:36,568
There's a story behind JTONG...

3600
02:10:36,569 --> 02:10:39,339
moving to Block Two.

3601
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,669
(Block 1 targeted JTONG from the start of the match.)

3602
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:43,568
(You were busy picking up trash.)

3603
02:10:43,569 --> 02:10:45,079
(You picked up a lot.)

3604
02:10:45,310 --> 02:10:47,109
(You picked up a lot.)

3605
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:50,078
- Yes! - My goodness.

3606
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:53,149
(They attacked JTONG throughout the Block Competition.)

3607
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:57,318
It was impressive to see how they openly talked about it...

3608
02:10:57,319 --> 02:11:00,118
in the battle with each side exchanging opinions.

3609
02:11:00,119 --> 02:11:02,728
It was exciting and relatable.

3610
02:11:02,729 --> 02:11:05,099
- JTONG is getting attacked. - I know.

3611
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:07,399
JTONG did his own style of rap.

3612
02:11:07,699 --> 02:11:09,568
When he was rapping like this,

3613
02:11:09,569 --> 02:11:12,569
I couldn't help myself but jump together.

3614
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:16,340
JTONG showed his character very well.

3615
02:11:16,539 --> 02:11:18,409
ShyboiiTobii was too good.

3616
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:21,349
He was in charge of the hook.

3617
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:24,579
I could feel his energy as if he was right next to me.

3618
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:28,850
Originally, he doesn't have that kind of vocal projection.

3619
02:11:29,189 --> 02:11:30,689
I was surprised by it.

3620
02:11:31,619 --> 02:11:34,219
The last rap of Block Two.

3621
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:35,559
They look like a fool even to themselves

3622
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:36,929
I didn't listen to my mom

3623
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:39,059
Repeating foolish behaviors

3624
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:41,568
The one that Nosun and Foggyatthebottom rapped together...

3625
02:11:41,569 --> 02:11:45,199
was the most moving performance of all.

3626
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:49,839
At the last stage, he made me choke up.

3627
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:52,879
They expressed what they've experienced and what they can do.

3628
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,409
That's why it was moving.

3629
02:11:55,579 --> 02:11:58,919
I think Block 2 was intimidated by Block 1's energy.

3630
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:01,049
First of all, Polodared did so well.

3631
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:04,390
I still remember his groove.

3632
02:12:04,689 --> 02:12:06,859
Okay!

3633
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:08,090
How did he do that?

3634
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:10,158
He showed a lot of his talent.

3635
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:12,029
He was flying on stage.

3636
02:12:12,659 --> 02:12:14,198
They showed cleverness appropriate for their age.

3637
02:12:14,199 --> 02:12:15,599
Introduce yourself.

3638
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:16,929
They were witty.

3639
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:19,238
DAMINI's verse was memorable too.

3640
02:12:19,239 --> 02:12:20,339
They say I'm a celebrity

3641
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:22,709
The raw energy from the old days surged,

3642
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:26,409
and she started mixing in her old tone.

3643
02:12:26,909 --> 02:12:30,108
It was nice. I could feel the raw energy of her past.

3644
02:12:30,109 --> 02:12:32,520
They showed their energy.

3645
02:12:35,649 --> 02:12:37,349
Just by two people rapping,

3646
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:38,989
they could intimidate others.

3647
02:12:39,159 --> 02:12:40,759
I was leaning toward them at that point.

3648
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:43,759
There was a sense of satisfaction,

3649
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:46,599
even though it wasn't our team, when each person's skill was...

3650
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:50,499
maintained and the agreed-upon performance came together perfectly.

3651
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:51,675
This is what a team should be like.

3652
02:12:51,699 --> 02:12:53,198
Kaogaii, you should've done something like this.

3653
02:12:53,199 --> 02:12:54,869
We will now begin the vote.

3654
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:58,810
- For goodness' sake. - Who should I choose?

3655
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:01,140
How can we decide?

3656
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:03,909
Wait. My gosh.

3657
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:05,750
This is hard. What should I do?

3658
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:07,879
There's no answer to this vote.

3659
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:09,220
I can't do this.

3660
02:13:09,619 --> 02:13:12,060
- Well done, DAMINI. - Thanks for your efforts.

3661
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:16,188
Let's all...

3662
02:13:16,189 --> 02:13:17,929
put our arms around each other.

3663
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:19,159
- Sure. - Yes, of course.

3664
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:22,270
Don't worry, seriously.

3665
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:24,569
I have no idea how it will turn out.

3666
02:13:24,939 --> 02:13:26,100
It's unpredictable.

3667
02:13:26,199 --> 02:13:28,470
I'll announce the result of the vote.

3668
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:31,539
Here's the result of the match between Block 2 and Block 1.

3669
02:13:31,779 --> 02:13:33,140
The winning block...

3670
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:38,419
I was determined to win at all costs.

3671
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:40,619
I never thought about losing.

3672
02:13:40,819 --> 02:13:41,920
We're not going home.

3673
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:44,050
I never think about losing.

3674
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:47,289
Will it be Block 1 or Block 2?

3675
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,189
What's happening?

3676
02:13:50,489 --> 02:13:51,828
It's Block One.

3677
02:13:51,829 --> 02:13:54,970
(Block 2 loses with 8 votes, and Block 1 wins with 21 votes.)

3678
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:57,430
- Thanks for your efforts. - You're welcome.

3679
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:59,770
- It's okay. - We did well.

3680
02:14:00,170 --> 02:14:01,369
They were powerful.

3681
02:14:01,609 --> 02:14:02,970
Block One is cool, though.

3682
02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:05,438
Right. They made it through...

3683
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:07,609
without their leader.

3684
02:14:08,149 --> 02:14:10,978
Our team members went through a lot.

3685
02:14:10,979 --> 02:14:12,319
Thank you for everything.

3686
02:14:12,819 --> 02:14:15,648
To all the rappers in Block Two,

3687
02:14:15,649 --> 02:14:18,819
thank you for your efforts and thanks again.

3688
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:25,100
It's okay.

3689
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:26,399
We did well.

3690
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:28,499
- Thank you for your efforts. - Congratulations.

3691
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:30,420
- Thank you for your efforts. - Congratulations.

3692
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:33,898
- Thank you for your efforts. - Loopy,

3693
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:36,039
everyone did well. Why are you upset?

3694
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:38,239
Gosh, Loopy.

3695
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:41,810
I know exactly how Loopy feels.

3696
02:14:42,609 --> 02:14:43,750
But...

3697
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:46,220
I like that we won.

3698
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:48,149
I think Loopy is crying.

3699
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:51,489
Right. Of course, he'll feel the pressure.

3700
02:14:51,689 --> 02:14:53,590
Keep your head up, brother.

3701
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:54,890
Come on.

3702
02:14:54,891 --> 02:14:56,389
- Loopy. - Loopy.

3703
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:57,658
- Why? - Keep your head up.

3704
02:14:57,659 --> 02:14:59,159
You did a good job.

3705
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:01,529
You did a good job.

3706
02:15:01,569 --> 02:15:02,600
Loopy.

3707
02:15:03,329 --> 02:15:05,238
You did what you had to do.

3708
02:15:05,239 --> 02:15:06,398
- But this is... - Also...

3709
02:15:06,399 --> 02:15:08,709
- It was fun watching it. - Yes.

3710
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:11,270
We need to vote solely about this match.

3711
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:12,840
Don't be agitated.

3712
02:15:14,979 --> 02:15:16,050
My gosh.

3713
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,890
- Keep your head up. - Everyone did well.

3714
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:23,119
Keep your head up.

3715
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:24,960
Why?

3716
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:26,789
We were so cool.

3717
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:30,560
I feel bad for Loopy.

3718
02:15:30,729 --> 02:15:33,430
Loopy must be very upset.

3719
02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:36,569
I was just...

3720
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:39,199
thinking "What am I?"

3721
02:15:39,699 --> 02:15:42,068
"What should I do?"

3722
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:44,169
I was supposed to do something...

3723
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:48,550
to prevent us from being in danger.

3724
02:15:49,079 --> 02:15:50,909
My mind was in turmoil.

3725
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:53,720
Everyone, you all did a great job.

3726
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:54,890
You were amazing.

3727
02:15:54,989 --> 02:15:56,589
- We were amazing. - We had so much fun.

3728
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:58,819
We showed what we had.

3729
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:00,260
- Seriously. - Yes.

3730
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:02,489
- We were amazing. - You were crazy good.

3731
02:16:04,899 --> 02:16:06,930
Members of RAP: PUBLIC,

3732
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:10,430
the blocks that won the third Block Match are...

3733
02:16:10,670 --> 02:16:14,568
Block 1, Block 3, and Block 4.

3734
02:16:14,569 --> 02:16:16,368
(Third Block Match winners: Block 1, Block 3, and Block 4)

3735
02:16:16,369 --> 02:16:17,609
Good job.

3736
02:16:17,909 --> 02:16:19,639
The winning blocks...

3737
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:22,380
will receive 20,000 dollars of Block Money.

3738
02:16:24,149 --> 02:16:25,278
Yes.

3739
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:28,648
(Current Block Money Ranking)

3740
02:16:28,649 --> 02:16:30,350
(1. Block 1:43,000 dollars)

3741
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:33,659
We're the winning team in terms of Block Money.

3742
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,290
(Whipping)

3743
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:38,398
I feel good. It's not only words that we're a strong team.

3744
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:39,958
People were talking.

3745
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:41,359
Now, we're in first place for real.

3746
02:16:42,129 --> 02:16:43,399
What's funny is that...

3747
02:16:43,530 --> 02:16:45,138
SINCE moved there from us,

3748
02:16:45,139 --> 02:16:46,769
and OSUN left you.

3749
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:48,099
We beat Block 5, and you beat Block 6.

3750
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:50,708
- JTONG moved from here too. - You're right.

3751
02:16:50,709 --> 02:16:53,109
Things don't work out well if you leave your original block.

3752
02:16:53,610 --> 02:16:57,350
I moved to a new block seeking an adventure.

3753
02:16:57,450 --> 02:17:00,579
But we lost, so my mind is in turmoil.

3754
02:17:00,979 --> 02:17:02,750
I want to deny the reality so badly.

3755
02:17:03,149 --> 02:17:04,590
Okay. Let it sink in.

3756
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:06,189
The defeated blocks,

3757
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:09,090
including the leader and all members,

3758
02:17:09,590 --> 02:17:10,629
Including the leader?

3759
02:17:10,889 --> 02:17:12,729
Will be sent to the deathmatch.

3760
02:17:13,059 --> 02:17:14,099
For goodness' sake.

3761
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:16,629
If I lose, will I be eliminated?

3762
02:17:16,899 --> 02:17:21,340
I thought the leaders wouldn't get eliminated.

3763
02:17:21,809 --> 02:17:23,840
- Including the leader is too much. - Right.

3764
02:17:23,969 --> 02:17:25,138
This is strange.

3765
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:27,340
Can't the leader use the elimination exemption card?

3766
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:30,548
Anyway, the previous deathmatch...

3767
02:17:30,549 --> 02:17:32,120
was done by leaders.

3768
02:17:32,350 --> 02:17:33,520
Yes.

3769
02:17:35,819 --> 02:17:37,049
OSUN did well today.

3770
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:39,558
I was annoyed.

3771
02:17:39,559 --> 02:17:41,389
Things aren't going my way.

3772
02:17:41,489 --> 02:17:44,790
They even gave me a leader position.

3773
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:47,500
We can climb up again.

3774
02:17:48,129 --> 02:17:49,269
I'll do my best.

3775
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:51,739
We all don't want to go home.

3776
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,899
Can't we just start now? I want to rap quickly.

3777
02:17:55,139 --> 02:17:56,840
Let's just do a cypher.

3778
02:17:58,110 --> 02:18:00,439
The format of this deathmatch is...

3779
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,960
- They're announcing immediately. - I guess we need to prepare.

3780
02:18:03,979 --> 02:18:05,719
Performance Match.

3781
02:18:06,049 --> 02:18:07,219
- Performance? - My goodness.

3782
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,589
What's a Performance Match?

3783
02:18:08,590 --> 02:18:09,990
Do we need to create a performance?

3784
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:11,420
Like how?

3785
02:18:11,889 --> 02:18:13,360
In the Performance Match,

3786
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,190
all members of the defeated block participate,

3787
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:20,898
and each block must complete a performance...

3788
02:18:20,899 --> 02:18:22,059
to battle against each other.

3789
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:24,670
Oh, it's a battle between blocks.

3790
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:26,468
Oh, it's a team battle again.

3791
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:27,500
It's about teamwork.

3792
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:30,669
It was a relief as it wasn't an individual deathmatch.

3793
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:34,109
The survival possibility reduces for individual deathmatches.

3794
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:36,009
We need to prepare a performance.

3795
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:39,849
We need to show how we become one team in our performance.

3796
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:42,319
Let's go. We can do this again.

3797
02:18:42,450 --> 02:18:44,350
Loopy, we can do it.

3798
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:46,318
Since Loopy made a mistake,

3799
02:18:46,319 --> 02:18:48,290
he thinks we lost because of him.

3800
02:18:48,590 --> 02:18:50,489
But I don't think so.

3801
02:18:50,590 --> 02:18:53,158
We have a good chance to perform together again.

3802
02:18:53,159 --> 02:18:56,700
I tried hard to think positively.

3803
02:18:57,430 --> 02:19:00,399
According to the result of the deathmatch, one block...

3804
02:19:03,909 --> 02:19:05,739
may survive all together.

3805
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:10,849
How about the others?

3806
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:12,180
We'll win!

3807
02:19:12,219 --> 02:19:13,455
All the rest are getting eliminated?

3808
02:19:13,479 --> 02:19:14,578
That's terrible.

3809
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:16,889
Only 1 block among the 3 will survive.

3810
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,620
Two blocks will be eliminated.

3811
02:19:19,090 --> 02:19:21,236
They're only letting four blocks enter the next stage.

3812
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:22,760
This is thrilling!

3813
02:19:23,659 --> 02:19:24,860
Let's not go home.

3814
02:19:25,129 --> 02:19:26,829
We have more verses show.

3815
02:19:27,129 --> 02:19:28,229
Let's survive together.

3816
02:19:29,870 --> 02:19:31,370
We will never die.

3817
02:19:31,739 --> 02:19:33,799
We'll survive here.

3818
02:19:34,969 --> 02:19:38,940
Every other day, a crisis keeps coming.

3819
02:19:39,340 --> 02:19:43,149
We can't lose twice. We'll survive all together.

3820
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:46,219
We're so lucky that we won.

3821
02:19:46,450 --> 02:19:47,679
- Shortly, - Thank you.

3822
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:49,419
We'll start the deathmatch.

3823
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:51,119
- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

3824
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,888
Defeated blocks, please return to the Village...

3825
02:19:53,889 --> 02:19:56,329
and prepare for the deathmatch.

3826
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:58,029
Let's go. Hurry!

3827
02:19:58,030 --> 02:19:59,229
Hurry up!

3828
02:20:00,829 --> 02:20:03,599
(The deathmatch will now begin.)

3829
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,770
(You can do it.)

3830
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:12,839
(A desperate deathmatch for the defeated blocks)

3831
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:15,850
Go, JOONIE!

3832
02:20:16,209 --> 02:20:20,218
(The final stage where all members of the block risk their fate.)

3833
02:20:20,219 --> 02:20:21,949
(He showed everything on the stage.)

3834
02:20:21,950 --> 02:20:25,048
(We'll reveal the elimination candidate chosen by the leader.)

3835
02:20:25,049 --> 02:20:26,388
(Our first elimination candidate is...)

3836
02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:27,389
(The elimination candidate is...)

3837
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:28,710
(The elimination candidate is...)

3838
02:20:29,430 --> 02:20:31,898
(I felt I lacked a lot as a leader.)

3839
02:20:31,899 --> 02:20:34,958
(I kept thinking that this is so hard.)

3840
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:38,429
(I was frustrated because nothing was going toward my way.)

3841
02:20:38,430 --> 02:20:40,139
(I felt too bad and upset.)

3842
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,068
(I couldn't help myself.)

3843
02:20:42,069 --> 02:20:44,839
(I felt too bad and upset.)

3844
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:47,738
(The third deathmatch has ended.)

3845
02:20:47,739 --> 02:20:49,378
(Listen to me. We have this much money.)

3846
02:20:49,379 --> 02:20:50,509
(We can divide it.)

3847
02:20:50,510 --> 02:20:51,609
(What do you mean?)

3848
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:52,779
(I'm suggesting to divide the money.)

3849
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:54,119
(Don't tell the other blocks.)

3850
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,919
(I was sure that we were allies.)

3851
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,419
(Block 2 and Block 6 made a deal.)

3852
02:20:58,420 --> 02:21:00,189
(Can't we betray them?)

3853
02:21:00,190 --> 02:21:01,689
(It's a battle of guts right now.)

3854
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:03,388
(KHAN isn't that smart.)

3855
02:21:03,389 --> 02:21:04,589
(You aren't smart too.)

3856
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:05,798
(I told him.)

3857
02:21:05,799 --> 02:21:06,958
(He said, "I'll betray them.")

3858
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:08,968
(We're beneficial in this deal.)

3859
02:21:08,969 --> 02:21:10,728
(- You don't want to do this? - We'll do this by ourselves.)

3860
02:21:10,729 --> 02:21:12,798
(Honestly, I feel upset.)

3861
02:21:12,799 --> 02:21:14,039
(I trusted him.)

3862
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,669
(Kaogaii let his guard down.)

3863
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:17,339
(He's just so rude.)

3864
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:18,408
(Are you getting dopamine rush or not?)

3865
02:21:18,409 --> 02:21:19,638
(It's exploding.)

3866
02:21:19,639 --> 02:21:22,850
(I don't even see them as rappers now.)
