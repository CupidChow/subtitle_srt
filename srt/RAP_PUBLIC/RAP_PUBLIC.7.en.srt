00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:21,989
(RAP: PUBLIC)

2
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,600
Only the leaders were asked to stay. Will the deathmatch be different?

3
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,600
It was an unexpected situation.

4
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,999
Will we go against each other? There are two microphones.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,469
I was very nervous.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,340
If we go against each other...

7
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,478
(Deathmatch procedures)

8
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,950
Oh, no.

9
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,649
I feel like...

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:43,979
(Over there!)

11
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,280
- Over there! - Okay.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,048
(In this deathmatch, the leader of the losing block...)

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,049
(will determine the fate of the elimination candidate.)

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,059
See?

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,890
What? What does that mean?

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,659
I was a bit confused.

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,358
(The leaders will have a 1-on-1 battle...)

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,006
(with the elimination candidates they selected on the line.)

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,099
What?

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,770
For goodness' sake.

21
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,238
It was like a bolt from the blue.

22
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,879
Those rules were completely unexpected.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,309
For goodness' sake.

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,049
Seriously.

25
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,919
(The leaders will have a 1-on-1 battle.)

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,289
(If you win, )

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,988
(your elimination candidate will survive.)

28
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:25,989
(If you lose, )

29
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,070
(your elimination candidate must leave immediately.)

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,159
What's this? This is driving me crazy.

31
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,900
What should I do?

32
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,598
(2 hours before the Block Tournament)

33
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,869
Here's what I'm thinking about the deathmatch.

34
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,480
Like I said before,

35
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,578
send me to the deathmatch.

36
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,780
Do you want to participate in the deathmatch?

37
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,149
I think I'll be perfect for it.

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,450
Like I said,

39
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,159
I think you guys should show more on this show.

40
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,389
That way, when the show ends...

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,629
and you guys get an opportunity, you'll call me.

42
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,030
I don't care if it's a club gig or something else.

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,830
In any case,

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,039
I'm older and more experienced.

45
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,668
So I'm truly interested...

46
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,840
in helping you guys receive more attention.

47
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,508
Since I now belong in the older generation,

48
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,180
I want to teach things...

49
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,848
to the younger rappers I met.

50
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,560
I want to share my know-how and enlighten them.

51
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,460
You guys need more achievements.

52
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,389
No matter what,

53
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,900
take the stage when you can...

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,169
and make a good picture. That's very much needed.

55
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,568
If I survive and come back, I'll be able to help the block.

56
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,969
I don't know how the deathmatch will proceed,

57
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,340
but I have a feeling that you'll come back.

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,049
I'll do my best.

59
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,878
I'll tell you straight up.

60
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,795
If I need to pick three elimination candidates...

61
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,550
In any case, Loopy,

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,319
thank you so much for volunteering.

63
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,329
(In this deathmatch, the leader of the losing block...)

64
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,530
(will determine the fate of the elimination candidate.)

65
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,599
I was quite confused.

66
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,138
Our block's elimination candidates consisted of the members...

67
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,310
who could stay on the show.

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,239
(Block 3 was strategic...)

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,609
(about choosing their elimination candidates.)

70
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,650
They used their brains.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,979
They could win and come back.

72
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,550
Pick me.

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,089
I'll win the deathmatch no matter what.

74
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,158
I'll come back no matter what.

75
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
It occurred to me that this deathmatch would be hard.

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,030
Before I saw the rules,

77
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,530
I discussed with the block members about choosing the candidates.

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,869
Pick me. I can participate in the deathmatch...

79
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,869
and survive.

80
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,239
Choose the 3 of us if you need 3.

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,638
- I think that's right. - Yes.

82
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,679
- Do as we said. - The three of you?

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,809
- Yes. Go right ahead. - Seriously.

84
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,948
We'll survive no matter what.

85
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,508
We're pretty talented rappers.

86
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,620
Okay.

87
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,219
I was nearly losing it.

88
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,219
This is driving me crazy. For goodness' sake.

89
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,329
(There will be 3 elimination candidates.)

90
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,528
There's no way we're eliminating all three over a single round.

91
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,268
- Do we need to eliminate all 3? - In 1 go?

92
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,299
(Blocks that advanced to Round 2 will only choose 2 candidates.)

93
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,339
What?

94
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:32,309
(3 elimination candidates)

95
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,609
(2 elimination candidates)

96
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,350
(All the members have survived.)

97
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,649
Thank goodness.

98
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,889
How cruel.

99
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,919
Had I won a round,

100
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,818
I would've been able to save one more person.

101
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,759
That thought made me sad.

102
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,290
If I have to pick three...

103
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:55,269
(The leaders enter the Choice Block to pick the elimination candidates.)

104
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,970
Should I include Drain K or not?

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,208
(We entered the show to make the team more well-known.)

106
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:06,078
(If one of us gets eliminated, )

107
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,850
(the other will quit.)

108
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,979
If I go out there and keep winning,

109
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,620
all the candidates I chose will survive.

110
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm here with a resolution to save all of them.

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,060
I'll save you guys. Don't worry.

112
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,859
I'll take them with me no matter what.

113
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,899
(HAON)

114
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,370
I was very torn...

115
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,740
about O'Domar and JOONIE.

116
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,768
Choosing between the two of them...

117
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,910
was incredibly stressful.

118
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,980
- If you leave out the three of us, - Okay.

119
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,249
Those three will be the candidates.

120
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,378
But it makes no sense.

121
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,619
- They haven't even rapped, - There they are.

122
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,219
So they shouldn't be elimination candidates.

123
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,758
A decision like that...

124
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,329
- belongs to an unqualified leader. - I agree.

125
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,659
(All blocks...)

126
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,569
(finished choosing the elimination candidates.)

127
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,839
- They're out. - This is insane.

128
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:10,509
Let's go.

129
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,539
The leaders of the blocks that lost in the Block Match...

130
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,680
chose the elimination candidates.

131
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,079
Were they chosen again?

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,948
Oh, no. For goodness' sake. I'm ruined.

133
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,149
- I'll be back. - Let's go.

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,480
- By the Block Tournament results, - This is nerve-racking.

135
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,990
The blocks that lost in Round 1 chose 3 candidates...

136
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,059
and the blocks that lost in Round Two...

137
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,729
- chose two candidates. - That's good to hear.

138
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,730
Nice.

139
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,540
- Two. - I'll be back. They're dead.

140
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,516
I hope that there won't be any strict rules.

141
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,838
The elimination candidates that were chosen by the leaders...

142
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,480
- Let's stay seated. - will be announced.

143
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,679
This is scary.

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,050
- Yes. - Right away?

145
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,750
The following are Block Two's elimination candidates.

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,789
Yukon.

147
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,059
(Block 2's elimination candidates: yukon)

148
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,258
Kim Ga Yeon.

149
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,929
(Block 2's elimination candidates: yukon, Kim Ga Yeon)

150
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,059
(Block 2's elimination candidates: yukon, Kim Ga Yeon, Raf Sandou)

151
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,300
Raf Sandou.

152
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,970
Okay.

153
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Why?

154
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,169
What? What's going on?

155
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,069
What's this situation?

156
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,219
I choose Block Two's Raf Sandou as an elimination candidate.

157
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,819
The elimination candidates won't rap. I will.

158
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,490
I'll save them anyway.

159
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,318
Raf Sandou came to my mind first.

160
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,730
You won't get eliminated.

161
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,309
I'm certain that you won't get eliminated.

162
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,230
Why did he change the elimination candidates?

163
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,199
Raf Sandou probably didn't think that he'd go to the deathmatch.

164
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,910
I didn't know how to react.

165
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,079
The following are Block Three's elimination candidates.

166
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,550
- BBULKUP. - Well done.

167
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,120
- DOMMIU. - Okay.

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,750
DOMMIU?

169
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,318
- What's going on? - I definitely told Reddy...

170
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,790
to choose me for the deathmatch.

171
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,470
If the ones who can help the block and give strength get eliminated,

172
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,198
the remaining members will become extremely nervous.

173
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,470
That was why I made a decision on my own this time.

174
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,809
HAON, this is the right decision.

175
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,879
What was that?

176
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,159
This is the right decision.

177
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,079
I'm sure Reddy had his reasons.

178
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,059
The following are Block Six's elimination candidates.

179
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,029
I think I'll be among the elimination candidates.

180
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,369
- O'Domar. - O'Domar?

181
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,090
(Block 6's elimination candidates: O'Domar)

182
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,709
It really is the worst feeling.

183
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,779
I felt anger, but it was directed toward me.

184
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,609
(During the Block Tournament, )

185
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,519
(O'Domar made a mistake on the stage.)

186
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,548
So I couldn't curse the others.

187
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,820
But it was still annoying.

188
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,320
So JOONIE survived.

189
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,919
He kept JOONIE.

190
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,419
JOONIE survived.

191
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,360
- She did well today. - Yes.

192
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,628
Had it been two days ago, I would've picked JOONIE.

193
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,970
But she did very well today. It was in my mind.

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I thought it'd be best to be fair in everyone's eyes.

195
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,110
The following are Block Seven's elimination candidates.

196
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,679
MOON.

197
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,739
Foggyatthebottom.

198
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,849
(Block 7's elimination candidates: MOON, Foggyatthebottom)

199
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,879
Marv.

200
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,549
Okay.

201
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,149
Didn't Marv make a mistake? Didn't he stutter?

202
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,089
He stuttered a bit.

203
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,320
Hey, Foggyatthebottom.

204
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,820
- My goodness. - We need to go.

205
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,299
- What is it? - The deathmatch.

206
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
For goodness' sake.

207
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,900
The following are Block Eight's elimination candidates.

208
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,638
Daniel Jikal. KP.

209
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,639
(Block 8's elimination candidates: Daniel Jikal, KP)

210
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,169
- gamma. - It has to be gamma.

211
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,869
(gamma was the only member of Block 8...)

212
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,408
(who didn't rap during the Block Tournament.)

213
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,678
(Block 8's elimination candidates: Daniel Jikal, KP)

214
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,740
gamma.

215
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,378
Whether Hippie Kunda or Drain K gets eliminated,

216
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,320
they'll stay together.

217
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,720
Hippie Kunda can't get eliminated since she's the leader.

218
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,120
- That block is so... - It's so annoying.

219
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,259
It's so annoying.

220
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,120
Darn. That's just wrong.

221
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,189
Did she pick everyone expect for her teammate?

222
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,600
Hey, this is a bit annoying.

223
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,928
If I pick Drain K as an elimination candidate...

224
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,070
and made a terrible mistake,

225
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,808
my one and only partner will be gone.

226
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,679
He needs to survive...

227
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,049
so that we can make a comeback.

228
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,919
The following are Block Four's elimination candidates.

229
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,220
COCONA.

230
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,759
- What? - What?

231
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,719
(Block 4's elimination candidates: COCONA)

232
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,928
VIIN.

233
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,158
(Block 4's elimination candidates: COCONA, VIIN)

234
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,288
Kim Ryul.

235
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,609
(Block 4's elimination candidates: COCONA, VIIN, Kim Ryul)

236
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,929
Why? Why did he do this?

237
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,440
Just what happened?

238
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:11,039
Because of me and the members who rapped in Round One,

239
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,509
they failed to perform and faced the danger of elimination.

240
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,720
I must save all of them.

241
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,649
Rappers who have been called,

242
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,089
pack your belongings...

243
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,960
and move to the arena immediately.

244
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,659
It's so annoying to pack up.

245
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,359
I don't want to pack up.

246
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,589
We aren't going to pack up.

247
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,129
Don't even talk about packing up.

248
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,730
You're talking about it now.

249
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,745
"You're talking about it now."

250
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,769
- Don't even bring it up. - We'll get drunk today.

251
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,799
Let's have a glass.

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,570
Pay attention to the order of entrance.

253
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,169
Okay?

254
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,579
Thank you for everything, Reddy.

255
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,908
This might be the last time.

256
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,989
I don't know what it'll be, but it's totally doable.

257
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,720
O'Domar might survive the deathmatch.

258
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,510
- Come back soon. - Okay. I'll be back.

259
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,519
- Come back soon. - Okay. I'll be back.

260
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,759
Hey, Owen.

261
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,690
I'm leaving for the deathmatch.

262
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,019
I can't come back here if I get eliminated, so...

263
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,629
- What? - I'm leaving for the deathmatch.

264
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,039
Show them what you can do. Think of this as an opportunity.

265
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,210
I think it's more than enough.

266
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,639
- I'll be waiting. - Okay.

267
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,909
No matter what, do your absolute best.

268
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,409
Yes.

269
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,519
- Yes. - Let's go.

270
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,549
See you afterward.

271
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,119
Don't go first.

272
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,249
Watch people's reactions when others have a match.

273
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,890
I'll get going now. Let's part ways here.

274
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,990
- I'll be back. Get some rest. - Okay.

275
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,128
- Two, three. Trinity! - Trinity!

276
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,499
Let's go! Do well!

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,700
- I'll be back. - Okay.

278
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,699
A rapper who needs money sometimes

279
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,799
My family

280
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,199
But my family is about to break up

281
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,569
Just freestyle when you mess up.

282
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,669
You can survive.

283
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,409
You'll survive. Seriously.

284
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,349
Firstly, I'm sorry.

285
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,679
I'm really sorry.

286
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,878
With survival as our goal,

287
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,950
the three of us will stick together.

288
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,258
We'll meet again, right?

289
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,289
We'll meet again here.

290
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,619
One, two, three.

291
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,659
- Let's go! - Let's go!

292
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,629
- Let's go. - Go.

293
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,299
You can do it.

294
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,070
The deathmatch will begin.

295
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:28,480
(16 elimination candidates enter the arena.)

296
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,519
This is driving me crazy.

297
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,399
Elimination candidates, please sit by the blocks.

298
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,370
For goodness' sake.

299
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,768
They probably think that we're the judges.

300
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,840
That's right.

301
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,980
The rules of the deathmatch will be explained.

302
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,950
Among the 16 elimination candidates,

303
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,419
the number of rappers who can survive in this society is...

304
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,120
- Six? - Eight?

305
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,659
Only eight.

306
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,159
Eight?

307
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,059
We need to be included in the half.

308
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,570
It's half. That's good to hear.

309
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,070
Half.

310
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,370
I can do it.

311
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,039
I can save all of them.

312
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,980
Why are the leaders on the stage? What are we doing?

313
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:37,379
Perhaps we'll perform with him.

314
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,049
- With us? - With KHAN?

315
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,389
Us?

316
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,860
One, two, three, four, five, Get it, shake it

317
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,559
Why does KHAN look like he's rapping?

318
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,490
I don't think we're rapping.

319
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,429
The procedures of the deathmatch will be explained.

320
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,870
This part will be important.

321
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,899
In this deathmatch,

322
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
the leaders who lost in the Block Match...

323
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,340
will determine the fate of the elimination candidates.

324
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,849
- It's up to the leaders. - Will the leaders vote?

325
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,649
No, the leaders will compete.

326
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,869
- They'll do the deathmatch. - What are you talking about?

327
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,889
That's why they're so nervous.

328
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:22,788
They'll compete in the battle themselves.

329
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,029
This is annoying.

330
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,129
Wait. What?

331
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,469
I had no power whatsoever...

332
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,210
to change the situation.

333
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,908
It's so cruel.

334
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,480
They should just let us rap.

335
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,908
For goodness' sake.

336
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,279
They'll do the battle.

337
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,179
How could this happen?

338
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,179
It's so cruel.

339
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,120
It's so cruel.

340
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,750
All right.

341
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,289
Why does Kaogaii need to take on that burden?

342
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,505
The leaders of the blocks that lost in the Block Match...

343
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:57,829
will compete in the battle themselves.

344
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,299
KHAN will do it. KHAN will rap.

345
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,100
KHAN will rap.

346
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,139
- Crazy. - What?

347
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,138
Unbelievable.

348
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,769
- Reddy? - The leaders will rap.

349
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,580
The leaders will compete.

350
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,810
I see why he didn't choose me.

351
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,120
Why on earth are they doing this?

352
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,590
This is seriously annoying.

353
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,119
It keeps people on their toes.

354
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,659
We need to look at the leaders, not the elimination candidates.

355
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,029
PUNCHNELLO? Okay. Our leader will win.

356
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,369
In that case, we have an advantage.

357
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,028
- It's good. - We have an advantage.

358
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,569
Let's see the leaders.

359
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,840
It's good for us.

360
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,009
What's on the line? The elimination candidates?

361
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,409
The match will consist of eight rounds.

362
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,549
It'll follow the order of the beats that were provided in advance.

363
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,548
When a round begins, the two leaders...

364
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,850
who goes first and grabs the microphone...

365
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,120
will have a 1-on-1 battle.

366
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,429
When it happens, each leader...

367
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,190
will submit one card...

368
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,700
among the elimination candidates he or she chose...

369
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,900
before the battle begins.

370
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,470
After the battle is concluded,

371
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,210
the leader with more votes will win.

372
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,409
That leader will be able to save the elimination candidate...

373
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,240
whose card he or she submitted.

374
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,309
I'll work very hard.

375
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,779
But if the leader loses in a 1-on-1 battle,

376
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,950
the elimination candidate whose card he or she submitted...

377
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,859
must leave immediately.

378
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,359
The leaders will feel bad.

379
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,040
- Are they placing a bet? - One at a time. Yes.

380
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,459
- They're betting people, not money. - They're betting people.

381
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,599
They're betting...

382
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,099
the contestants' lives.

383
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,669
This is insane.

384
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,838
It's so cruel.

385
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,338
They should just make the elimination candidates rap.

386
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:49,779
If the leader doesn't participate...

387
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,109
- That's right. - It might happen.

388
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,879
- Strategically speaking, - They don't need to participate.

389
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,108
They might stand back and save the verses...

390
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,379
- if they don't want to save anyone. - Right.

391
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,480
Who would do that?

392
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,690
- Who knows? - Other than Kaogaii...

393
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,819
The leader's victory...

394
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,389
will be the only way...

395
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,329
to save the elimination candidates.

396
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,610
The only way to save the elimination candidates.

397
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,500
For goodness' sake.

398
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,230
I never imagined this.

399
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,268
To the leader, this is too...

400
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,440
- It's cruel. - It's bad.

401
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,338
It's too much.

402
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,109
Seriously, it's so evil.

403
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,950
In this deathmatch, the winners of the Block Tournament,

404
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,279
Block 1 and Block 5's rappers will be the judges.

405
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,420
Block 1 and Block 5.

406
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:39,259
There are 12 people then. A total of 12 people will judge.

407
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,029
I feel like a judge.

408
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,329
- It feels like an upset stomach. - I can't breathe.

409
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,940
I'll give it a go again.

410
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,410
Don't worry too much.

411
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,250
Please believe in me.

412
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,480
I'll save you guys. Don't worry.

413
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,489
I'll do my very best and save you guys,

414
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,759
so please enjoy the match.

415
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,309
Let's go back together.

416
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,109
Let's go.

417
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,250
You trust me, right?

418
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,220
I'll rap diligently to the best of my abilities.

419
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,319
Let's go back together.

420
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,730
The deathmatch will begin now.

421
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's go.

422
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,269
Let's go.

423
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,799
Round One of the deathmatch will begin.

424
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,910
Two leaders who want to enter,

425
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,979
please come to the center of the stage...

426
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,839
and grab the microphone.

427
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,348
- I'll go first. - Okay.

428
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:15,349
(Block 7's Chaboom versus Block 2's KHAN)

429
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,349
Here I go.

430
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,490
(Block 2 and Block 7 have 3 elimination candidates.)

431
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,859
That's Chaboom.

432
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,390
That's Chaboom's voice.

433
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,099
The 2 leaders who entered Round 1,

434
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,930
please submit the cards of the elimination candidates.

435
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,210
Chaboom, good luck.

436
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,279
Yes.

437
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,910
- Will they tell us the leaders? - Yes.

438
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,380
Round One of the deathmatch will begin.

439
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,720
Ready.

440
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,849
(Round 1 of the deathmatch starts.)

441
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,829
Start.

442
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,108
I was dumb as a donkey, I was ripped off

443
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:14,108
Everyone acted high and mighty after having a measly sum of money

444
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,879
Act like a fool, raise the shoulders

445
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,879
Everyone pretends to be a celebrity, I was so dumb

446
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,719
I did what pea-brained kids did

447
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,818
I'm tired of this, Fame, money, and women

448
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,689
They say you keep it real when you're on a reality show

449
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,629
I was dumb as a donkey, So dumb to be true

450
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,999
Among fake people, I was like a dog chew

451
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,160
I became a joke and my career exploded

452
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,469
To prove that I was different,

453
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,440
I ran the other way, Run, Forrest, run

454
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,669
I was dumb, I've been a changed man

455
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,969
My bottom is too heavy to go up the ladder

456
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,410
Now, I'm a grown man

457
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,279
Now, I'm a grown man

458
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,910
What on earth am I doing here?

459
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,018
One, two, three, four, five, Shake your head, shake it

460
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:02,029
Okay, I move in a crooked way and make a rising curve daily

461
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,098
I'll get rid of what's awkward and fill the gap properly

462
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,828
These jerks only talk big

463
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,298
They can't achieve anything, so they just back off

464
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,068
They try what they can't do I'll achieve all of their dreams

465
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,068
Replay from the very bottom, I'm focused because I have no cards

466
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,108
I've decided on my plan, no plan B, so move as planned and play

467
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,639
Jerks who say they can do anything run away when they're before me

468
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,909
Honk the car horn, move, because I take action

469
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,348
My life has no cap or fiction

470
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,749
I made a miracle from a semi-basement apartment

471
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,889
Food still comes before clothes, so I can't get tired

472
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,649
I can never go back, so I don't waste money

473
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,118
I need recognition, I must get through with a touchdown

474
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,929
Now, people click on my name, That's why I became greedier

475
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,659
If you think I've changed, you don't know me yet

476
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,528
Who was by my side when my name had no value?

477
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,629
My team was by my side, not you, Brothers on the street led me

478
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,338
I know what I need to do

479
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,868
Trust nobody, only my team is a consolation

480
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,368
We move like sharks even when we're busy

481
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,868
We must keep on going because it's too early to end it

482
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,778
I pray that I'll stay alive until I achieve all

483
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,409
I'll end them all so that they can't complain

484
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,530
We can't let our guards down until we become the best

485
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,250
Let's go!

486
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,000
(The voting begins.)

487
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,298
They're rapping harder since other people's lives...

488
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,470
- depend on this. - That's right.

489
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,779
(The voting is closed.)

490
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,880
- The voting is closed. - Yes.

491
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,220
I want to keep going. I want to survive.

492
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,549
I need to survive.

493
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,960
The result of the vote will be revealed.

494
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:41,789
The winner of this battle is...

495
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,869
the leader of Block Two, KHAN.

496
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,970
- The leader of Block Two, KHAN. - Yes.

497
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,079
Yes, sir.

498
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,039
Let's go.

499
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,549
The leader of Block Two, KHAN.

500
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:16,190
Leader KHAN, please reveal the rapper who will survive.

501
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,000
The rapper who will survive is Raf Sandou.

502
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,459
Raf Sandou.

503
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,829
(Block 2's Raf Sandou survives.)

504
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,470
Yes.

505
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,009
Chaboom, the leader who lost,

506
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:35,049
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

507
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,650
I'm sorry. The rapper who will leave is MOON.

508
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,789
(Block 7's MOON gets eliminated.)

509
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,759
I'm sorry. The rapper who will leave is MOON.

510
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,430
My goodness.

511
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,130
My goodness.

512
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:01,069
Rapper MOON, please leave now.

513
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:03,710
My goodness.

514
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,980
It's okay.

515
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,980
You worked hard. You did well.

516
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,619
Thank you.

517
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,849
- Go home safely. - Okay.

518
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,828
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

519
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:26,000
- I'm sorry, MOON. - Bye. It's okay.

520
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:36,009
I don't blame them for anything.

521
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,180
I'm still proud of them. One hundred percent.

522
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,150
I want Block Seven to do well.

523
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,690
It's no joke.

524
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,390
Even when it isn't a member of my block, I feel bad.

525
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,430
The battle will resume.

526
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,989
For goodness' sake. I didn't think that I'd lose.

527
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I can't lose.

528
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,379
Round Two of the deathmatch will begin.

529
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,410
Two leaders who want to enter,

530
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,518
please come to the center of the stage...

531
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,450
and grab the microphone.

532
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,588
- Do you want to go first? - Yes.

533
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,299
- Then this is your spot. - Okay.

534
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,339
The 2 leaders who entered Round 2,

535
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,909
please submit the cards of the elimination candidates.

536
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,990
(Block 3 and Block 7 have 2 elimination candidates.)

537
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,380
(Block 7's Chaboom versus Block 3's Reddy)

538
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,249
Round Two of the deathmatch will begin.

539
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,366
(Round 2 of the deathmatch starts.)

540
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,460
Ready.

541
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Start.

542
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,269
What on earth is this?

543
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,749
I make it big, I go up like a launched rocket

544
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,209
I breathe fire, a sucker punch

545
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,979
- Can't take me down - Is it Chaboom again?

546
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,818
I fly and earn 12 rounds, Euro, dollar, pound

547
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:31,318
I zip up my down jacket since it's cold at the very top

548
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,118
Hallelujah, hallelujah

549
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,129
Sweet words of the demon can't seduce me

550
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,959
My soul is bulletproof

551
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,528
My view becomes narrow, Even at the point of zero

552
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:42,169
I drift in a cool way, See you

553
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,568
I came a long way

554
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,639
They call me a B-lister for my lack of class

555
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,338
Don't pick at the wound, I got a punch to the guts

556
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,808
They said that I dug my own grave

557
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:53,479
But I set up a strategy with my brothers in my own way

558
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,479
I make money and pop the Cristal Champagne bottle now

559
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,979
I drink it up until I'm full

560
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,318
My family members and friends ride with me

561
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,618
With their heads held high

562
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,318
I say that I'll take them to the space

563
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,019
No takebacks for my bluff, I'm out

564
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,319
I see dead people

565
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,190
Yes.

566
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,660
Hey. Let's go, man.

567
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:17,729
The phone rings again and I answer like a parrot

568
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,298
The same day is a bore, I sell clothes when customers come

569
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,308
I just need to go slow like the big brothers said

570
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,038
Kids who started later than me already make money

571
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,749
They make money, but I still work at a clothing store

572
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,818
Four hours of commute, I waste my golden time

573
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,078
- Had I collected those hours - It's so nice.

574
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,318
I'd have real gold necklaces

575
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,118
On my neck like Nigo

576
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,758
I'm sick and tired of fake gold I've held out until now

577
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,489
Paloalto told me that I'm protecting myself

578
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,129
But I'm struggling, I'm barely holding out

579
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,229
Although I feel troubled, I need to tend to my customers, Work

580
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,598
- Work. - Yes.

581
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,700
My goodness.

582
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,440
He did well.

583
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,970
(The voting begins.)

584
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:59,278
What do you think?

585
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,249
- I think Chaboom was better. - Chaboom did all right.

586
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,450
Actually,

587
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,548
structure-wise, I feel like Chaboom has more...

588
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,889
- He'll win. - He'll win.

589
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,389
- It was really good. - Everyone will survive.

590
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,470
It suited the beat so well.

591
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,031
He became one with the beat. You know what I mean, right?

592
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,829
(The voting is closed.)

593
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,369
The result of the vote will be revealed.

594
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,509
The winner of this battle is...

595
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,980
Please.

596
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,380
Reddy's verse was stronger.

597
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,650
The leader of Block Three, Reddy.

598
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:50,390
- The leader of Block Three, Reddy. - Yes!

599
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,599
My goodness.

600
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:58,500
- The leader of Block Three, Reddy. - For goodness' sake!

601
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,769
For goodness' sake!

602
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,269
Oh, my goodness.

603
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:15,250
Leader Reddy, please reveal the rapper who will survive.

604
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,589
The rapper who will survive is...

605
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:19,690
DOMMIU.

606
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,420
(Block 3's DOMMIU survives.)

607
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,799
DOMMIU, come back.

608
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,569
Chaboom, the leader who lost,

609
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:34,869
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

610
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,140
I'm sorry.

611
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,450
The rapper who will leave is Marv.

612
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,279
Oh, no.

613
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,519
My goodness.

614
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,930
Rapper Marv, please leave now.

615
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:12,940
(Block 7's Marv gets eliminated.)

616
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:17,710
I felt so bad.

617
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,819
How could I be useless at the most important moment?

618
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,119
I felt like a piece of garbage.

619
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,920
Seriously.

620
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,130
Well...

621
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,799
I know...

622
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,239
that Chaboom performed the verse he was the most confident about.

623
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,839
I know from his expression that he had confidence in winning.

624
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,279
Thus, I don't resent him at all.

625
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,980
I really hope that he won't feel bad.

626
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,450
I'm very thankful for him.

627
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,220
I have such high hopes...

628
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,088
for Block Seven's members.

629
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,460
I want to hear about their victory later on.

630
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,630
This is harder than I thought.

631
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,558
I thought this would be easier to take in.

632
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,568
Kind of, like... It's kind of, like, a simple game.

633
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,929
This really is like the devil's plan.

634
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,940
It does. It is.

635
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,740
Round Three of the deathmatch will begin.

636
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,609
Two leaders who want to enter,

637
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,179
please come to the center of the stage...

638
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,420
and grab the microphone.

639
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:33,389
The 2 leaders who entered Round 3,

640
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,559
please submit the cards of the elimination candidates.

641
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:39,298
(Block 2's elimination candidates: Kim Ga Yeon, yukon)

642
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,619
(Block 4's elimination candidates: COCONA, VIIN, Kim Ryul)

643
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,369
Ready.

644
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:48,099
(Block 4's PUNCHNELLO versus Block 2's KHAN)

645
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:51,509
Start.

646
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,880
- I think it's PUNCHNELLO. - Yes.

647
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:03,219
My eyes spin, I feel dizzy every day

648
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,518
Jack in my left hand, A pen in my right hand

649
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,519
I can't think straight

650
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,659
Oh, my gosh, I pass out while writing the lyrics

651
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,788
I do it despite the headache

652
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:10,258
I swallow the smoke, In a drunken state, gotta go fast

653
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,558
I'll ax it 100 times, I must swallow this whole

654
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,959
I can't go back, oh, sorry, I can't do it for long anyway

655
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,268
I won't see you out, so bye I put it in my mouth again

656
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:19,538
I learned from that jerk Who cares? I'm fading

657
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,669
I'm going crazy, my head hurts, Imagination takes over

658
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,139
Bent back, drunken brain Go easy on me, sir

659
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,479
What can I do? I'm sorry

660
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,808
Everyone, go ahead because I hate it here

661
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,538
I'm suffocating, Shut it and get out of here

662
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,078
Yes, what do you want? What do you want from me?

663
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,249
I'm drowning, so leave me alone

664
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,479
The ceiling spins No one knows, absolutely no one

665
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,389
Was I in the wrong? My shout doesn't yield an answer

666
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,118
So I shout again in the end, It's heavy, so put it down

667
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,859
It's another adios

668
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,059
Yes.

669
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,130
It's Block Two's time! You heard?

670
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,630
- It's him. - Is it him?

671
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,929
I keep spitting it, it won't work even if you try, you're messed up

672
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,199
I flow on, I just overtake them easily

673
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,538
I know it all now 4Life, throw your 4s up

674
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,768
The situation naturally changed, Everything is locked up now

675
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,078
I got somewhere, I don't dry up like trendsetter

676
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,409
I changed my thoughts into attitude, always

677
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,679
The situation naturally changed, I know what everything is now

678
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,018
The situation naturally changed, Everything is locked up now

679
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,149
I got somewhere, I just spit it right away

680
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,690
No matter what you say, I just spit it right away

681
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,119
I'm sorry, is it our payday? It gets further away, mayday

682
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,789
Yes.

683
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
I think PUNCHNELLO won.

684
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:22,670
I think he won too.

685
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
He won this.

686
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:25,299
- He won. - He won this.

687
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,369
He definitely won this.

688
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,539
(The voting begins.)

689
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,250
(The voting is closed.)

690
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,489
Give me your hand.

691
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,689
He would have made it. It's okay.

692
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,829
I'm sure.

693
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,329
I will announce the result.

694
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,039
As the result of Round Three of the deathmatch,

695
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,409
the two have the same score.

696
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,299
The two have the same score.

697
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,849
What?

698
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,569
The two have the same score.

699
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,059
- No. Please. - No.

700
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,089
Since you have the same score,

701
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,630
you will have a rematch.

702
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,469
In the rematch,

703
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,840
a 1-on-1 battle without music will be conducted.

704
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,610
Goodness.

705
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,280
Is it without music again?

706
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,880
This is done.

707
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,320
Gosh... Without music.

708
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,320
Goodness. It's so cruel here.

709
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,750
I know.

710
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:53,819
The rematch of Round Three...

711
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,420
of the deathmatch will begin.

712
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,768
My flow goes on to the end of the Pacific

713
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,368
I pray it goes far away with the waves like a child

714
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,908
That's why no one can predict my success

715
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,509
Just like you grew up to be the older son who is hopeless

716
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,009
I swear that only the sky is the witness to my sweat

717
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,779
Those who only blabbered clear their throats in front of me

718
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,510
I still trust myself

719
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,219
They're just a piece of cake like dessert

720
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,789
Through all the temptations, my life always

721
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,289
Produces a movie like I'm DJ

722
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,699
He can win.

723
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,570
Hey.

724
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,900
I've got this vibe, I don't need that mic

725
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,669
They say I'm all dead now, Not as good as before

726
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,578
What nonsense is that? Have they ever been alive?

727
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,638
I'm always prepared, Yes, work hard, play hard

728
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,948
I don't know, just play harder, Chop me a hundred times

729
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:53,319
I'm still alive, game over

730
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,049
You'll get hit while you look down on me, neck slice

731
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,149
- Slap and pour - He definitely won.

732
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,750
Two bottles of soju and it's game time

733
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,158
Cheers to myself who survived death

734
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,260
All hail the fool, I keep pouring it in

735
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,699
We will now begin the vote.

736
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,070
(The voting begins.)

737
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,379
(The voting is closed.)

738
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,280
I will announce the results.

739
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,380
The leader who won this battle...

740
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,860
- Please. Block Four. - We won.

741
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,530
Is PUNCHNELLO, the leader of Block Four.

742
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,069
- It's PUNCHNELLO, - Nice.

743
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,099
The leader of Block Four.

744
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,440
It's PUNCHNELLO, the leader of Block Four.

745
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:52,909
What?

746
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,940
Oh, shoot.

747
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,489
Leader PUNCHNELLO, please reveal the rapper who will survive.

748
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,388
The rapper who will survive from Block Four...

749
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:07,559
is Kim Ryul.

750
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:11,889
(Block 4's Kim Ryul survived.)

751
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,070
KHAN, the leader who lost,

752
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:21,139
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

753
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
I think it will be her.

754
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,150
Is it yukon?

755
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,150
Who would he have put?

756
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,118
I think it would be Ga Yeon.

757
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,420
- Goodness. - It would be in order.

758
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,690
It's Kim Ga Yeon.

759
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,690
(Block 2's Kim Ga Yeon gets eliminated.)

760
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,730
It's Kim Ga Yeon.

761
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,769
Rapper Kim Ga Yeon,

762
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:59,009
please leave now.

763
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,110
It was the best.

764
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,210
I'm sorry.

765
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,409
- Win and show us great stages. - Okay.

766
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,559
I should save them.

767
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,730
That's what I thought.

768
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:18,760
I should have practiced instead of making Ga Yeon practice.

769
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,210
This happened because I'm not good enough.

770
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,698
I felt so bad after losing like that.

771
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:25,840
I looked at Ga Yeon,

772
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:30,670
but she smiled at me so brightly.

773
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,139
So I felt so sorry.

774
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,150
It must have been very burdensome.

775
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,980
But he did so great there. So I was thankful.

776
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,489
I hope he can keep doing great...

777
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,519
and win first place.

778
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,789
Thank you.

779
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,889
We will have Round Four of the deathmatch.

780
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,229
The two leaders who will battle, please come to the center...

781
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,070
and grab the mic.

782
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,300
We're here again.

783
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:04,409
(Block 3 and Block 7 have 1 elimination candidate left.)

784
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,679
I'll take them all back no matter what.

785
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,279
I thought I could win.

786
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,550
I just had the will to save him.

787
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,150
Ready.

788
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:20,659
Start.

789
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,420
(Round 4 of the deathmatch begins.)

790
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,829
It's Reddy.

791
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,929
You feel me?

792
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,269
Let's go.

793
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,138
I wanted to become a villain instead of being nice and getting ripped off

794
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,038
I'd rather have them curse me

795
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,609
I take out one Marlboro with swagger

796
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,279
I look like I'll take out a gun

797
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,049
They look scared, They stay away from me

798
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,979
Actually, I'm a bit clumsy to become a villain

799
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,448
I was tied up with a spider web

800
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:49,718
It's not true

801
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,448
But it changes into an excuse even if I say the truth

802
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,018
The anti-fans come out and skip my music

803
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,819
For the crimes of becoming famous

804
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,558
People recognize me

805
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,288
I shouldn't get caught

806
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,058
I hide my face with Ray-Ban

807
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,759
My light, spotlight for a moment

808
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,229
I gear up again, vroom

809
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,129
Whether it's a lie or true didn't matter

810
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,669
You can't return to the previous track

811
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,339
You need to look at your dream from closer, zoom

812
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,509
Those who want to catch me only show up on the comments

813
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,238
My million-dollar smile, I only show it to my fans

814
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,939
The faceless hater's age was 16

815
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,900
I don't sue him, I just send him home with a word

816
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,150
What the heck

817
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:18,949
Goodness.

818
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,550
Is that Chaboom?

819
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,388
I never miss, miss

820
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:29,118
I'm a Jumong in this business

821
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,988
Pull the shutters down, lady, LBNC is here

822
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,799
Let's open the liquor, The result is decided

823
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,058
Hey miss, miss

824
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,868
K-archery, I never miss

825
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,729
I fill it like an outsider

826
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,268
Inside the cafe, my rash kids, kids

827
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:41,868
The pretty one among the bad ones

828
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,539
We're the original, Jangchung-dong

829
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:46,639
Give it to me, fill the glass to the brim and drink it

830
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,408
The stink

831
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,909
Many have rotten while going after the trend

832
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,979
Give it here, one drop is enough, You'll cover your mouth after this

833
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,649
The best makgeolli

834
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,419
The real ones know that we're right on point

835
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,619
Whip it

836
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,230
(The voting begins.)

837
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,170
(The voting is closed.)

838
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,619
- It wasn't just good. It was great. - He was great.

839
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,069
He has to win at least once.

840
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,780
At least once.

841
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,449
I will announce the result.

842
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,849
As the result of Round Four of the deathmatch,

843
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,090
the two have the same score.

844
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:36,829
(They have the same score.)

845
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,400
I think it's Reddy and Chaboom again.

846
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,099
Was it a tie?

847
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:45,469
Yes.

848
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:51,739
The rematch of Round Four of the deathmatch begins.

849
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:53,610
What?

850
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,609
(Exclaiming)

851
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,480
Honestly, no one is bad.

852
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,226
They keep going against each other.

853
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,349
Darn. What is this?

854
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,519
But...

855
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,658
The young one from Westside

856
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:09,629
Bono-dong, Ansan, Gyeonggi Province

857
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,529
No blue, no gold, no call, no palm tree

858
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,928
No Dom Perignon

859
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:16,629
Park Joon Leekajah Hair, Air Max 95 97

860
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,399
Slicked-back hair, Shoe Goo on the sole

861
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,169
I don't need to think about what character to take

862
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,868
Got no gimmicks keep it real, that's the Ansan style

863
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:27,109
My rap that covers the nights of the capital is the new OST

864
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,809
I don't stop, I'm the rapping player

865
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,320
- That's so cool. - Right.

866
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,448
A red box logo in the middle of the chest

867
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,058
I envied the older guys for that

868
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:44,259
I just drooled, Seeing it only doesn't satisfy me

869
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,029
It's just Nike C and C Stussy

870
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,729
I work at Kashina after being discharged from the military

871
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,069
I ride a car with a triangular star at the front

872
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,738
Until I take a ride around the cold Seoul land

873
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:57,038
Like the song I listened to every day at the store

874
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,739
I dreamed of a good life like Kanye

875
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:02,979
The cold air in Apgujeong made me shiver

876
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,750
But I still maintained the good vibes

877
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,619
(The voting begins.)

878
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,889
I don't know who did better.

879
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,260
Let's just leave it to him.

880
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
(Sighing)

881
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,370
- I don't know. - This is really hard to tell.

882
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:20,860
(The voting is closed.)

883
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,070
I will announce the results.

884
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:26,539
The leader who won this battle...

885
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,549
is Block Seven's leader, Chaboom.

886
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,820
(Block 7's leader Chaboom won.)

887
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,059
We won?

888
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,960
It's Block Seven's leader, Chaboom.

889
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,670
Well done.

890
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,170
It's Block Seven's leader, Chaboom.

891
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:15,449
Leader Chaboom, please reveal the rapper who will survive.

892
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,650
It's Foggyatthebottom.

893
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,059
(Block 7's Foggyatthebottom survives.)

894
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
But we're done.

895
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,999
- What? - We got MOON and Marv eliminated.

896
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,070
We just saved Foggyatthebottom, so we're done.

897
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,569
Reddy, the leader who lost,

898
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,110
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

899
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,940
The rapper who will leave...

900
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,880
is BBULKUP.

901
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,750
It's BBULKUP.

902
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:46,780
Do well.

903
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:51,889
Rapper BBULKUP, please leave now.

904
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,229
(Block 3's BBULKUP is eliminated.)

905
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,288
Well done.

906
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,800
- I'm sorry. - Well done. It's okay.

907
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,900
- Give me a call. - Let's stay in touch.

908
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,369
Take care.

909
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,510
I feel so bad for BBULKUP.

910
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,210
I felt how desperate...

911
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,619
he was.

912
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,619
The disappointment and everything.

913
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,828
I could see that he was trying to hide those.

914
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:30,889
So,

915
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,760
that broke my heart.

916
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,329
In the 1st rap and the 2nd,

917
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:43,070
I felt overwhelmed.

918
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:46,069
I knew how much he cared for me,

919
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,909
tried to give me confidence,

920
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,179
and tried to save me.

921
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,019
I hope he doesn't blame himself,

922
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,460
feel sorry,

923
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,929
or put it on himself.

924
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:09,359
(As a result of the deathmatch, Block 3's DOMMIU survived...)

925
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,098
(and BBULKUP was eliminated.)

926
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:14,940
Round Five of the deathmatch will begin.

927
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,340
Will Kaogaii go?

928
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,039
I think he will.

929
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,679
He said he wanted to save all of them earlier.

930
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,038
- Really? - Yes.

931
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,078
The two leaders who will battle,

932
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,780
please come to the center and grab the mic.

933
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,519
Grab the mic.

934
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,250
Hello.

935
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,250
(Round 5: Block 4's PUNCHNELLO versus Block 8's Hippie Kunda)

936
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,590
(Kaogaii didn't enter even in Round 5.)

937
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,659
The two leaders battling in Round Five,

938
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,159
please submit the cards of the elimination candidates.

939
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,268
(Block 4's elimination candidate: VIIN and COCONA)

940
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:50,768
(Block 8's elimination candidate: gamma, Daniel Jikal, KP)

941
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:51,769
Ready.

942
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,078
(Round 5 of the deathmatch begins.)

943
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,079
Start.

944
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:08,518
Spend my money, no reason, Spend my time, I enjoy more

945
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,189
They never admit it

946
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,959
Whatever, I keep making rap

947
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,328
Well, you need nobody I don't need anything, be nobody

948
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:15,959
Keep your distance, you idiot

949
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,629
I'm 100 percent, Your brains are empty

950
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,768
Your money, your problem

951
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,439
It's none of my business, I'm also dizzy

952
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,069
Your money, your problem

953
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,569
Your opinion, I live harder

954
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,979
I just do whatever after drinking, I'm tired of the persecution

955
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,379
I have too much anger, You don't know the real me

956
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,078
The boring everyday life, But look at the pay that falls on me

957
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,249
Goodness, The boring everyday life

958
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,288
Get lost, punk

959
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,759
I'm so real, I'm sorry, I take them all

960
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,419
I'm too real, I need a crack

961
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,058
I should still work and show them

962
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,459
I'm so real, I'm sorry, I take them all

963
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,129
I'm too real, I need a crack

964
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,800
I should still work and show them

965
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,569
Jae Yoon's bag is like a drugstore

966
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,169
It's already working like this

967
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,879
Who's there to take care of you when you're sick?

968
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,479
Break while you try to prove it

969
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,078
I provide mother's love if you become my person

970
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:06,379
I'm the reliable breadwinner too, It's not about the duty

971
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,178
- I run on the track as I want - She's doing what she's good at.

972
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,689
I brought the enemy's head

973
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,419
You can see he lacks blood

974
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,988
A Scrooge even if there's not much money

975
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,618
Handmade work that we always do

976
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,859
We're used to being the underdog, That's when we become the heroes

977
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,658
We used to be underrated

978
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:22,499
That's why we're here again, Keep it low at all times

979
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,928
My tongue is busy dribbling

980
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:25,828
Our team is like the official lead, Gryffindor

981
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,029
There's no hatred in my glass, but I'm tripping, though

982
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,039
Winning KP

983
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,440
Winning gamma

984
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,880
Winning Daniel

985
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,119
Team 8, team 8

986
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,219
She did well.

987
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,989
Our leader is good.

988
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:50,960
(The voting begins.)

989
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,199
(The voting is closed.)

990
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,599
Please.

991
00:49:58,469 --> 00:49:59,500
Please.

992
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:03,739
I will announce the results.

993
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:07,039
As the result of Round Five of the deathmatch,

994
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,600
the two have the same score.

995
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,820
Is it a tie again for PUNCHNELLO?

996
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,488
Why?

997
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:19,789
Is it a tie again?

998
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,260
Are you serious?

999
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,059
The rematch of Round Four of the deathmatch begins.

1000
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:34,939
Yes, I'm crazy

1001
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,439
I punch the wall if I can't focus on work

1002
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,078
Experiment subject number one, Hippie needs that brain surgery

1003
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,779
A sea named Under, We're at the edge of the water

1004
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,408
Experiment subject number one, Hippie needs that brain surgery

1005
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,118
I made the good fight, We're decent in the rappers' fight

1006
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,888
We just smoke a cigarette and drift apart, let the beat go

1007
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,389
We should go and lose our dreams

1008
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,489
She did well.

1009
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,268
Pour it in the mouth, don't stop it

1010
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,569
How can I stop it?

1011
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,468
Tired eyes, It's filled with cigarette smoke

1012
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,198
Everyone nods under the lights

1013
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,908
I don't give a thing about it, I fill another glass

1014
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:12,069
I untie all the things that tied me up

1015
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,038
Here we go again, my dizzy head

1016
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,839
It's useless, my phone is ringing again

1017
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,749
- I turn it off and leave me here - He's really good.

1018
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,509
It can be dark, it has to be dark

1019
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,518
I turn around, The world turns with me

1020
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,348
It can be dark, it has to be dark

1021
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:25,948
I turn around, The world turns with me

1022
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,789
- How do you beat that? - Yes!

1023
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:31,329
That was great!

1024
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,529
We will begin voting.

1025
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,699
(The voting begins.)

1026
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,869
It's so difficult.

1027
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,030
Goodness.

1028
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,099
(The voting is closed.)

1029
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,239
I will announce the results.

1030
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,480
The leader who won this battle...

1031
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,190
is Block Four's leader, PUNCHNELLO.

1032
00:51:57,389 --> 00:52:00,119
Yes!

1033
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,260
- Darn it. - Yes!

1034
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,130
Yes!

1035
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
He's so good.

1036
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,069
- It was crazy. - He's so good.

1037
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,639
The rapper who survives in Block Four is COCONA.

1038
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:17,269
(Block 4's COCONA survives.)

1039
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,408
Hippie Kunda, the leader who lost,

1040
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:24,809
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

1041
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,050
The rapper who will leave from Block Eight...

1042
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,190
is KP.

1043
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,630
(Block 8's KP is eliminated.)

1044
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,059
- What? - Why?

1045
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,469
That's a shame.

1046
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,570
Rapper KP, please leave now.

1047
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,019
- Why? - Why?

1048
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:10,629
"Is it really the end?"

1049
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,829
It didn't seem real.

1050
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,300
I should go out and start again.

1051
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,869
It feels like I had another fun experience.

1052
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:23,469
I wanted to hug him, but I held that in.

1053
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,940
I thought I would cry...

1054
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,440
if I hugged him.

1055
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,280
That's why I just held his hand.

1056
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,820
But I couldn't believe it. He was really leaving.

1057
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,190
Darn. This is crazy.

1058
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,800
Round Six of the deathmatch will begin.

1059
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,329
- Kaogaii hasn't gone yet. - That's right.

1060
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,439
- Kaogaii... - I think he'll go now.

1061
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,098
Kaogaii should go. He should go at least once.

1062
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:57,070
The two leaders who will battle,

1063
00:53:57,269 --> 00:54:00,538
please come to the center and grab the mic.

1064
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:01,578
There.

1065
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:03,880
- Grab the mic. - There.

1066
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,479
Goodness.

1067
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
(Round 6: Block 2's KHAN versus Block 4's PUNCHNELLO)

1068
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:10,219
The two leaders who will battle in Round Six,

1069
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:13,590
please submit the cards of the elimination candidates.

1070
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,019
Good luck.

1071
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,789
Round Six of the deathmatch will begin.

1072
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,530
Ready.

1073
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:23,869
Let's go.

1074
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,969
It's KHAN.

1075
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,139
Start.

1076
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:44,989
Stop playing with me, there's no time, don't talk with me

1077
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:48,259
I have loyalty flowing in me, The doctor is shocked by my blood

1078
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,488
I get the big ones now

1079
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,529
A fantasy I never dreamed of before

1080
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,799
Those who said I wouldn't make it are done for now

1081
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,098
While you're doing something useless

1082
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,368
I take my girlfriend somewhere nice and check in

1083
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,399
I changed my life with my own strength

1084
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,698
I look for a better life every day

1085
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,408
Kambo and Superbee, Top spitta my brodie

1086
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:04,908
We open a new era here

1087
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:06,509
I'm ready to shoot at the target

1088
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,610
We only go for the best of the best

1089
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,280
- PUNCHNELLO again? - PUNCHNELLO.

1090
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,488
- It's PUNCHNELLO. - Is it PUNCHELLO?

1091
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:20,189
It would be legendary if he saves this.

1092
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,959
Act like a fool, What did you live for?

1093
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,629
I won't hide myself, I take it off

1094
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,259
- It's good. - I sprinkle blood here like a demon

1095
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,928
You drink it like it's sacred water

1096
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:33,328
They fight together, I say nothing They play together, I say nothing

1097
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,799
Goodness, PUNCHNELLO the king of pretense

1098
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,939
Your pattern is obvious, Just forget it

1099
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,879
I paint my insides black as I feel

1100
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,678
- It's crazy. - I just go, they talk too much

1101
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,979
You wanted to see my blood, here, I paint it black with my blood

1102
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,549
- Anomaly - He's so good.

1103
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,749
Anomaly

1104
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,019
Anomaly

1105
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,719
What?

1106
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,159
- PUNCHNELLO. - He's so good.

1107
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,130
(The voting begins.)

1108
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,828
This is difficult.

1109
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,230
It's too much.

1110
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,928
Block Four? Hold on.

1111
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,769
(The voting is closed.)

1112
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,968
I will announce the results.

1113
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:13,980
Please.

1114
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,349
The leader who won this battle...

1115
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,919
- Please. - Seriously.

1116
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,250
I'll be so happy if everyone survives.

1117
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,799
Is Block Four's leader, PUNCHNELLO.

1118
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,160
(Block 4's leader PUNCHNELLO won.)

1119
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,268
It's Block Four's leader,

1120
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:40,399
- PUNCHNELLO. - Nice!

1121
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,369
- PUNCHNELLO! - PUNCHNELLO!

1122
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,070
I love you!

1123
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:47,710
It's Block Four's leader, PUNCHNELLO.

1124
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:52,010
Well done, yukon.

1125
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,448
Leader PUNCHNELLO,

1126
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:58,289
please reveal the rapper who will survive.

1127
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:01,488
The rapper who will survive in Block Four...

1128
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:02,788
is VIIN.

1129
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:05,690
(Block 4's VIIN survives.)

1130
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,199
We all survived.

1131
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,329
It's a relief.

1132
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,840
They'd become very tight. It's crazy.

1133
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,439
KHAN, the leader who lost,

1134
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,679
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

1135
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,280
It's yukon.

1136
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,920
Rapper yukon, please leave now.

1137
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,420
I'm sorry.

1138
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,420
- Great work. - Gosh.

1139
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:32,719
Keep it up.

1140
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,429
I felt very bad when yukon left too.

1141
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,300
I didn't feel like I was cool.

1142
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,929
I wasn't good enough when I was the leader.

1143
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,499
Round Seven of the deathmatch will begin.

1144
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,239
(Only two leaders are left now.)

1145
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:53,808
Kaogaii hasn't gone yet.

1146
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,239
- Not even once. - Not even once.

1147
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,380
Why isn't Kaogaii going?

1148
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,909
He'd go now. There are two rounds left.

1149
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:03,888
The two leaders who will battle, please come to the center...

1150
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:05,650
and grab the mic.

1151
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,119
These two have to come out. They have to battle.

1152
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,788
(Kaogaii came out for the first time.)

1153
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,109
(Round 7: Block 8's Hippie Kunda versus Block 6's Kaogaii)

1154
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,969
The two leaders who will battle in Round Six,

1155
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:23,299
please submit the cards of the elimination candidates.

1156
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,469
(There are 2 elimination candidates in Block 8.)

1157
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,809
Ready.

1158
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,079
Start.

1159
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,598
No manager again, I take the wheel again

1160
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,569
I leave the agency and fill my stomach

1161
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,468
Tight schedule, Four jobs when I'm a rapper

1162
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,799
Mom quit her work, Her son bought a house

1163
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,538
Okay, let's pay the 3.3 percent tax well

1164
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,109
And eat them all

1165
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,110
I live as I want and earn

1166
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:02,979
- It's good. - But I pay the tax, I keep the law

1167
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,408
This is the tip

1168
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:05,879
To not get an indigestion even if I binge eat

1169
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,078
Rappers cause trouble

1170
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,079
And curse the person next to them but I stay quiet

1171
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,989
Where are those guys who said I'd fail?

1172
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,899
I'm on my mission, We got a large picture

1173
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,799
They put me in dot gas chamber, I can feel my rising temper

1174
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,698
I need more paper, The voices whisper in my head

1175
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,638
She so chatter, kick that beat while smoking a vape

1176
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,880
Darn that press, I hit my forehead even when I made it

1177
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,709
Those who chattered shut their mouth I asked and they acted awkward

1178
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,249
- She's good. - They take me wrong since I laugh

1179
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,919
Hippie is strong only when she wears a mask

1180
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,279
I want to be nice

1181
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,718
But why do they keep asking me to show my inner macho?

1182
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:45,419
Jack London, wildness calls

1183
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,959
I lead the block like a sled dog

1184
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,288
From the beginning to the end

1185
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,959
I keep rolling hard

1186
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,259
I don't care what others say

1187
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,788
I'm too busy to shake away the gossip

1188
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,328
Friends, quickly call me

1189
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:56,030
Take the call no matter how much is owed

1190
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,570
(The voting begins.)

1191
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,809
(The voting is closed.)

1192
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:16,526
- I wonder what will happen. - I don't know.

1193
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,789
I don't know about this. I can't guess.

1194
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,659
I will announce the results.

1195
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:23,860
The leader who won this battle...

1196
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,669
is Block Six's leader, Kaogaii.

1197
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,199
(Block 6's leader, Kaogaii won.)

1198
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:39,809
- Yes! - Okay.

1199
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,340
Kaogaii!

1200
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,179
Leader Kaogaii,

1201
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,550
please reveal the rapper who will survive.

1202
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,619
- O'Domar. - I think it will be O'Domar.

1203
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,518
It's O'Domar.

1204
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:55,190
(Block 6's O'Domar survives.)

1205
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:56,889
He did well.

1206
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,329
He was smart, in a way.

1207
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,099
Hippie Kunda, the leader who lost,

1208
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,769
please reveal the rapper who will leave.

1209
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,900
The rapper who will leave from Block Eight...

1210
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:12,510
is gamma.

1211
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,779
Rapper gamma,

1212
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,610
please leave now.

1213
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,079
Great job.

1214
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:25,519
Come here.

1215
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,789
It's okay.

1216
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,960
I'll get going.

1217
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,129
Too much greed, overconfidence, and arrogance...

1218
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,199
crossed my mind.

1219
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:41,400
I was very angry at myself...

1220
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,539
and felt very powerless.

1221
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,439
Those who watch this may also think...

1222
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,909
that I should have done well when I had the chances.

1223
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,280
I also think so.

1224
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,150
I won't forget this feeling and go straight home...

1225
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:56,050
and rap again.

1226
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,920
Round Eight of the deathmatch will begin.

1227
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,488
The two leaders who will battle, please come to the center...

1228
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:05,590
and grab the mic.

1229
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,510
- What is Kaogaii doing? - What's wrong?

1230
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:18,869
Why isn't he going?

1231
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,909
What is happening?

1232
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:24,779
The two leaders who will battle, please come to the center...

1233
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,650
and grab the mic.

1234
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:28,820
Does he have no verses?

1235
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:31,118
How can Kaogaii have no verses?

1236
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,249
He has so many verses.

1237
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,419
And grab the mic.

1238
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,690
No one is going. I think it's Kaogaii.

1239
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:37,929
No, he went up.

1240
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,110
Did only one person go to the stage? I hope not.

1241
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,670
He's not someone who exchanges one person with his verse.

1242
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,630
Round Eight of the deathmatch will begin.

1243
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,340
Ready.

1244
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,340
- Okay. - Who is it?

1245
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:51,610
Start.

1246
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:55,178
Rage? They'll do it on rage?

1247
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:56,340
He chose this?

1248
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,078
I say, okay cool, don't say too much

1249
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,788
Eat like Scooby Doo, My eyes are stagnant

1250
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:07,189
But even newbies are amazed, Hey, how much you

1251
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:09,459
I don't sell, I buy, I'm hopping on muscular

1252
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,529
Just the daughter of a hustler, You don't need to give me change

1253
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,658
The price goes up since we're two, Always keep double up

1254
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,229
I said this before coming up

1255
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,368
- What do we have to do now? - Let's just go together

1256
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:19,868
- Do we choose her? - If you like the stereotype

1257
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:21,698
- I don't know either. - Who desperately sells their soul

1258
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:24,768
We wouldn't be to your taste, Just do whatever you want

1259
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,439
Two is better than one, Three is better than two

1260
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,738
Then they come to me and become a family, is this the end of the road?

1261
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,340
No, he's lost

1262
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:36,079
What? Why is she rapping alone?

1263
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,158
- What is he thinking? Is he crazy? - What is he thinking?

1264
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:42,420
What is he thinking?

1265
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,889
Let's first see why he made that decision.

1266
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,530
Only one leader participated in this deathmatch.

1267
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:54,739
The elimination candidate submitted by the leader will survive.

1268
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,800
- What? - What?

1269
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:58,610
Did Kaogaii give up?

1270
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:02,440
The elimination candidate who survived...

1271
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,880
is Daniel Jikal.

1272
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,880
What? That's so crazy.

1273
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,550
I didn't expect such a situation.

1274
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:13,150
Block Six's leader Kaogaii...

1275
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:15,960
didn't participate in this round.

1276
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,730
The rapper should leave.

1277
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,859
- Kaogaii is crazy. - I got goosebumps.

1278
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,130
I don't understand.

1279
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:27,739
Does he think he's so clever?

1280
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:29,840
I'm really curious about what he's thinking.

1281
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:32,969
My plan was to eliminate him.

1282
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,738
I needed to make two slots,

1283
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,509
or at least one slot empty...

1284
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,750
to accept someone new.

1285
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,380
Someone who is good.

1286
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:45,219
"Are you rude? Are you bad?"

1287
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:47,219
"But do you rap well? Nice. Come."

1288
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:49,819
"You're really awesome. You're nice."

1289
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,540
"But do you not rap well? Get lost, loser."

1290
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:52,889
That became so clear to me.

1291
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,429
The deathmatch ended.

1292
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,030
They all looked desperate.

1293
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:01,099
The leaders carried all the responsibility...

1294
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,339
and did their best...

1295
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,539
to save their team members.

1296
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,909
That was very touching.

1297
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,210
When they submitted the name cards,

1298
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:13,050
they didn't put them down, thinking they might lose.

1299
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,595
They did it with the thought that they should save that person.

1300
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:18,250
I could see that they tried to fight until the end.

1301
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,049
And I think that...

1302
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,860
moved people's hearts a lot.

1303
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:25,190
I think that's how burdensome that position is.

1304
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,900
I don't think I can do it.

1305
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,829
The eight rappers who were saved by their leaders...

1306
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,599
will continue their journey in RAP: PUBLIC.

1307
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:38,170
The members who survived,

1308
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,539
please return to your blocks with your leader.

1309
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,348
- Great. - Great.

1310
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:52,449
- Great. - Great.

1311
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:53,989
Goodness.

1312
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:56,089
- You did so well. - Goodness.

1313
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,689
- You did so well. Well done. - Goodness.

1314
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,129
- You did well. - It's such a relief.

1315
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,800
- You did well. - Great job.

1316
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,968
- It was crazy. - How did everyone survive?

1317
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:06,729
- You were crazy. - I'm so relieved.

1318
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,538
You did so well. Well done.

1319
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:10,199
It's such a relief.

1320
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:14,209
He fell down while running out to get the mic.

1321
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,279
- Really? - Really?

1322
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,209
- His back was bent. - But I did a forward roll.

1323
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,050
- I rolled over. - That's awesome.

1324
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,880
PUNCHNELLO is really great, isn't he?

1325
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:25,320
He's really great. He did so well.

1326
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,988
- Hold it. I mean it. - Okay.

1327
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:29,760
There's something I said to you.

1328
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,888
- Well done. - Great job.

1329
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:33,389
- Well done. - Well done.

1330
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,929
Well done.

1331
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,669
- Let's do well, O'Domar. - Let's do well now.

1332
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,268
You really have to forget all about it.

1333
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:43,368
I'm really mad. I don't know...

1334
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:46,468
why he has to be responsible for this.

1335
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,655
That's because I'm the leader, and I won't get eliminated.

1336
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:49,679
That's the purpose.

1337
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,348
- You have to overcome it. - That's right.

1338
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:53,279
- Okay. - But you should be mad about...

1339
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,880
the fact that you stumbled on the words.

1340
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,720
- Okay. - You should be mad at that.

1341
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,618
(Kaogaii, Geegooin, Mckdaddy, Jo Gwang Il, )

1342
01:06:58,619 --> 01:06:59,820
(JOONIE, Kohway, O'Domar)

1343
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,388
(Reddy and DOMMIU return to Block 3.)

1344
01:07:01,389 --> 01:07:02,519
Goodness.

1345
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,630
(Sighing)

1346
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,730
(Block 3)

1347
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:10,229
- Great job. - No.

1348
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,469
Reddy.

1349
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,069
Well done.

1350
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,268
- Well done, Reddy. - Reddy.

1351
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:17,269
Well done.

1352
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,238
- You were so cool. - You did a great job.

1353
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:20,839
- You did a great job. - It was great.

1354
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,939
- You brought... - I'm sorry.

1355
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,439
- No. - Don't be sorry.

1356
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,948
You brought the best result...

1357
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:26,909
- We danced thinking you won. - Reddy.

1358
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,189
- You did so well. - Well done.

1359
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,219
You were so amazing.

1360
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:35,089
- They all told me... - You did an amazing job.

1361
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,659
- it was okay. - Reddy.

1362
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,800
It made me feel worse that I couldn't save...

1363
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:46,170
our members.

1364
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,408
- This was a really tough one. - I felt incredibly sorry to HAON.

1365
01:07:51,409 --> 01:07:53,969
- This must be incredibly difficult. - When...

1366
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,339
- I was in his shoes... - Seriously.

1367
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,980
Your verse was a killer too.

1368
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,930
I didn't know the weight of being a leader was this heavy.

1369
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,948
The survival of the members was at stake in the battle.

1370
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:08,219
So I could picture him just going for that microphone.

1371
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:11,360
I was grateful to Reddy.

1372
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,189
Let's do our best.

1373
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,670
- Yes. Let's go. - Let's do our best.

1374
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,328
- Anyway, good work. - Yes.

1375
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:20,000
- Thank you. - My gosh.

1376
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,239
(Reddy, HAON, Yang Kyle, OSUN, Yun Ha, James An, DOMMIU)

1377
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:27,369
- Hey, brother. - Now...

1378
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,340
My gosh.

1379
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:31,978
- Good job. - I lost two of our rappers.

1380
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:33,849
- Gosh, you did well. - Good job.

1381
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,850
Welcome back.

1382
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,749
- Well done. - Good job.

1383
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,189
Let's put their name tags here.

1384
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,948
We should...

1385
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,890
We'll keep our block as it is now for the rest of the missions.

1386
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,528
If anyone feels confident, go for it.

1387
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:45,788
- Yes. - Let's win all the missions now.

1388
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:50,600
(KHAN, Loopy, Nosun, XWALLY, ShyboiiTobii, Raf Sandou)

1389
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:52,029
Well done.

1390
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:53,868
Once it started, I had a lot on my mind.

1391
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:55,398
I didn't know which verse to use.

1392
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,199
(KHAN tries to let go of his disappointment.)

1393
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:03,539
(Loopy goes into the room alone.)

1394
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,250
I remembered how hard the eliminated rappers practiced.

1395
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,550
So I was really sad...

1396
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,590
because...

1397
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,219
out of the seven people who came to me in the beginning...

1398
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,688
(I'll pick yukon, number 60.)

1399
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,198
(Who's that? I don't know him.)

1400
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,800
(I'll pick Ga Yeon.)

1401
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,100
My gosh.

1402
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:25,898
(What an interesting choice.)

1403
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:28,769
(Loopy keeps surprising us with his choices.)

1404
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:33,109
My goal was to get to the finals with these rappers.

1405
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,379
But I failed.

1406
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,810
When I saw what our leader, KHAN, had to face,

1407
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:43,520
it sort of broke my heart. That's how I felt.

1408
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,060
(Block 7)

1409
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,560
Okay.

1410
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:57,669
I guess, I'm not trying to blame anyone.

1411
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,100
Chaboom did his thing.

1412
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:03,239
I was a bit confused.

1413
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,109
It didn't feel good to see Marv leave.

1414
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:09,779
Yes. It was really tough on me.

1415
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:13,479
Would you be the leader?

1416
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,550
And we can bring these two. You know?

1417
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,090
- Do you want to do that? - I don't know.

1418
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:25,629
I don't know why I lost.

1419
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,929
I lost the first two battles like a fool.

1420
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,130
I mean it. I was confident I could win all the battles.

1421
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:33,199
It's okay.

1422
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,239
I didn't make any mistakes.

1423
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,770
I was listening to the battles.

1424
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,380
I don't think it was about if you made mistakes or not.

1425
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,360
We shouldn't look for the reason you lost.

1426
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:54,050
(Chaboom, Owen, Double Down, Foggyatthebottom, Marv)

1427
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,288
There's nothing we can do.

1428
01:10:57,289 --> 01:11:02,600
(The members of the block leave while the leader remains alone.)

1429
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,990
It was our worst-case scenario for us.

1430
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:10,738
In the end, I became...

1431
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:12,970
a failed leader after one deathmatch.

1432
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,579
They didn't comfort me. It was lonely.

1433
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,279
But I was still able to stay strong mentally.

1434
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:24,919
"Was it the right decision to maintain this team?"

1435
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,060
In order to think about that, I spent some time alone.

1436
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:30,759
I didn't pick those rappers for the block.

1437
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,528
I didn't have any personal connections with them.

1438
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:35,099
On top of that, we didn't have any musical connections.

1439
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,158
It was really tough.

1440
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,559
I had no idea that...

1441
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,399
the sense of responsibility would drag me down like this.

1442
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,239
I'm going to move out.

1443
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:45,140
- What? - I'm going to move out.

1444
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:46,439
I'll change my block.

1445
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,309
- Where are you going? - I don't know.

1446
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,579
Given everything that's happened, I must win.

1447
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:52,879
I'll be honest with you.

1448
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,750
- Go on. - I have to win this.

1449
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,319
But if we all leave, this block will be gone.

1450
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,590
Where are you going?

1451
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,400
To be honest, Block Five is the only option...

1452
01:12:03,859 --> 01:12:04,889
we have.

1453
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,689
- For all of us to go? - Yes.

1454
01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:10,460
But shouldn't we talk to Chaboom at least?

1455
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:14,170
Yes. I think he will understand too.

1456
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,269
As I told you,

1457
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:19,350
having a lot of rappers on the team is an advantage.

1458
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:27,350
Let's talk to him then.

1459
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,449
If our intention is to win, then we can play around.

1460
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,289
We might split up our team...

1461
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,389
because at the end of the day, we need to survive.

1462
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,960
With four people, it's going to be a bit difficult.

1463
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:46,869
(Meanwhile, Block 8 is waiting for the members.)

1464
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,869
Well done.

1465
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,609
Come on.

1466
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:00,109
I mean...

1467
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,250
I...

1468
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,020
I didn't win any battle on my merit.

1469
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,689
I could have saved gamma too.

1470
01:13:13,659 --> 01:13:15,960
Personally, I thought you did a better job.

1471
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,130
I agree.

1472
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,199
Goodness.

1473
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,479
Why must other rappers leave when I'm the one who messed up?

1474
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:38,889
You know that it's not your fault that they had to leave.

1475
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,049
I know.

1476
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,089
But it's natural for your mind to go to that place right now.

1477
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,489
Even I would be beating myself up if I were you.

1478
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:51,300
I think that it's a miracle that you were able...

1479
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,170
to save Daniel from the deathmatch.

1480
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:59,710
Everyone got hurt because two of our rappers had to leave.

1481
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,238
I just didn't know what to do. I felt like...

1482
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,180
It was one of the worst mental breakdowns.

1483
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:12,489
(Hippie Kunda, Drain K, Daniel Jikal)

1484
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:15,960
- Daniel, I'll go out for a smoke. - You should unpack.

1485
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:21,960
Holy...

1486
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:27,800
I'm going to lose my mind. I'm actually going to lose my mind.

1487
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:37,680
There's no... I can't.

1488
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,778
Come on.

1489
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:43,648
(Daniel Jikal is left all alone in Block 8.)

1490
01:14:43,649 --> 01:14:45,289
My gosh.

1491
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,589
I cried a lot.

1492
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:52,060
I was getting really stressed. I had a mental breakdown.

1493
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,759
I just didn't know if I could even keep...

1494
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,529
going on the show.

1495
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,270
"The majority of the block must agree that..."

1496
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:08,840
- Daniel. - Hey. I'm back.

1497
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:11,039
- Are you okay? - Actually, you must want...

1498
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,648
to quit the show the most among us.

1499
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:14,408
- Right. - Goodness.

1500
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,179
- Shall we talk? - Yes, let's talk.

1501
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,288
For this conversation, we need to be a bit quiet.

1502
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:20,489
I've never seen him this serious.

1503
01:15:20,619 --> 01:15:23,390
- Gosh. I'm being serious. - Okay.

1504
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:27,430
- To be honest, - Yes.

1505
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,999
- this show is too hard on me. - It's too hard on you?

1506
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,969
- Yes. If... - I see.

1507
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,938
The block still had 4 or 5 rappers,

1508
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:41,979
we could attempt to do other missions then.

1509
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,810
I'll be honest. I'm done here.

1510
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,648
So if you guys don't mind...

1511
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:49,119
You guys know about this rule, right?

1512
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,618
Right. If the majority agrees,

1513
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:52,519
- We can do a vote. - you can drop out of the show.

1514
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,149
So...

1515
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:55,960
I'll drop out.

1516
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,089
You guys can join another block.

1517
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,859
I think that's the best plan.

1518
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,999
To be honest, I didn't see that coming.

1519
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,669
Daniel came back alone after seeing the other rappers...

1520
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,140
from Block Eight getting eliminated one after another.

1521
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:16,409
That must've destroyed him mentally.

1522
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:19,948
But you came back like a miracle.

1523
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:22,350
- Yes. - Here's our plan.

1524
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:27,589
We can join other blocks if there's space for us.

1525
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:31,159
So naturally, we could work together again in a different block.

1526
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,528
- That's a possibility. - Block Eight would be gone.

1527
01:16:33,529 --> 01:16:35,999
But there are a lot of openings in other blocks.

1528
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,199
The three of us can join a block together.

1529
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:43,770
(Block 8 is in a crisis. What will be the result?)

1530
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,569
Oh, my.

1531
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,340
- Gosh. - This looks good.

1532
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,278
(A party for the winning blocks, Blocks 1 and 5)

1533
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,810
- I can't believe this. - It's my favorite, Jack Daniel's.

1534
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:57,119
(Enjoying their victory with Jack Daniel's)

1535
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,719
Good job.

1536
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,788
- Good job. - Well done.

1537
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:01,789
(Blocks 1 and 5 celebrate together.)

1538
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,920
- Well done. - Great job.

1539
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:06,659
All right. Who wants some Jack Daniel's on the rocks?

1540
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,629
- Me. I can't wait. - Okay. Here.

1541
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:10,328
On the rocks for Khundi Panda.

1542
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:13,068
- Thank you. - Khundi Panda, the rap monster.

1543
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:14,629
- On the rocks. - You're too kind.

1544
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,669
Jack Daniel's with Coke is a famous cocktail.

1545
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,670
Right.

1546
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:20,368
I mean, everyone knows it.

1547
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,078
People might not know who I am, but they know the cocktail.

1548
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:25,148
- Right. - That's so true.

1549
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:27,978
- I love this drink. - Gosh. Right.

1550
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:29,619
Drink all you want today.

1551
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:32,649
Thank you, Jack Daniel's.

1552
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:33,948
I like Jack Daniel's on the rocks...

1553
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,688
- because it has a smoky... - What? Okay.

1554
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,589
- and sweet flavor. - Right.

1555
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:39,429
To be honest, everyone likes this drink.

1556
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,158
- Right. - Yes. No one can hate this drink.

1557
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:42,629
- Right. Everyone likes it. - Yes.

1558
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:45,269
As for the apple cranberry flavor, it's refreshing.

1559
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,169
It also has that fresh note of apples.

1560
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,038
- Really? - Like green apples.

1561
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,639
- Green apples? - So...

1562
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Green is his color too.

1563
01:17:51,641 --> 01:17:53,509
- I ought to drink this one. - Right.

1564
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,238
The cocktail is very refreshing.

1565
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,608
- It goes down so smoothly. - Can I try a sip?

1566
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:00,249
- Of course. - Try it.

1567
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,450
- I should try it too. - I'm envious of your ice cubes.

1568
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:04,278
- Well done. - Great job.

1569
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,989
- Good job today. - Good work.

1570
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:07,648
With our hard work, we made it this far.

1571
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,089
Let's go all the way.

1572
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,158
Let's hear it from the oldest guy here.

1573
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,858
- Let's hear it from him. - Do a toast.

1574
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:14,759
We only live once.

1575
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,059
Let's show who we are on this show.

1576
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,068
Let's enjoy every moment. Let's go!

1577
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,839
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1578
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,640
- With Jack Daniel's. - With Jack Daniel's.

1579
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:26,608
Darn it. This is...

1580
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:28,009
(Some of the blocks had to say goodbye to their members.)

1581
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,510
This is so cruel.

1582
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,220
There's nothing we can do.

1583
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,079
There's nothing we can do.

1584
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:37,779
This was the toughest deathmatch.

1585
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,390
I'm so lonely.

1586
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:44,829
I really need to have a drink today. Darn it.

1587
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:47,858
PUNCHNELLO. Check your bed. There's a bottle of Jack Daniel's.

1588
01:18:47,859 --> 01:18:50,130
- That's for you. - Jack Daniel's is for you.

1589
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:52,770
Gosh, this is so tough.

1590
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:57,670
Can I get a glass of Jack Daniel's?

1591
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,469
- Sure. Okay. - We can give you two.

1592
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,169
- Should I pour you one? - Yes. Thank you.

1593
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,250
I'll pour one for everyone.

1594
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,778
I'm JEFFERY WHITE.

1595
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:05,948
I know you.

1596
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,278
- I like OKASHII. - Gosh.

1597
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:08,849
Thank you so much.

1598
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,778
- You don't have to thank me. - I like real rap.

1599
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,988
- I'm being honest. I like it. - What?

1600
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:15,419
By the way, how do you want me to address you?

1601
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,818
I want to give you a special nickname.

1602
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,359
How special do you want it to be?

1603
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:21,359
Ultra-amazing, legit rapper queen.

1604
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,699
- Ga Yeon. - Ga Yeon.

1605
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:26,000
I'm really sorry, Ga Yeon.

1606
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:27,669
Don't be.

1607
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,170
Ga Yeon!

1608
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,639
Win first place for me.

1609
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,309
We'll win first place for you.

1610
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,790
- Go and get some sleep. - Thank you.

1611
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:38,550
I realized that we had bonded a lot and become close friends.

1612
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,909
I met new rappers...

1613
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,850
and learned a lot from them.

1614
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,318
It was a short period of time,

1615
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:45,649
but we became so close.

1616
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:47,919
I think we were completely sincere to each other.

1617
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,919
- Why did you join the show? - Yes?

1618
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,228
I really wanted to put on a killer performance here.

1619
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:54,510
I wanted people to think that Korean rappers were cool...

1620
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,729
after watching my performance.

1621
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,029
There are...

1622
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,068
a lot of things I want to do as a rapper once the show ends.

1623
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,199
All of a sudden,

1624
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:06,270
I want to go all the way as a rapper.

1625
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:08,239
- Do you like it? - Yes.

1626
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:10,710
Then should I send it to you later?

1627
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,148
I'll go to your studio.

1628
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:13,210
Really?

1629
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,750
I loved it.

1630
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:18,850
I was able to listen to the perspectives of younger rappers.

1631
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:21,250
And I got to learn about their attitude toward music.

1632
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,960
I could see all these things while interacting with them.

1633
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,620
So it was a new experience for me.

1634
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:27,488
Everyone is so kind.

1635
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,500
They're all passionate about music.

1636
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,828
Their approach to music is pure.

1637
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:33,898
They know how to have fun. And they're open-minded.

1638
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:35,969
The show was full of rappers who knew how to enjoy music.

1639
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,600
I thought, "Gosh, this is great."

1640
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,170
There you go.

1641
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:41,238
(Block 7)

1642
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:42,880
- Hey. - You didn't meet him?

1643
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:44,639
When did you stay there?

1644
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,079
- Let me see. - Okay.

1645
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,319
- I think you drank a lot. - Owen.

1646
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,118
- Why are you drinking so much? - I'm good.

1647
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:52,288
Your neck is red.

1648
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:53,389
- Well, - Hey.

1649
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,819
- Marv got eliminated. - You'll see me after this, right?

1650
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,429
Of course. Gosh, no. I don't have anything against you.

1651
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:59,488
- It's nothing like that. - Nothing like that.

1652
01:20:59,489 --> 01:21:01,599
So when...

1653
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,800
Marv was up for the elimination, whom did you vote for?

1654
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,069
I think...

1655
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,569
I wouldn't put it past you.

1656
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,599
- I feel uncomfortable too. - What?

1657
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,015
For some reason, I feel uncomfortable.

1658
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,109
Owen...

1659
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:15,710
started to get angry.

1660
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,779
The consequence of the deathmatch...

1661
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,648
was Marv getting eliminated. So for Owen,

1662
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:22,649
it was like losing a part of himself.

1663
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:26,619
Marv was one of my guys.

1664
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:28,760
I really wanted Marv to come back.

1665
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:31,659
You know what? I...

1666
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:34,829
I don't like it when I can't get along with my friends.

1667
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,329
What's up, Owen?

1668
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,868
- Hello. - My gosh, Owen.

1669
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:40,300
I think you drank a lot.

1670
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,470
Hey, go easy on the drinks.

1671
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,438
- Okay. - Hey, are you good?

1672
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:47,970
- What's going on? - I heard you were pretty sensitive.

1673
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,478
- Yes. - After that happened...

1674
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:51,439
I think I can crush it.

1675
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:54,310
That's how I feel.

1676
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,119
- No. - It's still there?

1677
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,449
Yes.

1678
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,329
I came to talk to you, Loopy.

1679
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,028
Should we give you some privacy?

1680
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:08,528
No. We're good.

1681
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:09,809
Have a drink and laugh about it.

1682
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,499
Have a drink and laugh about it.

1683
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,169
- I'm always smiling. - Yes?

1684
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,170
Let's go.

1685
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,170
I just...

1686
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,108
I know why you're upset.

1687
01:22:23,109 --> 01:22:24,140
Yes, you do.

1688
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,710
To produce Marv's album,

1689
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:29,979
I took out a 10,000-dollar loan from the bank.

1690
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:33,789
So I'm so upset that he's gone.

1691
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,988
Owen became his brother.

1692
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:41,776
He now has a little brother he's got to help grow.

1693
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,759
So the two of them joined the show.

1694
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,770
But he couldn't protect his brother.

1695
01:22:45,829 --> 01:22:49,239
So his brother, Marv, got eliminated first.

1696
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:51,738
I already wired you the money. So take a cab.

1697
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:52,739
(Owen talks to Marv who left the show first.)

1698
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,986
Take the cab. Darn it. Why are you waiting for the first bus?

1699
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,380
It's 2am now. Why would you wait for the first bus?

1700
01:22:58,510 --> 01:22:59,550
I wired you the money.

1701
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:03,180
If I can't wire you the cab fare, I wouldn't be able to face you.

1702
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:06,059
Think of it as saving my face. So just take a cab and go home.

1703
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,460
As the leader of my group, ECLIPSE EMPIRE,

1704
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:11,488
I went through a lot because it was my first time.

1705
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:14,189
I had never been a leader or managed a team before.

1706
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:15,529
Are you listening to me?

1707
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,175
I'm listening to everything you're saying.

1708
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,829
I have high expectations of you.

1709
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:20,850
I'm saying this, so you make a good impression.

1710
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:22,738
I felt so awful.

1711
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:24,915
I could understand how tough it must've been for Loopy.

1712
01:23:24,939 --> 01:23:26,069
He was my crew leader.

1713
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,609
So I spent some time talking to him.

1714
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:34,609
Do you want some water?

1715
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,859
I'm sorry.

1716
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,500
Why are you apologizing to me?

1717
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,970
I know. You don't have to say it.

1718
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:02,310
You know...

1719
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,310
that's how it had been for you and me.

1720
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:12,350
I should be the one apologizing.

1721
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,789
Stop crying.

1722
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,090
You've got your brothers now.

1723
01:24:21,659 --> 01:24:23,429
Marv went home today.

1724
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,528
That can make you sad today.

1725
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:27,970
But that's also why you must get yourself together too.

1726
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:29,270
Do you get that?

1727
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,109
I'm sorry.

1728
01:24:34,939 --> 01:24:36,079
It's okay.

1729
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,479
Get yourself together.

1730
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,020
We met after two years. And I'm asking you.

1731
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:47,989
No more drinks.

1732
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:50,760
Don't do anything you'll regret.

1733
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:51,789
Okay.

1734
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,728
I kept thinking about our days together when we were in MKIT RAIN.

1735
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:57,199
I tried to lead my junior rappers in the past.

1736
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,728
But I had to say goodbye to them.

1737
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,868
And I know that life hasn't been good to them afterward.

1738
01:25:03,869 --> 01:25:06,939
They're having a tough time, and they're struggling too.

1739
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,710
Didn't you have a bed like this?

1740
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,649
When I was in MKIT RAIN?

1741
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,250
Right. The bunk beds remind me of those days.

1742
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,920
I always tell them we should reunite.

1743
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:26,229
I miss...

1744
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:35,970
Me too. I'll try to find them.

1745
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,409
You take care of your brothers.

1746
01:25:42,779 --> 01:25:45,310
If you stay like that, blood won't circulate.

1747
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,810
Stop crying.

1748
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:02,100
That day, at that moment,

1749
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:06,430
I didn't feel as if I was on a TV show.

1750
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:10,800
It was a moment of reunion between Owen and me.

1751
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:13,109
In this confused state,

1752
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:16,439
he was trying his best to hang in there.

1753
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,979
(Heart-to-heart conversations were exchanged overnight.)

1754
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:23,020
(A new day begins on RAP: PUBLIC.)

1755
01:26:23,649 --> 01:26:25,989
(JTONG begins his morning with an exercise as usual.)

1756
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,789
JTONG.

1757
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,720
- Did you wash up? - Yes.

1758
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:34,870
That stretches the iliopsoas muscles.

1759
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,359
- Right. - Right? It's for iliopsoas muscles.

1760
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,270
When I wake up in the morning...

1761
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:44,170
How should I say it? My body feels really stiff.

1762
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,738
- Sometimes, it's the weather. - Right.

1763
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:48,470
(Quiet)

1764
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:51,479
(The traces of yesterday's party are seen everywhere.)

1765
01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:55,649
(The rappers are still sleeping after a tough night.)

1766
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,649
Hey, young people.

1767
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:00,988
Let's eat. We must eat to survive.

1768
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:01,989
Kyle.

1769
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:04,319
Yun Ha.

1770
01:27:04,489 --> 01:27:05,858
Oh, no. We're doomed.

1771
01:27:05,859 --> 01:27:07,379
- Yun Ha will never wake up. - Yun Ha.

1772
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:19,640
(Trying to wake up with some water)

1773
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,239
Gosh, I can't seem to wake up.

1774
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:27,949
And...

1775
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:32,489
Oh, shoot. Hold on.

1776
01:27:32,619 --> 01:27:35,119
I have an announcement.

1777
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:38,189
A while ago, a rapper...

1778
01:27:38,789 --> 01:27:41,359
withdrew from the show...

1779
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,728
since the majority of the block supported his decision,

1780
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:46,099
which is allowed under the rules of this society.

1781
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,130
What? Who?

1782
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,340
A rapper withdrew from the show.

1783
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:52,609
Who?

1784
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:57,909
Therefore, I announce that...

1785
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:01,680
Block 8 now has 2 rappers, not 3.

1786
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,220
If there's a block you want, you can also join the block...

1787
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,788
with the condition that we would join them too.

1788
01:28:10,789 --> 01:28:12,589
The three of us can play that card.

1789
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,689
I see.

1790
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:15,560
But...

1791
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,399
Is this too much for you?

1792
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:24,399
(This morning at Block 8)

1793
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:29,079
(Daniel Jikal reads the rule book again after waking up.)

1794
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:39,149
After I woke up, I was thinking about...

1795
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:42,090
I just didn't know what to do.

1796
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:44,159
It would be really hard for me...

1797
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,929
to go to a different block and try to fit in with their vibe.

1798
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:49,959
I didn't want to give the burden...

1799
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,470
to Hippie Kunda or Drain K.

1800
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,640
This TV show isn't for me.

1801
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:01,510
So I'm thinking of dropping out.

1802
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:06,379
So you won't change your mind now.

1803
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,660
Because this is too much on you,

1804
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:11,380
- you can't continue. Right? - Yes. That's how I feel.

1805
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,989
I really didn't want him to leave.

1806
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,260
But he was pretty firm...

1807
01:29:24,329 --> 01:29:26,228
when explaining why he wanted to leave.

1808
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:27,930
So he convinced us too.

1809
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:31,868
(Block 8 headed to the Choice Block for Daniel Jikal's withdrawal.)

1810
01:29:31,869 --> 01:29:34,640
I'm here to withdraw from the show.

1811
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:37,779
I support his decision.

1812
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,409
I support his decision.

1813
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:46,020
(Daniel Jikal)

1814
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,460
(Hippie Kunda, Drain K)

1815
01:29:49,789 --> 01:29:51,819
- Good job. - Good job.

1816
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,229
Go all the way to the finals. Good luck.

1817
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:56,560
- You too. - Of course.

1818
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,029
- 99' Nasty Kidz. Seriously. - If we can...

1819
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:02,239
Let's hang out after the show.

1820
01:30:02,369 --> 01:30:03,739
- Sounds good. - For sure.

1821
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,438
- Definitely. - Keep in touch.

1822
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:06,510
Yes.

1823
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,038
Bye.

1824
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:10,340
- I'll walk you to the door. - Okay.

1825
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:13,679
Bye. Good luck.

1826
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,749
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1827
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:15,750
Good luck.

1828
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,260
It's announced right away.

1829
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:25,288
I want to tell him he's great at rapping.

1830
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:26,659
You're the best.

1831
01:30:28,229 --> 01:30:29,629
(Block 8)

1832
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:32,169
(Hippie Kunda, Drain K)

1833
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:35,469
Did Daniel Jikal move blocks?

1834
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,470
No. He resigned. He quit.

1835
01:30:38,869 --> 01:30:39,869
He quit.

1836
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:42,140
He really did it.

1837
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:45,079
What's Block Eight going to do now?

1838
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,880
What will they do?

1839
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,148
- He must've left. He quit. - Right.

1840
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:52,289
Daniel Jikal must've resigned.

1841
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,850
- I'm getting goosebumps. - Goodness.

1842
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:58,089
Looking at how things are progressing,

1843
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:00,629
rappers are recruiting other rappers.

1844
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:04,229
The change in blocks is happening a lot faster than expected.

1845
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:07,270
It starts now.

1846
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,569
We should go around recruiting rappers.

1847
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:12,970
It's the beginning of a war now.

1848
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:21,310
Other than him, I don't want to recruit anyone.

1849
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,519
- No matter who it is. - Okay.

1850
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,118
I think it's best to stick with who we have.

1851
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:29,789
- Close our block? - Yes.

1852
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:33,858
I can't help but think we need a solid strategy.

1853
01:31:33,859 --> 01:31:36,959
We thought of rappers with experience.

1854
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,829
Chaboom...

1855
01:31:39,699 --> 01:31:40,699
Do you want him?

1856
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,438
He and I were on the same wavelength.

1857
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:44,868
From your point of view, where do you think...

1858
01:31:44,869 --> 01:31:46,608
Chaboom would want to go?

1859
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:48,538
I think he'll want to go to Block Six.

1860
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:49,709
He wants to come to our block.

1861
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,408
- Really? - I'm 100 percent certain.

1862
01:31:51,409 --> 01:31:53,209
But isn't he close with Block Six?

1863
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:54,749
He clearly said,

1864
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,579
- "I want to rap with HAON." - For real?

1865
01:31:56,819 --> 01:32:00,688
I had five rappers in mind,

1866
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:01,849
and one of them was you, HAON.

1867
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,759
I instantly had the feeling...

1868
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,090
of wanting to rap with HAON upon coming here.

1869
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,399
- Got it, Chaboom. - I'm not just being nice.

1870
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,129
Can you use him as a bullet bait?

1871
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:13,329
Using him...

1872
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:16,369
wasn't what I had in mind.

1873
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:19,609
I'm not the leader, am I? Or hand me the necklace.

1874
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,839
He left a good impression on me.

1875
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,209
We can use him in our strategy.

1876
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:25,538
Our block doesn't have a guy like him.

1877
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:27,750
- Right? - He's a guy we don't have.

1878
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,419
HAON asked...

1879
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,949
what I thought of recruiting Chaboom.

1880
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:35,219
Chaboom has a great personality and is smart,

1881
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,859
so I was in.

1882
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:40,228
HAON really likes you.

1883
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:42,028
He wanted me to tell you...

1884
01:32:42,029 --> 01:32:45,398
that he's a big fan of yours...

1885
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,269
and that you wanted to be in the same block.

1886
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,799
Putting everything aside,

1887
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,068
being responsible is my top priority in life.

1888
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:53,509
Being responsible for that situation.

1889
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,769
I'm still the leader.

1890
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,978
After an hour, I can make a decision for myself.

1891
01:32:57,979 --> 01:32:59,908
I'll think about it seriously when that time comes.

1892
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:02,478
Before that, I need to sort out my block first.

1893
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:04,278
The next important thing is...

1894
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:06,648
whether I can move with my Block Money or not.

1895
01:33:06,649 --> 01:33:09,989
We don't care if you don't bring the Block Money.

1896
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,260
Really.

1897
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:14,288
I'll give it some serious thought. Thank you.

1898
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:16,028
Thank you.

1899
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:17,799
Let's work together, all right?

1900
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,129
Come on, Chaboom.

1901
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:24,169
Until I take off the leader sticker, I'm the leader.

1902
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:26,169
I should fulfill my duty as the leader until the end.

1903
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:29,009
I personally think that...

1904
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:31,608
our block mates should split up...

1905
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:33,649
into other blocks.

1906
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,150
What do you think, Foggyatthebottom?

1907
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:38,019
I'm on the same page as you.

1908
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,318
From now on, move for your own sake...

1909
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:42,220
- and not for the block. - Okay.

1910
01:33:42,489 --> 01:33:44,959
Take some time to check if there's a block...

1911
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,559
you want to join...

1912
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,028
and talk to them.

1913
01:33:48,029 --> 01:33:52,260
I wanted to go to a block with my crew member.

1914
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:53,728
Double Down.

1915
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:55,469
What are you thinking right now?

1916
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:57,669
This block has a good feeling. Do you know what I mean?

1917
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:00,568
You don't have any dead weight. Do you know what I mean?

1918
01:34:00,569 --> 01:34:01,769
Everybody's great.

1919
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:02,840
What's your plan?

1920
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:05,108
You're the only block that wants me.

1921
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:06,908
How about we switch right now?

1922
01:34:06,909 --> 01:34:08,709
Let's replace the leader right now.

1923
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,519
Let's switch leaders before Owen joins.

1924
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,760
- I'll take care of things. - You should get some sleep.

1925
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,050
We need to do it now. We're short on time.

1926
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,919
JP wasn't doing well...

1927
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,028
and couldn't move quickly.

1928
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:22,500
Our idea was to switch leaders fast...

1929
01:34:22,659 --> 01:34:25,300
so I could walk around recruiting rappers.

1930
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:28,269
- What is it? - Did someone move blocks?

1931
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:31,568
Block Five's leader was replaced from JP...

1932
01:34:31,569 --> 01:34:34,739
- Khundi Panda? - to Khundi Panda.

1933
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,680
- Well, I... - Did you talk to them?

1934
01:34:37,609 --> 01:34:38,609
Can I recruit you?

1935
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:40,350
- Let's go. - Okay.

1936
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:42,310
- I'll see you. - Okay.

1937
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:51,220
I will move to Block Five.

1938
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,959
Block Five.

1939
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,028
(Rappers Owen and Double Down of Block 7 were recruited to Block 5.)

1940
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:58,129
The number five...

1941
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,698
was my football number.

1942
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:03,269
It could happen. Gosh, don't tell me...

1943
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:07,109
Rapper Double Down was recruited to Block Five.

1944
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:11,778
- Welcome. - Rapper Owen...

1945
01:35:11,779 --> 01:35:14,079
- was recruited to Block Five. - What?

1946
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,420
- What? - Let's go.

1947
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,978
(Block 7, Block 5)

1948
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:22,319
(From Block 7 to Block 5)

1949
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,288
Is there anyone you think doesn't look good together?

1950
01:35:26,289 --> 01:35:27,589
- No. - No, this is perfect.

1951
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:29,528
Honestly, this combination is the best.

1952
01:35:29,529 --> 01:35:30,559
Put your faith in me.

1953
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,469
It was the most brilliant idea,

1954
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:35,300
telling you I wanted to recruit this rapper yesterday.

1955
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:36,639
Look.

1956
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,868
With that rapper, our vibe will change completely.

1957
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:40,139
It's a golden opportunity.

1958
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:43,409
If I can recruit JTONG of all rappers to our block...

1959
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:47,380
(JTONG showed off his crazy presence in all matches.)

1960
01:35:48,649 --> 01:35:50,449
The most memorable performance? JTONG's.

1961
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:52,379
JTONG is seriously cool.

1962
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,219
He earns brownie points simply by just standing there.

1963
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:57,020
It was like the appearance of the final boss.

1964
01:35:57,159 --> 01:35:58,959
Can't we recruit JTONG?

1965
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,488
- Seriously? - I'm just throwing in names.

1966
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:04,599
That block is strongly attached to JTONG in the center.

1967
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,729
It's the block that will falter the least.

1968
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:09,169
I don't think anyone is thinking about recruiting...

1969
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:10,969
a rapper from our block.

1970
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:13,169
- They think our block is solid. - Yes. Because of that,

1971
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:15,050
nobody dares to think about recruiting someone.

1972
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,009
That block is very solid.

1973
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,938
There won't be rappers changing blocks.

1974
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,408
I never even thought about recruiting JTONG.

1975
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:23,720
JTONG seemed like he'd stick with his block.

1976
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:25,819
But suddenly, JTONG...

1977
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:28,289
It's an emergency. A real emergency.

1978
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,619
What is it?

1979
01:36:30,689 --> 01:36:32,488
On my way back from taking a shower,

1980
01:36:32,489 --> 01:36:35,259
JTONG came up to me, and we talked for a bit.

1981
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:37,698
JTONG suddenly told me...

1982
01:36:37,699 --> 01:36:40,028
he was interested in changing blocks.

1983
01:36:40,029 --> 01:36:41,799
I saw the potential.

1984
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,770
I find JTONG to be very cool.

1985
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,139
I had everyone's consent.

1986
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:47,509
With the thought of...

1987
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,809
persuading JTONG to come to our block,

1988
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:52,439
I spent the day waiting for him.

1989
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:54,850
I'll persuade JTONG no matter what.

1990
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:57,149
JTONG.

1991
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,720
May I talk to you for a minute?

1992
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,229
Our block wants a combination of old and new.

1993
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:09,658
"A combination of old and new?"

1994
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:13,568
With rappers with long-lasting fans like you and Loopy.

1995
01:37:13,569 --> 01:37:16,738
Rather than distancing ourselves from each other, we should work...

1996
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:18,099
together on a performance,

1997
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:20,170
hence asking you to join our block.

1998
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:24,939
Everyone wants you to join us.

1999
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,850
Things got...

2000
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,250
complicated in my head.

2001
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:39,788
Whichever block I went to, they were preparing for the presentation.

2002
01:37:39,789 --> 01:37:42,560
Are we...

2003
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,630
settled?

2004
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,270
- We're settled. - Yes.

2005
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:47,500
What is?

2006
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,068
Our members are fixed, right? We're fixed members.

2007
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:52,569
- We're FM. - FM? Frequency Modulation?

2008
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:54,869
I kind of want to...

2009
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:01,850
As I had in mind,

2010
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:04,649
I wanted to go through various environments,

2011
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,890
situations, and experiences.

2012
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,029
I wish to experience diversity.

2013
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:21,769
I want to keep my door open...

2014
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:25,899
and think about things. I've always wanted to tell you all.

2015
01:38:26,569 --> 01:38:28,809
But actually putting it into words wasn't easy.

2016
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:29,810
It's not.

2017
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:33,050
In short...

2018
01:38:34,779 --> 01:38:36,719
I'm thinking of changing blocks.

2019
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,050
- I see. - For real?

2020
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,149
To which block?

2021
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:44,090
But, you see...

2022
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:51,399
Everyone was shocked.

2023
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:53,970
Yes, we were.

2024
01:38:57,770 --> 01:39:00,538
This might be me trying to persuade JTONG,

2025
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:03,939
but Block One is the best block in rapping.

2026
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:06,810
We proved our skills and teamwork...

2027
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:08,778
in our last mission.

2028
01:39:08,779 --> 01:39:13,149
I think all eight of us have similar styles.

2029
01:39:15,619 --> 01:39:16,939
Do you want to become the leader?

2030
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,059
Stop him from going anywhere.

2031
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,788
- Stop him from running away. - Keep him here.

2032
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:22,858
Become the leader, JTONG.

2033
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:24,728
- The majority agrees. - The majority does.

2034
01:39:24,729 --> 01:39:25,800
Do it.

2035
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:28,600
JTONG leading the group isn't bad either.

2036
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:31,169
Anyway, I haven't decided whether I want to move.

2037
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:33,238
- We're also trying to persuade you. - We're persuading you.

2038
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:36,039
Our block may face difficulties if you leave.

2039
01:39:36,579 --> 01:39:39,408
I felt bad. Really bad, at that.

2040
01:39:39,409 --> 01:39:41,310
Block One has one more thing...

2041
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:43,750
to worry about now.

2042
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:47,489
From what I see, JTONG has been in this block since the beginning.

2043
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:51,859
I felt a sense of stability...

2044
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,960
in the situation I was in.

2045
01:39:56,829 --> 01:39:59,869
Go around meeting other rappers.

2046
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:02,938
It might turn out that you don't want to change blocks.

2047
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:05,198
Talking to other rappers might make you realize you fit here.

2048
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,439
Here's something for certain. We all came because of you.

2049
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:10,579
- Yes, that's... - We wanted to rap with you.

2050
01:40:10,909 --> 01:40:12,309
Aren't you putting...

2051
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:14,009
pressure on him now?

2052
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:16,179
- Don't answer us right away. - We must appeal to him.

2053
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,078
- Yes. - JTONG is an important member.

2054
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:19,318
He's right.

2055
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:22,420
If you want to go somewhere, I'll pick and drop you off.

2056
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:25,188
What's with "I'll pick and drop you off?"

2057
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:26,259
He's a package.

2058
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,890
- "Here's JTONG." - I'll take you to the block.

2059
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:31,299
- Okay. - Walk around.

2060
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:35,069
(Facing a dilemma, JTONG comes out to the square where the others are.)

2061
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,239
Now that I'm out here...

2062
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,408
Look at all of them.

2063
01:40:42,409 --> 01:40:44,979
I'm realizing that I'm with people I'm close with.

2064
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,279
- That's for sure. - It feels new.

2065
01:40:49,949 --> 01:40:51,279
This is my outfit.

2066
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:52,619
It's nothing.

2067
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,890
Why don't you two talk casually?

2068
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,989
- All right. Let's be friends. - Okay.

2069
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,060
Are you okay?

2070
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,360
We heard you wanted to move blocks.

2071
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,000
- I'm thinking about it a lot. - I'd appreciate it...

2072
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:09,939
if you could add our block into your list.

2073
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,500
Block One looks...

2074
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:15,739
really solid. How is it internally?

2075
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:21,039
(Block 1 is concerned about the other blocks approaching JTONG.)

2076
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:22,449
I didn't know.

2077
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,220
All I thought was, "What should we do?"

2078
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:29,488
JTONG. Is it not settled yet?

2079
01:41:29,489 --> 01:41:30,619
No, it's not.

2080
01:41:31,619 --> 01:41:32,789
Have you decided?

2081
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,659
Something like, "Aren't we firm?"

2082
01:41:36,899 --> 01:41:38,500
ZENE THE COLA.

2083
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,368
We came out here to socialize. But in the end...

2084
01:41:41,369 --> 01:41:43,539
You're right. I was watching over there...

2085
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:46,210
and came over wondering why we've gathered again.

2086
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:47,868
What's this? Is it a group chat?

2087
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:49,680
I had mixed feelings.

2088
01:41:49,939 --> 01:41:51,439
I became friends with the guys.

2089
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:53,850
The peaceful atmosphere...

2090
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:55,680
wasn't bad at all.

2091
01:41:56,619 --> 01:41:58,919
If I go to a new block,

2092
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,448
there will be more to think about.

2093
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:02,688
With that, I wasn't sure.

2094
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:04,859
(What did JTONG decide to do?)

2095
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,390
I was prepared to recruit rappers.

2096
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:08,859
The air was like, "Okay."

2097
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,430
"We need to recruit and win."

2098
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:16,299
(Block 1 has become mightier after recruiting Polodared and Tray B.)

2099
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,270
(They won Block Tournament's B League.)

2100
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,738
After watching Block One's performance,

2101
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:22,938
there were opinions that it was only right to recruit...

2102
01:42:22,939 --> 01:42:24,439
one more rapper.

2103
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:25,978
With how the game is proceeding,

2104
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:27,679
only by recruiting people...

2105
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:29,649
can the block be reinforced.

2106
01:42:29,979 --> 01:42:33,090
Where will the various rappers go now?

2107
01:42:34,689 --> 01:42:35,749
(Block 4)

2108
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:39,060
Who should we try to recruit?

2109
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:40,759
- I think... - These blocks.

2110
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:43,430
We can try all blocks aside from...

2111
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:45,659
- Block 1 and Block 3. - Same here.

2112
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:48,069
What about Mckdaddy?

2113
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:49,670
I'm in.

2114
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,369
I don't mind Kaogaii if our leader is replaced.

2115
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,709
Me too. Kaogaii is my first choice.

2116
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,710
He's the best option.

2117
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,579
I always thought we needed...

2118
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:03,679
a fierce rapper in our block...

2119
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,920
to get to the finals.

2120
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,649
So I paid Kaogaii a visit.

2121
01:43:10,119 --> 01:43:12,260
- Welcome. - Hey. What are you doing?

2122
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:14,409
What is it? Do you want to talk about something?

2123
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,720
I've got a lot to talk about.

2124
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:21,329
(Kaogaii and SINCE head to the lounge.)

2125
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:24,799
Do you have any plans to come to my block?

2126
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,568
- No. I doubt I'll go there. - No?

2127
01:43:26,569 --> 01:43:28,608
- Even if you become the leader? - It's still a no.

2128
01:43:28,609 --> 01:43:31,380
Because too much time has passed now.

2129
01:43:32,979 --> 01:43:36,318
Only when Kaogaii is in my block can we advance...

2130
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:38,118
closer to winning.

2131
01:43:38,119 --> 01:43:40,250
But Kaogaii had no intention of moving.

2132
01:43:41,489 --> 01:43:43,090
Here's what I'd like to ask you.

2133
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,988
(Kaogaii tried to recruit SINCE...)

2134
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:49,960
(on the first night of entering the Village.)

2135
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,198
You're proposing...

2136
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:54,728
I will not get eliminated if I go to your block.

2137
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:55,770
No.

2138
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,480
You can't come to my block, can you? Your heart is not letting you.

2139
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,310
- Your mentality won't let you. - But...

2140
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:06,609
I didn't think about moving up until yesterday.

2141
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:07,779
Is your mind changing now?

2142
01:44:09,449 --> 01:44:11,520
- Either way, we need to win. - Yes.

2143
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,989
SINCE is wavering.

2144
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:18,220
Give it a serious thought.

2145
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,688
I had hopes that SINCE might betray...

2146
01:44:22,689 --> 01:44:24,100
her block.

2147
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,829
With that, I waited.

2148
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:33,609
(SINCE is stuck at a crossroads after talking with Kaogaii.)

2149
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:36,380
This is tough.

2150
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,020
I just came back from talking to Kaogaii.

2151
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,648
But he doesn't want to move at all.

2152
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:50,619
If a member...

2153
01:44:50,819 --> 01:44:52,959
Kaogaii thinks is the main rapper...

2154
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,859
moves to another block,

2155
01:44:55,659 --> 01:44:57,999
his plan might not work.

2156
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,199
I told him that and asked again.

2157
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:01,990
But Kaogaii already had a backup plan.

2158
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:05,300
And he won't change blocks.

2159
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,309
He will stick with his block.

2160
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:09,786
- What about becoming the leader? - He'll stay as one in Block Six.

2161
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:10,939
I see.

2162
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:15,549
I really want Roh Yun Ha, but I doubt he'll come.

2163
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:16,979
- Yun Ha? - Yes.

2164
01:45:19,949 --> 01:45:21,090
I'm thinking of...

2165
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,159
ZENE THE ZILLA or Nosun.

2166
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,329
- As our first option? - Yes.

2167
01:45:29,829 --> 01:45:30,930
What do the others think?

2168
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:33,345
Let's think about our second option.

2169
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:34,369
"Second option?"

2170
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:36,470
ZENE THE ZILLA and Nosun are my first options.

2171
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,439
My second option is Chaboom.

2172
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:40,438
- Chaboom? - I'm with you.

2173
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:41,439
And Geegooin.

2174
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,609
- Geegooin? - Yes.

2175
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:50,050
I think Boi B's options are the best right now.

2176
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,020
Where's skyminhyuk?

2177
01:45:53,149 --> 01:45:55,118
Is he talking to JEFFERY WHITE?

2178
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,019
We can give it a shot.

2179
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,820
Are we recruiting JEFFERY WHITE to our block?

2180
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:01,289
Even if Block One is powerful,

2181
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:05,600
a member might feel relatively weak inside that block.

2182
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:07,399
It will cause them to feel anxious.

2183
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,800
If we guarantee the leader position to them,

2184
01:46:10,939 --> 01:46:12,369
they might be intrigued.

2185
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:14,309
Here's what I think.

2186
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:17,038
If they're unstable in that block,

2187
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:19,639
what merit would they bring...

2188
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,010
- That's true. - to our block?

2189
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:24,949
It's meaningless if the rapper isn't fierce.

2190
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,050
- Right. - To...

2191
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,689
survive and win,

2192
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:32,720
- we need someone good at rapping. - Right.

2193
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,729
We're not accepting just anyone.

2194
01:46:36,029 --> 01:46:37,500
We're recruiting to do better.

2195
01:46:38,829 --> 01:46:41,800
I asked Tray B.

2196
01:46:42,029 --> 01:46:43,029
What did he say?

2197
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,799
He has no interest in becoming the leader...

2198
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,510
and only wants to think of himself.

2199
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,009
"Okay, got it," is what I told him.

2200
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:51,310
- He's a clear and cool guy. - Right?

2201
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,148
He doesn't want to think about others.

2202
01:46:54,149 --> 01:46:56,649
My block members are nice and doing great.

2203
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:59,250
But surviving and winning is the main goal.

2204
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:02,648
I just came back from talking to SINCE.

2205
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:05,390
She kept making me an offer.

2206
01:47:06,289 --> 01:47:07,359
"Come."

2207
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:09,130
"You'll be the leader."

2208
01:47:09,859 --> 01:47:12,399
But I told her I wasn't interested.

2209
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:15,270
"You come."

2210
01:47:16,369 --> 01:47:17,569
"You can come instead, SINCE."

2211
01:47:17,899 --> 01:47:21,140
"You couldn't betray Block Four because of us. Just come."

2212
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:23,880
That was what I suggested.

2213
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,978
SINCE was firm about staying but is now contemplating it.

2214
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:27,979
Why?

2215
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:30,920
- Don't tell me... - She wants to win.

2216
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,350
But SINCE can't picture it with Block Four.

2217
01:47:35,289 --> 01:47:37,318
SINCE won't come. I'm certain.

2218
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:39,689
- No. - Is she wavering?

2219
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:41,858
Here's what I told her.

2220
01:47:41,859 --> 01:47:44,359
"Leave the Village as is, and you're stuck with your block."

2221
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,999
"Just be bold and move blocks."

2222
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,398
"That's how it's organized and why the rules exist."

2223
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:50,739
"Nobody will resent you."

2224
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,869
She understood what I said.

2225
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,169
I'm not against SINCE.

2226
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:57,539
- She's the best. - It'd be nice if she came.

2227
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,148
What's after?

2228
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:01,309
(Kaogaii goes over to SINCE.)

2229
01:48:01,409 --> 01:48:02,478
Can we talk after?

2230
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:03,550
Okay.

2231
01:48:06,819 --> 01:48:09,619
(At that moment, Geegooin calls over Kaogaii.)

2232
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:11,689
I'm talking to SINCE after she's done.

2233
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,100
Boi B will join after another Block Match.

2234
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:15,329
- For real? - Yes.

2235
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:18,060
How about you come to my block?

2236
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:22,269
You don't have to come right now. You can come the next time.

2237
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:24,169
Right. If my block survives.

2238
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:25,375
(The two promised for the next chance.)

2239
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:26,738
Should I tell SINCE...

2240
01:48:26,739 --> 01:48:29,879
that Boi B will join if she doesn't?

2241
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:30,880
Like coming between them.

2242
01:48:30,881 --> 01:48:33,108
Going that far...

2243
01:48:33,109 --> 01:48:34,408
will offend Boi B.

2244
01:48:34,409 --> 01:48:35,909
- Is that our problem? - So...

2245
01:48:37,079 --> 01:48:39,579
(SINCE visits Block 6 after her conversation ends.)

2246
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,520
- So... - SINCE is here. Hold on.

2247
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,760
It's tough, right?

2248
01:48:45,761 --> 01:48:47,288
My head hurts like crazy. My brain won't work.

2249
01:48:47,289 --> 01:48:48,289
My brain will soon be out of juice.

2250
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,460
You can leave voluntarily.

2251
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:51,800
- Let's be quick. - Okay.

2252
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,270
So?

2253
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:54,699
Are you not coming?

2254
01:48:56,939 --> 01:48:58,269
- Going to your block... - No?

2255
01:48:58,270 --> 01:48:59,369
I can't go to your block.

2256
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:03,510
- Can I say something? - Sure.

2257
01:49:03,979 --> 01:49:05,738
Don't tell a soul about this.

2258
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:06,810
Got it.

2259
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:10,180
- Boi B... - Yes?

2260
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:12,359
Is he going to your block?

2261
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:14,649
He promised to come.

2262
01:49:20,029 --> 01:49:21,659
Did Boi B agree to join your block?

2263
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,129
Did he say that to Geegooin?

2264
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:25,060
With him, you'll have eight members.

2265
01:49:25,729 --> 01:49:26,970
We haven't decided yet.

2266
01:49:27,569 --> 01:49:28,898
Whether to accept Boi B or not?

2267
01:49:28,899 --> 01:49:30,238
That's why I'm telling you this.

2268
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,369
If you're joining, we'll stop recruiting here.

2269
01:49:34,539 --> 01:49:36,439
His words were a blow to the head.

2270
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:39,179
I thought everyone would stay in their blocks until the end.

2271
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,425
But that wasn't the case for Boi B.

2272
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:42,649
I decided to give it another thought.

2273
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:47,649
You know the picture I had in mind at first, right?

2274
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,020
We'll last until the end, even if my block loses.

2275
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:56,170
- We're out of time. - Will I be guaranteed my survival?

2276
01:49:56,329 --> 01:49:57,499
- Absolutely. - Will I not be...

2277
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,698
an elimination candidate?

2278
01:49:58,699 --> 01:49:59,729
Never.

2279
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:06,340
Surviving and winning is the main goal.

2280
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:08,169
It crossed my mind that I should consider...

2281
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:09,569
moving to Block Six.

2282
01:50:10,739 --> 01:50:11,979
Who is in your block?

2283
01:50:12,579 --> 01:50:13,979
Gamma and Geegooin.

2284
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:15,979
Let's have a look.

2285
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:17,519
- Let me look at your block. - Here.

2286
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:23,119
If we win, fewer members will be eliminated.

2287
01:50:24,489 --> 01:50:26,319
- This is our strategy. One and two. - Okay.

2288
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,689
- Hold on. - Hi.

2289
01:50:29,859 --> 01:50:31,960
May we come inside, Kaogaii?

2290
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,869
No. Right now, we're...

2291
01:50:35,229 --> 01:50:36,670
We're currently...

2292
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:39,238
Can I take a candy?

2293
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:40,270
Go ahead.

2294
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:42,640
- Thank you. - Either way,

2295
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:45,140
they will get eliminated after the mission.

2296
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:47,810
This block will split apart and disappear.

2297
01:50:48,279 --> 01:50:50,079
SINCE might move to Block Six.

2298
01:50:52,279 --> 01:50:53,520
What if SINCE moves?

2299
01:50:55,449 --> 01:50:57,389
SINCE could possibly move.

2300
01:50:57,390 --> 01:51:00,159
She's getting persuaded. That was what I thought.

2301
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:13,869
I kept brainstorming by myself what I should do...

2302
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:15,869
if SINCE leaves.

2303
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,880
I was coming up with a plan.

2304
01:51:17,979 --> 01:51:20,510
(SINCE returns to Block 4 after talking to Kaogaii.)

2305
01:51:20,779 --> 01:51:21,909
Right now...

2306
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:26,180
This is how the blocks are.

2307
01:51:26,181 --> 01:51:27,749
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2308
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,850
But from here,

2309
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,589
this is what they want.

2310
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:32,590
- I see. - Right.

2311
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:33,890
- And... - And...

2312
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:37,329
JP is against this picture.

2313
01:51:37,529 --> 01:51:38,799
Is JP moving?

2314
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,028
It wasn't what JP had in mind.

2315
01:51:41,029 --> 01:51:42,029
Really?

2316
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:45,139
It sounded like things weren't working out with JP.

2317
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:47,169
That's the current situation.

2318
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,840
Is nobody moving from our block?

2319
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,579
To another block. Be honest.

2320
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:58,719
I'll be frank. I might move.

2321
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,789
- Really? - I'm contemplating.

2322
01:52:05,359 --> 01:52:06,618
- To Block Six. - Or...

2323
01:52:06,619 --> 01:52:07,760
- Block Six? - Yes.

2324
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:17,140
My mind was a complete mess.

2325
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:21,469
What has become of what we talked about...

2326
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:23,810
and felt yesterday as a block?

2327
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:25,180
Where did that go?

2328
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:30,880
Everyone was aware that SINCE was likely to leave.

2329
01:52:35,649 --> 01:52:36,720
I was very upset.

2330
01:52:37,689 --> 01:52:38,689
Oh, gosh.

2331
01:52:39,819 --> 01:52:42,760
If any of us go, our block will break up.

2332
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:54,039
Then everyone, I...

2333
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:00,880
Are you going?

2334
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:05,119
I'll choose to be trash.

2335
01:53:05,579 --> 01:53:06,719
- I'll be trash... - It's okay.

2336
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,818
- with a terrible personality. - It's okay.

2337
01:53:07,819 --> 01:53:10,858
- I'll be trash, everyone. - No. Where are you going?

2338
01:53:10,859 --> 01:53:12,459
- Stand up. - I'm so sorry.

2339
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:14,728
- It feels so... - I choose to be trash.

2340
01:53:14,729 --> 01:53:15,989
I'm trash.

2341
01:53:16,930 --> 01:53:19,559
- Just in a few hours. - I'm trash that can't be recycled.

2342
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,300
I'm trash.

2343
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,729
I'm trash.

2344
01:53:23,329 --> 01:53:24,439
I'm trash.

2345
01:53:25,369 --> 01:53:27,908
What have I done to these nice people?

2346
01:53:27,909 --> 01:53:30,709
I wanted to win by myself. And I've already stated my decision.

2347
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:32,379
"Yes. I'm trash." I acknowledged it.

2348
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,620
This is the right thing, right?

2349
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:35,648
No. What I'm saying is...

2350
01:53:35,649 --> 01:53:37,856
(SINCE is going to Block 6 after saying she'll join another block.)

2351
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,880
Are you coming?

2352
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:45,189
- Gosh. - What are you going to do?

2353
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,260
Did they go crazy?

2354
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,060
I declared that I'm trash before coming here.

2355
01:53:53,569 --> 01:53:54,969
- Did you say you'd join us? - Yes.

2356
01:53:55,029 --> 01:53:56,969
- Okay. - I made a bow to them.

2357
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:57,970
Okay. I got it for now.

2358
01:53:59,369 --> 01:54:01,310
"I got it?" Darn it.

2359
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:03,209
Stay seated.

2360
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:05,609
Bring a rope to tie her to the chair.

2361
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:07,879
- Are you coming? - Yes.

2362
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,209
- Are you going to join us? - Yes. I'll join you.

2363
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:10,819
- Okay. - Okay.

2364
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:12,180
- Okay. - I got it.

2365
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:18,189
You've come a long way.

2366
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,459
This is the right thing, isn't it?

2367
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:21,389
- Is this right? - It's absolutely right.

2368
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:24,398
Compared to our beginning,

2369
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:27,130
our energy or flow...

2370
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,368
is great right now.

2371
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:32,140
So she might've thought she'd win if she joined us.

2372
01:54:34,109 --> 01:54:35,368
(SINCE)

2373
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:36,868
(Block 4: SINCE)

2374
01:54:36,869 --> 01:54:40,349
(Block 6: SINCE)

2375
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:44,049
SINCE is an all-rounder. So she'll be a big help to our team...

2376
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:45,478
with a live performance.

2377
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:46,680
Welcome.

2378
01:54:47,489 --> 01:54:49,719
- Hello. - Welcome.

2379
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:52,060
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2380
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:55,060
I can't believe SINCE has joined us.

2381
01:54:55,689 --> 01:54:57,600
Gosh, but SINCE is so disloyal.

2382
01:54:58,859 --> 01:55:00,930
I'm trash. Yes.

2383
01:55:01,899 --> 01:55:05,198
Rapper SINCE was recruited to Block Six.

2384
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:06,199
What?

2385
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:07,969
What's going on?

2386
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:09,039
Really?

2387
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:11,879
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

2388
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:14,278
- Hey. - It's a lie.

2389
01:55:14,279 --> 01:55:16,109
She's so scary.

2390
01:55:16,279 --> 01:55:18,749
I'm scared of him.

2391
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:19,949
I'm scared of this guy.

2392
01:55:20,819 --> 01:55:22,550
What is going to happen to Block Four?

2393
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:26,459
(Block 4 is discussing after SINCE left.)

2394
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:29,390
- Shall we change our leader 1st? - Let's do that 1st.

2395
01:55:29,659 --> 01:55:31,328
After SINCE had left,

2396
01:55:31,329 --> 01:55:34,930
we had to recruit someone quickly.

2397
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:38,568
As the leader, I had to recruit...

2398
01:55:38,569 --> 01:55:40,510
members of other blocks quickly.

2399
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:42,810
I'd like to replace the leader.

2400
01:55:44,539 --> 01:55:46,339
(With everyone's agreement, )

2401
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:48,149
(PUNCHNELLO was replaced by skyminhyuk.)

2402
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:51,979
We wanted to fill all eight slots.

2403
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:55,550
But we didn't have the mental capacity to recruit them 1 by 1.

2404
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:59,288
And I saw two people, who I know are great performers,

2405
01:55:59,289 --> 01:56:01,959
were walking around the lounge.

2406
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:04,559
There's a rule that if only the leader remains in the block,

2407
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,528
the block will be closed down. The leader will lose all authority,

2408
01:56:07,529 --> 01:56:10,500
and be absorbed into another block.

2409
01:56:11,069 --> 01:56:13,969
Suddenly, skyminhyuk came.

2410
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:14,970
We have two slots left.

2411
01:56:14,971 --> 01:56:18,009
If you join us, we'll be able to show an amazing performance.

2412
01:56:18,010 --> 01:56:19,879
I asked the other members about recruiting you,

2413
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,010
and they all loved it.

2414
01:56:21,649 --> 01:56:23,180
- Why don't you talk with us? - Sure.

2415
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:25,719
- We have two slots left. - Yes.

2416
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:28,448
And we all agreed...

2417
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:30,659
- that we'd like to recruit you. - I see.

2418
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:32,419
There was no reason to refuse.

2419
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:33,728
Let's go.

2420
01:56:33,729 --> 01:56:35,329
You're from Incheon.

2421
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:36,828
We can go together.

2422
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:37,858
Are you going to join them?

2423
01:56:37,859 --> 01:56:39,228
- Yes. We're done now. - Is that so?

2424
01:56:39,229 --> 01:56:41,399
Hippie Kunda and Drain K.

2425
01:56:41,569 --> 01:56:43,300
It feels like we have an army by our side.

2426
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:46,198
We'd like to recruit rappers.

2427
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:47,939
We'd like to recruit rappers.

2428
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:49,568
Thank you.

2429
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:51,639
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

2430
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,979
Let's kill it.

2431
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,118
Rapper Drain K and Rapper Hippie Kunda...

2432
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:59,278
were recruited to Block Four.

2433
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:00,749
What? What happened?

2434
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:01,849
What will happen?

2435
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:04,288
- Block Eight will be closed down. - Yes. Because there's no one.

2436
01:57:04,289 --> 01:57:07,489
Block Eight will be closed down immediately.

2437
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:13,329
Rapper Hippie Kunda, please take the remaining Block Money...

2438
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,699
and go to Block Four.

2439
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:23,139
(Block 8: Hippie Kunda, Drain K)

2440
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,038
(Block 4: Drain K, Hippie Kunda)

2441
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:26,509
(Closed down)

2442
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:28,750
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2443
01:57:31,819 --> 01:57:33,220
I was startled.

2444
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:37,889
Everyone was clapping and cheering for us when we walked in.

2445
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,020
"Welcome."

2446
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:41,488
They welcomed us.

2447
01:57:41,489 --> 01:57:43,159
"This is so heartwarming."

2448
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:46,600
"It's nice." That's what I thought when I walked in.

2449
01:57:47,829 --> 01:57:49,630
Oh, right. the Block Money.

2450
01:57:49,970 --> 01:57:51,969
- Oh, my. - Thank you.

2451
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:53,438
- It's not a lot. - How much is it?

2452
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:54,769
I'll give you 2,000 dollars for travel expenses.

2453
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:56,510
- "Travel expenses?" - That's nice.

2454
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,180
(Current Block Money Ranking)

2455
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:05,979
(4th place: Block 4, 20,000 dollars)

2456
01:58:08,289 --> 01:58:11,688
Rapper SINCE was recruited to Block Six.

2457
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:12,788
- We should hurry up. - Let's do it.

2458
01:58:12,789 --> 01:58:15,528
We should make a decision before it's too late.

2459
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:17,799
Or they'll recruit everyone.

2460
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,059
We need JTONG's confirmation.

2461
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:22,398
Honestly, you're...

2462
01:58:22,399 --> 01:58:24,868
- the most persuasive. - Can you get...

2463
01:58:24,869 --> 01:58:26,299
his confirmation?

2464
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:27,609
Okay. I'll try.

2465
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:31,579
- Take your time. - But I...

2466
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,050
What's going on?

2467
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:39,619
Hey.

2468
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:41,819
- I came to talk with JTONG. - You did?

2469
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,589
Okay.

2470
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:45,359
- You may go. - I'll be back.

2471
01:58:46,859 --> 01:58:47,930
Please take a seat.

2472
01:58:48,689 --> 01:58:52,358
Our priority is to recruit JTONG,

2473
01:58:52,359 --> 01:58:53,560
which hasn't changed.

2474
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,500
This is the first time I ask someone to talk with me.

2475
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,938
What's your purpose and goal...

2476
01:59:00,939 --> 01:59:02,970
here?

2477
01:59:06,579 --> 01:59:09,409
A new environment...

2478
01:59:10,449 --> 01:59:13,819
I've never experienced in my daily life.

2479
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:15,749
- Yes. - I want to be...

2480
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:16,949
in that kind of environment.

2481
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,288
You know what you want. You're like, "This is me."

2482
01:59:19,289 --> 01:59:21,889
That's why I like you.

2483
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:23,689
- That's why we want you. - Yes.

2484
01:59:23,899 --> 01:59:25,158
If we draw...

2485
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:28,299
the second half of the picture together here,

2486
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,068
something unexpected...

2487
01:59:30,069 --> 01:59:34,068
will definitely happen.

2488
01:59:34,069 --> 01:59:36,710
I want you to imagine it.

2489
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:43,850
Thank you. That was my honest thought.

2490
01:59:43,979 --> 01:59:46,380
I really want to perform with you.

2491
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:53,260
I felt secure in Block One.

2492
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:57,430
But I'll have fun in another block.

2493
01:59:58,029 --> 02:00:01,969
I was contemplating between them. I kept thinking...

2494
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:04,799
whether I should stay...

2495
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,340
or take up a challenge.

2496
02:00:08,569 --> 02:00:10,840
- JTONG, have you talked with them? - Yes.

2497
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:12,079
How did it go?

2498
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:17,649
I'm thinking about putting myself...

2499
02:00:18,619 --> 02:00:19,779
in a new environment.

2500
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:22,119
- Yes. That's nice. - Yes.

2501
02:00:22,819 --> 02:00:24,420
How did the conversation go?

2502
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:28,260
I've decided to put myself...

2503
02:00:29,029 --> 02:00:30,459
- Yes. - in a new environment...

2504
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:34,229
when I have a chance. Even though it's risky,

2505
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:38,368
I decided to be on the show...

2506
02:00:38,369 --> 02:00:40,769
because I wanted to have time like that.

2507
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:43,510
When you're contemplating, you should go for it.

2508
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:46,210
You can try. And if it's not good, you can come back. Right?

2509
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:48,709
The last day hasn't come.

2510
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:49,778
- I'm sorry. - Yes.

2511
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:51,879
Because they should recruit someone again.

2512
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,988
(I'm sorry. If I move, Block 1 should recruit someone again.)

2513
02:00:53,989 --> 02:00:55,489
I feel sorry.

2514
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:00,760
Please go easy on us if you join Block Two.

2515
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,689
Yes.

2516
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,859
JTONG and Loopy?

2517
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:08,599
- TONGpy. - TONGpy?

2518
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:11,000
TONGpy is... My gosh.

2519
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:14,146
- It's a solid combination. - Block Two is very powerful now.

2520
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:15,210
I know.

2521
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,810
How should I put it? For me,

2522
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:21,310
it was a bolt out of the blue.

2523
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:22,880
This will be...

2524
02:01:24,619 --> 02:01:25,619
KHAN.

2525
02:01:26,649 --> 02:01:27,949
- Let's go. - Yes.

2526
02:01:28,489 --> 02:01:29,789
Let's go.

2527
02:01:30,119 --> 02:01:31,460
- Yes. - Let's go.

2528
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:33,059
- What's the matter? - No.

2529
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,229
Let's do it.

2530
02:01:35,029 --> 02:01:36,090
He's here.

2531
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:39,528
I think I made JTONG curious about our team.

2532
02:01:39,529 --> 02:01:41,799
He was probably like, "Should I experience it?"

2533
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,828
I think that's why he came.

2534
02:01:43,829 --> 02:01:45,939
The decisive moment was when Loopy asked...

2535
02:01:47,369 --> 02:01:49,909
why I came to the show.

2536
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:52,679
That moment made me think...

2537
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:55,108
about important things in my life...

2538
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:57,949
once again.

2539
02:01:58,149 --> 02:02:00,449
It made me think...

2540
02:02:00,689 --> 02:02:03,090
I want to leave to find something new...

2541
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:05,020
rather than stay.

2542
02:02:07,829 --> 02:02:09,658
Rapper JTONG...

2543
02:02:09,659 --> 02:02:11,858
was recruited to Block Two.

2544
02:02:11,859 --> 02:02:14,399
It's not good for Block One.

2545
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:17,670
Because it felt like they were Team JTONG.

2546
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,898
- Gosh. - Okay.

2547
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:21,108
Block Two is really strong now.

2548
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:23,439
- I got goosebumps. - Block Two will kill it.

2549
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:27,380
He was 1 of the pillars of Block 1.

2550
02:02:27,609 --> 02:02:28,709
It was unexpected.

2551
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:32,649
I didn't think JTONG would move.

2552
02:02:32,819 --> 02:02:33,819
Take care.

2553
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:36,689
It's okay.

2554
02:02:36,989 --> 02:02:39,189
- It's really fine. - No.

2555
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:42,229
Let me pack my bag.

2556
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:46,129
Block Two became stronger as JTONG joined them.

2557
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:48,129
It's like Team Hong Chul without Hong Chul.

2558
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:50,299
We're Team JTONG without JTONG.

2559
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:52,799
Who should be our core member?

2560
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,068
Who should we recruit?

2561
02:02:54,069 --> 02:02:55,770
It's going to be hectic from now on.

2562
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:58,710
(KHAN gets ready to welcome JTONG.)

2563
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:01,510
So it turned out like this.

2564
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:04,350
- Come on, brother. - It's interesting somehow.

2565
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,989
- Oh, my. You worked hard. - Our big picture worked out.

2566
02:03:09,189 --> 02:03:10,350
Let's get it!

2567
02:03:17,289 --> 02:03:19,560
- There's an empty bed for you. - It's good to see you.

2568
02:03:20,729 --> 02:03:22,228
(Block 1: JTONG)

2569
02:03:22,229 --> 02:03:25,739
(Block 2: JTONG)

2570
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,310
Are our blockmates in there?

2571
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:31,779
Come on. We should go quickly.

2572
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:34,948
Chaboom said if you recruit Foggyatthebottom,

2573
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:36,578
he'll give you 15,000 dollars for the Block Money.

2574
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:37,649
Chaboom did?

2575
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:39,750
KHAN.

2576
02:03:39,979 --> 02:03:42,349
If I step down as the leader and is replaced by Foggyatthebottom,

2577
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:44,350
I'll give you 15,000 dollars. I hope you take him.

2578
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:48,289
He wants to take the responsibility as the leader and leave.

2579
02:03:48,489 --> 02:03:50,130
I understand what you mean.

2580
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:51,689
He immediately went to Block Seven.

2581
02:03:51,829 --> 02:03:54,059
Winning both Foggyatthebottom and 15,000 dollars.

2582
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:55,600
Killing two birds with one stone.

2583
02:03:55,930 --> 02:03:57,840
We'll take Foggyatthebottom.

2584
02:03:57,869 --> 02:03:59,438
Okay. Noted.

2585
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:01,809
Are you going to hand over the leader role to him?

2586
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:02,939
Oh, okay.

2587
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:05,309
He'll hand over the leader role.

2588
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:06,609
That was the deal.

2589
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,449
I made a deal with them.

2590
02:04:08,579 --> 02:04:09,749
I promised to hand over the leader role...

2591
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,618
- to you. - And I'll join that block?

2592
02:04:11,619 --> 02:04:14,889
I didn't know, but Chaboom saved me,

2593
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:16,810
and it feels like he gave me some allowance too.

2594
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:18,260
I felt sorry.

2595
02:04:19,789 --> 02:04:20,989
You wanted to be in this team.

2596
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,029
You saved me.

2597
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:25,659
But you want me to bring the money too?

2598
02:04:26,329 --> 02:04:28,049
I'm giving you some money while saving you.

2599
02:04:28,369 --> 02:04:29,800
Aren't you too big of a person?

2600
02:04:32,239 --> 02:04:33,899
- What? - What was that?

2601
02:04:34,369 --> 02:04:39,039
Block Seven's leader changed to Foggyatthebottom.

2602
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:43,909
I'm Chaboom, and I'm moving from Block 7 to Block 3.

2603
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:47,078
I'll move from Block 7 to Block 2.

2604
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:48,196
(Foggyatthebottom is recruited to Block 2 from Block 7.)

2605
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:49,618
(Block 7: Foggyatthebottom and Chaboom)

2606
02:04:49,619 --> 02:04:53,118
(Block 3: Chaboom)

2607
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:54,589
(Block 7: Foggyatthebottom)

2608
02:04:54,590 --> 02:04:56,589
(Block 2: Foggyatthebottom)

2609
02:04:56,590 --> 02:04:58,000
(Block 7: Closed)

2610
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,130
I love you.

2611
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:01,399
Another new guest is here.

2612
02:05:02,170 --> 02:05:04,129
- Yes! - Yes!

2613
02:05:04,130 --> 02:05:05,669
- Welcome. - Yes!

2614
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:06,868
You came with a lot of money.

2615
02:05:06,869 --> 02:05:08,640
- Pay us first. - He brought some cash.

2616
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,039
So it's a total of 29,000 dollars now.

2617
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:12,710
It's 29,000 dollars.

2618
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:14,380
I've never met you before.

2619
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:17,479
It's 29,000 dollars?

2620
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:20,078
(Current Block Money Rank)

2621
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:21,349
(1. Block 5:30,000 dollars, 2. Block 2:29,000 dollars)

2622
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:22,448
(3. Block 3:27,000 dollars, 4. Block 1:23,000 dollars)

2623
02:05:22,449 --> 02:05:25,090
Block Two seems to be getting stronger and more solid,

2624
02:05:25,659 --> 02:05:27,520
both in terms of people and money.

2625
02:05:27,859 --> 02:05:28,930
I'm loving it.

2626
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,289
My team got stronger.

2627
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:33,430
I'm curious how we will win the next match.

2628
02:05:36,170 --> 02:05:38,170
It's an emergency.

2629
02:05:39,170 --> 02:05:40,170
It's an emergency.

2630
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:42,569
- We just... - Emergency. What should we do?

2631
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:44,840
How about recruiting the main rappers of Block Four?

2632
02:05:44,979 --> 02:05:46,210
Who's the main rapper?

2633
02:05:46,279 --> 02:05:47,279
Boi B.

2634
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:48,949
No, he's weak.

2635
02:05:49,779 --> 02:05:52,920
We're still the unbeatable Block One, though.

2636
02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:56,289
JTONG's move is our loss.

2637
02:05:56,989 --> 02:06:00,289
I wanted to replace his place.

2638
02:06:01,189 --> 02:06:03,029
Do you think we can give the best performance?

2639
02:06:03,329 --> 02:06:06,158
After one hour, we'll wrap up the Leader Replacement...

2640
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:07,969
and Rapper Recruitment.

2641
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:10,069
- After 1 hour? - After 1 hour?

2642
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,770
We had no time.

2643
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:15,310
Who should we recruit? We had to recruit one rapper.

2644
02:06:15,609 --> 02:06:17,810
Who's good? Reddy?

2645
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:19,810
HAON? Roh Yun Ha?

2646
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:21,149
But...

2647
02:06:21,649 --> 02:06:25,020
Double Down and I are the same age.

2648
02:06:25,819 --> 02:06:27,050
When he raps,

2649
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:30,050
it feels different even though he's doing the same thing.

2650
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:33,158
He would be appropriate as JTONG's replacement.

2651
02:06:33,159 --> 02:06:34,219
When I was in Block Seven,

2652
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:36,389
I learned that he had a great personality.

2653
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:38,829
He raps noticeably.

2654
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,759
During Mask Off,

2655
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:43,629
I thought he rapped with wit and humor.

2656
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:45,470
That's why I wanted to recruit him to my team.

2657
02:06:45,569 --> 02:06:48,139
Group Five, maybe. With me.

2658
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:49,939
- If you include me. - Yes.

2659
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:53,078
So, well...

2660
02:06:53,079 --> 02:06:55,949
Is there a spot here in Block One?

2661
02:06:56,510 --> 02:06:58,949
Yes, if...

2662
02:06:59,449 --> 02:07:01,250
you're thinking to move, let's talk.

2663
02:07:04,119 --> 02:07:05,259
Are you willing to come?

2664
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:06,590
Did Polodared move?

2665
02:07:07,189 --> 02:07:08,528
Oh, Polodared is here.

2666
02:07:08,529 --> 02:07:10,630
- He's here. - Oh, he's having his meal.

2667
02:07:14,430 --> 02:07:17,568
If you're okay with that, let's do this quickly.

2668
02:07:17,569 --> 02:07:19,470
- Quickly. - Yes.

2669
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,039
Right.

2670
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:24,510
We had to be on the same team.

2671
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:28,649
If it happens, it will be really fun.

2672
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:31,180
You've got to move to my block.

2673
02:07:31,449 --> 02:07:33,079
Come. Everyone wants you.

2674
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:36,489
I'm not lying.

2675
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:38,119
I'm not lying.

2676
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:40,319
I'm not lying. Yes.

2677
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:43,430
Right now. Let's go.

2678
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:50,399
(Double Down is thinking hard as Don Mills keeps persuading him.)

2679
02:07:51,569 --> 02:07:53,800
I think I'll go.

2680
02:07:54,409 --> 02:07:56,239
For sure? A hundred percent?

2681
02:07:56,739 --> 02:07:58,039
- Of course. - Yes.

2682
02:07:58,939 --> 02:08:01,750
Don Mills is in Block One, you know.

2683
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:03,879
Polodared is a good rapper.

2684
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:06,619
Tray B and Fleeky Bang are good too.

2685
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:09,119
Everyone is good. It was a strong team.

2686
02:08:09,289 --> 02:08:10,520
I had to change my plan.

2687
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:13,488
- Here. - Two of them should go in, right?

2688
02:08:13,489 --> 02:08:14,560
We're the bodyguards.

2689
02:08:14,859 --> 02:08:15,930
Right.

2690
02:08:16,029 --> 02:08:19,499
(Fleeky Bang and Double Down enter the Choice Block.)

2691
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:21,100
I will recruit a rapper.

2692
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:24,129
I'm going to Block One.

2693
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:25,199
Yes.

2694
02:08:29,939 --> 02:08:31,139
(Double Down is recruited to Block 1 from Block 5.)

2695
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:32,539
Yes. Thank you.

2696
02:08:33,909 --> 02:08:36,380
- I signed the contract. - The contract?

2697
02:08:36,979 --> 02:08:38,020
Good job.

2698
02:08:38,449 --> 02:08:40,948
We were very happy. After JTONG left,

2699
02:08:40,949 --> 02:08:42,849
and Double Down joined, we thought it was better.

2700
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:45,960
We became the most enjoyable team.

2701
02:08:46,119 --> 02:08:47,420
It was a good change.

2702
02:08:48,090 --> 02:08:50,090
This is more than satisfying. It's a huge success.

2703
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:51,529
If they rap well, I'm good.

2704
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:52,859
No matter what it is.

2705
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:55,569
We all need to survive. You know?

2706
02:08:56,369 --> 02:08:57,698
(Block 5: Double Down)

2707
02:08:57,699 --> 02:09:01,109
(Block 1: Double Down)

2708
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:05,738
Rapper Double Down...

2709
02:09:05,739 --> 02:09:08,448
- was recruited to Block One. - Who?

2710
02:09:08,449 --> 02:09:10,289
- Double Down to Block One. - Oh, Double Down.

2711
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:12,250
It suits him.

2712
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:14,720
- All the Blocks are strong now. - Yes.

2713
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:17,520
This will continue.

2714
02:09:17,890 --> 02:09:20,020
- Only strong rappers will survive. - Yes.

2715
02:09:21,489 --> 02:09:23,036
Everyone is thinking of the bigger picture.

2716
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:25,359
They're all thinking hard.

2717
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:27,560
It's a battle of taking and losing.

2718
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:29,529
It's fun.

2719
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:30,970
Shall we take a break too?

2720
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:32,569
I should take a nap.

2721
02:09:32,899 --> 02:09:34,100
Let's take a break.

2722
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:36,839
I used too much of my brain.

2723
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:38,739
Right? It feels like I completed a mission.

2724
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,809
I fell in love with your rap yesterday.

2725
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:41,810
It's over.

2726
02:09:41,811 --> 02:09:44,750
Rapper OSUN was recruited to Block Five.

2727
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:46,779
- This is what happens. - OSUN?

2728
02:09:46,949 --> 02:09:49,350
What? OSUN is recruited?

2729
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,520
Or...

2730
02:09:51,489 --> 02:09:53,358
- Is it over? - Rapper OSUN was...

2731
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:55,229
recruited to Block Five.

2732
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:57,089
- It scared me. - What?

2733
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:58,960
He's recruited to Block Five.

2734
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:03,929
Rapper OSUN. Pack your belongings...

2735
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:06,299
and move to Block Five now.

2736
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:07,738
- What the heck? - What the heck?

2737
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:09,439
- What the heck? - Hey!

2738
02:10:09,739 --> 02:10:11,239
Is it OSUN or Nosun?

2739
02:10:11,779 --> 02:10:13,010
Is it Nosun or OSUN?

2740
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:14,450
- Did we lose him? - It's OSUN?

2741
02:10:14,609 --> 02:10:15,710
Our OSUN?

2742
02:10:15,909 --> 02:10:16,909
I think it's OSUN.

2743
02:10:16,979 --> 02:10:18,920
- OSUN? - From our team?

2744
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:21,050
- From our team? - OSUN?

2745
02:10:21,819 --> 02:10:23,550
It's our team. Shoot.

2746
02:10:23,619 --> 02:10:24,619
Is it you?

2747
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,488
- OSUN? - Is it you?

2748
02:10:26,489 --> 02:10:27,489
Did you move?

2749
02:10:27,489 --> 02:10:28,489
I moved.

2750
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:30,630
What's going on?

2751
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:32,699
My heart is beating, and my hands are shaking.

2752
02:10:33,930 --> 02:10:35,490
- Do you want to drink? - Is that cold?

2753
02:10:36,069 --> 02:10:37,229
Where did you get this?

2754
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:39,739
It's a flex of a winner.

2755
02:10:40,569 --> 02:10:44,239
(Block 5 won League A of the Block Tournament.)

2756
02:10:44,439 --> 02:10:46,679
We enjoyed the day.

2757
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:48,079
We enjoyed it a lot.

2758
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:49,310
Give me a little bit.

2759
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:50,310
A taste of success.

2760
02:10:50,311 --> 02:10:51,319
Cheers!

2761
02:10:51,619 --> 02:10:53,078
- Thanks for your efforts. - Thanks for your efforts.

2762
02:10:53,079 --> 02:10:54,696
- Thanks for your efforts. - Thanks for your efforts.

2763
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,560
SINCE, when are you going to offer me a drink?

2764
02:10:57,090 --> 02:10:59,060
Wait. We...

2765
02:10:59,289 --> 02:11:01,259
- Wait, we... - I'm sorry.

2766
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:03,229
I forgot after pouring her glass.

2767
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:05,599
I was happy because...

2768
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,300
it was my first time to win after entering the Village.

2769
02:11:08,829 --> 02:11:12,640
I loved how satisfying it was.

2770
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,939
(After the night of enjoying the flex of a winner)

2771
02:11:20,039 --> 02:11:21,649
This is hard.

2772
02:11:21,979 --> 02:11:23,010
It's hard, right?

2773
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:25,420
To earn something,

2774
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:28,590
you need to move faster than you think.

2775
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:29,720
I know.

2776
02:11:29,721 --> 02:11:30,920
You need to act in advance.

2777
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:33,590
You're right. For goodness' sake.

2778
02:11:33,689 --> 02:11:35,228
Let's change the leader now.

2779
02:11:35,229 --> 02:11:36,389
Our new leader is...

2780
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:37,630
- Khundi Panda. - Khundi Panda.

2781
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:39,358
- Did you tell them? - I just need to say it, right?

2782
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:41,529
I'm moving to Block Five.

2783
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:43,399
Block Five.

2784
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,438
- Are you still trying? - I should.

2785
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:47,899
This won't work. We need one more rapper.

2786
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:49,309
Are you positive or not?

2787
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:51,679
- Me? Of moving my block? No. - Yes.

2788
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,039
I want to win in my current block.

2789
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,380
What are you going to do?

2790
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:56,880
I won't do anything.

2791
02:11:57,149 --> 02:11:59,449
Are you considering to move?

2792
02:11:59,819 --> 02:12:02,550
I'm going to stay here.

2793
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:04,050
Do you want to join us?

2794
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,288
What? Suddenly?

2795
02:12:05,289 --> 02:12:07,090
I asked a lot here and there.

2796
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:10,688
But everyone was vague, and no one wanted to move.

2797
02:12:10,689 --> 02:12:12,029
I was in a dilemma.

2798
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,720
- I need to tell you all something. - What?

2799
02:12:15,229 --> 02:12:18,270
I'm going to move.

2800
02:12:19,069 --> 02:12:23,470
I'm sorry. That's why I wanted to talk to you first before you hear...

2801
02:12:24,369 --> 02:12:26,108
I thought nothing was going well.

2802
02:12:26,109 --> 02:12:27,180
Nothing is going well.

2803
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:29,250
What should I do?

2804
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:31,350
Why is it always so difficult for us?

2805
02:12:31,979 --> 02:12:33,349
After that chaos,

2806
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:36,719
I'm furious that I could only recruit one rapper.

2807
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,760
It's over. Darn it.

2808
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,260
VIIN...

2809
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:43,960
- Let's survive once more. - wanted to move because...

2810
02:12:44,329 --> 02:12:46,228
- she couldn't show her talent. - Yes.

2811
02:12:46,229 --> 02:12:47,658
Isn't it better for her to come here?

2812
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:48,930
- Shall I recruit her? - Yes.

2813
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,840
VIIN and Kim Ryul,

2814
02:12:51,939 --> 02:12:53,199
are you both fixed to be here?

2815
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:55,810
- We didn't discuss that yet. - Not yet?

2816
02:12:56,109 --> 02:12:58,039
Are you considering to move?

2817
02:13:00,779 --> 02:13:02,180
- Then... - How should we do this?

2818
02:13:03,979 --> 02:13:06,119
I want to try working with Block Five,

2819
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:07,779
but I'll just be in my team...

2820
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,688
for now.

2821
02:13:09,689 --> 02:13:12,358
Okay. You can show your talent here.

2822
02:13:12,359 --> 02:13:13,359
Yes.

2823
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:14,789
Let's go to bed now.

2824
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:18,130
How much is it?

2825
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,529
- Around 1,000 dollars. - Right?

2826
02:13:24,869 --> 02:13:25,869
Why?

2827
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:28,969
- I want to rap with you. - Do you want to join us?

2828
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:30,509
- I want to rap with you. - Do you want to join us?

2829
02:13:30,510 --> 02:13:31,679
- No. - I want to rap with you.

2830
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:32,909
I'm considering my option.

2831
02:13:33,239 --> 02:13:34,750
- Like what? - I'm calculating.

2832
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:37,125
I think it would be nice if you joined our block.

2833
02:13:37,149 --> 02:13:38,180
Oh, is it?

2834
02:13:38,649 --> 02:13:39,649
Yes.

2835
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:42,580
Then I want to be the leader.

2836
02:13:50,789 --> 02:13:51,960
What do you think about this?

2837
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:57,129
If you won't be chosen as the elimination candidate,

2838
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:58,170
do you want to join us?

2839
02:13:58,539 --> 02:14:00,069
Just verbally?

2840
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,239
So you want this?

2841
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:02,670
Yes.

2842
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:03,969
For real?

2843
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:05,839
OSUN wants to join if he becomes the leader.

2844
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:06,840
I agree.

2845
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:07,978
Will you give me the position?

2846
02:14:07,979 --> 02:14:09,149
- Yes. - Sure.

2847
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:13,679
I'll move to Block Five.

2848
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,389
(OSUN of Block 3 gets recruited to Block 5.)

2849
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:16,988
(Block 3: OSUN)

2850
02:14:16,989 --> 02:14:20,358
(Block 5: OSUN)

2851
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:21,460
Is it you?

2852
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:23,289
- OSUN? - Is it you?

2853
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:25,199
- Did you move? - I'm leaving.

2854
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,869
You can go without discussing it with us?

2855
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:31,299
Yes, he can.

2856
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,820
It shocked me. I'm not sleepy anymore.

2857
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:34,198
I enjoyed working with you, OSUN.

2858
02:14:34,199 --> 02:14:35,359
- This is how it goes. - Yes.

2859
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:39,010
- Are you leaving? - I'm leaving because...

2860
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:41,978
I'm scared of being here...

2861
02:14:41,979 --> 02:14:43,885
as I might be one of the elimination candidates.

2862
02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:46,180
So I'm moving with a condition of me being the leader.

2863
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:48,219
- Oh, you're going to be the leader. - Oh, okay.

2864
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:49,920
So I won't be eliminated.

2865
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:51,050
- I see. - Okay.

2866
02:14:51,051 --> 02:14:52,390
- You calculated well. - Yes.

2867
02:14:54,289 --> 02:14:55,759
I had no choice.

2868
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:57,559
I might be eliminated being here.

2869
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:59,560
I'm going there to survive as a leader.

2870
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:01,740
- Did they agree on that? - Yes.

2871
02:15:02,029 --> 02:15:03,100
I understand.

2872
02:15:09,609 --> 02:15:10,739
"I might be eliminated?"

2873
02:15:17,079 --> 02:15:19,619
- We have no time. - Yes. What should we do?

2874
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:21,688
Is there an option to recruit?

2875
02:15:21,689 --> 02:15:23,889
Shoot. Should we get a replacement?

2876
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:25,389
- There's no one to recruit. - Instead...

2877
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:27,858
Why did he just move without discussing it with us?

2878
02:15:27,859 --> 02:15:30,158
He said he was scared of being eliminated here.

2879
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:31,828
- Right. - But I...

2880
02:15:31,829 --> 02:15:33,328
have never thought about it.

2881
02:15:33,329 --> 02:15:34,898
Me too.

2882
02:15:34,899 --> 02:15:36,269
But I understand why he did.

2883
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:38,029
- Right. - He needs to survive.

2884
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:41,039
- Right. - Right.

2885
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:43,938
I thought he discussed it earlier.

2886
02:15:43,939 --> 02:15:46,015
- That's what I thought. - Block Five's leader was...

2887
02:15:46,039 --> 02:15:50,149
changed from Khundi Panda to OSUN.

2888
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:51,310
I had no idea.

2889
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:54,578
Personally, I feel like I got stabbed in the back.

2890
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:56,019
But I understand his perspective.

2891
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:57,288
- I understand. - If he stays here,

2892
02:15:57,289 --> 02:16:00,658
he might be listed up as an elimination candidate.

2893
02:16:00,659 --> 02:16:02,788
- He was always worried. - I see.

2894
02:16:02,789 --> 02:16:04,959
- We never thought about it. - Never.

2895
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:06,429
- That's why I feel bad. - Leader Replacement...

2896
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:08,299
and Rapper Recruitment is over.

2897
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:10,828
- That's how they recruited him. - Yes.

2898
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,898
- My gosh. What's going on? - That's why he moved.

2899
02:16:12,899 --> 02:16:15,470
They promised him the leader position.

2900
02:16:17,069 --> 02:16:18,379
- I see. - What are they thinking?

2901
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:20,909
They made a deal with him by giving him the leader role.

2902
02:16:21,079 --> 02:16:23,579
Is OSUN worth that much?

2903
02:16:23,979 --> 02:16:27,179
I thought they recruited him to put in the elimination candidate.

2904
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,749
- Why did they make him the leader? - I have no idea.

2905
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:30,149
What's their plan?

2906
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,958
- I'll enjoy this. - Yes, survive.

2907
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:36,828
- Do a good job out there. - Yes.

2908
02:16:36,829 --> 02:16:39,658
- I moved to be on stage. - Do it well. Yes, I know.

2909
02:16:39,659 --> 02:16:42,700
Survive. OSUN, survive.

2910
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,468
Be awesome.

2911
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:45,599
You'll do well.

2912
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:48,770
We need to think about our next member.

2913
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:55,808
Of course, I'm fond of Block Three.

2914
02:16:55,809 --> 02:16:57,978
But I felt insecure...

2915
02:16:57,979 --> 02:17:00,749
about my survival.

2916
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:02,388
Won't they eliminate more people?

2917
02:17:02,389 --> 02:17:04,350
They will without holding back.

2918
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,520
Honestly, I can judge objectively.

2919
02:17:06,659 --> 02:17:08,829
If I had to choose two candidates to eliminate,

2920
02:17:09,229 --> 02:17:11,059
I'd choose DOMMIU and James An.

2921
02:17:11,229 --> 02:17:13,799
Only 4 or 5 rappers will survive from Block 3.

2922
02:17:14,229 --> 02:17:17,969
If James An and DOMMIU become the elimination candidates,

2923
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:21,139
I felt like I'd be the next one.

2924
02:17:21,299 --> 02:17:23,009
I think it'll be good to recruit Chaboom.

2925
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:25,539
Is Chaboom the scapegoat?

2926
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:28,138
No, we're not looking for a scapegoat...

2927
02:17:28,139 --> 02:17:29,909
but a rapper to strengthen us.

2928
02:17:30,209 --> 02:17:33,979
If we need to eliminate someone,

2929
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:37,189
we'll feel bad to eliminate someone from our block.

2930
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:39,988
Many rappers of Block Three are skilled.

2931
02:17:39,989 --> 02:17:43,029
I thought it would be difficult for me to survive.

2932
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:45,799
Khundi Panda offered me the leader role.

2933
02:17:46,159 --> 02:17:47,829
So I trusted him and moved right away.

2934
02:17:48,569 --> 02:17:50,968
- I'll get going. - Let me have a hug.

2935
02:17:50,969 --> 02:17:53,370
- Your necklace is cool. - Your necklace is cool.

2936
02:17:53,739 --> 02:17:54,770
Congratulations.

2937
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:56,468
Feel the weight of a leader.

2938
02:17:56,469 --> 02:17:59,408
- Yes. Thank you. Bye. - Bye.

2939
02:17:59,409 --> 02:18:01,279
- Goodbye, OSUN. - Yes.

2940
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,509
- Bye. - Thanks for your efforts.

2941
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:04,609
- Thank you. - Do well when you go there.

2942
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:06,548
- You can do it. - You made the right choice.

2943
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:08,709
- Thank you. Let's do this. - Thanks for your efforts.

2944
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:12,120
Okay. Good.

2945
02:18:15,090 --> 02:18:17,590
I didn't see this coming. At all.

2946
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:24,728
What happened?

2947
02:18:24,729 --> 02:18:27,769
Block Five recruited him with a leader role.

2948
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:29,808
- I predicted that. - To OSUN. Yes.

2949
02:18:29,809 --> 02:18:32,109
But I didn't see it coming.

2950
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:34,478
- I feel sad. - I see.

2951
02:18:34,479 --> 02:18:37,110
We were trying to get this through as a team.

2952
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:39,750
What upset me was...

2953
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:43,548
that if there was a reason to leave our team,

2954
02:18:43,549 --> 02:18:45,389
he could have discussed with me or Reddy...

2955
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:48,759
and found a mutual agreement.

2956
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,860
Because I enjoyed being on a team with OSUN.

2957
02:18:55,469 --> 02:18:57,509
How do I look? Do I look like the man in "Old Boy?"

2958
02:18:58,329 --> 02:18:59,440
GOLDBUUDA?

2959
02:18:59,739 --> 02:19:02,369
OSUN will eat everything. He'll empty it.

2960
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:03,969
You should do an eating show.

2961
02:19:04,909 --> 02:19:05,979
Can I drink this?

2962
02:19:07,579 --> 02:19:11,249
(While working together, HAON became attached to OSUN.)

2963
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:14,649
The writer doesn't want you to plastic surgery, accept the reality

2964
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:16,620
OSUN, that punk.

2965
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:20,159
I guess I expected it to be too sweet and nice.

2966
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:23,489
Shall I go to the lounge?

2967
02:19:25,059 --> 02:19:26,759
We might have to battle with the winner.

2968
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:27,828
First place against first place?

2969
02:19:27,829 --> 02:19:28,869
(OSUN and JP are currently discussing the upcoming match.)

2970
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:30,799
- Second place against second place. - Wait.

2971
02:19:31,969 --> 02:19:33,176
- OSUN, are you happy? - Then...

2972
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,160
- I came to visit you. - the two closed blocks...

2973
02:19:35,639 --> 02:19:37,738
(HAON came to visit OSUN at Block 5.)

2974
02:19:37,739 --> 02:19:40,180
- The two teams... - What?

2975
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,520
Are you happy?

2976
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:55,889
- Am I happy? - Yes.

2977
02:19:56,059 --> 02:19:57,690
I'm okay.

2978
02:20:01,799 --> 02:20:02,870
Honestly,

2979
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,600
it's upsetting that you moved when we only had five minutes left.

2980
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:17,510
If I stayed, you would've eliminated me.

2981
02:20:18,049 --> 02:20:20,350
- We? Eliminating you? - Yes.

2982
02:20:21,049 --> 02:20:22,718
We would never.

2983
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:24,988
We were a team. It was like that for so long.

2984
02:20:24,989 --> 02:20:26,158
If you were to choose a candidate.

2985
02:20:26,159 --> 02:20:27,520
- If I had to choose? - Yes.

2986
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:30,159
- You thought you would be next? - Yes.

2987
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:31,959
Okay.

2988
02:20:32,899 --> 02:20:34,299
You thought about losing already.

2989
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:38,870
Not that, but more of a Plan B.

2990
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:41,939
- To prepare for us losing? - Yes.

2991
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:43,610
- For the worst-case scenario? - Yes.

2992
02:20:44,010 --> 02:20:46,208
- Because... - But because of your choice,

2993
02:20:46,209 --> 02:20:48,609
do you realize that we are closer to the worst-case scenario?

2994
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:50,849
- Because... - But because of your choice,

2995
02:20:50,850 --> 02:20:53,290
do you realize that we are closer to the worst-case scenario?

2996
02:20:57,549 --> 02:21:00,790
As a result, we lost one of our soldiers, which is you.

2997
02:21:01,489 --> 02:21:03,959
But I'm in another team now.

2998
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:07,559
Is there a need to think about this matter?

2999
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:11,229
Okay. Then, fine.

3000
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:15,309
I'm leaving.

3001
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:24,379
- He's angry. - Yes. He is.

3002
02:21:29,889 --> 02:21:31,190
For goodness' sake.

3003
02:21:37,959 --> 02:21:39,500
I'm not sleepy anymore.

3004
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:48,120
You're scaring me. What are you doing?

3005
02:21:48,639 --> 02:21:50,369
I'm playing chess alone. Do you know how to play?

3006
02:21:50,370 --> 02:21:51,370
- I don't know. - Yes?

3007
02:21:51,371 --> 02:21:53,079
- I'll just sit here. - Sure.

3008
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,920
- Let's go to Beef Zone. - Shall we?

3009
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:03,749
Oh, my. Chess?

3010
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:05,488
- I went to OSUN... - Yes.

3011
02:22:05,489 --> 02:22:07,020
- and scolded him. - Seriously?

3012
02:22:08,290 --> 02:22:10,329
- You can't hold back. - It's that...

3013
02:22:11,329 --> 02:22:13,728
- he moved to survive. - Yes.

3014
02:22:13,729 --> 02:22:15,370
He said he made the best choice.

3015
02:22:16,629 --> 02:22:18,798
Honestly, I'm not fine.

3016
02:22:18,799 --> 02:22:22,110
- So I went to talk to feel fine. - Okay. You did well.

3017
02:22:23,639 --> 02:22:25,208
We spent some time together.

3018
02:22:25,209 --> 02:22:28,979
It'd have felt strange if he moved to another team.

3019
02:22:29,379 --> 02:22:30,978
He'd be less meaningful to me.

3020
02:22:30,979 --> 02:22:33,120
You jerk! I'm kidding.

3021
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:35,620
OSUN, since you left, hope you do well there.

3022
02:22:35,790 --> 02:22:37,950
I just like my block.

3023
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:44,888
I used too much of my brain. I'm tired.

3024
02:22:44,889 --> 02:22:46,798
- Stressful two hours. - Tell me about it.

3025
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:48,869
But we wrapped it up.

3026
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:51,369
But because OSUN left us,

3027
02:22:51,370 --> 02:22:53,499
we became nervous.

3028
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:54,939
I like that in a way.

3029
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:57,708
We needed this tension.

3030
02:22:57,709 --> 02:22:59,908
After Foggyatthebottom and JTONG joined,

3031
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:01,780
it became a huge plus to us.

3032
02:23:02,079 --> 02:23:03,319
- Seriously? - I'll do my best.

3033
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:06,949
I'm gaining new energy that I haven't felt before.

3034
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:10,048
We made a lot of causes to make our team...

3035
02:23:10,049 --> 02:23:11,620
bond better.

3036
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:13,859
I feel relief too, but...

3037
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:16,659
it's too much of an emotion...

3038
02:23:17,329 --> 02:23:20,529
to just define it as a relief.

3039
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:22,128
It's quite complex.

3040
02:23:22,129 --> 02:23:23,530
I feel like...

3041
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:26,799
our victory came very close to us.

3042
02:23:30,909 --> 02:23:31,909
Oh, my.

3043
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:33,639
Members of RAP: PUBLIC.

3044
02:23:34,209 --> 02:23:36,280
Please come to the arena.

3045
02:23:36,610 --> 02:23:38,079
- My goodness. Please. - Let's go!

3046
02:23:38,309 --> 02:23:40,280
- Let's go. - Please give us a break.

3047
02:23:41,079 --> 02:23:42,290
Shall we get going?

3048
02:23:43,719 --> 02:23:45,289
Mission never stops.

3049
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:46,760
Never stops.

3050
02:23:47,860 --> 02:23:49,860
- How's the atmosphere? - It's warm.

3051
02:23:51,290 --> 02:23:54,360
- How's Block Two? - I can't simply say it's good.

3052
02:23:54,659 --> 02:23:57,029
I'm adapting to the new environment.

3053
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:58,100
I see.

3054
02:23:58,299 --> 02:23:59,699
- Where are our seats? - Are we at the end?

3055
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:01,969
- Is it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? - Are we at the end?

3056
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:03,239
Blocks 7 and 8 are closed.

3057
02:24:03,370 --> 02:24:05,069
- So we should sit at the end. - I see.

3058
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:10,649
OSUN, that jerk.

3059
02:24:11,149 --> 02:24:15,049
Members of RAP: PUBLIC. After the previous match,

3060
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:17,719
three leaders were replaced.

3061
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:20,719
- Hurry. Come here. - Welcome.

3062
02:24:23,489 --> 02:24:27,100
Nine members moved their blocks.

3063
02:24:29,069 --> 02:24:30,869
Gosh. Nine members moved?

3064
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:33,068
It looks different. Chaboom is sitting there.

3065
02:24:33,069 --> 02:24:34,100
I know, right?

3066
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:37,510
It looks very different now.

3067
02:24:37,909 --> 02:24:41,179
Through this process, with only one leader remaining,

3068
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:44,179
Blocks 7 and 8 were closed,

3069
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:48,020
and once again, the society began to change.

3070
02:24:48,250 --> 02:24:50,920
How can I win?

3071
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:52,819
From now on,

3072
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,989
I will announce the third Block Match,

3073
02:24:56,129 --> 02:24:59,159
which will determine the fate of the blocks once again.

3074
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:01,700
Oh, come on, baby.

3075
02:25:02,530 --> 02:25:03,968
- I'm nervous again. - I'm nervous.

3076
02:25:03,969 --> 02:25:05,968
- Right? After that many rounds. - Me too.

3077
02:25:05,969 --> 02:25:07,840
The third Block Match is...

3078
02:25:08,639 --> 02:25:09,639
What is it?

3079
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:12,208
Block Competition.

3080
02:25:12,209 --> 02:25:13,379
Block Competition?

3081
02:25:13,639 --> 02:25:15,179
- What is it? - Competition?

3082
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:17,078
Are we forming a union with other blocks?

3083
02:25:17,079 --> 02:25:18,978
We're going to have a battle with other blocks again.

3084
02:25:18,979 --> 02:25:21,648
- One from us and one from them. - The rules are as follows.

3085
02:25:21,649 --> 02:25:22,649
He's explaining.

3086
02:25:23,389 --> 02:25:27,388
For the Block Competition, everyone from the block will participate.

3087
02:25:27,389 --> 02:25:30,829
It's a match to show your teamwork.

3088
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:33,259
- Teamwork. Nice. - Teamwork.

3089
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,298
(Block Competition Rule)

3090
02:25:34,299 --> 02:25:37,199
The two blocks will face off...

3091
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,770
in an eight-round showdown.

3092
02:25:39,569 --> 02:25:42,870
Each round will feature the same beat,

3093
02:25:43,370 --> 02:25:45,979
and there is no limit...

3094
02:25:46,909 --> 02:25:48,439
to the number of participants per round.

3095
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:50,978
Is it okay to have two rappers participate for one beat?

3096
02:25:50,979 --> 02:25:53,179
They might have four rappers in one round.

3097
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:55,519
- Even eight. - Eight rappers can participate.

3098
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,488
This is crazy.

3099
02:25:57,489 --> 02:25:58,959
It's an unlimited fight.

3100
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:00,289
We need to prepare multiple options.

3101
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:01,290
You're right.

3102
02:26:01,291 --> 02:26:03,629
- This is too tough. - It really is.

3103
02:26:03,959 --> 02:26:07,129
Why would one choose to have many rappers in one round?

3104
02:26:07,659 --> 02:26:09,199
When many rappers participate,

3105
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:12,069
- they might show good teamwork. - The teamwork.

3106
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:14,968
Teamwork is vital for this match.

3107
02:26:14,969 --> 02:26:17,039
There's an order of which rapper would rap first.

3108
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:19,708
But what would the others do?

3109
02:26:19,709 --> 02:26:21,279
This is important.

3110
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,949
After eight rounds are over,

3111
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:28,148
the rappers who didn't participate in the match...

3112
02:26:28,149 --> 02:26:32,289
will vote the block who performed better.

3113
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:35,860
The winner will be decided with this vote.

3114
02:26:36,229 --> 02:26:37,260
- I see. - Okay.

3115
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:40,299
The block that wins this match...

3116
02:26:40,659 --> 02:26:42,629
will have all their members survive...

3117
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:46,370
and earn 20,000 dollars as their Block Money.

3118
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:49,940
Okay.

3119
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:53,440
The block that loses this match,

3120
02:26:56,079 --> 02:26:59,319
everyone including the leader...

3121
02:27:00,579 --> 02:27:03,290
- Elimination? - will go through a deathmatch.

3122
02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:06,399
- Including the leader? - It's including the leader.

3123
02:27:06,889 --> 02:27:09,190
My goodness. I got goosebumps. What should we do?

3124
02:27:10,659 --> 02:27:12,299
- This is too much. - I got goosebumps.

3125
02:27:14,459 --> 02:27:15,459
The whole block?

3126
02:27:15,969 --> 02:27:18,398
I don't want to do the deathmatch again.

3127
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:19,746
But the leader doesn't get eliminated.

3128
02:27:19,770 --> 02:27:20,870
You were tricked.

3129
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,238
We'll be doomed if we lose this.

3130
02:27:27,239 --> 02:27:28,479
We just need to win.

3131
02:27:29,450 --> 02:27:30,810
Don't think like that. We can win.

3132
02:27:32,149 --> 02:27:33,750
I didn't show, but...

3133
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:37,620
Wait.

3134
02:27:38,719 --> 02:27:40,589
Now, we will decide...

3135
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:43,559
the matchups for the Block Competition.

3136
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:45,290
This is important.

3137
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:48,799
For the match opponent...

3138
02:27:50,569 --> 02:27:52,129
Will they follow the Block Money order?

3139
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:58,940
Block Five, which currently has the fewest members,

3140
02:27:59,139 --> 02:28:00,579
can be the first to choose.

3141
02:28:02,979 --> 02:28:05,249
I felt like we got a free cookie.

3142
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:06,280
Lucky.

3143
02:28:06,579 --> 02:28:08,479
It was very reasonable.

3144
02:28:08,850 --> 02:28:10,589
It was a great choice for me to move.

3145
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:12,219
As soon as we started...

3146
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:15,489
- It's great. - They're so lucky.

3147
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:19,899
However, the block chosen as the opponent will have the right...

3148
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:23,968
to decide whether they want to go first or second.

3149
02:28:23,969 --> 02:28:25,939
- This is nice too. - It is.

3150
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,099
- The chosen opponent? - Yes.

3151
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:29,708
For all the eight rounds?

3152
02:28:29,709 --> 02:28:31,239
- I think so. - Yes.

3153
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:32,539
Oh, okay.

3154
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:35,408
Block Five, after discussion,

3155
02:28:35,409 --> 02:28:37,350
choose your opponent,

3156
02:28:37,579 --> 02:28:40,520
and tell us the reason.

3157
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:42,350
Which block will they choose?

3158
02:28:42,719 --> 02:28:43,789
What if they choose us?

3159
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:45,049
I think they'll choose us.

3160
02:28:45,219 --> 02:28:46,818
We only have a few members.

3161
02:28:46,819 --> 02:28:48,790
They might choose us because of that.

3162
02:28:48,989 --> 02:28:49,989
Yes.

3163
02:28:50,059 --> 02:28:51,790
I'm considering two blocks.

3164
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:53,499
One on our right and one on our left.

3165
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,558
- Yes, right. - Right?

3166
02:28:54,559 --> 02:28:55,869
It makes us think like that.

3167
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:58,369
I'm not sure about Block Four.

3168
02:28:58,370 --> 02:28:59,810
- It's either from the sides. - Yes.

3169
02:29:00,469 --> 02:29:01,798
We should have a rematch.

3170
02:29:01,799 --> 02:29:02,969
- Of course. - We have to.

3171
02:29:03,569 --> 02:29:05,689
- Shall I say now? - Say that we will have a rematch.

3172
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:08,639
I think there are weak members in Block Four.

3173
02:29:08,809 --> 02:29:11,510
Honestly, two rappers there...

3174
02:29:11,579 --> 02:29:14,020
didn't rap since Mask Off.

3175
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:18,190
They will face a situation where they have to rap.

3176
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:21,090
We chose them because of that.

3177
02:29:21,219 --> 02:29:24,129
Block 5 will choose Block 4...

3178
02:29:25,129 --> 02:29:28,200
to have the Block Competition.

3179
02:29:30,370 --> 02:29:32,330
I'm actually relieved now that it's been decided.

3180
02:29:32,969 --> 02:29:36,309
We just chose an opponent that we could win.

3181
02:29:36,569 --> 02:29:38,010
We'll have fun beating you.

3182
02:29:40,209 --> 02:29:42,180
- He's reliable. - What was that?

3183
02:29:42,309 --> 02:29:43,609
We never discussed this.

3184
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:45,730
- We never discussed this. - We never discussed this.

3185
02:29:47,350 --> 02:29:48,519
Is it your personal thought?

3186
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:49,620
Good job.

3187
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:52,096
- This is the least I can do. - It's what the leader wants.

3188
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:54,218
(Match 1: Block 5 versus Block 4)

3189
02:29:54,219 --> 02:29:55,790
(Block Competition)

3190
02:29:56,829 --> 02:29:58,429
After Block 5, isn't it Block 7?

3191
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,799
- Is it our turn? - Yes.

3192
02:30:00,229 --> 02:30:01,535
Will they choose Block Two again?

3193
02:30:01,559 --> 02:30:02,629
Again? Block Two again?

3194
02:30:02,969 --> 02:30:05,469
I think Block Three will choose us.

3195
02:30:05,569 --> 02:30:07,270
I think so too.

3196
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:10,009
I hope they choose us. They're weak.

3197
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:11,010
I hope Block Three chooses us.

3198
02:30:11,011 --> 02:30:13,280
To talk about Block Three,

3199
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:15,040
they're a mess.

3200
02:30:15,579 --> 02:30:17,350
Their members changed.

3201
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:19,449
Their leader changed.

3202
02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:20,450
Nothing good can happen.

3203
02:30:21,319 --> 02:30:22,549
- I'll choose. - Yes, sir.

3204
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:26,658
We'll choose Block Six.

3205
02:30:26,659 --> 02:30:28,059
Yes!

3206
02:30:30,159 --> 02:30:31,790
- Nice. It's over. - Good!

3207
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:33,829
The reason why we chose Block Six is because...

3208
02:30:33,899 --> 02:30:38,629
there's one rapper that we want to recruit.

3209
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:40,799
- So... - I see.

3210
02:30:41,139 --> 02:30:43,610
Since there's one rapper that we want to recruit,

3211
02:30:43,639 --> 02:30:45,610
we want to have this match.

3212
02:30:45,809 --> 02:30:46,979
- I think it's SINCE. - Yes.

3213
02:30:47,479 --> 02:30:48,879
He's flirting with her.

3214
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:51,079
Block Six is nervous.

3215
02:30:51,909 --> 02:30:52,979
Isn't it me?

3216
02:30:53,879 --> 02:30:57,048
Block 3 is going to have a match with Block 6.

3217
02:30:57,049 --> 02:30:59,389
Reddy offered me to join.

3218
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:00,559
Roh Yun Ha made a heart.

3219
02:31:00,659 --> 02:31:01,659
Did she?

3220
02:31:03,389 --> 02:31:04,760
My feeling? I felt very bad.

3221
02:31:05,059 --> 02:31:06,559
We went through a lot to recruit her.

3222
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:08,628
So I really wanted to win.

3223
02:31:08,629 --> 02:31:11,129
I thought about winning even more.

3224
02:31:12,170 --> 02:31:14,298
(Match 2: Block 6 versus Block 3)

3225
02:31:14,299 --> 02:31:15,969
(Block Competition)

3226
02:31:16,069 --> 02:31:17,638
Blocks 1 and 2 will have a match automatically.

3227
02:31:17,639 --> 02:31:18,969
Gosh. Blocks 1 and 2.

3228
02:31:19,579 --> 02:31:21,040
I think we're confirmed.

3229
02:31:21,479 --> 02:31:22,709
My goodness.

3230
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:25,780
Why, of all Blocks?

3231
02:31:26,149 --> 02:31:29,048
JTONG will have a match with his previous teammates.

3232
02:31:29,049 --> 02:31:30,090
JTONG derby.

3233
02:31:30,219 --> 02:31:31,719
It's JTONG derby.

3234
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:32,959
This is how it's going to be?

3235
02:31:33,159 --> 02:31:35,520
What kind of twist of fate is this?

3236
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:38,790
I feel like fighting my own people.

3237
02:31:39,459 --> 02:31:40,629
This is difficult.

3238
02:31:41,159 --> 02:31:42,159
JTONG.

3239
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:47,040
We'll make you regret it.

3240
02:31:48,569 --> 02:31:49,569
JTONG.

3241
02:31:49,639 --> 02:31:50,809
Traitor-TONG.

3242
02:31:54,909 --> 02:31:55,979
"Traitor-TONG."

3243
02:31:56,209 --> 02:31:57,309
JTONG.

3244
02:31:57,709 --> 02:31:59,250
We'll make you not regret it.

3245
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:03,548
- This is good. - Nice!

3246
02:32:03,549 --> 02:32:04,690
It's scary.

3247
02:32:04,819 --> 02:32:06,779
Blocks 1 and 2 were going to have a match anyway.

3248
02:32:06,959 --> 02:32:09,590
I must make JTONG regret this.

3249
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:12,180
He moved because he thought Block Two was a stronger team.

3250
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,360
It hurt my pride.

3251
02:32:15,559 --> 02:32:17,128
It's not about beating Block Two...

3252
02:32:17,129 --> 02:32:18,399
but beating JTONG.

3253
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:20,869
(Match 3: Block 2 versus Block 1)

3254
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:22,340
(Block Competition)

3255
02:32:22,399 --> 02:32:24,110
The third Block Match,

3256
02:32:24,409 --> 02:32:26,809
Block Competition is starting now.

3257
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:29,079
I have nothing to say to the opponent.

3258
02:32:30,579 --> 02:32:33,850
Welcome to the Block Two compilation Album concert.

3259
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:36,119
- You're so cool! - Let's go.

3260
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,649
I have nothing to say to Block Two as well.

3261
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:40,389
"Save the Green Planet." JTONG.

3262
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:43,360
You were busy picking up trash.

3263
02:32:43,729 --> 02:32:45,129
You picked up a lot.

3264
02:32:52,639 --> 02:32:55,639
Yesterday's friend is today's enemy.

3265
02:32:55,770 --> 02:32:57,510
JTONG, goodbye.

3266
02:32:58,409 --> 02:32:59,440
Let's go.

3267
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:03,509
Is he going to rap?

3268
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:05,378
I'm Polodared. You jerks.

3269
02:33:05,379 --> 02:33:07,250
(I'm Polodared.)

3270
02:33:07,479 --> 02:33:09,020
- Yes! - Yes.

3271
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,859
- Okay. - You're good!

3272
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:14,059
What? How did he do that?

3273
02:33:14,889 --> 02:33:16,628
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3274
02:33:16,629 --> 02:33:18,289
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3275
02:33:18,290 --> 02:33:19,898
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3276
02:33:19,899 --> 02:33:21,628
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3277
02:33:21,629 --> 02:33:23,199
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3278
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,328
Who wants to fight us?

3279
02:33:24,329 --> 02:33:26,638
- How is he moving like that? - Who wants to fight us?

3280
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:28,270
- Who wants to fight us? - What?

3281
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:30,908
Be careful, you'll get caught

3282
02:33:30,909 --> 02:33:33,478
But I'm too cool for school, so every day is Saturday

3283
02:33:33,479 --> 02:33:34,978
My life is blessed

3284
02:33:34,979 --> 02:33:36,648
My bank account is playing with zeros like football

3285
02:33:36,649 --> 02:33:38,279
I'm so busy

3286
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:40,379
You're in hot water now

3287
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:42,548
I show off in my neighborhood, Bomnae

3288
02:33:42,549 --> 02:33:43,648
You're scared

3289
02:33:43,649 --> 02:33:45,089
The more you do that, the more I scold you

3290
02:33:45,090 --> 02:33:46,718
- You can't mimic it - Nice!

3291
02:33:46,719 --> 02:33:48,359
Sam Bong is annoying

3292
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,888
Sam Bong grew up a lot

3293
02:33:49,889 --> 02:33:51,589
Girls send me DMs

3294
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:53,328
Boys send me jealousy

3295
02:33:53,329 --> 02:33:54,429
Yes

3296
02:33:54,430 --> 02:33:56,128
- Who wants to fight Tobii? - I don't want to

3297
02:33:56,129 --> 02:33:57,769
- Who wants to fight Foggy? - I don't want to

3298
02:33:57,770 --> 02:33:59,398
- Who wants to fight Loopy? - I don't want to

3299
02:33:59,399 --> 02:34:01,068
- Who wants to fight XWALLY? - I don't want to

3300
02:34:01,069 --> 02:34:02,669
- Who wants to fight KHAN? - I don't want to

3301
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:03,670
Who wants to fight Nosun?

3302
02:34:03,671 --> 02:34:05,639
- I don't want to - But I don't know this jerk

3303
02:34:05,770 --> 02:34:07,309
Who wants to fight JTONG?

3304
02:34:08,579 --> 02:34:09,749
Oh, shoot.

3305
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:11,409
Who wants to fight?

3306
02:34:15,479 --> 02:34:17,119
- He's kind. - A gentleman.

3307
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:18,849
- Yes. - Mother, father, gentleman

3308
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:20,360
- Let's do this. Let's go. - Okay.

3309
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:21,690
Give me that beat.

3310
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:25,328
- Link up with the plug, hello - Hello

3311
02:34:25,329 --> 02:34:28,059
- I can't go out, I got no visa - He's good.

3312
02:34:28,799 --> 02:34:31,628
I can't date girls easily, come on

3313
02:34:31,629 --> 02:34:32,840
Darn it

3314
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:35,340
Expensive meal

3315
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:36,968
Nun on my wrist

3316
02:34:36,969 --> 02:34:39,109
Holly is trying to take my piece

3317
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:40,509
- I am no fuss - He's cool.

3318
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:42,609
I'm a darn goofy witch

3319
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:46,180
I'm going to tour on a tourist buddy business

3320
02:34:48,219 --> 02:34:49,589
Counting blue benjamins

3321
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:51,048
If you're confident try it, please, Try me

3322
02:34:51,049 --> 02:34:52,988
I'll make sure you can't lift your head again

3323
02:34:52,989 --> 02:34:54,589
I'm confused when I hear you rap

3324
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:56,529
You're not blood-related but it's like decalcomania

3325
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:58,089
I'm different from you

3326
02:34:58,090 --> 02:35:00,128
I was born different

3327
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:01,728
You all meet up frequently

3328
02:35:01,729 --> 02:35:03,568
In reality, you're always in your room doing nasty

3329
02:35:03,569 --> 02:35:04,929
We keep going

3330
02:35:04,930 --> 02:35:06,769
ShyboiiTobii and I

3331
02:35:06,770 --> 02:35:08,499
Even if you count on everything, you won't be able to make it

3332
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:10,208
We always lay low while moving

3333
02:35:10,209 --> 02:35:12,009
Money is always sweet like candy

3334
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:13,738
When I chase money like I'm Django

3335
02:35:13,739 --> 02:35:15,439
You know I started with bare hands

3336
02:35:15,440 --> 02:35:17,779
In my game, I'm always the main boss

3337
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:19,308
For a long time

3338
02:35:19,309 --> 02:35:21,419
I endured my time underground

3339
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:22,849
A hungry appetite with potential

3340
02:35:22,850 --> 02:35:25,089
But always runs out of food

3341
02:35:25,090 --> 02:35:26,419
Full of vigor and energy

3342
02:35:26,420 --> 02:35:28,658
Like a strong young person

3343
02:35:28,659 --> 02:35:30,789
Growing rapidly with high energy

3344
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:32,089
Like mushrooms sprouting

3345
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:33,828
Life is just a continuous repetition

3346
02:35:33,829 --> 02:35:35,558
Of the same days

3347
02:35:35,559 --> 02:35:36,869
I thank the Almighty

3348
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:39,169
Reflect and seek enlightenment

3349
02:35:39,170 --> 02:35:40,439
Bend the back that was once straight

3350
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,708
Under the vast sky, be humble

3351
02:35:42,709 --> 02:35:44,238
Be prepared in time

3352
02:35:44,239 --> 02:35:45,940
For a journey to devote your entire life

3353
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:47,978
Two stone

3354
02:35:47,979 --> 02:35:49,749
Baby, I don't know

3355
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:50,978
I'm the person who always throws a fist

3356
02:35:50,979 --> 02:35:52,979
Even when I lose at rock-paper-scissors

3357
02:35:54,579 --> 02:35:56,749
Get it, hit it, call me

3358
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:58,619
Hit a bullet on his

3359
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:00,318
Mother freaking dome

3360
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:02,760
- Bring it on. - Foggy!

3361
02:36:03,329 --> 02:36:04,530
It's so scary.

3362
02:36:04,729 --> 02:36:05,989
Fight!

3363
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:08,200
- Bad manners! - Bad manners.

3364
02:36:08,430 --> 02:36:11,230
(The match between Blocks 1 and 2 is getting fiercer over each round.)

3365
02:36:11,299 --> 02:36:13,100
(JTONG was ours, but you can have him.)

3366
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:14,500
(This is real hip-hop.)

3367
02:36:17,510 --> 02:36:21,239
(Block Competition is a battle of pride. Who will win?)

3368
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:24,909
(Here's the result of the match between Block 1 and Block 2.)

3369
02:36:25,010 --> 02:36:26,250
Whoever wins,

3370
02:36:26,450 --> 02:36:27,920
it wouldn't be surprising.

3371
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:30,290
(Last time in the battle, you caused a scene.)

3372
02:36:31,350 --> 02:36:32,420
- My gosh. - My goodness.

3373
02:36:32,489 --> 02:36:33,958
(- What? - I can't watch this!)

3374
02:36:33,959 --> 02:36:36,489
You don't realize in this darkness

3375
02:36:36,690 --> 02:36:37,729
Liberty of dissing

3376
02:36:38,459 --> 02:36:42,559
(The competition between the blocks has become even intenser.)

3377
02:36:42,729 --> 02:36:44,770
- Again, let's go - Again, let's go

3378
02:36:45,229 --> 02:36:48,568
(The spine-chilling performance of united rappers as a team)

3379
02:36:48,569 --> 02:36:50,540
(I got goosebumps.)

3380
02:36:50,709 --> 02:36:51,709
(Block Competition)

3381
02:36:52,139 --> 02:36:56,250
(RAP: PUBLIC's intensity is gradually rising.)

3382
02:36:56,379 --> 02:36:57,908
- This is my energy - Energy

3383
02:36:57,909 --> 02:36:59,208
(How does it feel to lose to someone with a high school diploma?)

3384
02:36:59,209 --> 02:37:00,419
(Are you okay? Can you do this?)

3385
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:02,988
(A one-sided love line sent by Geegooin)

3386
02:37:02,989 --> 02:37:05,449
(If you want to flirt with SINCE, win the battle first)

3387
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:06,619
(Double Down)

3388
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:08,058
(He's fast)

3389
02:37:08,059 --> 02:37:09,930
(Jo Gwang Il)

3390
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:11,929
(Everyone in the block that lost, )

3391
02:37:11,930 --> 02:37:15,430
(including the leader, )

3392
02:37:15,559 --> 02:37:17,530
(It's too much that even the leader is included.)

3393
02:37:17,629 --> 02:37:19,228
(will join the deathmatch.)

3394
02:37:19,229 --> 02:37:21,539
(Can't the leader use the elimination exemption card?)

3395
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:23,209
(Seriously...)

3396
02:37:24,209 --> 02:37:26,408
(According to the result of the deathmatch, )

3397
02:37:26,409 --> 02:37:29,239
(everyone of a block may survive.)

3398
02:37:29,549 --> 02:37:31,408
(We won't lose anyway.)

3399
02:37:31,409 --> 02:37:32,780
(I should never make a mistake.)

3400
02:37:32,979 --> 02:37:35,426
(The third Block Match is vital for the survival of the entire block.)

3401
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:37,489
(How will the Block Competition turn out?)
