1
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,660
(RAP: PUBLIC)

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,928
(Now, )

3
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,459
(the third Block Match will begin.)

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,370
(Block Competition, Match 1: Block 6 versus Block 3)

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,940
(Block 6 showed the spirits with no hesitation.)

6
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,339
He's fast. He's surely fast.

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,868
- Block Six - Aka

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,409
- That's my - Aka

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,750
(Then followed the performance of Block 3's HAON and Yang Kyle.)

10
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,478
You'll die if you block my way

11
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,218
(Block 3 used the new diss lyrics to give an impactful performance.)

12
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,319
(The block that won is...)

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,618
(Block 3.)

14
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,218
(MVP Yang Kyle.)

15
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,959
(We finally tasted true victory.)

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,529
(But I was again at the risk of being eliminated.)

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,429
(Block Competition, Match 2: Block 5 versus Block 4)

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,929
(Block 5 showed unrivaled rap skills.)

19
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,069
(My gosh, they're fighting.)

20
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:10,510
(Block 4 showed an intense performance.)

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,108
(The winning block is...)

22
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,150
(Block 4.)

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,619
Oh, my goodness.

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,848
(Fortunately, we won't need to do the deathmatch.)

25
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,919
(I was very annoyed.)

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,958
(Block Competition, Match 3: Block 2 versus Block 1)

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,260
(The big match of Block Competition was JTONG versus ShyboiiTobii.)

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,459
(What's with ShyboiiTobii?)

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,659
(The match was so fierce that they got close to a fistfight.)

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,629
(Block 2 made an unexpected mistake.)

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
(Thanks to Polodared's remarkable performance, )

32
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,769
(Block 1's teamwork shined.)

33
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,608
Shut it

34
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,479
Forget it, it's time

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,539
It's game over

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,048
(The winning block...)

37
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,749
(is Block 1.)

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,920
- Thanks for your efforts. - You're welcome.

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,489
(My mind was in turmoil.)

40
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,719
The winning blocks of the third Block Match...

41
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,790
will receive 20,000 dollars of Block Money.

42
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,699
Yes.

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,129
We're the winning team in terms of Block Money.

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,629
(Whipping)

45
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,938
(Current Block Money Ranking)

46
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,710
(1. Block 1:43,000 dollars)

47
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,340
As for the defeated blocks, everyone including the leader...

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,879
Including the leader?

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,279
Will go through a deathmatch.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,349
(Sighing)

51
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,089
Defeated blocks, please return to the Village...

52
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,519
and prepare for the deathmatch.

53
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,918
Let's go. Hurry!

54
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,490
- My heart is becoming hot. - Let's go.

55
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,329
- Okay! Let's go! - Good luck.

56
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,128
- Good luck. - Let's go.

57
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,229
- Okay. - Let's go.

58
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,369
Hey, TSP! Loopy! JTONG!

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,300
- Good luck. - Let's go.

60
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,239
Give us more strength.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,770
- Let's go. - Let's go.

62
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,009
Show everyone.

63
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,339
This is so hard.

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,509
- Good luck. - Come on.

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,418
We won.

66
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,149
- We won. - We won.

67
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,759
(Block 3 members cheer upon spotting something.)

68
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,429
Oh, my goodness.

69
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,729
(The reward for victory is Jack Daniel's.)

70
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,560
- We won. - It's party time.

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,669
I missed you, Jack Daniel's.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,669
(Cheering)

73
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,810
It was my first time thinking, "So this is how it feels."

74
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,809
It was a festival.

75
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,340
It was our first time to avoid the deathmatch.

76
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,878
- Is it okay to be this happy? - Yes! It's totally okay!

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,750
Right? It's so nice.

78
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,149
Everyone worked hard today.

79
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,590
Let's have a good result next time as well.

80
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,119
Jack Daniel's tastes like victory.

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,020
Gosh, that's right.

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,990
I felt so happy. I felt so relieved.

83
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,329
Since we won the Block Competition, shall we drink Jack Daniel?

84
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,530
What did you say just now?

85
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,068
- Jack Daniel? - Yes.

86
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,098
- Who is he? - Don Mills.

87
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,038
- Is he Don Mill? - Right.

88
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,369
- He's Don Mills. - Right.

89
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,168
- I'm Don Mills, not Don Mill. - Jack Daniel?

90
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,339
- It's Jack Daniel's. - Okay.

91
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,579
- Understood? - Jack Daniel's.

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,110
What should we say now?

93
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,810
(Confused)

94
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,218
"Cheer?" No. Say, "Cheers."

95
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,289
(They happily savor the victory.)

96
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,589
- They made thorough preparations. - That's right.

97
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,589
Our block lost.

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,960
We ended up going to the deathmatch.

99
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,429
Let's think of it as a new match, not the deathmatch.

100
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,198
This deathmatch is like...

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,500
the mini-version of the Block Competition.

102
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,569
The format of this deathmatch is Performance Match.

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,779
Performance?

104
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,609
The defeated blocks will participate in the deathmatch.

105
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,609
All block members will participate.

106
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,850
Each block will perform as a group for the Performance Match.

107
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,350
(Block 5)

108
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,559
You know, we need to work together.

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,919
During the Block Competition,

110
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,688
we watched the winning blocks' performances.

111
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,300
It gave us an idea of what we needed to do to win.

112
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,828
According to the result of the deathmatch, one block...

113
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,870
may survive all together.

114
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,670
I see.

115
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,109
All the rest are getting eliminated?

116
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,339
That's terrible.

117
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,309
As for the block that places second,

118
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,810
one out of three elimination candidates will survive.

119
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,349
One out of three will survive.

120
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,119
As for the block that places third,

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,920
all three elimination candidates will be sent home.

122
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:18,719
Five people will be sent home.

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,328
We need to create a good performance as a team...

124
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,729
and prepare well...

125
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,059
so that no one will be eliminated.

126
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,599
Let's win in the all-member deathmatch.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,729
The second match had begun for us.

128
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,338
I thought, "Let's make it thorough preparations."

129
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,810
"Let's overcome this crisis well."

130
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,810
It's a bit disappointing.

131
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,148
I'm not saying that I don't admit defeat. I do.

132
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,979
Of course, we admit defeat.

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,289
We face a crisis every other day.

134
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,420
To be honest, it was hard to keep myself strong.

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,789
It can't be helped.

136
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,829
I accept what happened. I have no regrets.

137
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,659
As soon as I became the leader,

138
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,799
the block entered the deathmatch.

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,839
The only thing that was on my mind was, "This isn't easy."

140
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,310
I felt so down because of that.

141
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,409
You need to pull yourself together.

142
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,008
This block had always done well.

143
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,750
But it lost as soon as I became the leader.

144
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,279
- It's annoying. - It's okay.

145
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,680
It weighed heavily on my mind...

146
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:23,519
because I felt like I gave OSUN this ordeal.

147
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,759
Listen.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,930
In any case, we need to have a discussion right now.

149
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,959
I need to decide on the candidates.

150
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,800
- The elimination candidates? - Yes.

151
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,970
(Right after losing the Block Competition)

152
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,169
(The leaders of Bocks 2, 5, and 6, who are entering the deathmatch, )

153
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,779
(please pick 3 elimination candidates each.)

154
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,750
I thought really hard. I thought nonstop. Seriously.

155
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,279
- Three elimination candidates? - Yes. I need to choose three.

156
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,319
You should do what you want.

157
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,519
Do you want me to choose? We should discuss the matter.

158
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,828
I want to discuss the matter...

159
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:04,128
because I won't get eliminated anyway.

160
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,399
But in any case...

161
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,729
(Sighing)

162
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,799
I don't want to burden OSUN so much.

163
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,169
OSUN just became the leader,

164
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,970
so he wouldn't be able to choose with his preferences.

165
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,439
I'll be it.

166
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,250
I'll feel more comfortable if I'm it.

167
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,979
If we win, it'll be nice.

168
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,420
If we lose, it's okay if I get eliminated.

169
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,519
I'm the one who gathered the Block Five members.

170
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,518
Even though I'm not the leader,

171
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,790
I continue to feel a sense of responsibility.

172
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,958
I can also be it even though I joined the block late.

173
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,529
Still, I depended on the block a lot...

174
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,600
during my short time as a member.

175
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,639
In that situation, I couldn't bring myself to say,

176
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,810
"I want to survive."

177
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,639
That was why I asked OSUN to make me an elimination candidate.

178
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,709
I can be it too.

179
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,448
You feel the same in any case, right?

180
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,920
- Yes. - Okay. Then give it a go.

181
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,349
I think this is right...

182
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,490
because Hash Swan went to the deathmatch once.

183
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,888
Choosing is inevitable...

184
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,920
because there are only a few members in the block.

185
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,060
To be honest, I was stressed out in that situation.

186
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,599
The talented rappers offered...

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,969
to become the elimination candidates first.

188
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,268
I feel like I brought this destiny to the block,

189
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,610
so I'm apologetic.

190
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,109
I'm really relieved that it won't be a one-man performance.

191
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,208
That's right.

192
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:31,518
Let's gather the killer verses.

193
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,450
I was glad that it wasn't an individual deathmatch.

194
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:35,919
And it isn't over yet.

195
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,819
In terms of the order, I think JP should go last.

196
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,090
JP should go last.

197
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,529
I'll spit out some words for the intro and do a verse.

198
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,329
Owen and JP took on important tasks.

199
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,139
One got the intro, and the other got the outro.

200
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,668
Shall we give it a go then?

201
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,439
I got something to get off my chest.

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
I'm a chess piece, but I say it proudly. Let's go.

203
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,610
It begins right away.

204
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,979
Maybe you should...

205
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,079
Defining wrong and right

206
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,990
What? I need to enter during the scratching sound.

207
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,689
Owen had to begin his verse...

208
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,529
as soon as the beat dropped.

209
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,428
Defining wrong and right in this hateful era

210
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,469
(Owen continues to make mistakes with the intro.)

211
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,600
I used to shine brightly, the steps I took for my goal

212
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,570
As I prepared for the performance, one part of me...

213
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,439
was worried.

214
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,778
Here's what I think. This performance feels like...

215
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,609
- a protest. - Right.

216
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,648
- Take off and throw the block mark. - All right.

217
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,048
When you look at the camera...

218
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,479
and go, "With my pack,"

219
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,879
we'll throw it together for a cool effect.

220
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,659
We're planning the performance like the last revolution.

221
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,489
It'll be simple and cool.

222
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,428
At the same time, we'll show an adequate amount of anger.

223
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,960
That was the idea.

224
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,859
Let's keep practicing.

225
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,398
- Okay. Let's keep practicing. - I got something...

226
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,928
to get off my chest.

227
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,129
Whatever. Let's go.

228
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,298
(An alarm sounds for choosing the elimination candidates.)

229
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,939
- That startled me. - The leader of Block Five, OSUN,

230
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,638
- Go ahead. - please go to the Choice Block.

231
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,440
- Go ahead. - Go. Don't keep your heart heavy.

232
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,250
OSUN, you know what to do.

233
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,678
In any case, he'll choose three.

234
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,548
- I guess he feels bad. - You know...

235
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,549
You never know.

236
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,990
Now that...

237
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,019
it was time to choose,

238
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,690
I just wanted to go home.

239
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:27,570
(OSUN seems torn before choosing the elimination candidates.)

240
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,700
I didn't become the leader for this.

241
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,138
That's right. It's hard to be the leader.

242
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,139
Being a leader isn't always easy.

243
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,409
I wanted to become the new leader...

244
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,909
and bring out the potential of this block.

245
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,220
It didn't go as I had planned,

246
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,919
so I was a bit frustrated.

247
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,518
(Block 6)

248
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,329
When we lost the Block Competition,

249
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,428
I could feel that I was completely drained...

250
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,129
of the energy and such that would help me fight on.

251
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,139
The deathmatch remained,

252
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,768
but I kept thinking, "This is enough. I should go home."

253
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,768
Kaogaii, where's your spirit?

254
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,769
My spirit?

255
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,879
- My spirit? - You must pull yourself together.

256
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,350
Compete with desperation.

257
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,908
- Let's go. - SINCE and I came here for you.

258
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,148
- That's right. Darn. - Okay.

259
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,149
This nonsense happened as soon as I joined the block.

260
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,649
I'm sorry. I'm quite exhausted.

261
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,018
I could handle physical exhaustion.

262
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,028
But mental exhaustion hit,

263
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,259
and I was out of my head.

264
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,928
Since I was the leader,

265
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,199
I told myself, "Keep going. You can do it."

266
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,999
Hold on. Let me just say this.

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,329
Upon coming here,

268
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,869
I learned that your spirit was all that matters.

269
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,069
- That's right. It's the spirit. - You know what I mean, right?

270
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,638
- There's nothing else. - There's nothing else.

271
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,710
This is SPIRIT: PUBLIC.

272
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,138
If your spirit gets knocked down,

273
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,080
it's easy to collapse. It's the same for me.

274
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,918
As for Geegooin,

275
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,079
he stuttered today.

276
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,089
I felt bad because I messed up.

277
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,388
I could tell that he felt apologetic as if he had committed a crime.

278
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,460
Let me say a few words.

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,058
- It's okay to win or lose. - That's right.

280
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,258
It was our first loss, to be honest.

281
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,999
- You're right. - Let's admit defeat...

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,629
and plan an insane performance for the deathmatch.

283
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,138
We lost in the main match.

284
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,370
We need to figure out why we lost.

285
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,369
We lacked composition and discipline.

286
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,609
We watched...

287
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,878
the winning blocks' performances.

288
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,979
After we're done, people should go, "Gosh,"

289
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,148
"have those eight members always been a team?"

290
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,249
I want us to be organized.

291
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,449
- We must do that. Seriously. - We must plan and follow through.

292
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,489
We must plan the performance.

293
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,249
I always did this as Rhythm Power.

294
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,419
- Really? - I always planned performances.

295
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,490
- Show us the power of Rhythm Power. - In any case...

296
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,859
How about this?

297
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,329
The hook can be similar to what Polodared did.

298
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,558
There's an airplane in the sky Something like that.

299
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,869
That's a good idea. People know the melody already,

300
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,469
so they can sing along easily.

301
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,109
How about this one? Don't go home, baby

302
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,409
We still have some verses left

303
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:53,409
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

304
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,110
Okay. This is nice. It's nice for sure.

305
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,579
It's nice, right?

306
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,918
Everyone was exhausted. We forced ourselves to say,

307
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,119
"Let's do this." Suddenly, Geegooin went...

308
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,819
Don't go home, baby The moment he did that...

309
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,419
- We got this. - Let's go.

310
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,059
We're set. This is how it should be.

311
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,959
I'm in the best condition right now.

312
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,959
- We have the best spirit right now. - Suddenly, this became fun.

313
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,700
Hey, this was the color of our block.

314
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,398
We can make a dance with a kick.

315
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,099
We can make a train on the stage.

316
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,908
- Good. - Let's use add those elements...

317
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,038
in moderation...

318
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,308
and show our rapping skills.

319
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,339
That's great, Geegooin.

320
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,678
I voice my opinions a lot. I shared my ideas a lot.

321
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,709
During my time as a member of Rhythm Power,

322
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,219
I accumulated fun stage manners and know-how.

323
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,450
It's so nice.

324
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
Geegooin went back to being the doctor.

325
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,289
Professor.

326
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:40,089
- Hey, I'm back. - He's back.

327
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,959
He was down earlier because he stuttered the lyrics.

328
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,759
He had a mental breakdown.

329
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,658
He didn't even apologize to me.

330
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,569
He talked to himself. "I'm sorry."

331
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,269
I was like, "Geegooin, stop. Come to your senses."

332
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,240
- Let's add it. - I love it.

333
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,168
(Block 6 members practice to become 1.)

334
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,339
Get up

335
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,979
- All right. - That's good. That's so cool.

336
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,249
The vibe should be a life or death situation.

337
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,179
We're showing everything we have before we go home.

338
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,480
I was desperate. In any case, it's my goal...

339
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,690
to have this system hold out until the next turn.

340
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,090
As for the elimination candidates...

341
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,690
It couldn't be helped.

342
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,418
I'm usually the type to choose them as I want.

343
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,129
But at this point, I'm too emotionally affected.

344
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,699
I told him frankly.

345
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,928
In any case,

346
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,268
you've only proven yourself once.

347
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,628
I understand.

348
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,570
Keep showing us what you can do. Keep up the spirit.

349
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,668
The final members in my head are...

350
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,109
me, Geegooin...

351
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,369
I have to include Geegooin.

352
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,808
He has worked so hard. He has done so well.

353
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,079
He just made a slight mistake today.

354
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,648
Mckdaddy, SINCE, and you.

355
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,878
But let's say I choose Jo Gwang Il as an elimination candidate.

356
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,778
- It makes no sense. - It makes no sense, right?

357
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,689
So I'll choose O'Domar, JOONIE, you.

358
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,690
But if we place second, I'll save you.

359
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,960
Thus, I picked the three elimination candidates.

360
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:54,029
I choose O'Domar, JOONIE, and Kohway as elimination candidates.

361
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,629
Let me tell you this.

362
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't think we'll lose.

363
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,269
So don't worry about the elimination candidates.

364
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,638
- If we lose... - We just need to win.

365
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,710
Think that everyone will be out if we don't place first.

366
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,580
I'm not worried because the preparation was fun.

367
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,479
"Let's have a lot of fun."

368
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,509
"This is like a concert."

369
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,309
- One, two, three. Let's go. - All right.

370
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950
(Block 2)

371
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,179
The deathmatch is so nice.

372
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,950
This is fun.

373
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,149
There will be music.

374
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,589
We won't need to contend against the fellow block members.

375
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,590
It isn't half bad.

376
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,389
- Seriously. - This is romance.

377
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,158
That's right.

378
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,428
I think the hook is the most important.

379
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,129
It's a matter of how well we can seize the atmosphere.

380
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,729
Since things have come to this,

381
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,268
I decided to think of it as a good opportunity to perform.

382
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,638
I made a lot of effort...

383
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,870
to stay positively.

384
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,308
- Let's go. All right. - We either go home together...

385
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,908
or survive together, okay?

386
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,519
(Unlike the block members, Loopy looks depressed.)

387
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,449
Loopy, come on. Don't be like that.

388
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,489
Don't get dejected.

389
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,620
Forget everything.

390
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,888
Loopy's shoulders...

391
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:54,120
were quite hunched.

392
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,330
Even the bunny ears...

393
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,330
of his beanie drooped to show his depressed state.

394
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,070
He seemed to be down.

395
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,269
Gosh.

396
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,940
Loopy, we're at an advantage.

397
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,679
We're at an advantage.

398
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,449
I don't know. I'm completely lost...

399
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,549
after ruining the performance.

400
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,679
I thought to myself, "What am I doing? What's this?"

401
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,830
(Suddenly, Loopy begins to change into new clothes.)

402
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,129
Were you asked to pack up?

403
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,960
No, I'm just changing.

404
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,600
I need to wear fresh clothes.

405
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,139
I'm making an effort to change the vibe.

406
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,580
(Block 2 listens to the beat to prepare for the deathmatch.)

407
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,839
I can rap to it.

408
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,679
I can nail the performance.

409
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,350
I can rap to it too.

410
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,720
Do you have a hook?

411
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,449
Taking my time traveling, not done yet

412
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,589
Even when there's nothing, I got back to you

413
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,889
It's great as a hook.

414
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,159
"The whole squad, not well-established."

415
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,400
It means that our block has the best teamwork now.

416
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,730
To be honest, I need to borrow a hook from ShyboiiTobii.

417
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,099
Let's do this.

418
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,000
Listening to ShyboiiTobii's hook made me go, "We got this."

419
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,410
I was certain that we wouldn't lose.

420
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:18,140
I thought, "We'll definitely survive."

421
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,710
I had no courage to take the stage.

422
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,279
It was hard for me to focus on practice.

423
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,689
Here's what I personally think.

424
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,889
I personally think the young punks should take...

425
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,319
the stage.

426
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,058
I want to take responsibility.

427
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,059
To be honest, we pushed all responsibility to Loopy.

428
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,130
I want Loopy to relax just once.

429
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,099
That's my opinion.

430
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,869
I understand.

431
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,008
I want to give Loopy some time to rest.

432
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,639
He was under so much pressure,

433
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,308
so it was time for the young ones to help out.

434
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:55,209
(Block 2 begins practicing in earnest.)

435
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,278
I'll be brand new, I'll take charge and abuse you

436
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,848
Push it aside

437
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:02,589
(Loopy suddenly leaves the room during practice.)

438
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,058
Everyone was having fun with practice,

439
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,460
but the upbeat song sounded sad in my ears.

440
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,859
I felt sorry and grateful.

441
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:16,829
Those emotions...

442
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,640
Here's what I want to do.

443
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,799
The stage is at the center, right?

444
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,139
Let's stand on the outline...

445
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,539
and face the audience members.

446
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,008
- I want to throw something. - Like what?

447
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,420
If you want to take us to victory, you should do this.

448
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,819
Can you rip off your T-shirt?

449
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,920
- I can do it. - Yes. Let's go.

450
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,758
Our performance is so much fun.

451
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,759
- Loopy. - Yes?

452
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,588
- Can you do the call for the beat? - You should do that.

453
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,629
- Okay. - Yes.

454
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,829
I'll think of something.

455
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,970
"Someone save the younger members!"

456
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,298
"Come back home!"

457
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,068
(Distributing the tasks precisely lifted up Block 2's spirits.)

458
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,409
- All right. - Go.

459
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,709
Members of this block are very tight...

460
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,809
and willing to sacrifice themselves.

461
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,079
Looking at their loyalty...

462
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,420
gave me many thoughts.

463
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,690
- Come back home - What? Take your trash

464
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,650
Hold on. Then...

465
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,920
We were practicing.

466
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,889
We talked by ourselves...

467
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,900
while Loopy wasn't around.

468
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:22,700
Shall we not include Loopy in the elimination candidates?

469
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,069
- No. - Don't include him.

470
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,508
I'm a bit torn about choosing...

471
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,838
the elimination candidates.

472
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,940
Choose me.

473
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,779
Loopy offered to be an elimination candidate.

474
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,880
I thought it was wrong.

475
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,749
I didn't do well today.

476
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,889
Don't say that. You've done well so far.

477
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,749
I said this to JTONG.

478
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,159
If anyone gives a performance that's bad or lacking,

479
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,259
he should be an elimination candidate.

480
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,828
I'm really sorry about saying this.

481
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:54,829
- It's okay. - I'll be it.

482
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,170
Why don't the three of us become the elimination candidates for him?

483
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
The three of you?

484
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,508
Ga Yeon and yukon left.

485
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,409
Nosun and we're the only ones who remain.

486
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,038
- That's right. - We're the younger members.

487
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,409
- All right. - I wish I could be included.

488
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,879
- I'll do my absolute best. - It's okay.

489
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Let's exclude Loopy.

490
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,349
Let's exclude Loopy. I think it's for the best.

491
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,419
Loopy has been considerate...

492
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,990
of us so far.

493
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,919
So I wanted other members to be elimination candidates.

494
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,258
Let's use this as a motivation...

495
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,829
to work harder.

496
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,659
Don't tell Loopy about the elimination candidates.

497
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,900
- Of course not. - Okay.

498
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,569
I didn't tell Loopy because he would've felt bad.

499
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:33,939
I know that we're going to win,

500
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,970
so I want it to be a surprise present.

501
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,210
Let's survive until the end.

502
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,710
We're the best.

503
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,078
I'm so glad that I joined this team.

504
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,779
It's finally time for me to shine. Now is the time.

505
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,118
All of us were certain.

506
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,348
We poured out all of our energy and passion.

507
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,619
We'll place first no matter what.

508
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,659
Soon, the deathmatch will begin.

509
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,200
- Let's go. - Let's go.

510
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,470
The defeated blocks members who are participating in the deathmatch,

511
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,869
please move to the arena.

512
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,440
Believe in yourself.

513
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,440
- One, two, three. Let's go. - Let's go.

514
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,109
Kaogaii, don't make a mistake.

515
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,880
Don't worry.

516
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,420
Good luck.

517
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,950
I'll cheer up.

518
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,819
JTONG, good luck.

519
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,819
- Root for me. - Of course.

520
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,490
Block Two, let's go.

521
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,190
- Let's go. - Okay.

522
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,789
- Let's get it. - Block Two, let's go.

523
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,660
Let's just go.

524
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,400
Let's create a cool performance we'll remember for years to come.

525
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,869
Let's burn up our energy.

526
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,539
Let's go.

527
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,868
I think we became even tighter as we prepared for this performance.

528
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,039
- That's right. - Let's kill our opponents.

529
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,950
In the third deathmatch,

530
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,150
each block's teamwork will be very important.

531
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,179
It's the Performance Match.

532
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,220
Let's enjoy ourselves.

533
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,618
Votes will be cast...

534
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,118
by the rappers of the blocks that won the Block Match.

535
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,729
After each block's performance,

536
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,099
they'll cast a vote if they think the block did well.

537
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,798
That's insane.

538
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,639
The result of the deathmatch...

539
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,240
will determine the survival of the elimination candidates.

540
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,069
This is cutthroat.

541
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,950
Now, the deathmatch will begin.

542
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:23,579
- Yes. - Let's go.

543
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,319
Let's go. The time has come.

544
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,650
- Let's go! - Let's go.

545
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,959
- Okay. - Good luck.

546
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Let's go.

547
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,130
Let's go.

548
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,699
Block Six members, please come up to the stage...

549
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,399
- and begin. - Good luck.

550
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,430
Let's go.

551
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,999
Yes.

552
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,169
I'm very excited. Let's have fun.

553
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,239
This is like our concert.

554
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Let's enjoy this performance.

555
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,608
Let's survive together.

556
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,940
I won't get eliminated. I'll win no matter what.

557
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,108
Although this is a deathmatch,

558
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,380
I prepared the performance with excitement...

559
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,019
instead of nervousness for the first time.

560
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:06,058
I hope you'll enjoy it with us.

561
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,960
Okay. Block Six, let's go.

562
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,799
Let's go.

563
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,400
Hey, everyone. We still have so many verses left.

564
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,639
We'll use up all of our verses before we leave, okay?

565
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,508
- Okay. - Okay.

566
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,568
You can't leave!

567
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,139
One, two, three, four.

568
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,679
- Don't go home, baby - Don't go home, baby

569
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,879
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

570
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,949
Okay, okay

571
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,949
- Don't go home today, baby - Don't go home today, baby

572
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,019
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

573
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,318
I want to skip school and play

574
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,129
I'll call over my friends and have a party

575
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,489
I don't care about anything

576
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,298
As long as it's fun because I'm like Cardi B

577
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,798
I don't play with children

578
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,399
- Only aces - Aces

579
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,669
Young, dumb, and broke

580
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,500
- Children's cases - Cases

581
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:53,538
Everybody has their own way

582
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:54,969
There are no answers, only differences

583
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,538
Everything will be beautiful in the eyes of the higher power

584
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:58,939
Black, white, and yellow, All mankind's struggle

585
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,578
Keep your own way of hustling

586
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:04,108
You wish your effort will pay off, but that might not happen in life

587
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,679
I feel bad for my father whenever I think about it

588
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,219
I had a bad stealing problem in elementary school

589
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,149
I stole 50 cents from the store and flexed with 50 dollars

590
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,959
Now, I see that what's yellow are the bills in my wallet

591
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,489
- I went from bottom to the top - You're the best!

592
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,258
It's better than the feeling of ecstasy

593
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,758
- Don't go home, baby - Don't go home, baby

594
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,129
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

595
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,199
Okay, okay

596
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,068
- Don't go home today, baby - Don't go home today, baby

597
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:27,239
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

598
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,808
Let's go, let's go

599
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,979
I worked when you guys played, I struggled when you guys slept

600
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,108
How was my mom supposed to know that I wasn't like a neighbor's kid?

601
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:38,219
While other kids got allowances and focused on Instagram

602
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,249
- I paid off my family's card debts - Go!

603
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,249
I don't stop or worry about falling while running

604
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,219
I put a checkmate on the habit of falling down

605
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,459
I cut ties with people who act big and give excuses

606
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,058
They're neck-and-neck They stutter when they rap honestly

607
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,558
Without any seriousness, they try to make money haphazardly

608
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,328
Just go and see the cherry blossoms with your girlfriend

609
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,329
Look at Mr. Mck

610
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,028
He looks comfortable as if he's eating a meal at home

611
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:58,298
I get sleepy while riding the rhythm and get arrested for drowsy driving

612
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,399
I dreamed when I was little, Now, my dream lies in money

613
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,469
- If it won't bring money, shut it - Shut it

614
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,939
- One, two, three, go - One, two, three, go

615
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,409
- Don't go home, baby - Don't go home, baby

616
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,778
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

617
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:10,848
- Let's go - Let's go

618
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:13,778
- Don't go home today, baby - Don't go home today, baby

619
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,220
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

620
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,189
Start the car, I must go somewhere like Bonnie and Clyde

621
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,288
I'll steal this night and sleep at an unfamiliar hotel

622
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,429
All right, there are many problems I don't mind, I know them all

623
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,970
Start the car, I must go somewhere like Bonnie and Clyde

624
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,139
- Get up - Get up

625
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,669
- I get up like Lexy - Get up

626
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,139
- I get up like Kitsyojii - Get up

627
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,439
- Say what? - Get up

628
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,379
I get up like Lexy, I get up like Kitsyojii

629
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,419
- Go, JOONIE - Go, JOONIE

630
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,818
- Go, JOONIE - Go, JOONIE

631
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,318
- Go, JOONIE, go, Geegooin - Go, JOONIE, go, Geegooin

632
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,419
- Go, Geegooin - Go, Geegooin

633
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,058
- Go - One, two, three, go

634
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,629
- Don't go home, baby - Don't go home, baby

635
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,929
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

636
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,358
- Okay, okay - Go

637
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,899
- Don't go home, baby - Don't go home, baby

638
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,038
- We still have some verses left - We still have some verses left

639
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,639
One, two, three, go

640
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,239
- Don't go home - Don't go home

641
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,808
- Don't go home - Don't go home

642
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,379
- Don't go home - Don't go home

643
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,939
- Don't go home - Don't go home

644
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,479
- Don't go home - Don't go home

645
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,249
- Don't go home - Don't go home

646
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,778
- Don't go home - Don't go home

647
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,819
- Don't go home - Baby!

648
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,689
- They did so well. - It was so much fun.

649
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,059
How did they pull off such a performance?

650
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,598
That takes wits.

651
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,669
Was the atmosphere of the deathmatch always like this?

652
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,670
No, it wasn't.

653
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,739
When I voted in the previous deathmatches,

654
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,098
my heart felt heavy.

655
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,039
But they performed with fun energy.

656
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,278
It was so cheerful.

657
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,509
We came feeling depressed but enjoyed the fun performance.

658
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:53,149
The hook, "Don't go home, baby,"

659
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,989
was witty.

660
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,589
It looked so much fun. It was perfect.

661
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,089
(The voting begins.)

662
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,960
The reactions are good.

663
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,329
(The voting is closed.)

664
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,929
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

665
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,828
- Thank you for your hard work. - Well done.

666
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,139
- Nice. - Thank you for your hard work.

667
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,568
No matter the result, we gave a performance we wouldn't regret.

668
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:18,409
"Okay. Even if I go home,"

669
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,808
"my heart will be light." I had that thought.

670
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,879
The level of completion was 100 percent.

671
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,479
I think it deserved the perfect score.

672
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,249
It was a performance we wouldn't regret.

673
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,250
It was so much fun.

674
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,390
Other blocks will have a hard time.

675
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,558
Block Five members, please come up to the stage...

676
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,730
- and begin. - Good luck.

677
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,598
- Good luck. - Let's go.

678
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,730
OSUN, let's go.

679
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,329
- Let's go. - Let's go.

680
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,808
It's everyone's goal to give a good performance.

681
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:55,278
So that the rappers can connect,

682
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,509
we'll compete with our rapping skills.

683
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,750
OSUN, do well.

684
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,849
Hello, we're Block Five.

685
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,890
- Block Five. - Block Five.

686
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,429
Before we begin our performance,

687
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,230
I'd like to applaud you for your hard work.

688
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,859
Here comes what we prepared.

689
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,639
I got something to get off my chest.

690
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,210
I came this far, so I can't go back. I'm still hungry.

691
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,680
Drop it.

692
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:32,879
Defining wrong and right

693
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,950
I'm sorry about that.

694
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,490
- Hey. - It's okay.

695
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,159
Defining wrong and right in this hateful era?

696
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,889
I used to shine brightly, the steps I took for my goal

697
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,528
The images are overused, The lyrics are a memorial service

698
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,129
People fill their wallets with the views they take easily

699
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,568
They say all jobs are equal, but some jobs make me wonder

700
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:53,669
A selfie stick on everybody's hands

701
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,338
- Everyone is the main character - Let's go

702
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,709
Dance and they're watching all your moves like the feds

703
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,679
You're going to get yourself fed with your popularity

704
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,879
- Luci Gang! - Can't take a plan B

705
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,048
Just going insane

706
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,548
I empty the twisted thoughts and turn my head blank

707
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:05,979
I don't know what will happen tomorrow

708
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,949
The wolf hunts for its prey, I make new path

709
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,118
I can't never do subtraction

710
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,719
- How cute. What's this? - Whether it's my attitude or money

711
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,219
All I do is add or multiply, Pressure puts me in the zone

712
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,959
Hair sticks to my sweat, But staying with Mike Sullivan

713
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,598
Automatic flow cascades down, Switch it when I want Ben 10

714
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,159
What's the time? When I count money, my belly gets fat

715
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,669
This is like flexing Louis Vuitton, Crack the logic, where's the bullet?

716
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,239
I suffocate when I see the punks who have been packaged well

717
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,799
Let's sous vide them at once

718
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,038
Yes, what I'm trying to protect is the class of the gutter

719
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,338
Perhaps I'm sick of it now

720
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,039
I bow to the age that even multiplies poverty

721
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,639
- Naivety is a disaster - Naivety is a disaster

722
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,278
- I know now, I'm not a Cinderella - Cinderella

723
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,150
Drink pills, I'll dive into chaos

724
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,618
Finally, I'm free

725
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:45,258
- One, two, three to the four - One, two, three to the four

726
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,659
- I'll teach you how to rap - I'll teach you how to rap

727
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,629
- Blocks 5, 6, 7 to the 8 - Blocks 5, 6, 7 to the 8

728
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,929
- If you can't rap, don't rap, flow - Don't rap, flow

729
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,768
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

730
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:58,368
- You can rap like that - You can rap like that

731
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:01,268
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

732
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:04,209
None of y'all can't mess with my pack

733
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,379
I reminisce about my beautiful past

734
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,479
I was a strange punk, I was never sick

735
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,808
Perhaps I wanted to sacrifice my body and find out

736
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,749
Foolishness piles up unlike what I want

737
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,219
My mom and dad worry about me

738
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,088
But watch who takes the lead when the tables are turned

739
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:22,459
The worries I had a year ago become jokes

740
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,358
I've seen them all I've organized things for years

741
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,959
You are what you eat, Thus, I'm Korean hip-hop

742
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,469
On par with the origin country, but made in South Korea

743
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,098
If you want, we can switch careers

744
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,868
New beginnings are easy, I'll be at the top in a few months

745
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,538
People who ignored me when I was a nobody want to talk now

746
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,209
Do they think this is Tinder? I just take my shot

747
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,108
Since you only read the room, I'll recommend Halli Galli

748
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,419
Leave when people are clapping, This is where I take my leave

749
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,018
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

750
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,749
- You can rap like that - You can rap like that

751
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,389

00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,058

753
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,528
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

754
00:30:58,529 --> 00:30:59,899
- You can rap like this - That's right.

755
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,028
- You can rap like that - You can rap like that

756
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,429
- You can rap like this - OSUN

757
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,669
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

758
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,338
- JP - JP

759
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:08,170
None of y'all can't mess with my pack

760
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,838
Armor on my chest, got them, I'm a walking list

761
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,979
To many pedometers, numbers

762
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,108
I hop on a limo two times

763
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:15,249
I don't know where I'm going next, mama

764
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,348
I got money, but what am I spending on

765
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:17,449
Get them big bottles popping

766
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,618
Still on this, I run on the street

767
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,449
The impeccable Seoul doesn't seem like a place for me

768
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,118
- One, two, three to the four - One, two, three to the four

769
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,389
- I'll teach you how to rap - I'll teach you how to rap

770
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,288
- Blocks 5, 6, 7 to the 8 - Blocks 5, 6, 7 to the 8

771
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,528
- If you can't rap, don't rap, flow - Don't rap, flow

772
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:35,399
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

773
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,129
- You can rap like that - You can rap like that

774
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,139
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

775
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,538
None of y'all can't mess with my pack

776
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:44,808
You can rap like this

777
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,179
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

778
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,538
You can rap like this

779
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,909
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

780
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,209
You can rap like this

781
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,808
- You can rap like this - You can rap like this

782
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,479
None of y'all can't mess with my pack

783
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,819
- With my pack - With my pack

784
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,289
He threw it away.

785
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,929
It was so much fun.

786
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,028
- I'm sorry that I blew the bridge. - No, you did well.

787
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,659
- You did well. - It's okay.

788
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,670
You did well.

789
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,268
The atmosphere was amazing.

790
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:12,969
- I'm sorry. - It's okay. It was great.

791
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,099
It was totally cool.

792
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,038
There was no performance.

793
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,909
Only a little bit of performance. But they did well.

794
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,210
- Yes. - Yes.

795
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,808
They understood the structure.

796
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,349
Their performance reflects the feedback.

797
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,149
The call for the beat moved my heart.

798
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,579
I got something to get off my chest.

799
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,890
I came this far,

800
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,220
so I can't go back. I'm still hungry.

801
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:37,689
Block Five excited the audience in their unique way.

802
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,799
It was really cool.

803
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,029
It was a hip-hop performance.

804
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,529
I had that thought.

805
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,499
The last performance was insane.

806
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,209
(Block 5 asked the audience members to sing together.)

807
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,909
- You can rap like that - You can rap like that

808
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,639
After putting down the microphones, they chanted the hook once more...

809
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,710
and threw the block marks. It was totally cool.

810
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,750
We will now begin the vote.

811
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,119
How do we vote for this?

812
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,028
I ruined the last part.

813
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:12,459
So good.

814
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,599
Well done.

815
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,630
I have no regrets.

816
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,129
I'm satisfied with the stage itself.

817
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,768
I performed a verse I liked.

818
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:21,740
I think the song was quite complete.

819
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,170
I'd give 98 points out of 100.

820
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,240
It was impressive when Block Five's patches were thrown.

821
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,509
It felt like my heart was liberated.

822
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,150
We all did great. I feel proud of you.

823
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,989
Block Two members,

824
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,518
- come up to the stage, - Are you ready?

825
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,989
And begin your performance.

826
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,389
- Let's finish this romantically. - Romantically.

827
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,660
- Are you ready? - Let's go.

828
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,400
Let's go.

829
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,129
- Let's go. - I look forward to this.

830
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,000
- Let's go. - Let's go.

831
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,539
TSP!

832
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,269
What must they have brought?

833
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,150
Let's go.

834
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,009
Let's go.

835
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,849
There's a formation.

836
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,920
Looks like ShyboiiTobii will do something.

837
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,159
I can't wait.

838
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,900
They are rappers who look the happiest and delighted on stage.

839
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,699
They feel happiest when they rap.

840
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,769
So I don't want to lose this time.

841
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,699
Hello.

842
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,710
I'm Loopy, Block Two's eldest.

843
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,110
As the eldest,

844
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,408
I put my block at the risk of being eliminated.

845
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,879
No, that's not true.

846
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,979
So I was going to go home.

847
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,719
But they said they would never let me go home,

848
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,460
so I'll decide after listening to this.

849
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,320
Give us the beat.

850
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,170
Please let us live.

851
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,129
Come back home!

852
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,598
Ticking time traveling, Work that I did unwillingly

853
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,768
Keeps increasing, so I get busier, There's no work for you

854
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,109
I can't go out sad I have time, my fortune

855
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,638
Whole squad, now well established

856
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,210
On the other hand, como estas

857
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,779
Higher than a trampoline, Swear this game can't be

858
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,319
Enough with your culture talk, What do you mean?

859
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,919
It didn't exist to begin with

860
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,448
We're all con artists here

861
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,018
You're contradicting yourself, What are you saying?

862
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,518
Just do what you've been doing

863
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,190
No one will say anything anyway

864
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:26,759
Rockstar aura, I cannot go to sleep

865
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,698
- Pull up to the city - They're the trendiest.

866
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,229
Brand new Rickys on my feet

867
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,268
I've been outside today, Fresh as heck, I keep it clean

868
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,509
I wake up with ambition, I'm riding with my team

869
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,638
Bad rich, just wait a bit, On my way to make 100k.

870
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,710
I'm not talking about a year, I mean in a day

871
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,948
Take a trip to foreign cities, Bangkok as the last stop

872
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:48,249
Take a trip, go to space tonight, I'm going to levitate

873
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,819
Ticking time traveling, Work that I did unwillingly

874
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,018
Keeps increasing, so I get busier, There's no work for you

875
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,259
I can't go out sad, I have time, my fortune

876
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,859
Whole squad, now well established

877
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,399
On the other hand, como estas

878
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,928
I'm a young climber, I climb up from the bottom

879
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,098
Try on sight, hit the crux, Blood on my body

880
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,339
Young climber, I get back up even if I fall hard

881
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,439
I trust my strong arms and legs, This is all I got

882
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,979
Ticking time traveling, Work that I did unwillingly

883
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,118
Keeps increasing, so I get busier, There's no work for you

884
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,448
I can't go out sad, I have time, my fortune

885
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,988
Whole squad, now well established

886
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,119
On the other hand, como estas

887
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,860
ShyboiiTobii is amazing.

888
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,259
Como estas

889
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,759
Don't mess with us, I'm from the outer space

890
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,499
- Spell that up in that upper case - That's right.

891
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,058
It looks different now, their taste

892
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,198
I might pace up and call back, My thing is just too clear

893
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,598
Got me brand new Rick pants

894
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,368
And I'm on the plane, Check the views here

895
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,769
Trip to south of France, French garments' color tone

896
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,638
Color tone going crazy, Getting taste, heart cold for real

897
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,709
My swagged out, Now she's trying to paint my nails

898
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,419
About to travel around the globe, North Pole, South Pole, how I feel

899
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,049
Back in the day, I was stepping on the mud

900
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,049
- Come back home - Ticking time traveling

901
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,249
Work that I did unwillingly

902
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,459
Keeps increasing, so I get busier, There's no work for you

903
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,859
I can't go out sad, I have time, my fortune

904
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,328
Whole squad, now well established

905
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:08,158
On the other hand, como estas

906
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,768
I can see everything, They're all so obvious

907
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,499
Don't act stupid, stop playing

908
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,999
He's no figure in his neighborhood

909
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,638
Who is he boasting in front of? It's not funny

910
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,169
My eyes are like a scouter's, All 100 out of 100

911
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,768
Know-it-alls ended up tapping

912
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,408
They rush to flee before even making an attack

913
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,578
I don't care who the opponent is, I just do it every day

914
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:23,749
Your mindset is already all wrong

915
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,308
If you want to join us, Just risk your life first

916
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,848
Or else, shut it and get lost Block Two

917
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:28,988
It's my turn, I'll show you who is the best

918
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,419
- 031, everything - His face is getting red.

919
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,419
- Block Two - What's up, earn like 16 Changmo

920
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,988
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

921
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,589
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

922
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,559
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two!

923
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,259
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

924
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,799
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

925
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,968
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

926
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,109
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

927
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,268
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

928
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,879
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

929
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,479
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

930
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,909
- Block Two, we're still going up - Block Two, we're still going up

931
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,119
We came back home

932
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,519
Awesome!

933
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,559
Block Two!

934
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,559
We came back home

935
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,259
Block Two!

936
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,030
Goodness.

937
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,559
That was crazy.

938
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,329
That was energetic.

939
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,198
We would have taken off our clothes too.

940
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,699
Mckdaddy.

941
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,340
You can do it now.

942
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,170
How did they make this over the short time?

943
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,408
I think their energy level is different.

944
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,210
- It's different. - It's like there is no limit.

945
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,209
This seems more fun than the main stage.

946
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,379
- Right. - I agree.

947
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,320
- I think it was the best. - I know.

948
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,319
Among the team stages...

949
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,589
we've seen so far,

950
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,760
Block Two's deathmatch stage was the best.

951
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,260
I think the goal to have everyone survive...

952
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,559
was very clear.

953
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:52,170
(Block 2 did their best since everyone's survival was at stake.)

954
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,538
The energy of all the members...

955
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,170
exploded on that stage.

956
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,578
They rapped an amazing hook, and they jumped around.

957
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,710
They were very desperate, and they didn't want to be eliminated.

958
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,149
Seriously.

959
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,479
I had chills.

960
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,050
ShyboiiTobii...

961
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,288
seemed like he was overwhelmed.

962
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,420
He looked like someone who wanted to protect something.

963
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,019
That was touching.

964
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,828
KHAN's voice didn't seem to be in a good condition.

965
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:21,459
Still, he rapped until the end.

966
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,429
I could understand how he felt.

967
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,699
In that sense, the stage made my heart fire up.

968
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,179
Well done.

969
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,880
We will now begin the vote.

970
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,419
(The voting begins.)

971
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,078
Can they all not leave?

972
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,150
I know.

973
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,760
Just...

974
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,860
They all put in everything.

975
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,460
I've never seen JTONG jump like that.

976
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,829
(The voting is closed.)

977
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,929
- Well done. You did so well. - Great job.

978
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,698
- Well done. - I think my verse was bad.

979
00:39:58,699 --> 00:39:59,739
No. You did well.

980
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,599
It's okay. It was good.

981
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:02,909
We did what we could.

982
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,368
It felt like there was love.

983
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,440
We wanted to keep all the members there.

984
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,980
It was a very beautiful scene.

985
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,219
We did our best, and we made a fun stage.

986
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:16,519
So we're satisfied as well.

987
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:21,760
Considering that it was a team performance,

988
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,129
I think...

989
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,960
our block should win first place.

990
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,129
All the deathmatch stages...

991
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,869
of the three blocks have ended.

992
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,199
Let's not go.

993
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,439
You see a great scene when people are desperate.

994
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,639
People were desperate and also enjoyed the stage.

995
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,280
I could see that they really loved rapping.

996
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,210
I could feel their passion and sweat.

997
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:47,448
All the three blocks showed us very strong performances.

998
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,550
I enjoyed it.

999
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,888
All the blocks did so well.

1000
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,058
There will be a difference of 1 or 2 votes.

1001
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,259
The leaders of the blocks that lost,

1002
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,389
please come up to the stage.

1003
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,460
Leader.

1004
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,599
Seriously.

1005
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,670
The elimination candidates that the block leaders selected...

1006
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,070
will be revealed.

1007
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Goodness.

1008
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,409
The horrible part starts from here.

1009
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,710
It's reality now.

1010
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:18,250
This is so cruel.

1011
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,320
It's difficult.

1012
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:22,480
Goodness.

1013
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,360
Block Six's leader, Kaogaii.

1014
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,559
Please say the names of the rappers selected as elimination candidates.

1015
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,170
Block Six's first elimination candidate...

1016
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,500
is O'Domar.

1017
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,139
(Block 6's 1st elimination candidate is O'Domar.)

1018
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,670
The second elimination candidate...

1019
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,179
I already hear JOONIE.

1020
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,610
Is JOONIE.

1021
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,519
(Block 6's 2nd elimination candidate is JOONIE.)

1022
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,320
The third elimination candidate...

1023
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,090
is Kohway.

1024
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:58,019
(Block 6's 3rd elimination candidate is Kohway.)

1025
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:04,329
I really want us to win.

1026
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,300
Block Five's leader, OSUN.

1027
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,400
Please say the names of the rappers selected as elimination candidates.

1028
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,599
Who should you pick from this block?

1029
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,239
How do you choose three among them?

1030
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,150
Block Five's elimination candidate...

1031
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,089
is Luci Gang.

1032
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,019
(Block 5's 1st elimination candidate is Luci Gang.)

1033
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,900
Block Five's second elimination candidate...

1034
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,969
is Khundi Panda.

1035
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,908
(Block 5's 2nd elimination candidate is Khundi Panda.)

1036
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:51,940
What?

1037
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:53,579
What?

1038
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,679
(OSUN's decision shocks everyone.)

1039
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,480
What on earth?

1040
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,820
No way.

1041
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:01,519
Maybe he volunteered.

1042
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,820
Would it be those three, including JP?

1043
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,090
I think so.

1044
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,530
Block Five's final elimination candidate...

1045
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,769
is Owen.

1046
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,239
(Block 5's 3rd elimination candidate is Owen.)

1047
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,170
- What? - What on earth?

1048
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,739
This is...

1049
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:31,750
He carried the team.

1050
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,650
Darn.

1051
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,190
Why?

1052
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,590
I really didn't expect this.

1053
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,288
I didn't think Owen and Khundi Panda would be elimination candidates.

1054
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,090
Are they certain that they won't lose?

1055
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:53,698
So do we have four people who say...

1056
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,969
they can be elimination candidates?

1057
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,940
Yes. We're really loyal, aren't we?

1058
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:59,138
Is it okay for you to go as well?

1059
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,139
- Me? - Yes.

1060
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,579
I want to survive.

1061
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,249
What? Then...

1062
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,179
- Then we have 3. - Then we have 3.

1063
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,519
I tried to reflect the opinions of the original members.

1064
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,219
I'll select Luci Gang, Khundi Panda, and Owen as elimination candidates.

1065
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,730
This is crazy.

1066
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,170
Block Two's leader, KHAN.

1067
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,340
Please say the names of the rappers selected as elimination candidates.

1068
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,840
There's no one to eliminate here.

1069
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,380
Our first elimination candidate is Raf Sandou.

1070
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,949
(Block 2's first elimination candidate is Raf Sandou.)

1071
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Goodness.

1072
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,670
- I feel very bad. - Right.

1073
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,650
I got very attached because we stayed together for a long time.

1074
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,659
I'm sorry.

1075
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,969
Our second elimination candidate is XWALLY.

1076
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,199
(Block 2's 2nd elimination candidate is XWALLY.)

1077
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,909
Our final elimination candidate is ShyboiiTobii.

1078
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,949
(Block 2's 3rd elimination candidate is ShyboiiTobii.)

1079
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,559
Here's the voting result of the deathmatch.

1080
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,900
I can't listen to this.

1081
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,800
Please.

1082
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,510
First, I will reveal the block that received the most votes...

1083
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,650
and therefore have all its members survive.

1084
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:19,179
This...

1085
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:24,320
As a result of the deathmatch, the block that won first place...

1086
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:32,960
Please.

1087
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,339
(As a result of the deathmatch, the block that came first place...)

1088
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,868
(is Block 6.)

1089
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:45,968
is Block Six.

1090
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:51,150
(Block 6's elimination candidates all survived.)

1091
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,609
is Block Six.

1092
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,279
(Block 6 came in 1st place with 23 votes.)

1093
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,519
- It's crazy. - It's crazy.

1094
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:01,289
Seriously. I almost died.

1095
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,989
- I thought this would happen. - I also did.

1096
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,468
(Sighing)

1097
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:15,599
(Block 2 and Block 5 will have eliminated members.)

1098
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,210
Block Six members can return to their seats.

1099
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,349
Well done.

1100
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,320
It's so hard.

1101
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:30,820
Well done.

1102
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,989
It's done. I told you.

1103
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,690
Honestly, I almost cried.

1104
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,929
I almost cried, so I tried my best to hold it in.

1105
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,469
As a result of the deathmatch, the block in the second place...

1106
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:51,769
can save 1 member among the 3 elimination candidates.

1107
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,739
I can't watch this either.

1108
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,780
The block that came in the second place in the deathmatch...

1109
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,130
is Block Two.

1110
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,768
(Block 2 came in 2nd place with 22 votes.)

1111
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,469
(Only 1 vote difference from 1st place)

1112
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:30,078
(Block 3 came in 3rd place with 19 votes.)

1113
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,980
(Block 5's Khundi Panda, Luci Gang, and Owen are eliminated.)

1114
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,489
Goodness. Those three are leaving?

1115
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:42,659
It was so unfortunate and shocking.

1116
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,260
I felt bad.

1117
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,829
Goodness.

1118
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,630
Block Two's leader, please say the name of the rapper who will stay.

1119
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,039
How do you choose this?

1120
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,440
One person.

1121
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:02,710
How do you choose that?

1122
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,019
(Only one among Raf Sandou, XWALLY, and ShyboiiTobii will stay.)

1123
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:10,549
They're all too good. Raf Sandou and ShyboiiTobii.

1124
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,550
- It would be so hard for KHAN. - Right.

1125
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,960
The rapper who will be saved in our block...

1126
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,929
is ShyboiiTobii.

1127
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,439
(Block 2's ShyboiiTobii survives.)

1128
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,610
(Block 2's Raf Sandou and XWALY get eliminated.)

1129
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,879
With that, all the rappers to be eliminated,

1130
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,280
including those in Block Three, were decided.

1131
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,219
Don't cry.

1132
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,429
See you after it ends.

1133
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:00,039
I should have prepared more. I'm sorry.

1134
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,940
Well done.

1135
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:09,979
Well done.

1136
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,480
Don't cry.

1137
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,980
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1138
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:16,889
It's okay.

1139
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,559
Darn.

1140
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,429
See you when we go out.

1141
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:28,928
Thank you so much.

1142
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,630
- Darn it. - Don't cry.

1143
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,269
I'm sorry.

1144
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:37,809
I'm sorry.

1145
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:40,340
- It's okay. - You were so cool.

1146
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,349
Let's see each other outside.

1147
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:44,880
Good luck.

1148
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,860
This is crazy.

1149
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:23,190
This is unfair.

1150
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,260
Why are you crying?

1151
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:36,928
I broke down.

1152
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:39,169
If you ask someone who went to war...

1153
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,139
how the war was, they can't give you an answer easily.

1154
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,739
How do I explain this?

1155
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:49,380
I feel very complex feelings while being on RAP: PUBLIC.

1156
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,110
They're people who I wouldn't have seen in my life,

1157
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,888
but I was even feeling their emotions...

1158
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:59,889
right next to them.

1159
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:03,119
There's a feeling that I can't describe.

1160
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,500
(The rappers return to the Village after the deathmatch.)

1161
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,670
Where are you going, Luci Gang?

1162
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:15,969
Luci Gang.

1163
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,579
I'm so sad.

1164
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,809
Luci Gang.

1165
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,919
You really did a great job.

1166
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,090
We already talked about it, and I somewhat expected it.

1167
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:34,289
- You had talked about it? - Yes.

1168
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,218
We volunteered.

1169
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,659
OSUN and JP...

1170
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,960
Speak slowly. It's okay.

1171
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,169
I burst into tears when I saw them.

1172
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,699
When you saw their faces.

1173
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:48,669
Right. The emotions would flood in.

1174
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,268
Actually, I accept the results of the deathmatch.

1175
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,980
I do have regrets.

1176
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:00,420
Don't cry. I tear up when I see other people cry.

1177
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,559
Well done.

1178
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:25,739
Having so many people eliminated...

1179
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,039
That was...

1180
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,518
- I wanted to keep going with you. - What?

1181
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:41,558
I really wanted to keep doing this with you.

1182
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:44,058
- I also wanted to, of course. - I really wanted to.

1183
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,059
But what can we do?

1184
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,929
Don't...

1185
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:51,469
feel sorry or something like that.

1186
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,190
We have to do well.

1187
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,920
Seriously.

1188
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,138
- Well done. - You did a great job too.

1189
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,170
You'll do well.

1190
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,038
Carry on the good job. Good luck.

1191
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,579
- You did a great job. - Not at all.

1192
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,348
- We should... - I'm really sorry.

1193
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,849
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

1194
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,448
Darn. I...

1195
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,619
I really wanted to get you to stay.

1196
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,159
Great job.

1197
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,589
- I'm really sorry. - Let's stay in touch.

1198
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,289
I'm really sorry.

1199
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:56,129
Don't say that. It's okay.

1200
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,300
It's okay.

1201
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,900
I normally don't cry so much.

1202
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:05,969
But this happened as soon as I joined the block.

1203
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,309
So I felt guilty.

1204
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:11,980
That's why I cried.

1205
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:20,190
It was my fault.

1206
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:22,719
It feels terrible.

1207
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,030
We can get through this and win.

1208
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,530
Sit down for a while.

1209
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:48,149
(Loopy can't stop crying...)

1210
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:52,650
(because of the guilt of having the members eliminated.)

1211
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,440
Drink some water.

1212
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,078
- Here. - Hold it.

1213
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:19,110
(XWALLY heads to the two who are crying.)

1214
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,090
ShyboiiTobii.

1215
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,590
Darn. XWALLY.

1216
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,329
Thank you. You have to win, you know?

1217
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:35,598
Raf Sandou and XWALLY sacrificed many things for the team.

1218
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,630
But they all got eliminated.

1219
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,570
Seriously.

1220
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,940
(ShyboiiTobii feels bad because they were eliminated.)

1221
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:51,880
(Block 2 performed desperately to protect the members.)

1222
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,118
I was very desperate.

1223
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,820
I shouted and rapped like a crazy person...

1224
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,888
for the block.

1225
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:04,190
I was confident, but the result didn't reflect that.

1226
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:20,780
I'm sorry.

1227
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,449
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything here.

1228
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,719
I wanted to prove it to you.

1229
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,420
You did great today.

1230
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:32,719
You improved a lot.

1231
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,658
It's so difficult for me to be here.

1232
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:38,230
I have a trauma.

1233
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:43,968
I thought I should achieve something from here...

1234
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:45,500
that I couldn't do outside.

1235
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:49,198
You're here.

1236
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,368
I can't tell if this is a reality or a game.

1237
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:54,679
I'm at the border...

1238
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,579
So I can't focus on the stage.

1239
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,119
I asked him to put me as a candidate.

1240
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,690
I talked with the others when you weren't here.

1241
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,328
You kept taking care of us.

1242
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:16,360
They said they'd go...

1243
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:18,769
because we'd win.

1244
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:23,169
So far, Loopy supported us.

1245
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,868
You're the leader, but he still didn't stay comfortable.

1246
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,210
He wasn't comfortable even once.

1247
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:31,909
He feels down.

1248
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,979
You feel like you let us down as the older one.

1249
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,679
It's not you.

1250
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:38,590
- We stepped in. - Yes.

1251
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,760
- It's not like you stepped out. - Yes.

1252
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:41,919
You stepped in too.

1253
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,420
You did way too much.

1254
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,488
I met new younger rappers here.

1255
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,800
I didn't think I'd feel like this through them.

1256
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,499
The way everyone cared about each other...

1257
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,699
made me cry.

1258
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,809
- But it was really cool. - Seriously.

1259
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,839
It was cool. I was amazed while watching it.

1260
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,409
We had fun. That's what matters.

1261
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,980
Everyone...

1262
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,119
I respect you from my heart.

1263
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,780
- Thank you. - From my heart.

1264
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:14,690
(Raf Sandou silently prepares to leave.)

1265
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,219
Raf Sandou.

1266
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:25,199
I really had fun.

1267
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,300
But the remaining members...

1268
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,169
shouldn't feel so down.

1269
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,768
I want them to use this as a reason to work harder.

1270
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,038
- We'll do well. - Yes.

1271
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,309
Thank you for being on our block.

1272
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,719
As the leader of this block,

1273
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,949
I should make it so that the eliminations don't go in vain.

1274
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,920
I should work harder like crazy.

1275
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,090
I'll get going.

1276
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,058
(Laf Sandou and XWALLY leave the Village.)

1277
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:55,059
No.

1278
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,940
ShyBoiiTobii.

1279
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,809
I wouldn't be able to experience something like this again.

1280
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,750
Yes!

1281
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,489
It was a short time, but they were all like family.

1282
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,288
I was moved a lot, and I was motivated a lot.

1283
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:24,530
We'll win.

1284
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,590
We will win.

1285
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:29,429
I felt that they were very cool people.

1286
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,900
I got very attached to the rappers in the same block.

1287
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,369
We were really serious about each other.

1288
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,440
The remaining missions would be difficult,

1289
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,610
but think of us,

1290
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,010
and win no matter what.

1291
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,009
(Block 2: KHAN, Loopy, Nosun, JTONG, )

1292
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,219
(Foggyatthebottom, ShyboiiTobii)

1293
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:51,849
I'm going now.

1294
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:55,259
It was really great to get to know you.

1295
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,658
I'm also really glad I met you.

1296
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:57,860
Stay in touch.

1297
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:02,760
I was really thankful to be with you here as your fan.

1298
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,570
Bye.

1299
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,800
Bye.

1300
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,099
Well done.

1301
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:12,840
I'll get going.

1302
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,480
I know.

1303
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:19,309
Okay, Block Five.

1304
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:21,579
Give me a hug.

1305
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,219
Thank you for coming to Block Five.

1306
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,288
Thank you for accepting me.

1307
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,389
What are you saying?

1308
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,960
Thank you for calling me.

1309
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,889
Well done.

1310
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,260
I'm sorry.

1311
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,170
I won't keep doing this.

1312
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:41,138
Go and pull yourselves together.

1313
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:43,098
Think about how you'll do tomorrow.

1314
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,210
I'll watch the show on TV now.

1315
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:46,038
Well done.

1316
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,339
Bye.

1317
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,908
- We'll really go. - Bye.

1318
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,079
Bye.

1319
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,949
This...

1320
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,988
was a journey that I could achieve...

1321
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,690
through my suffering or hard work.

1322
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,460
I felt refreshed.

1323
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,459
I had only one reason for coming here.

1324
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:10,400
I wanted to be somewhere to show and prove myself.

1325
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,800
I wanted people to listen to what I make.

1326
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:17,070
It was really an honor to work...

1327
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:20,340
together with those I really like and respect.

1328
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,638
I want to be remembered well.

1329
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:23,908
(He was on all the matches with his skills.)

1330
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:27,010
(Khundi Panda acted as the center of Block 5.)

1331
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:29,750
I have no regrets.

1332
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,820
(Block 5)

1333
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,759
(We had fun. From Khundi Panda Luci Gang, and Owen)

1334
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,718
(Block 5: OSUN, Hash Swan, JP, Luci Gang, Khundi Panda, Owen)

1335
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,360
(Block 5: OSUN, Hash Swan, JP)

1336
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,900
(Block 5's leader OSUN can't stop crying after his members left.)

1337
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:53,139
There were so many things that didn't go as I wanted.

1338
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:58,379
I felt like I caused harm...

1339
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,119
on the members.

1340
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:11,230
You did well. You were great today.

1341
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,760
Gosh.

1342
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,130
This is so difficult.

1343
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:21,840
- It's not easy. - You did well.

1344
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,139
I had to protect them no matter what.

1345
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:27,380
I know. It's not easy.

1346
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,610
- Thank you. - I did nothing.

1347
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:35,349
You followed my decision.

1348
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,150
We were...

1349
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:41,718
in the same situation where we had to survive.

1350
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:45,429
That same feeling was shared among us.

1351
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,059
It was unfair.

1352
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,460
This is so hard.

1353
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:02,639
I mean...

1354
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,619
Gosh.

1355
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:18,760
(Even the rappers who won can't stop crying throughout the night.)

1356
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,828
(Block 2)

1357
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,738
It was really...

1358
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:31,739
Darn it.

1359
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,179
I don't think I've experienced something like this before.

1360
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,979
All the rappers who act strong...

1361
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,119
are all sniffling.

1362
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:44,150
It's very emotionally draining.

1363
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:47,320
We formed a sense of comradeship.

1364
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,690
(The rappers can't fall asleep easily.)

1365
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,899
They really made it well.

1366
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,559
We came here with masks.

1367
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,630
That's already a memory.

1368
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:01,868
(Block 2)

1369
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,670
XWALLY shouldn't have gone.

1370
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:08,138
ShyboiiTobii seems like he has a lot of passion.

1371
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,639
The passion exploded today.

1372
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,420
I think living together made us more emotional.

1373
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,519
We have no phone too. We talked every day.

1374
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,960
We know how hard everyone works.

1375
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,929
That's why I also...

1376
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,800
learned a lot from others as a human.

1377
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:31,299
I also got very motivated as an artist...

1378
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,329
while being here.

1379
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,340
It really is an unforgettable experience.

1380
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:40,979
Seriously. I won't forget this. It makes no sense.

1381
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,250
I rarely come out of my home.

1382
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:47,820
I only met people I usually meet.

1383
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:50,920
So I think it's a relief that I came here.

1384
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,519
We stayed together here...

1385
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,860
with the same interest.

1386
01:05:57,929 --> 01:06:01,860
Having this chance to share our emotions like this is valuable.

1387
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:04,369
Well, we made it this far.

1388
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:07,500
Is there anyone who feels fine with getting eliminated?

1389
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,369
- I don't want to get eliminated. - No one.

1390
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,368
After what we've been through, if I get eliminated,

1391
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:14,038
I'll let Khundi Panda down.

1392
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,039
Right.

1393
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:18,010
Now that I feel relaxed, I'm so exhausted.

1394
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,750
- You're drinking a lot. - Right.

1395
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,849
We've been cooped up only in here.

1396
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,489
So this show feels like my life right now.

1397
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,920
Even if we went home today, we would've gained something.

1398
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:31,289
Right.

1399
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,630
Gosh, this is already our last day in the Village.

1400
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:39,368
(Block 6)

1401
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:40,868
- SINCE, should I pour you one? - Not getting drunk...

1402
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:42,069
- Do you have some? - I do.

1403
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,868
- You should drop the honorifics. - Sure.

1404
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:46,109
- In what year were you born? - I was born in 1992.

1405
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,169
- You were born in 1992? - Yes.

1406
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,538
The connection between SINCE and I is tight.

1407
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:49,909
We were both born in 1992.

1408
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,409
- Right. - What's the nickname you call me?

1409
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,880
- Kaogui. Gui sounds like 92. - Right.

1410
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,518
That's another reason why we're in a parallel...

1411
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:56,948
What do you call that?

1412
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,018
- A parallel universe. - A parallel universe.

1413
01:06:58,019 --> 01:07:00,389
I've never met anyone who was dumber than me.

1414
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,819
My gosh, you shouldn't be happy.

1415
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,129
(Chaboom keeps observing SINCE after the deathmatch.)

1416
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,058
SINCE. By the way, you were killing it during the deathmatch.

1417
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:09,428
- Seriously. SINCE is... - She's so good.

1418
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:12,269
That's why we didn't diss her when we were dissing your block.

1419
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,829
(During the Block Competition)

1420
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:17,669
(There's a rapper we would like to bring to our block from Block 6.)

1421
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:18,968
(Me?)

1422
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:20,538
(Welcome, )

1423
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:21,809
(SINCE.)

1424
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,349
(Block 3 kept trying to recruit her during the Block Competition.)

1425
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,119
By the way, are you trying to steal her for real?

1426
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,849
Yes. I think they wanted her from the beginning.

1427
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,428
I thought he was just joking.

1428
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,288
But Chaboom looked dead serious...

1429
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:43,459
when he told me I should think about joining Block Three.

1430
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,629
I came to Block 4 because I thought Block 6 had a good chance to win.

1431
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,868
But Block Six had to compete in the deathmatch.

1432
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:49,638
I had to face another crisis of possibly being eliminated.

1433
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:51,409
So I got nervous again.

1434
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,469
But it looked like...

1435
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,579
Block Three had a better chance of winning in the future.

1436
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,349
- Let me say just this, though. - What? Okay.

1437
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,380
I might have a change of heart.

1438
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,219
- Are you for real? - Yes. For real.

1439
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,320
I'm seriously considering.

1440
01:08:11,429 --> 01:08:12,460
Why?

1441
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,369
Are there more rappers you want to perform with on Block Three?

1442
01:08:22,869 --> 01:08:23,899
Right.

1443
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:26,539
That's why I'm considering it.

1444
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,810
- I think they're a strong block. - Yes.

1445
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,818
But here's what doesn't add up in my head for you.

1446
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:40,419
Are you certain that...

1447
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,988
they will not put you up for elimination?

1448
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:43,719
- Remember what I said? - Yes.

1449
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,188
Not being put up for the elimination won't keep me in the game.

1450
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:48,630
- I see. Is that how you felt? - We have to win the match.

1451
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,399
Well, I can't resent her even if she joins them.

1452
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,270
But this feels terrible.

1453
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:59,970
- I think she might leave. - Right?

1454
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:03,079
My gosh, we're doomed.

1455
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,408
Here's what I think is happening.

1456
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:08,219
So she's going to join them.

1457
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,019
But if she ditches us right away, she would feel bad and guilty.

1458
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,550
I think that's why she hinted it at me.

1459
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,689
She thought they were joking. But after thinking...

1460
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,358
about what Reddy said to her...

1461
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,759
and seeing how Chaboom kept on nudging her,

1462
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,158
it hit me then.

1463
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,659
"Darn it. My guard was down." That crossed my mind.

1464
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,499
- Darn it. I suddenly feel awake. - Right. This is bad news for us.

1465
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,270
We can't replace her now.

1466
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:33,640
(SINCE comes back to Block 6 after being gone for a while.)

1467
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,879
Can we talk in private?

1468
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,278
I think the two of us should talk...

1469
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:37,680
since I was the one who recruited you.

1470
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,720
But if you only look at the results,

1471
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:44,449
we only lost once, and they also lost only once.

1472
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,050
But I haven't experienced Block Three yet.

1473
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:52,390
The rappers on Block Three are close-knit.

1474
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,229
A lot more so than you probably expect.

1475
01:09:57,229 --> 01:10:00,369
They're the only block except for our block...

1476
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,310
to have continued with the same rappers from the beginning.

1477
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:07,109
Let's say you join them, and one of you has to be eliminated.

1478
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:09,139
Honestly, you'd have a high chance...

1479
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,279
- of getting picked. - Right.

1480
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,179
What about the next mission? If you win...

1481
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,779
I know that. But I'm still going to talk to them.

1482
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:17,149
- Okay. - Do you get it?

1483
01:10:17,149 --> 01:10:18,149
Can you not leave?

1484
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:21,560
- Should I not leave? - Don't leave.

1485
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,858
- Don't leave. - Should I not?

1486
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:27,959
- Don't leave. - Should we go all the way?

1487
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,029
Yes.

1488
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:31,770
This was driving me crazy.

1489
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:36,970
(Kaogaii tries to persuade her to stay for a long time.)

1490
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,779
(The next morning)

1491
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,209
- An O or X for the second one. - Yes.

1492
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:47,578
The one that popped up the most.

1493
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:49,879
- I see. That sounds about right. - Yes.

1494
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,050
(SINCE and JOONIE are making small talk.)

1495
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,289
What's wrong with your eye?

1496
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,760
- I got a sty. - I see. Really?

1497
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,188
Where is everyone?

1498
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:03,630
- Chaboom. By the way, - Yes.

1499
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,129
You said your block wanted me.

1500
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,969
- Were you serious about that? - Yes.

1501
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,599
You're the only one we're interested in recruiting.

1502
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,609
Really?

1503
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:17,439
(At that time, the rappers from Block 6 come back.)

1504
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,850
Gosh. That sounds fun. I...

1505
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,479
Hello.

1506
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,189
- Because of Chaboom? - Yes.

1507
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,429
Once you join us, you won't have to move again.

1508
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,399
You can just focus on music with nothing to worry about.

1509
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:39,629
At this point, he's not even trying to be polite...

1510
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,368
- Right? - when poaching her.

1511
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,300
- If you're considering to move, - Yes.

1512
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,909
- talk to Reddy or HAON. - I'm actually thinking about it.

1513
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,578
Should I call them out? Do you want to talk to them?

1514
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:49,579
Well...

1515
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,750
- We can talk inside here. Come. - I see.

1516
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,349
Someone wants to talk to you.

1517
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,550
- My gosh. Let's escort her. - I brought her here.

1518
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:01,488
- Yes. Who do you want to talk to? - Escort her.

1519
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:04,658
I just wanted to talk to Block Three.

1520
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:05,689
- I see. - Sit down.

1521
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:08,299
Let's say that I join you guys.

1522
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,568
Well, I joined your block to make my winning chances higher.

1523
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:15,639
But you already had time to bond and perform together as a team.

1524
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,669
So I might be the first one on the chopping block...

1525
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,608
which means although I would have moved to win,

1526
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:22,309
I might end up getting eliminated from the show.

1527
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:24,679
That worries me the most.

1528
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,819
From what I heard, that's the same situation with every block.

1529
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:31,448
So far, we have always communicated...

1530
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:33,420
before choosing the elimination candidates.

1531
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:35,459
Whom we're going to eliminate.

1532
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,090
And that won't change just because you joined us.

1533
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:42,929
By the way, I'm really confident.

1534
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,629
Considering the momentum and the rappers on our block,

1535
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,770
I think we have a good chance to win.

1536
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,499
I'm sure we'll get to a certain point...

1537
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,038
in the competition you would be happy with...

1538
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,409
- if you're with us. - Yes.

1539
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,809
- You've seen us. So you know. - Yes. I know you guys too well.

1540
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,818
But we don't want to pressure you.

1541
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:06,249
I just want you to make the best decision you can make.

1542
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,250
I see.

1543
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,060
My gosh, you guys are so different.

1544
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:14,289
After talking to them in person, I was even more confused.

1545
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,300
(Block 6)

1546
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,569
- Did you talk to them? - Yes.

1547
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,199
So?

1548
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:26,339
- I'm still thinking. - Still?

1549
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,340
Yes.

1550
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:30,408
- I want to go home. - Home? You'll just drop out?

1551
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:32,209
Yes. Go home. Let's think about this later.

1552
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,278
- Should I? - That's great.

1553
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:35,919
My gosh. Come on.

1554
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,549
- You're making me feel bad. - By the way,

1555
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,988
they didn't offer to make you the leader, right?

1556
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:41,559
They have a completely different vibe.

1557
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,119
Things are done so differently.

1558
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,159
Give me that.

1559
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,198
I'm sure they're trying to sweet-talk you into joining them.

1560
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,529
But you can't go anyway.

1561
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,399
Do you know what Chaboom said?

1562
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:53,969
"As long as you don't volunteer to be an elimination candidate,"

1563
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,238
"you'll survive."

1564
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:56,368
- If you don't volunteer? - Yes.

1565
01:13:56,369 --> 01:13:58,839
They all volunteer to be elimination candidates.

1566
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,639
Everything I did so far to make my team stronger...

1567
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,438
had worked until now.

1568
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:04,680
But now, it feels like all of my effort is backfiring.

1569
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:08,779
- Do you regret coming here? - No, I don't.

1570
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:11,988
Yesterday's deathmatch was really fun.

1571
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,119
Remember how we all sang, "Don't go home, baby?"

1572
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:16,158
Don't go home, baby

1573
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,390
- Anyway... - Okay.

1574
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,300
My gosh. But she might stay.

1575
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:26,930
She won't leave, right?

1576
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,770
To be honest, I'm not sure.

1577
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:35,538
No news from SINCE?

1578
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:36,908
- She's at Block Three. - What?

1579
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:39,510
She's talking to Block Three.

1580
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,219
Maybe, she joined them.

1581
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,520
(Maybe, she joined Block 3.)

1582
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,159
SINCE. I need to talk to you. Could you hurry up and tell me?

1583
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,859
Hold on. SINCE.

1584
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,329
Oh, right.

1585
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,470
- You're already... - Right. I'm sorry.

1586
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,698
If you want to join them despite the risk,

1587
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:02,739
then you should.

1588
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,839
Okay. I'll let you do your makeup. I have to wash up too.

1589
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,539
But I can't seem to do anything right now.

1590
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,578
- Gosh, really? - Empty your mind now.

1591
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:14,648
Make up your mind.

1592
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:17,219
Make up your mind. I'll wash up and get ready too.

1593
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,649
- Okay. - All right.

1594
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,358
I didn't know what to do. I know I shouldn't be like this.

1595
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:29,828
I should've made up my mind quickly.

1596
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:32,329
I knew that, but I was still unsure.

1597
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:37,699
(SINCE is deep in thought about Block 6 and Block 3.)

1598
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:43,180
(What will SINCE decide?)

1599
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:44,909
Where's SINCE?

1600
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,310
Well, she must be talking to them.

1601
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:50,618
Anyway, I did everything I could to persuade her.

1602
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:52,889
- I did everything I could do. - Yes. Right.

1603
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,688
- And you can't do more than this. - I can't.

1604
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:56,059
Besides, trying to stop her from talking to them...

1605
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,419
- seems like a stupid idea too. - Right.

1606
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,630
So if she decides to join them and apologizes to me,

1607
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,559
I'll just say, "Okay. Get lost now."

1608
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,429
(At that moment, SINCE comes back to Block 6.)

1609
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,228
The college students are locked up inside.

1610
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,639
But we're out here.

1611
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,770
- Okay. I'll tell you my decision. - Yes.

1612
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:13,739
My gosh.

1613
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:16,680
My gosh.

1614
01:16:17,109 --> 01:16:18,250
Here it goes.

1615
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,379
- Whatever it is... - Yes.

1616
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,680
No pressure. It's okay.

1617
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:25,349
Okay. Then I'll leave.

1618
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:26,550
- Okay. - Okay.

1619
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,389
- Thank you for everything. - Thank you for everything.

1620
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,959
- Thank you for everything. - I'm sorry.

1621
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,288
I'm sorry, everyone.

1622
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:33,358
- Gosh, no. Thank you. - I'm sorry.

1623
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:34,658
- Thank you. SINCE. - I'm sorry.

1624
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:36,399
- Get lost now. - Okay.

1625
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,658
- As fast as you can. - I'll leave super quickly.

1626
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:38,669
- Okay. - Good job.

1627
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:40,568
- I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.

1628
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:41,739
- It's okay. I understand. - It's fine.

1629
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:45,409
- I'm here to tell you something. - Yes.

1630
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,850
I'll join you guys.

1631
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,079
- I'll join you guys. Yes. - Gosh.

1632
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,250
- Yes! - Congratulations.

1633
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,189
- Congratulations. Welcome. - Congratulations.

1634
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:04,189
(Choice Block)

1635
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,000
I will recruit a rapper.

1636
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,099
She's cheerful. And she's an excellent rapper.

1637
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,630
Her performances are on point too.

1638
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,398
All of us on Block Three wanted SINCE...

1639
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:18,170
to join our block.

1640
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,108
(SINCE was recruited to Block 3 from Block 6.)

1641
01:17:20,109 --> 01:17:22,039
- I hope we work well together. - Yes.

1642
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:23,738
Yes, sir.

1643
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,278
(Kaogaii, Geegooin, Gwang Il, SINCE, JOONIE, Kohway, O'Domar, Mckdaddy)

1644
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:28,050
(Reddy, HAON, Kyle, Yun Ha, James, DOMMIU, Chaboom, SINCE)

1645
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,949
Rapper SINCE of Block 6 was recruited to Block 3.

1646
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,520
- Yes. - Welcome.

1647
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:36,920
DOMMIU, you got a female rapper now.

1648
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:39,760
Yes.

1649
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,960
Welcome.

1650
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,430
- Welcome. - Welcome.

1651
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:46,068
The rap general is here.

1652
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:48,840
- Yes. The general. Let's go in. - The rap general is here.

1653
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,970
- Let's go in. - Okay.

1654
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:52,409
(Block 4)

1655
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:55,640
(Rapper SINCE of Block 6 was recruited to Block 3.)

1656
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,140
This is so fun.

1657
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,049
Welcome!

1658
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,079
(We're going to win!)

1659
01:18:00,579 --> 01:18:02,180
I'm losing it right now.

1660
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,449
Same here.

1661
01:18:08,659 --> 01:18:13,859
(Block 6 is facing a crisis. What will happen to them?)

1662
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:16,300
- Let's eat, Loopy. - Okay.

1663
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,899
When did you all get up?

1664
01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:22,770
Did I drink a lot yesterday?

1665
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:25,539
- You did. Yes. - Really? I did?

1666
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:28,909
My gosh. I can't keep my eyes open.

1667
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:32,009
I think my eyes got super small.

1668
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,010
(Adoring him)

1669
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:37,750
By the way, ShyboiiTobii, you have to stay sharp today.

1670
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,520
- What? What's happening today? - You're taking over as the leader.

1671
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,420
Don't you remember?

1672
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,859
My gosh. Come on!

1673
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:51,029
Four of our rappers got eliminated after I became the leader.

1674
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,569
Should we change the leader?

1675
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:54,199
Don't think like that.

1676
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,300
This isn't your fault at all. No way.

1677
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,270
We said the same thing to Loopy.

1678
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,439
We told him not to carry the burden by himself.

1679
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:04,209
As their leader, I wanted to make them smile.

1680
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:07,149
But I was telling them I failed to do that.

1681
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,749
Then can you give me the responsibility?

1682
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,750
Totally.

1683
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,819
I'm being serious.

1684
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:14,618
To be honest, I think...

1685
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:16,960
I'm the most determined and spiteful one to win among us.

1686
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,930
I shared what I was feeling with the other guys.

1687
01:19:20,029 --> 01:19:21,799
By looking at his eyes right now,

1688
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,528
I'm confident to say that we can trust him.

1689
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:25,630
- Right. I can feel it too. - Today...

1690
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:29,568
ShyboiiTobii said he wanted to be the leader...

1691
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:31,269
and shared his vision with us.

1692
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,770
I thought it would be fun.

1693
01:19:33,409 --> 01:19:35,779
What do you think about becoming our leader?

1694
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,148
I'm not sure if you can remember...

1695
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:40,349
everything you said yesterday.

1696
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,778
I remember what I said.

1697
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:44,819
- You do? - That was before I got drunk.

1698
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,250
So I want you to be our leader.

1699
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,118
In my opinion,

1700
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,729
our block should mix things up.

1701
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,589
I'm worried about if the other rappers...

1702
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:56,059
would trust me and support my decisions as their leader.

1703
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,169
You'll have our trust and support for sure.

1704
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,599
You need to ask yourself...

1705
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,069
if you feel confident about leading our block.

1706
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,868
- I feel confident. - You do?

1707
01:20:02,869 --> 01:20:05,509
I'll be confident until the day I die.

1708
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,810
Then tell them you'll do it.

1709
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,108
I was grateful to hear what he said.

1710
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:13,550
I realized that I was able to win the trust of an experienced rapper.

1711
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,319
Let me be completely honest.

1712
01:20:15,579 --> 01:20:17,119
I can totally pull it off.

1713
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,948
But I'll listen to and incorporate everyone's idea.

1714
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:20,949
Sounds good.

1715
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,559
And we're switching things up for our block.

1716
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,219
- That's important. - Right.

1717
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,688
ShyboiiTobii might be the perfect person...

1718
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:29,399
to incorporate everyone's style.

1719
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,100
We'll replace our leader.

1720
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,328
The new leader for Block Two is...

1721
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,799
ShyboiiTobii.

1722
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,039
(Everyone changes their name plates to Replace Leader.)

1723
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,909
KHAN, Block Two's leader...

1724
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:48,719
was replaced by ShyboiiTobii.

1725
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Nice!

1726
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:54,049
Shy.

1727
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,060
(KHAN is replaced by ShyboiiTobii.)

1728
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,759
I'd like to make a suggestion.

1729
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,158
If anyone wants to be the leader, let's discuss that.

1730
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:03,560
Let's see who would be good for the position.

1731
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:06,829
I'll keep it simple.

1732
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:09,170
- The leader represents the block. - Yes.

1733
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,739
Fleeky Bang and ShyboiiTobii are the leaders now.

1734
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:15,038
I don't want to lose out to them.

1735
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:16,978
Right. The rappers from the current generation...

1736
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:19,679
- are becoming the leaders. - Right.

1737
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,779
- They represent their blocks. - Right.

1738
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:24,078
It's the same with Block 1 and Block 2.

1739
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,589
The rappers from his generation...

1740
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,789
are the leaders of their blocks.

1741
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:31,829
I think that became a trigger for HAON.

1742
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,590
So I thought this was a good time to switch.

1743
01:21:34,899 --> 01:21:36,199
We'll replace the leader.

1744
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,970
(Everyone changes their name plates to Replace Leader.)

1745
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,698
I'm the new leader.

1746
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:45,038
(Reddy led Block 3 after HAON led the block initially.)

1747
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:48,479
Reddy, Block Three's leader,

1748
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:50,640
was replaced by HAON.

1749
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:54,778
The former leader must hand off the necklace...

1750
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:57,119
of the leader to the new leader.

1751
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,849
- I'm going to need your support. - Thank you.

1752
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,090
My gosh, don't thank me.

1753
01:22:00,789 --> 01:22:02,989
So far, we've been taking turns...

1754
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,459
to be the leader.

1755
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,329
And that was our block's tradition.

1756
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:09,459
But if we can't change the leader again,

1757
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:12,299
I think it's only right to make Boi B our leader again.

1758
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,329
- I agree. - Me?

1759
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:18,068
Should I say the experienced side of Boi B?

1760
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:20,209
He's the rapper we rely on the most.

1761
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:23,710
He's Boi B. I mean, it's Boi B.

1762
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:25,550
We'll replace the leader.

1763
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,919
(Everyone changes their name plates to Replace Leader.)

1764
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,720
The new leader of Block Four is Boi B.

1765
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:35,760
(Boi B)

1766
01:22:36,189 --> 01:22:37,920
Boi B gets a necklace for becoming the leader.

1767
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,430
- Thank you. - My gosh.

1768
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,329
- Good work. - Thank you.

1769
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:44,698
- Good work. - Thank you.

1770
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:45,699
Good job.

1771
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,769
Block One is so fun.

1772
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,438
We're killing it with every match.

1773
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:53,539
I won't leave.

1774
01:22:55,109 --> 01:22:57,238
There were eight of us, so we weren't going to recruit anyone.

1775
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:58,978
We won the match, and we're doing a good job.

1776
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,210
I don't want to move to a different block.

1777
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:03,680
(Block 1 has 8 rappers.)

1778
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:05,688
- I hope we can work well together. - Same here.

1779
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,289
- Let's win no matter what. - Let's not cry.

1780
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,858
Hopefully, we won't have to.

1781
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,419
I thought we had the upper hand looking at our block.

1782
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,430
I love my block.

1783
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:14,760
(Block 3 has 8 rappers.)

1784
01:23:15,229 --> 01:23:17,228
skyminhyuk. How do you feel? Will you be loyal?

1785
01:23:17,229 --> 01:23:18,398
I'm loyal. Totally.

1786
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:20,270
- Right? - I'm 120 percent sure.

1787
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,438
There are eight of us now.

1788
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:26,739
I thought our block was perfect in terms of balance too.

1789
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,680
(Block 4 has 8 rappers now.)

1790
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,978
You know what I think? Let's keep our block as it is.

1791
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:32,979
Yes.

1792
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,679
We'll keep our block as it is even if we end up losing.

1793
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,379
That's our plan.

1794
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,689
(Block 2 has 6 rappers.)

1795
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,219
There are just seven of us.

1796
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,890
Without SINCE, our strength has weakened.

1797
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,228
I knew that we would have a hard time...

1798
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:47,390
with the future missions.

1799
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:49,829
We should look for another rapper to recruit.

1800
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,229
(Block 6 has 7 rappers.)

1801
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,069
(Meanwhile, what about Block 5?)

1802
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:57,069
You know what? Just being here is torturing me.

1803
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:02,079
(Block 5 has 3 rappers.)

1804
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,550
What should we do to overcome this situation?

1805
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,679
What's the best scenario for you?

1806
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,818
The three of us sticking together?

1807
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:09,819
Yes.

1808
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,519
- Winning it with a disadvantage. - With a disadvantage?

1809
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,119
That's the coolest scenario.

1810
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,449
Then let's stick together.

1811
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,719
- The three of us? - Yes.

1812
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,430
I like that. That's my first choice.

1813
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:25,300
I didn't bring this up in case you guys didn't want that.

1814
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:27,898
If that's your first choice,

1815
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:29,100
to be honest, it's mine too.

1816
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:32,340
The bottom line is we don't know what the mission will be.

1817
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,179
A part of me thinks that we might have a shot.

1818
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,179
- Yes. - That crossed my mind too.

1819
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,579
Anyway, we are indeed at a disadvantage.

1820
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:43,579
- But we might have an advantage. - That's our chance.

1821
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,419
Even if we get eliminated, let's give it our all.

1822
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,789
That's a cool way to go out.

1823
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,889
- That's cool. - That's what hip-hop is all about.

1824
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:49,960
Yes. That's cool.

1825
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,960
(Block 5 is in the square the next morning.)

1826
01:24:57,699 --> 01:24:58,770
Hello.

1827
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,170
What's your plan?

1828
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,568
Will you guys split?

1829
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:03,569
I think the three of us will stick together.

1830
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,568
You guys have three rappers on your block, right?

1831
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:06,609
You'll need to get more rappers.

1832
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,738
What's your plan?

1833
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:08,909
The three of us will keep going.

1834
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:09,979
You guys are bold. That's cool.

1835
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:13,049
But I'm not sure if there will be an advantage.

1836
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,710
But it's better to have more rappers.

1837
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:18,380
We talked to a lot of rappers about our situation.

1838
01:25:18,949 --> 01:25:20,749
"I'm envious." Was that it?

1839
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:21,919
I don't think.

1840
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,920
(Kaogaii spots Block 5.)

1841
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,720
Are you guys in a bad mood?

1842
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,430
- No. - No.

1843
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:27,529
We have a lot on our minds.

1844
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,358
We have to think about our next step and it's a serious matter.

1845
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,828
Whether or not to split or stick together?

1846
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:33,970
There are a lot of things to consider.

1847
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:38,640
But you guys have a lot of money.

1848
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,539
I suddenly got a brilliant idea.

1849
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,578
(Starting with the next match, the audience will vote.)

1850
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:48,010
(securing enough Block Money will be important.)

1851
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:54,549
They told us it was advantageous to have a lot of Block Money.

1852
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,188
They said only yesterday that money would be important.

1853
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:58,759
Money will be very important.

1854
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,389
- Right. - It wasn't important so far.

1855
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,460
It will be now.

1856
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:04,429
We'll need Block Money for the next performance.

1857
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,728
Maybe, we'll be able to buy a chance to survive on the show.

1858
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,239
I see. To survive?

1859
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,738
(Current Block Money Ranking)

1860
01:26:10,739 --> 01:26:12,068
(Block 1:43,000 dollars, Block 4:40,000 dollars, )

1861
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,509
(Block 3:36,000 dollars, Block 5:30,000 dollars, )

1862
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:14,970
(Block 2:29,000 dollars, Block 6:27,000 dollars)

1863
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:18,810
Okay.

1864
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,449
Hey.

1865
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,420
Listen. Block Five has a lot of money.

1866
01:26:29,989 --> 01:26:31,759
We can try to recruit OSUN with the money.

1867
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,989
That way, we'll be in first place.

1868
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:34,959
If you want to recruit OSUN,

1869
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,228
you have to get the other two's permission.

1870
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:37,759
Right. I need to feel them out for that.

1871
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,828
I can test out the waters.

1872
01:26:38,829 --> 01:26:40,229
- But... Hey. - But still.

1873
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:42,369
- But not OSUN. - What?

1874
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:43,869
How about Hash Swan?

1875
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,438
- Hash Swan? - Yes. If we're going to battle...

1876
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:49,078
- And to balance out our team... - Right.

1877
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,909
Our rap style is intense and rough.

1878
01:26:51,609 --> 01:26:52,909
If he can loosen up the mood...

1879
01:26:52,949 --> 01:26:54,549
Hash Swan with 30,000 dollars.

1880
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:56,180
We must get Hash Swan with 30,000 dollars.

1881
01:26:56,819 --> 01:26:58,549
For our block and the money,

1882
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:01,188
I thought we should recruit Hash Swan.

1883
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:03,259
(Block 6 pulls Hash Swan aside to ask his intention.)

1884
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,059
How is it going? Will you guys split up?

1885
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,489
- Yes. - You'll split up?

1886
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,398
Well, but at this rate,

1887
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:12,629
if other blocks maintain the status quo, the three of us...

1888
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,028
will have to continue.

1889
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:16,469
- Say there are no restrictions. - Yes.

1890
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,199
If you could pick any block, then which team would you join?

1891
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:21,109
- Be honest. - You should be honest now.

1892
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,680
Actually, I would want to join this block.

1893
01:27:23,909 --> 01:27:26,310
It'd be great if you joined our block too.

1894
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:28,278
The best scenario would be getting you and the money.

1895
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:29,749
That way, we'll be in first place.

1896
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,849
That too.

1897
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:33,288
Based on who takes the money and to which block he takes it,

1898
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,549
first place will change.

1899
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:37,318
But the problem is that if I were to join you guys,

1900
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,728
I doubt I would be able to bring the money.

1901
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:40,129
Is it OSUN's call?

1902
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,889
How is it going? How will you split the money?

1903
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,029
If I were to join you guys,

1904
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,569
the only option they have would be Block Two.

1905
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:51,970
With that said, the only thing they can offer to Block Two...

1906
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,470
It would be money?

1907
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,239
There's a risk in every decision.

1908
01:27:57,279 --> 01:27:59,350
We need to talk with Block Two.

1909
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,049
Lose them, and it'll be the end of us.

1910
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:03,019
(Block 5 has gathered in the square again.)

1911
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,618
Are you okay with it?

1912
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:07,149
Us two going to Block Two,

1913
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,559
- and you leaving with the money. - I'm fine with it.

1914
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,389
If you had to choose, isn't that the better choice?

1915
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,728
- Yes. - You'll be taking the money too.

1916
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:18,829
Scattering to different blocks while respecting each other...

1917
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:21,970
is the best choice.

1918
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:25,068
If you take 30,000 dollars of Block Money,

1919
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:26,809
your new block will be happy.

1920
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:27,840
(Block 6)

1921
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,639
Does Block Two want to...

1922
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,879
recruit more rappers than gain more Block Money?

1923
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,578
- No, they want money. - Block Two wants money.

1924
01:28:34,579 --> 01:28:37,979
- Right? - Should I just put down my pride?

1925
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:43,859
I should volunteer to become an elimination candidate, right?

1926
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,889
There's nothing we can do as we want to.

1927
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:47,890
I know.

1928
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:51,630
Where's KHAN? Spare me a minute.

1929
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,699
You have 6 rappers, right? Are you going to recruit 2 more?

1930
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:56,270
Are you sticking with six?

1931
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,269
- No matter what? Until the end? - Yes.

1932
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:00,369
Do you know what's stupid about this?

1933
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:04,108
You can recruit the two and eliminate them if your block loses.

1934
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:05,179
That's true.

1935
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:07,978
(Kaogaii confirms Block 2 has no intention to recruit rappers.)

1936
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:10,078
- This won't end. - How come?

1937
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:13,318
Block 2 has 6 members but won't recruit more.

1938
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:15,618
They don't want the two rappers. Then...

1939
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:18,288
Block 2 plans to continue with 6 members.

1940
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:21,929
At that rate, we can't bring Hash Swan and some Block Money.

1941
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,760
The block will remain.

1942
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:26,069
From what I see, sticking to our members is the best option.

1943
01:29:27,369 --> 01:29:30,238
To prepare for the next match well, we needed Block Money.

1944
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,709
Compared to other blocks, we didn't have much money.

1945
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,839
(Current Block Money Ranking)

1946
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,369
Our block is almost in last place.

1947
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:37,279
We're in last place.

1948
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:40,278
We really are in last place.

1949
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:44,249
Depending on how those rappers move, the ranking will change.

1950
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,350
I'm talking about Block 5 and 30,000 dollars.

1951
01:29:47,789 --> 01:29:51,288
Is taking 30,000 dollars from Block 5 the right thing to do?

1952
01:29:51,289 --> 01:29:52,488
- The right thing... - JTONG.

1953
01:29:52,489 --> 01:29:56,599
Looking at the situation, Block Five had a lot of Block Money.

1954
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,659
They had 30,000 dollars.

1955
01:29:58,869 --> 01:30:01,068
If the leader moves blocks,

1956
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:03,438
they can bring the Block Money with them.

1957
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,269
When our last match ended, it was announced that...

1958
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:08,538
(Loopy talks about the importance of Block Money.)

1959
01:30:08,539 --> 01:30:10,840
money would be crucial in the next match.

1960
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:12,809
Because Loopy brought it up,

1961
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,979
I realized I didn't think about that.

1962
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:18,249
Use our brains well, and we might easily climb up the ranks.

1963
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,889
I want to hear about everything.

1964
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,689
- Please listen to my idea. - Okay.

1965
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:24,059
Loopy and I just thought things through.

1966
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,359
Money is important in the next match.

1967
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:29,600
I'll ask OSUN to bring all the Block Money.

1968
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:32,699
- OSUN? - Block Money is really critical...

1969
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:34,599
- in the next match. - Let's recruit OSUN.

1970
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,538
The other blocks have a lot of money.

1971
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:38,299
We need to take all the money...

1972
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,739
to proceed with our next plan.

1973
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:43,479
That's the direction we're heading.

1974
01:30:48,449 --> 01:30:50,979
- Bring the Block Money with you. - But seriously...

1975
01:30:53,689 --> 01:30:56,019
- JP and I will be the ones left. - Right.

1976
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,590
Can we join your block together?

1977
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,229
If you want to join, it'll be only you and the money.

1978
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:03,199
That's the toughest offer.

1979
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,999
Are there no blocks wanting JP?

1980
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,569
Please think about us joining this block together again.

1981
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,239
- Our block... - The both of you joining?

1982
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,609
Isn't it okay?

1983
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,509
So what do we want?

1984
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:17,339
- Money. Money all the way. - That's it.

1985
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,350
(Block 2 will recruit OSUN and JP if they bring the Block Money.)

1986
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:21,249
- Come here. - KHAN. See me for a second.

1987
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,380
(Kaogaii wants to talk to KHAN again.)

1988
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,050
Do you not want to work with OSUN and JP?

1989
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,448
No, we asked them to...

1990
01:31:27,449 --> 01:31:28,750
- Bring the Block Money? - Yes.

1991
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:30,618
We won't recruit if they don't bring it.

1992
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:33,158
- There's no end to this. - You too, right?

1993
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:35,130
We told Hash Swan to bring us the money.

1994
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,599
- But only one rapper can take it. - Exactly.

1995
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,569
At this rate, it'll be an endless cycle.

1996
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:41,270
Here's the problem.

1997
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:45,300
Block Two won't recruit these two if they don't bring the money.

1998
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,868
- Gosh. - Then look.

1999
01:31:46,869 --> 01:31:50,209
For Hash Swan to bring the money, the leader must be replaced.

2000
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:53,379
Say that it happens. But if the two don't leave, nothing works.

2001
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,409
Hey.

2002
01:31:54,649 --> 01:31:57,319
- We should quickly... - Here's what I think.

2003
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:02,590
- Block Two won't tell you that. - Tell me what?

2004
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,219
- KHAN? - He could be...

2005
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,959
He's asking for a fight.

2006
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,228
- How can you believe him? - Are you talking about KHAN?

2007
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:10,328
- KHAN is not that smart. - No, he isn't.

2008
01:32:10,329 --> 01:32:11,960
You're not smart either.

2009
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:15,099
(You're not smart either.)

2010
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,139
You've changed.

2011
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,299
No. You're not smart either.

2012
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,500
- I mean... - Think about it.

2013
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:20,939
Come with me, ShyboiiTobii.

2014
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,849
- The two can't bring the money. - Sorry?

2015
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,448
We need to let them be. Why?

2016
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:30,978
Hash Swan is thinking of moving blocks with the money.

2017
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:33,319
Nobody can move blocks right now.

2018
01:32:33,489 --> 01:32:34,550
Right? That's what I mean.

2019
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,319
Should I go? Should I?

2020
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,658
- Really? - That's what I think.

2021
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:43,159
- Wasn't that favorable? - It was.

2022
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:44,430
Do you have an empty seat?

2023
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:48,699
ShyboiiTobii. Will you reject the two if they don't have money?

2024
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,938
Have a seat. You need to fill the spots.

2025
01:32:52,939 --> 01:32:54,368
We want to recruit Hash Swan.

2026
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:56,778
Honestly, we want Hash Swan and the money.

2027
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,639
You want Hash Swan...

2028
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,749
to bring the money with him, right?

2029
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,478
- Yes. - We also want that.

2030
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:04,978
That was why I asked if the two could join with the money.

2031
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,118
Yes, they can.

2032
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:08,420
Will you not accept them if they don't have the money?

2033
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:13,459
You must take the remaining two when the leader changes...

2034
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,688
so that we can bring Hash Swan.

2035
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:18,130
We're in a similar situation.

2036
01:33:18,529 --> 01:33:21,068
Block Six won't yield to us.

2037
01:33:21,069 --> 01:33:23,669
Each block needs to make a move more beneficial to them.

2038
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,840
With that, there were no agreements.

2039
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,038
It's the same thing repeating over and over again.

2040
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:30,979
- Everyone has the same idea. - Okay. Listen to me.

2041
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:32,408
- Block 5 has 30,000 dollars. - Yes.

2042
01:33:32,409 --> 01:33:34,578
- Can't we split it in half? - We can't.

2043
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:35,719
With the Beef Challenge.

2044
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,050
(With the Beef Challenge.)

2045
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:39,350
- What? - Wait. That's possible.

2046
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:41,619
That was when Mckdaddy's cleverness shined through.

2047
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:45,260
Using the Beef Challenge, let's split the Block Money.

2048
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:48,589
Hey. Beef Challenge.

2049
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:49,799
There's Beef Challenge.

2050
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,629
- What's that? - You choose someone and diss them.

2051
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:54,970
We're betting with our Block Money.

2052
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:57,769
The main is the block. The sub is the Beef Challenge.

2053
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,269
The purpose of Beef Challenge...

2054
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:01,868
- is to win the money. - It's to take the money.

2055
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:04,679
"The chosen block or rapper must counterattack."

2056
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,749
- This is intense. - It's not right away.

2057
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,749
The counterattack isn't right away.

2058
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,578
But the other rapper might not counterattack.

2059
01:34:10,579 --> 01:34:12,318
If there's no counterattack,

2060
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:14,089
half of the betting money must be given to the block.

2061
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:16,318
Half if there's no counterattack, but the whole if we lose.

2062
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:17,619
It seems like it.

2063
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:21,659
"If all four slots are full, no more Beef Challenges can be held."

2064
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:24,260
It's whether or not you'll take the risk.

2065
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:26,698
Can't the blocks work as a team, keep the slots open,

2066
01:34:26,699 --> 01:34:29,339
and earn Block Money by settling it together?

2067
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:30,869
The maximum is four slots.

2068
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,709
We can split it with the Beef Challenge.

2069
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,469
We'll challenge them, but they won't counterattack?

2070
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:37,478
- That's brilliant. - You're a genius.

2071
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:38,809
- Goodness. - Is that possible?

2072
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:40,179
That's how the Beef Challenge works.

2073
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,278
Here's an example.

2074
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:44,448
Hash Swan brings 30,000 dollars from Block 6 to our block.

2075
01:34:44,449 --> 01:34:45,919
You want 15,000, right?

2076
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,449
You get us to do the Beef Challenge with 3 of the 5,000 dollars.

2077
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:50,219
Three of the 5,000 dollars.

2078
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:53,389
- Kaogaii will definitely accept it. - No, we won't.

2079
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,959
- Is it a promise? - We'll use the rule...

2080
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,528
to split the money.

2081
01:34:56,529 --> 01:34:58,229
How about we give you 20,000 dollars?

2082
01:34:59,029 --> 01:35:01,028
Two thousand dollars? Are we negotiating now?

2083
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,339
You can take the money first. We trust you.

2084
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:04,999
Okay. I want my block to take the money first.

2085
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,239
Until now, we've had...

2086
01:35:07,609 --> 01:35:10,839
- clean matches. - Okay. We're in.

2087
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,148
- Can we do that? - Think of the situation.

2088
01:35:13,149 --> 01:35:14,279
You understood, right?

2089
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:16,750
We've finally come to an agreement.

2090
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:18,578
(Hash Swan to Block 6)

2091
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:19,949
You take 30,000 dollars.

2092
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:21,919
Four of us will ask for a Beef Challenge...

2093
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,318
worth 5,000 dollars each.

2094
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:26,828
Reject it, and we'll get 2,500 dollars each.

2095
01:35:26,829 --> 01:35:28,659
With that, we'll receive 10,000 dollars.

2096
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:30,929
You take 20,000 dollars. We'll take 10,000 dollars.

2097
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:33,068
(Block 2:20,000 dollars, Block 6:10,000 dollars)

2098
01:35:33,069 --> 01:35:34,069
Nice.

2099
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:36,839
Kaogaii's team has 27,000 dollars.

2100
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,310
They have the least amount of money. We agreed to...

2101
01:35:40,739 --> 01:35:42,908
He brought us the plan...

2102
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:45,408
of splitting the money with another block.

2103
01:35:45,409 --> 01:35:47,279
With that, we started a discussion.

2104
01:35:47,779 --> 01:35:52,020
It'll be an automatic transfer of money through the Beef Challenge.

2105
01:35:52,489 --> 01:35:55,350
We're using the Beef Challenge like a bank.

2106
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,959
- We... - Let's trust each other.

2107
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,728
I'm sorry. We're running out of time.

2108
01:35:59,729 --> 01:36:00,959
- Let's go. - All right.

2109
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:01,960
Let's go.

2110
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:04,760
- We're going as planned. - Is that so?

2111
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:07,329
- Let me tell the guys. - Okay.

2112
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,139
I'll move blocks first.

2113
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,499
- Okay. - I'm going now.

2114
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,908
Yes, we've heard.

2115
01:36:12,909 --> 01:36:14,670
- Okay. - Great work.

2116
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,108
- I'll see you again. - Of course. Good luck.

2117
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:18,340
- Thanks. - Good luck.

2118
01:36:18,909 --> 01:36:19,948
Kaogaii.

2119
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:21,249
(Choice Block)

2120
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:23,719
I will move from Block 5 to Block 6.

2121
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,189
JP will move to Block Two.

2122
01:36:26,649 --> 01:36:28,890
I will move to Block Two.

2123
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,358
(Block 5, Block 6)

2124
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:32,259
(Hash Swan moves to Block 6.)

2125
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:33,328
(Block 5, Block 2)

2126
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,358
(OSUN and JP move to Block 6.)

2127
01:36:34,359 --> 01:36:35,899
(Block 5 is closed.)

2128
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:38,599
Hey.

2129
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,930
- We have a lot of Block Money. - Goodness.

2130
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,770
(ShyboiiTobii)

2131
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,909
We have a lot of money.

2132
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:49,179
- It's heavy. - We're rich.

2133
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,339
Money bag.

2134
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:51,839
- Money bag. - Yes, sir.

2135
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,349
- Money bag, sunny. - Money bag.

2136
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,549
- Here's 30,000 dollars. - It's 30,000 dollars.

2137
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,750
- Yes, 30,000 dollars. - Good job, ShyboiiTobii.

2138
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:01,749
- Great job me. - You lived up as a leader.

2139
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,988
I did, right away.

2140
01:37:02,989 --> 01:37:04,489
Yes, we have 59,000 dollars.

2141
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,158
It's changing. It's changed.

2142
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:08,759
(Block 2's Block Money, from 29,000 to 59,000 dollars)

2143
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,358
(Current Block Money Ranking)

2144
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:13,670
(1. Block 2, 2. Block 1, 3. Block 4, 4. Block 3, 5. Block 6)

2145
01:37:14,069 --> 01:37:16,669
- You must be rich. - Our safe is looking nice.

2146
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,939
They've got 59,000 dollars. You're earning more and more.

2147
01:37:20,109 --> 01:37:22,109
Block Two is the scariest.

2148
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:26,309
We beat Block Two in the Block Competition yesterday.

2149
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,509
But Block 2 came in 1st place.

2150
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:29,818
Those guys are smart.

2151
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:30,819
I got jealous.

2152
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:34,719
They now have an incredible amount of money,

2153
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,419
and the block looks solid.

2154
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:39,059
Block Two needs to be held in check now.

2155
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,828
With the most Block Money, they have the upper hand.

2156
01:37:41,829 --> 01:37:44,600
We have to come up with a good strategy.

2157
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,929
All that's left is to win.

2158
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:51,568
I'm confident we'll become the strongest block.

2159
01:37:51,569 --> 01:37:52,839
(Block 6)

2160
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,108
- Smart. - Good.

2161
01:37:54,109 --> 01:37:55,809
We'll have four challenge your block.

2162
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:56,978
- We won't respond. - Okay.

2163
01:37:56,979 --> 01:37:59,209
- We have to hurry up. - How about me, Jo Gwang Il,

2164
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:00,648
O'Domar, and JOONIE?

2165
01:38:00,649 --> 01:38:02,509
Faster than anyone, different than anyone

2166
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:04,049
I can't remember the lyrics.

2167
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:06,419
For two months, city after city

2168
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:07,948
- Like this. - Okay.

2169
01:38:07,949 --> 01:38:08,988
- The players? - Let's go.

2170
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:10,318
- This is all for show anyway. - It's done.

2171
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:11,859
- When do we do it? - Go challenge them.

2172
01:38:12,859 --> 01:38:14,028
Look.

2173
01:38:14,029 --> 01:38:16,429
Aren't they going for the Beef Challenge?

2174
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,659
(Choice Block)

2175
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:21,068
I challenge Block Two's Nosun to a Beef Challenge.

2176
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:22,799
Block Two's KHAN.

2177
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,969
Foggyatthebottom.

2178
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:28,339
I challenge Block Two's ShyboiiTobii to a Beef Challenge.

2179
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:30,979
The betting amount is 5,000 dollars.

2180
01:38:31,609 --> 01:38:35,510
All four slots of the Beef Challenge have been filled.

2181
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:39,220
No further Beef Challenges can be held.

2182
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,788
- Hi. - What's up?

2183
01:38:41,789 --> 01:38:44,189
I'm wondering if you have a plan.

2184
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,189
Yes, we do.

2185
01:38:46,489 --> 01:38:48,188
We're hoping you chose us.

2186
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:49,528
Look forward to it.

2187
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:51,960
- Did you really choose us? - Stop it.

2188
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:55,170
You'll know later.

2189
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,170
We would've done the same...

2190
01:38:57,239 --> 01:38:58,469
if we were in last place. Right?

2191
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:00,209
Are the slots already confirmed?

2192
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:02,068
- Yes. We got all four. - Are they confirmed?

2193
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:04,038
- Because we... - No.

2194
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:06,379
- Because we... - No. They...

2195
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,879
(Kaogaii stops ShyboiiTobii from talking.)

2196
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,778
- Were you trying to... - We're challenging them.

2197
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:13,020
- Should we not be here? - I can't lie because of you.

2198
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,250
I see.

2199
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,188
- HAON. - Are you challenging them?

2200
01:39:18,189 --> 01:39:20,389
No. I was just joking around when you showed up.

2201
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,629
- We're doing the Beef Challenge... - Yes?

2202
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:23,799
To split the money up.

2203
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:26,099
The condition is that Block 2 will get 30,000 dollars.

2204
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,469
In return, we'll ask for a Beef Challenge.

2205
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:31,270
If Block 2 gives up, we can get 10,000 dollars.

2206
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:34,568
Block 6 and Block 2...

2207
01:39:34,569 --> 01:39:36,739
made a deal...

2208
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:40,479
and got rid of the Beef Challenge risk.

2209
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,880
That was a clever play.

2210
01:39:48,619 --> 01:39:49,619
That scared me.

2211
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,890
What is it? I was about to take my contacts out and sleep.

2212
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,589
- What? - It's a Beef Challenge.

2213
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,930
What? Beef Challenge?

2214
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:58,560
- Is it a Beef Challenge? - It's a Beef Challenge.

2215
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,599
(Block 3)

2216
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,199
What? He's heading up.

2217
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,270
Let's watch him.

2218
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:08,868
The Beef Challenge will soon begin.

2219
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:11,140
- Yes! - Yes!

2220
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,709
Finally. Who challenged who?

2221
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:15,109
Because of what grudge?

2222
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,020
I'm getting another dopamine rush.

2223
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,489
It's addicting.

2224
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:22,420
I was dying to know how it was going to be held.

2225
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:24,720
The member asking for a Beef Challenge...

2226
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,060
is Block Six's O'Domar.

2227
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:29,930
- Let's go! - Goodness.

2228
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,028
The rapper who was pointed out...

2229
01:40:32,029 --> 01:40:34,470
is Block Two's Nosun.

2230
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:37,099
I didn't see this coming.

2231
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,199
It's finally on.

2232
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,738
The rise and fall of hip-hop

2233
01:40:40,739 --> 01:40:42,209
The shape that outran my life

2234
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:43,538
The line between culture and industry

2235
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:44,839
Everyone in this room is a slave

2236
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,608
Show me Dingo Freestyle, the melody is on again

2237
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:50,278
The cause of death of a cold dead rapper is no problem

2238
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:52,988
The media's rerun makes dreamers helpless

2239
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:54,749
Revolution is streaming, it's outside

2240
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:56,659
Wake up now

2241
01:40:56,789 --> 01:41:01,729
(The first rapper, O'Domar's rap has ended.)

2242
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,429
But this is all planned out.

2243
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:07,228
Block 6 gave up on the money and let them go to Block 2.

2244
01:41:07,229 --> 01:41:08,368
Four will ask for a Beef Challenge.

2245
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:09,899
Block 2 will give 2,500 dollars each, a total of 10,000 dollars.

2246
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,569
It's like a transfer fee.

2247
01:41:11,939 --> 01:41:13,509
Under the condition of getting the rapper,

2248
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:15,709
Block 6 challenged 4 rappers to a Beef Challenge.

2249
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:16,908
- It's not a battle. - No.

2250
01:41:16,909 --> 01:41:19,010
- It's just like a money trade. - Yes.

2251
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,010
But they're playing smart.

2252
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,419
At first, I thought there would be some kind of beef.

2253
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:29,219
The team played it very strategically.

2254
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,090
Really...

2255
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:32,619
I was shocked at their idea.

2256
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,960
They were clever. It was a good decision.

2257
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:38,699
(Block 3)

2258
01:41:38,899 --> 01:41:41,930
They get 10,000 dollars. We'll be in last place with 1,000 dollars short.

2259
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:48,609
I don't like being in last place.

2260
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:53,909
What's up, man?

2261
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,019
- We're in last place. - Right.

2262
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:58,680
Our block will be 1,000 dollars short.

2263
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:00,988
Blocks 2 and 6 made a deal.

2264
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:04,220
Block 6 will get 10,000 dollars.

2265
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,229
Yes, that's what's going on.

2266
01:42:07,159 --> 01:42:10,560
In the end, we'll be starting at the most unfavorable position...

2267
01:42:11,229 --> 01:42:13,028
in the next match.

2268
01:42:13,029 --> 01:42:14,728
You needed to move first for the money to move.

2269
01:42:14,729 --> 01:42:16,368
Exactly.

2270
01:42:16,369 --> 01:42:17,470
- Really? - Yes.

2271
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:21,069
But if it ends like this, I'll feel like a fool. I don't like it.

2272
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:23,379
That's not true. Think about it.

2273
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,038
This was the only choice we had.

2274
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:26,179
- Is that so? - Yes.

2275
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:28,050
We're not closing the slots.

2276
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,949
Nobody else can challenge them.

2277
01:42:30,149 --> 01:42:31,920
- Do you get it? - All four are filled?

2278
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:35,249
Either way, Block 6 filled all 4 slots.

2279
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:36,488
The key point of this challenge...

2280
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:38,419
was the time difference.

2281
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:40,059
Had we filled all four slots,

2282
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,358
and Block Two were to reject two right away,

2283
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:43,799
two slots would've opened.

2284
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,659
(It ends if there's no counterattack within 24 hours.)

2285
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,800
Because of that, all slots were blocked.

2286
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,270
All four slots.

2287
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,869
Even if other members wanted to do the challenge, nobody could.

2288
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,479
Our members are on standby.

2289
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:58,239
So don't even think about it.

2290
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:01,349
Can't you be happy with taking SINCE?

2291
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:03,549
She's right. We racked our brains to come up with this.

2292
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:05,448
- You won yesterday's match. - Right?

2293
01:43:05,449 --> 01:43:07,119
It'll make everyone happy.

2294
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,760
It's starting.

2295
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:11,519
Again?

2296
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,989
The member asking for a Beef Challenge...

2297
01:43:14,529 --> 01:43:17,329
is Block Six's Kohway.

2298
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,299
The rapper who was pointed out...

2299
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,770
is Block Two's KHAN.

2300
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:23,270
Kohway, go away.

2301
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:25,769
(Kohway sings and doesn't do a diss rap.)

2302
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:29,438
I'm a swallow who will dash after a pause

2303
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:31,209
- What? - Both of my feet are off

2304
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:32,539
- Yes. - For real?

2305
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:35,449
- Kaogaii. Is this planned out? - There are

2306
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:36,919
- All sorts - This is for real.

2307
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,449
- Is it really a simple diss? - Just do it

2308
01:43:38,619 --> 01:43:40,550
I'm on the reverse

2309
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:43,390
Did you hear me, KHAN?

2310
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,119
Kohway, no way.

2311
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,090
I'll tell you since it's all set.

2312
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,828
If we four ask for a Beef Challenge...

2313
01:43:51,829 --> 01:43:53,969
of 5,000 dollars each, we will get 2,500 each...

2314
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,130
if rejected. It'll be a total of 10,000 dollars.

2315
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:57,698
That's how we'll gain money.

2316
01:43:57,699 --> 01:43:59,398
- You two made a deal. - But we've got no energy...

2317
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:01,139
for a Beef Challenge.

2318
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:03,309
What's the difference between us?

2319
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,078
- Around 1,000 dollars. - Is it exactly 1,000?

2320
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:06,210
Yes. We're second last.

2321
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:08,579
All the slots are filled right now.

2322
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,920
There's nothing that can be done.

2323
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,020
Hey, Foggyatthebottom. Get up.

2324
01:44:13,649 --> 01:44:15,188
Foggyatthebottom, get your butt up.

2325
01:44:15,189 --> 01:44:16,390
What happened?

2326
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:18,158
Get your butt up.

2327
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:20,858
For two months, city after city

2328
01:44:20,859 --> 01:44:23,499
My body feels like a working factory

2329
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,728
I'm low on energy

2330
01:44:24,729 --> 01:44:27,269
I'm a phone on low battery, my Red Bull

2331
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:29,170
- If we can't earn money, - No sugar, low calorie

2332
01:44:29,369 --> 01:44:31,139
we'll have them stay at the bottom.

2333
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,409
We need to maintain our credit as much as possible.

2334
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:35,239
You try, but it doesn't work, don't disagree

2335
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:38,140
- Then... - Where's Foggyatthebottom?

2336
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,978
You'll give up near the end, right?

2337
01:44:39,979 --> 01:44:41,309
Why do you ask? What is it?

2338
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:43,319
We'll end up ranking last place.

2339
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:44,750
Why didn't you come to our block?

2340
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:48,449
The situation would be different.

2341
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,188
HAON kept moving around busily.

2342
01:44:52,189 --> 01:44:53,658
As soon as he became the leader,

2343
01:44:53,659 --> 01:44:56,229
he wanted to do something for the block.

2344
01:44:56,329 --> 01:44:59,229
Do whatever you want. We'll support you.

2345
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,999
You're really cool. You're doing great as a leader.

2346
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,368
The member asking for a Beef Challenge...

2347
01:45:04,369 --> 01:45:05,939
is Jo Gwang Il.

2348
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:09,009
The rapper who was pointed out...

2349
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:11,238
is ShyboiiTobii.

2350
01:45:11,239 --> 01:45:12,479
(Block 6 Jo Gwang Il chooses Block 2 ShyboiiTobii.)

2351
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:16,448
(The fourth Beef Challenge fills the last slot.)

2352
01:45:16,449 --> 01:45:17,948
I do it properly with my tension

2353
01:45:17,949 --> 01:45:19,618
But all my raps are done with my senses

2354
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:22,288
The rappers criticizing me all become losers

2355
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:25,788
There's the smell of blood, Po tells me, "Don't talk"

2356
01:45:25,789 --> 01:45:28,930
(Jo Gwang Il ends the Beef Challenge with a fast rap.)

2357
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:31,529
That was super fast.

2358
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:33,699
It's a great strategy.

2359
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:35,569
It's too good that it makes me mad.

2360
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:38,499
We can ask Block Two to empty a slot...

2361
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:39,769
because it's their deal...

2362
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,339
- Right. - as they'll give up anyway.

2363
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,339
Let's ask Block Two to empty the slots.

2364
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:46,010
- We don't need all. One is enough. - Exactly.

2365
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:48,010
Five thousand dollars is more than enough.

2366
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:51,680
I made a sudden decision in my head.

2367
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,750
I decided to gain profit...

2368
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:59,890
from the deal made between Block 2 and Block 6.

2369
01:46:01,989 --> 01:46:03,629
Who are you going to challenge?

2370
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:06,358
- Who? - We can't do it. No slots are open.

2371
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:09,169
You want to make a deal with us, right? Since you'll rank last.

2372
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:11,198
Yes. We'll be 1,000 dollars short and rank last.

2373
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,840
Here's what I'm hoping. Block Two has the choice.

2374
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:15,709
Reject any of the challenges,

2375
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:18,179
one is enough, and we'll take care of it.

2376
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,680
Let's wait and see.

2377
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,550
- We'll take the long view. - In order.

2378
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:22,648
(Block 3)

2379
01:46:22,649 --> 01:46:24,549
I've talked with Block Two.

2380
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:26,920
I asked them to give us a reply.

2381
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:28,319
They might agree.

2382
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,689
- Okay, nice. - Nice.

2383
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:32,858
In that situation,

2384
01:46:32,859 --> 01:46:35,329
we tried to be hopeful.

2385
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:36,629
In the midst of all that.

2386
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:39,970
I quickly thought about what would be...

2387
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:41,630
the most beneficial to our block.

2388
01:46:42,369 --> 01:46:43,938
When is the slot opening again?

2389
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:45,699
No. It's when we reject the challenge.

2390
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,669
It became complicated.

2391
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:50,809
Kaogaii and HAON's blocks...

2392
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:53,948
depended on our choices.

2393
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:57,078
I tried really hard to get myself together.

2394
01:46:57,079 --> 01:46:58,948
Weren't you nervous? Didn't it make you nervous?

2395
01:46:58,949 --> 01:47:00,148
I was a bit nervous.

2396
01:47:00,149 --> 01:47:02,389
But I just did it.

2397
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:05,359
- It's do or die now. - Hold on.

2398
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,630
They might watch it.

2399
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:09,960
That's kind of... Come with me, Mckdaddy.

2400
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,459
They're being sweet-talked into doing it.

2401
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:14,399
They are. Block Three is sweet-talking them.

2402
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,828
Will you stick to the plan?

2403
01:47:15,829 --> 01:47:17,539
Or will you betray and keep the money?

2404
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:20,309
I'm here to urge them to betray you.

2405
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,310
I see.

2406
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:24,409
That's what Block Three is doing.

2407
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,779
- Block Three? - Yes.

2408
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,908
Block 3 is sweet-talking Block 2.

2409
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:29,679
They're coming in between us, right? To make you do it.

2410
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,680
Yes.

2411
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,479
- See that? - Who is?

2412
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,590
- The two old guys here. - Did they tell us to do it?

2413
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:38,219
- Don't do it. - How much do you have?

2414
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,129
- You took SINCE, Reddy. - What?

2415
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:42,630
Stop being so greedy, Reddy.

2416
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:46,629
You see, we don't have much money either.

2417
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:47,729
You have SINCE.

2418
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:49,368
Here's what I told SINCE.

2419
01:47:49,369 --> 01:47:51,770
- "Do whatever you feel is right." - I see.

2420
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:53,939
It was emotionally hard on her.

2421
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:55,939
Everyone has it tough.

2422
01:47:56,609 --> 01:47:59,139
- They did. And then, we... - You won't, right?

2423
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,679
Honestly, we've got zero energy.

2424
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,249
Let's end it here.

2425
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:04,019
But we'll rank last by a 1,000-dollar margin.

2426
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,379
You still have SINCE.

2427
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:06,618
Is SINCE not worth 1,000 dollars?

2428
01:48:06,619 --> 01:48:07,819
- You're right. - Right?

2429
01:48:09,989 --> 01:48:13,688
The fact that we had the least Block Money bothered me.

2430
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:16,059
There was more I could show...

2431
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:18,398
as a leader.

2432
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:19,760
How do I...

2433
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:25,068
innovatively gather money and raise my block's ranking?

2434
01:48:25,069 --> 01:48:28,209
How am I going to make that happen? I contemplated a lot...

2435
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:29,309
by myself.

2436
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:32,409
Your block is in panic since you'll rank last in Block Money.

2437
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:35,948
Right now, HAON is completely...

2438
01:48:35,949 --> 01:48:38,349
Seriously. They won you over.

2439
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:39,520
They're so greedy.

2440
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,318
It seems like Chaboom is coming up with a plan.

2441
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:45,889
But this is how far we go. Let's trust them.

2442
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:48,729
If they do break our promise, we'll just go with it.

2443
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,728
Foggyatthebottom. It's free money.

2444
01:48:50,729 --> 01:48:52,430
Win 4 times, and it's 20,000 dollars.

2445
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,799
- You're right. - What is it?

2446
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,969
What do you mean? Give me a minute.

2447
01:48:57,970 --> 01:49:00,339
Or if you can open up a slot...

2448
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:02,639
a few minutes earlier like it was an accident.

2449
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,778
Block Two will lose nothing from it.

2450
01:49:05,779 --> 01:49:07,579
Honestly, I'm anxious.

2451
01:49:07,649 --> 01:49:09,920
I might be making myself anxious.

2452
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:11,979
But Block Three must be panicking.

2453
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:13,949
I need to lie down.

2454
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:18,260
- I can... - Nice.

2455
01:49:19,189 --> 01:49:21,658
- I can make an interesting scene. - Yes.

2456
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:23,300
If you and I make a deal.

2457
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,599
Or you can do it alone.

2458
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,029
One counterattack is enough.

2459
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,068
HAON's expression from the square.

2460
01:49:30,069 --> 01:49:32,698
He was upset that they were going to rank last place.

2461
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:33,710
I get it.

2462
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:37,609
But I didn't like any of that.

2463
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:41,148
Frankly, Block Two is in the most favorable situation.

2464
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:44,549
- Right. - You should stick to our deal.

2465
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,488
It's your decision to make.

2466
01:49:47,489 --> 01:49:48,919
- Hey, stop it. - You...

2467
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,619
- HAON. - It's a well-known fact.

2468
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,689
Block Two won't betray us, will they?

2469
01:49:53,789 --> 01:49:55,459
Block Two? They'll never betray us.

2470
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:57,599
If they do, they're our enemies.

2471
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,060
I'll make them pay for it.

2472
01:49:59,329 --> 01:50:01,368
Honestly, I feel uneasy about it.

2473
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:04,840
It's a clever idea, but it makes me so anxious.

2474
01:50:05,239 --> 01:50:06,938
I think I kept trying to figure out what they were thinking.

2475
01:50:06,939 --> 01:50:08,539
Because there was nothing I could do.

2476
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:12,009
- We should write the lyrics fast. - Are you going to betray us?

2477
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:14,050
- Yes. - What the heck?

2478
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:15,879
Hey.

2479
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:19,478
Why do they keep making us anxious?

2480
01:50:19,479 --> 01:50:21,448
I was passing by and saw KHAN with other people.

2481
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:23,249
"We're confident." I heard him say something like this.

2482
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,788
- It'll be about the next mission. - Yes.

2483
01:50:24,789 --> 01:50:26,788
- Right? - We should just trust them.

2484
01:50:26,789 --> 01:50:28,260
Don't even doubt it.

2485
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:33,060
Geegooin, you look so worried.

2486
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:36,899
Block Two will definitely stay loyal.

2487
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:38,469
If not, it means they betrayed us.

2488
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:40,340
Let me talk with KHAN to make sure.

2489
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:43,108
- Have you eaten? - Sorry?

2490
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:45,209
- Have you eaten? - Why do you look tired?

2491
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:47,310
- This is killing me. - Really?

2492
01:50:47,609 --> 01:50:50,719
Hey, you'll never open the slot, will you?

2493
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,719
- Sorry? - You'll never open the slot, right?

2494
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,789
I don't know.

2495
01:50:54,119 --> 01:50:55,189
(Sighing)

2496
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:57,560
Please.

2497
01:50:57,989 --> 01:50:59,919
- Come here. - Please.

2498
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,658
- You too. - Come on.

2499
01:51:01,659 --> 01:51:03,189
I want to rest without worries.

2500
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:04,960
Let's seal the deal.

2501
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,129
- Let's finish it here. - Seriously.

2502
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:08,529
Oh, gosh.

2503
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:12,538
- Where do you want to sit? - We agreed on it.

2504
01:51:12,539 --> 01:51:14,068
Please help us.

2505
01:51:14,069 --> 01:51:15,438
We agreed on it anyway.

2506
01:51:15,439 --> 01:51:18,038
Yes. We tried to earn trust. We gave you a lot of money.

2507
01:51:18,039 --> 01:51:20,849
Honestly, I'm so offended.

2508
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:22,108
Because we trusted you.

2509
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:24,019
I'm honestly mad because you suddenly changed your attitude,

2510
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:25,050
but I'm sorry.

2511
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,479
I'm serious.

2512
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,288
If we get our phones later, I'll deposit some money...

2513
01:51:28,289 --> 01:51:29,688
into your account. Have a get-together or something.

2514
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:32,288
I mean it. I really do.

2515
01:51:32,289 --> 01:51:33,929
- I really want you to do it. - How much will you pay?

2516
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:35,858
- What? - Two hundred dollars is enough.

2517
01:51:35,859 --> 01:51:37,260
He offered 200 dollars.

2518
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:38,429
Is that not enough?

2519
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,469
But I can't give you 1,000 dollars.

2520
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:42,800
I'm doing this without telling my wife.

2521
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:45,339
He's having weird thoughts.

2522
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,539
Honestly, I'm so disappointed...

2523
01:51:47,739 --> 01:51:49,608
- because it was a deal. - Exactly.

2524
01:51:49,609 --> 01:51:51,078
Why should we beg you?

2525
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:52,810
(Sighing)

2526
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,250
Well...

2527
01:51:54,979 --> 01:51:56,608
As Mckdaddy said, we made a deal.

2528
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:59,078
We should be equal partners.

2529
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:01,219
We're upset as well because we don't have a lot of Block Money.

2530
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,249
You guys have the most money.

2531
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,759
We're just 1,000 dollars richer than the last place.

2532
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,389
What I really want to tell you is...

2533
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,688
that it could've been the other way when we made a deal.

2534
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:10,059
But since you couldn't trust us,

2535
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:12,898
- we let you choose on your own. - Right.

2536
01:52:12,899 --> 01:52:15,769
That's why we feel nervous until the end.

2537
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:17,868
- Think how painful it would be. - It's so hard.

2538
01:52:17,869 --> 01:52:19,839
- It was a deal. - That's what I'm saying.

2539
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,209
So please help us, KHAN.

2540
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:24,608
We want to take a rest comfortably even just for 30 minutes.

2541
01:52:24,609 --> 01:52:26,709
I want to seal the deal. But it seems you think differently.

2542
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:28,749
Honestly, it doesn't make me want to punch you, even though it does,

2543
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,319
because you're older than me.

2544
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:33,618
Not opening a slot doesn't mean you're betraying Block Three.

2545
01:52:33,619 --> 01:52:35,288
- It's just a deal. - It's just to keep our promise.

2546
01:52:35,289 --> 01:52:36,318
It's just a promise between us.

2547
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:37,959
What you promised to Block Three is helping them.

2548
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,659
I'll follow the older guys' opinions then.

2549
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,430
(What will Block 2 choose?)

2550
01:52:46,869 --> 01:52:48,600
(Loopy comes to HAON after finishing the conversation.)

2551
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:50,439
You didn't come to conclusions, did you?

2552
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,439
What I can tell you about that is...

2553
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,839
that we considered your request seriously.

2554
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:02,479
But in conclusion, we decided to keep the prior promise.

2555
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,720
But I think...

2556
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,988
- They're right. - They're right. Because...

2557
01:53:08,989 --> 01:53:11,188
we were going to do the Beef Challenge for Block Money.

2558
01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:13,488
But we didn't have to be stressed out and saved our energy...

2559
01:53:13,489 --> 01:53:15,788
because of our deal.

2560
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:17,529
So it's right for us to keep the promise.

2561
01:53:17,729 --> 01:53:21,669
Is there a way to make a deal with you without breaking off...

2562
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:23,899
the negotiations with them? I thought about it, but there's none.

2563
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:29,568
This is everything I can say to you for now.

2564
01:53:29,569 --> 01:53:32,739
I think this is the right thing.

2565
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:33,949
I got it.

2566
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:37,118
They won't open the slot.

2567
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,449
- Until the end? - Yes.

2568
01:53:38,619 --> 01:53:40,550
They won't open it because of their prior promise.

2569
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:43,960
Gosh, it means we...

2570
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:59,799
Actually, I understand Block Two because they'll lose nothing.

2571
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,139
- I know. - That's true.

2572
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:03,038
They don't have a reason to pull out of the deal.

2573
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:04,779
That's why I accepted it and came.

2574
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:08,550
But I'm going to talk to KHAN person to person.

2575
01:54:08,979 --> 01:54:10,049
He's nowhere to be found, though.

2576
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:11,920
Kaogaii made a smart move.

2577
01:54:13,989 --> 01:54:17,789
(HAON is looking for KHAN.)

2578
01:54:18,789 --> 01:54:19,819
KHAN!

2579
01:54:22,659 --> 01:54:24,399
Is it HAON?

2580
01:54:24,859 --> 01:54:25,929
KHAN!

2581
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:26,930
(Block 2)

2582
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:31,199
It seems Block Three is infuriated.

2583
01:54:31,539 --> 01:54:33,539
They're not children.

2584
01:54:33,869 --> 01:54:36,709
But actually, no one thought about using the Beef Challenge...

2585
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:39,038
until Mckdaddy mentioned it.

2586
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:40,078
Right.

2587
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:42,148
They haven't done it until now.

2588
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:43,249
(They haven't done the Beef Challenge until now.)

2589
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,818
Why haven't they done it before? It's ridiculous.

2590
01:54:45,819 --> 01:54:48,889
They said Block Money was important...

2591
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:50,220
for the mission.

2592
01:54:50,859 --> 01:54:54,789
If you think about it, this wouldn't have happened if SINCE hadn't left.

2593
01:54:55,729 --> 01:54:56,729
Chaboom.

2594
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:58,129
(Block 3)

2595
01:54:58,130 --> 01:54:59,560
I want to talk with HAON only.

2596
01:54:59,699 --> 01:55:00,800
I got it.

2597
01:55:02,529 --> 01:55:05,770
(Kaogaii and Geegooin call HAON privately.)

2598
01:55:05,869 --> 01:55:06,970
(Lounge)

2599
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:11,510
- In the end, you took SINCE, right? - Yes.

2600
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,709
I honestly feel like you're whining...

2601
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,809
after everything you've done.

2602
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:16,549
- That's my honest feeling. - Right. We're whining.

2603
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:17,719
Honestly,

2604
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,019
we don't want to be your enemies.

2605
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:22,889
- I got it. - This is a game anyway,

2606
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:25,188
but if it hurts our feelings for real...

2607
01:55:25,189 --> 01:55:26,688
That's not what I want.

2608
01:55:26,689 --> 01:55:29,389
Walking in your shoes, I understand you might feel that way.

2609
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:30,560
We were talking about it before we came.

2610
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,800
If I put myself in their shoes, I understand why they're mad.

2611
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:37,699
Let's talk it out with HAON.

2612
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:40,198
I talked with my blockmates just now.

2613
01:55:40,199 --> 01:55:45,379
Hearing it's right for them to keep the prior promise...

2614
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,938
made me understand to some extent.

2615
01:55:46,939 --> 01:55:49,049
- Did it make you feel better? - Yes. So...

2616
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:53,020
I take it that Block 6 and Block 2...

2617
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:55,250
played the game cleverly now.

2618
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,520
Because it's perfect defense.

2619
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,959
Yes. We did it for our block anyway.

2620
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,788
Because everyone will do that for their block.

2621
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:05,599
As I tried to change things as soon as possible,

2622
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:09,099
- I might've looked aggressive. - No. It's not like that at all.

2623
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:10,698
You were just immersed in the game.

2624
01:56:10,699 --> 01:56:13,368
- You didn't break the rules anyway. - Right.

2625
01:56:13,369 --> 01:56:16,409
"They just played well." That's what I thought,

2626
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:18,909
so I just want to make a nice move next time.

2627
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:22,210
I did create a scene. I had to do it for Block Three.

2628
01:56:22,409 --> 01:56:24,850
But thankfully, they wanted to talk it out first.

2629
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:26,750
I was thankful.

2630
01:56:27,489 --> 01:56:28,849
- I think it was best. - Yes.

2631
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:31,289
It's just a 1,000-dollar difference.

2632
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,688
It's okay. We'll do a good job.

2633
01:56:33,689 --> 01:56:35,629
- It turned out well anyway. - Yes.

2634
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:36,889
You worked hard.

2635
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:38,799
- We did our best. - Yes.

2636
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:39,959
We should just get ready...

2637
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,130
- for the next match. - Let's do that.

2638
01:56:41,569 --> 01:56:43,569
(Block 6 welcomes ShyboiiTobii whose hands are full of money.)

2639
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:46,300
It was a good business.

2640
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,640
- A good business. - Thank you for keeping the money.

2641
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:51,340
- Thank you. - It was good.

2642
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,949
Thanks.

2643
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:57,249
But in the end, it turned out the best for you guys.

2644
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:59,050
It was a gain for us anyway.

2645
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:00,818
Good luck.

2646
01:57:00,819 --> 01:57:01,949
- Let's go. - Bye.

2647
01:57:04,819 --> 01:57:05,959
It was really hard to earn this.

2648
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:08,489
It feels like we earned this money by doing manual labor.

2649
01:57:08,729 --> 01:57:10,129
It feels like we made 10,000 dollars by doing manual labor.

2650
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:11,629
Hash Swan brought it anyway.

2651
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:13,829
Right. That's so true. Money Swan.

2652
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:17,769
In the end, we gained everything we could.

2653
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:19,600
- That's right. - After doing everything we could.

2654
01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:21,969
(Current Block Money Ranking)

2655
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:23,038
(1st place: Block 2, 49,000 dollars)

2656
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:25,939
(4th place: Block 6, 37,000 dollars, 5th place: Block 3, 36,000 dollars)

2657
01:57:30,149 --> 01:57:32,079
Members of RAP: PUBLIC.

2658
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:35,550
After a fierce survival process,

2659
01:57:36,289 --> 01:57:40,659
there are now five blocks remaining here.

2660
01:57:41,529 --> 01:57:45,630
You no longer have an opportunity to recruit new rappers...

2661
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:49,270
or replace your leaders.

2662
01:57:49,699 --> 01:57:51,439
It's over. This is the final lineup.

2663
01:57:51,539 --> 01:57:52,769
We won't be separated now.

2664
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:55,539
- We'll stay together until the end. - Yes.

2665
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:57,068
It's a good timing.

2666
01:57:57,069 --> 01:58:00,749
- It's a good timing. - My gosh. I love you.

2667
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:03,278
- You don't have to pack your bags. - No.

2668
01:58:03,279 --> 01:58:04,849
This is the final lineup.

2669
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:06,850
I felt reassured and happy.

2670
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:10,390
As the blocks are completed,

2671
01:58:10,789 --> 01:58:13,158
the rule for designating elimination candidates has been removed...

2672
01:58:13,159 --> 01:58:14,488
- It's a relief. - and the leaders...

2673
01:58:14,489 --> 01:58:15,858
are no longer guaranteed survival.

2674
01:58:15,859 --> 01:58:16,929
What?

2675
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:18,060
- They're no longer guaranteed. - It's not guaranteed.

2676
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,358
The survival of the leaders isn't guaranteed anymore.

2677
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:24,600
From now on, only the block that survives to the end...

2678
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:29,810
through the unity of its members will enjoy the glory of victory.

2679
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:34,380
I hope none of us is eliminated and we can all make it to the final.

2680
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:37,079
Five blocks remaining in RAP: PUBLIC.

2681
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:41,920
Your fourth Block Match will be revealed.

2682
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:43,250
What do you think it'll be?

2683
01:58:43,489 --> 01:58:44,720
Is it a Diss Match?

2684
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,630
The fourth Block Match...

2685
01:58:53,630 --> 01:58:55,970
is Kill Them All.

2686
01:58:56,130 --> 01:58:57,169
My gosh.

2687
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:58,899
- "Kill Them All." - "Kill Them All."

2688
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:00,398
Kill them all.

2689
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:02,108
Does it mean all of us will be eliminated?

2690
01:59:02,109 --> 01:59:03,269
I guess that's the case.

2691
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:05,079
Gosh, this is intense.

2692
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:06,978
Yes.

2693
01:59:06,979 --> 01:59:09,179
It's called Kill Them All. It sounds like complete destruction.

2694
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:10,380
What are the rules?

2695
01:59:10,579 --> 01:59:13,220
The match will proceed as follows.

2696
01:59:13,649 --> 01:59:18,960
The rounds will continue in the cypher format within the time limit.

2697
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:21,859
- That's like the Infinite Cypher. - It's the Infinite Cypher.

2698
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:23,658
So each team will do the Infinite Cypher.

2699
01:59:23,659 --> 01:59:24,800
But there's a time limit.

2700
01:59:27,569 --> 01:59:30,770
Each block should bet 1,000 dollars of Block Money...

2701
01:59:31,069 --> 01:59:33,769
before each round begins.

2702
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:35,039
(Each block will bet 1,000 dollars of Block Money before each round.)

2703
01:59:35,239 --> 01:59:36,608
Are we betting?

2704
01:59:36,609 --> 01:59:38,239
The rapper who receives...

2705
01:59:38,539 --> 01:59:42,148
the most votes from the audience in each round...

2706
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:46,619
will take all the money bet by each block.

2707
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:48,618
After the time limit ends,

2708
01:59:48,619 --> 01:59:51,520
- It's about money. - only the top three blocks...

2709
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:55,029
will advance to the next match...

2710
01:59:55,789 --> 01:59:57,800
based on the accumulated Block Money ranking.

2711
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:02,500
To survive this match,

2712
02:00:02,869 --> 02:00:06,539
it's important to strategically place the rappers for each round...

2713
02:00:07,239 --> 02:00:10,739
and to secure enough Block Money.

2714
02:00:11,539 --> 02:00:13,609
That's why they said it's important to have secure money.

2715
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:16,710
That's why they said having more money is advantageous.

2716
02:00:16,909 --> 02:00:21,789
I'll reveal the amount of Block Money each block has secured so far.

2717
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:23,349
(Current Block Money Ranking, 1st place: 49,000 dollars)

2719
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:26,060
(4th place: 37,000 dollars, 5th place: 36,000 dollars)

2720
02:00:26,189 --> 02:00:27,689
Yes!

2721
02:00:28,529 --> 02:00:29,590
Block Two has so much money.

2722
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:34,699
We have the most Block Money anyway.

2723
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:39,399
We have a big advantage in this betting system.

2724
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:43,840
Our team was formed after many people were eliminated.

2725
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:45,938
So we should protect it. We will protect the team.

2726
02:00:45,939 --> 02:00:47,279
I'm suddenly getting angry.

2727
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:50,579
This is the first thought I had.

2728
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:52,319
"We're doomed."

2729
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:55,589
We'd be in a disadvantageous position without enough Block Money.

2730
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:58,519
I thought it wouldn't be easy at all.

2731
02:00:58,520 --> 02:00:59,589
I have to do everything I can.

2732
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:01,689
I decided not to lose. I will keep winning.

2733
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:06,329
To create one block to take over RAP: PUBLIC,

2734
02:01:06,729 --> 02:01:10,899
this society will now evolve and expand.

2735
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,899
(The fourth Block Match, Kill Them All)

2736
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:17,439
Members of RAP: PUBLIC, welcome.

2737
02:01:19,739 --> 02:01:22,779
The five blocks that have survived until now...

2738
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:24,978
will put to the crossroads of survival again...

2739
02:01:24,979 --> 02:01:27,750
based on the audience evaluation.

2740
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:32,658
Let me introduce the MC of RAP: PUBLIC...

2741
02:01:32,659 --> 02:01:35,130
who will host the fourth Block Match.

2742
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:42,600
Yes, sir!

2743
02:01:44,369 --> 02:01:45,869
RAP: PUBLIC, how are you doing?

2744
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:47,510
Hello, everyone!

2745
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:56,979
I'm Jay Park, the MC of RAP: PUBLIC. It's nice to meet you.

2746
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:01,619
It feels good.

2747
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:04,559
Let's meet the block rappers first.

2748
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,560
Are you ready, everyone?

2749
02:02:05,561 --> 02:02:07,430
- Yes! - Yes!

2750
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:10,189
Let's meet Block One now.

2751
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:12,959
(Block 1)

2752
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:17,470
It felt that I was close to the final win if we could win this.

2753
02:02:18,069 --> 02:02:19,770
I definitely want to win.

2754
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:26,978
Nice to meet you! Go for it until Block One wins!

2755
02:02:26,979 --> 02:02:28,510
Block One, we already won.

(Tray B, Double Down, DAMINI, JEFFERY WHITE)

2758
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,050
Let me introduce Block Two.

2759
02:02:34,119 --> 02:02:35,389
Block Two, please come on out!

2760
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,788
(Block 2)

2761
02:02:37,789 --> 02:02:39,119
Go! Let's go!

2762
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:40,619
I'm very excited.

2763
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:43,060
Considering Block Money, we're at the top.

2764
02:02:43,529 --> 02:02:46,499
Still, we need to give a good performance.

2765
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,970
We'll put in an effort...

2766
02:02:49,069 --> 02:02:50,270
to chase two hares at once.

2767
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,908

(Foggyatthebottom, Nosun, OSUN, JP)

2769
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:03,079
(Block 3)

2770
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:09,318
You must be wondering how fun our performance will be.

2771
02:03:09,319 --> 02:03:11,158
We will give an awesome, energetic,

2772
02:03:11,159 --> 02:03:14,590
and unforgettable performance.

2773
02:03:17,189 --> 02:03:18,300
I will do it with no regrets.

2774
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:20,898

2775

(Chaboom, Yang Kyle, James An, DOMMIU)

2776
02:03:25,539 --> 02:03:29,670
(Block 4)

2777
02:03:30,779 --> 02:03:34,209
It might be because of the presence of the audience.

2778
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:37,149
I feel very excited and nervous at the same time.

2779
02:03:39,619 --> 02:03:41,419

2781
02:03:43,649 --> 02:03:46,089
Lastly, let's meet Block Six.

2782
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:48,060
(Block 6)

2783
02:03:48,189 --> 02:03:50,329
Now, we're in fourth place regarding Block Money.

2784
02:03:50,899 --> 02:03:52,800
Of course, I want to win and advance to the next stage.

2785
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:54,898
I'm so desperate.

2786
02:03:54,899 --> 02:03:57,329
But I feel excited and happy to see the audience.

2787
02:03:57,739 --> 02:03:58,770
It's going to be fun.

(Mckdaddy, Kohway, O'Domar, JOONIE)

2790
02:04:02,970 --> 02:04:05,779
Let's listen to their determination, starting with Block One.

2791
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:09,809
We've done our best so far.

2792
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:12,179
We welcome everyone to come up when we're on the stage.

2793
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:14,649
We'll beat you all for sure. Thank you.

2794
02:04:17,859 --> 02:04:20,060
I enjoyed listening to your nonsense.

2795
02:04:22,789 --> 02:04:26,229
We'll give you a fun performance...

2796
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,869
and move on to the next stage just like that.

2797
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:33,600
If I think I'm going to lose today, I'll take off my pants.

2798
02:04:35,739 --> 02:04:36,839
Just kidding.

2799
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:40,978
So far, the rule was that we rappers voted to decide.

2800
02:04:40,979 --> 02:04:42,709
Now that we're going to perform before the audience,

2801
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:44,818
I feel so excited and very happy.

2802
02:04:44,819 --> 02:04:46,579
I will give you a fun performance.

2803
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:52,988
We have the least amount of Block Money,

2804
02:04:52,989 --> 02:04:54,929
so we're in a disadvantageous position.

2805
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:57,390
We made preparations considering every possible scenario.

2806
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,358
I think our performance deserves your attention.

2807
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:00,359
We can do it.

2808
02:05:02,630 --> 02:05:05,568
The show match coming up is important, of course.

2809
02:05:05,569 --> 02:05:07,709
But for those who are here today,

2810
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:09,409
we'll show the best performance.

2811
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:17,408
If you survive today's Block Match, Kill Them All,

2812
02:05:17,409 --> 02:05:19,420
you will move on to the show match.

2813
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:22,089
The last gateway to the show match,

2814
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:23,118
Kill Them All.

2815
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:27,119
It starts now. Let's go!

2816
02:05:35,529 --> 02:05:37,328
Everyone, we'll start Round One.

2817
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:39,470
Round One starts now.

2818
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:45,538
Now, every block will bet 1,000 dollars...

2819
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:47,380
there.

2820
02:05:47,409 --> 02:05:48,479
"There."

2821
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:50,949
Okay. You can go now.

2822
02:05:51,949 --> 02:05:53,079
Time is ticking.

2823
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:54,350
Put up your bread.

2824
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:55,618
- Shall we go now? - Okay, sir.

2825
02:05:55,619 --> 02:05:56,949
Put that thing on the table.

2826
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:58,920
He's hosting seems so funny.

2827
02:05:59,689 --> 02:06:01,359
"Put that thing on the table!"

2828
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:03,390
Put your money where your mouth is.

(Block Money betting for Round 1 begins.)

2830

He's performing.

2831
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:15,840
How does he do that?

2832
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:17,938
- That's nice. - Gosh, that's good.

2833
02:06:17,939 --> 02:06:19,840
- He's so good. - That's nice.

2834
02:06:21,149 --> 02:06:22,908
- Okay. - What's wrong with him?

2835
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:24,079
What's wrong with him?

2836
02:06:24,979 --> 02:06:26,649
- That's not fair. - Everyone.

2837
02:06:27,050 --> 02:06:28,819
The audience likes you.

2838
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:32,319

Okay, DJ Holiship. Drop the beat. Let's go.

2843
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:43,100
What's the first beat going to be?

2844
02:06:44,369 --> 02:06:46,538
- Here we go. - Let's go!

2845
02:06:46,539 --> 02:06:47,539
Here we go.

2846
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:50,609
Go.

2847
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,579
Gosh.

2848
02:06:54,409 --> 02:06:55,609
So many.

2849
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,210
What are these people doing?

2850
02:06:58,119 --> 02:06:59,119
I have no verse for this.

2851
02:06:59,579 --> 02:07:00,720
I'm going to count to ten.

2852
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:05,488
Five, four,

2853
02:07:05,489 --> 02:07:06,919
- What shall I do? - three...

2854
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:08,760
You have to go now. Time is ticking. Hurry.

2855
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,929
No more participants now.

2856
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:13,560
Let's stop here, everyone.

2857
02:07:14,029 --> 02:07:15,069
So many here.

2858
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:17,430
Too many people are coming up.

2859
02:07:17,470 --> 02:07:19,169
This 1 performance will amount to 50 minutes.

2860
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,170
That's what I'm saying.

2861
02:07:20,369 --> 02:07:22,438
They wouldn't spare block members. Everyone was coming up.

2862
02:07:22,439 --> 02:07:25,978
It was testing the waters to see what the audience likes.

2863
02:07:25,979 --> 02:07:26,979
Let's see what happens.

2864
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:29,149
That's enough for Round One.

2865
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:31,419
- They're all on the stage. - Right.

2866
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:32,920
What? Is everyone here?

2867
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:35,420
This performance will be on for 30 minutes.

2868
02:07:36,189 --> 02:07:37,959
Has everyone except for two gone up there?

2869
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:41,028
Since my block has the largest amount of Block Money,

2870
02:07:41,029 --> 02:07:44,059
if as many members as possible can rap the verse,

2871
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:47,398
my block can spend much time on the stage...

2872
02:07:47,399 --> 02:07:49,369
which will leave less chance to other blocks.

2873
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,629
Since we have a lot of resources,

2874
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:53,739
we could use a relaxed strategy.

2875
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:56,210
- Okay. - Are all these going to perform?

2876
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:59,039
We're in the last place in Block Money.

2877
02:07:59,210 --> 02:08:00,379
We need to win.

2878
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:02,578
Every round decides 5,000 dollars.

2879
02:08:02,579 --> 02:08:04,078
So the beginning of the performance will matter.

2880
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:06,448
We might have to contend for victory in the early stage.

2881
02:08:06,449 --> 02:08:08,988
We decided to go aggressive for the first round.

2882
02:08:08,989 --> 02:08:10,249
That's our strategy in the first place.

2883
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:13,059
Round One of Kill Them All cypher starts now.

2884
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:14,259
DJ Holiship,

2885
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:16,689
drop that beat. Let's go!

2886
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:27,369
(HAON of Block 3 enters Round 1.)

2887
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:30,438
Unstoppable, We don't know how to stop

2888
02:08:30,439 --> 02:08:32,738
So pop up on the first step, Pop up the bubble

2889
02:08:32,739 --> 02:08:34,078
And avoid the law

2890
02:08:34,079 --> 02:08:35,679
After earning the money, bury it and double it

2891
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,549
Dumbledore, It's a high-class magic

2892
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:39,349
A couple of items are prepared for an aesthetic purpose

2893
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:41,148
A greater future is waiting for me

2894
02:08:41,149 --> 02:08:43,019
No one can delay it, Bring me if there's any

2895
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:44,688
I lifted my body like it's time for rapture

2896
02:08:44,689 --> 02:08:46,658
Like the nirvana of Buddha, My spirit is uplifted

2897
02:08:46,659 --> 02:08:48,328
That might be the reason it's impossible to communicate with punks

2898
02:08:48,329 --> 02:08:50,358
Yes, I live as I like, Shine my way, no nonsense

2899
02:08:50,359 --> 02:08:52,129
It should at least sound nice not to get on my nerves

2900
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,959
Your rap is a noise, I don't want to listen

2901
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:56,028
The added value from public profile won't last after the first round.

2902
02:08:56,029 --> 02:08:57,528
Build up energy and blow the whistle

2903

2904

I don't even need to try to understand

2905

2937
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:12,179
Even though I'm a grown up, I can't hide the habit

2938
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:14,038
I've only done what I'm told not to do and I'm past 30 years old

2939
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:15,809
Being in the office 9 to 5 is far from my life

2940
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:17,809
Although I live as an immature grown-up I earn huge money

2941
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:19,318
The noise I made every night now makes people get goosebumps

2942
02:10:19,319 --> 02:10:21,219
I've come far compared to the beginning, Now I'm used to it

2943
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:23,249
I listened to SSaW's "Bravo My Life"

2944
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:24,959
The song comforted me and that became a memory

2945
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,618
I will definitely survive here

2946
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:28,429
I kept pushing forward to get a chance

2947
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:30,259
I did not bend my back risking I might break it

2948
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:32,129
Thanks to that, I got away from the suburb of Seoul

2949
02:10:32,130 --> 02:10:33,299
I feel free on Freedom Road

2950
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:34,969
I go from Gimpo to Seoul and go to Busan right away

2951
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:36,698
I fly like the space vehicle Naro, Unlike you who have plenty of time

2952
02:10:36,699 --> 02:10:38,799
If they get the money, we'll be in the last place.

2953
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,340
I want to go to the restroom

2954
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,939

2969
02:11:15,869 --> 02:11:17,140

(Kohway is in 3rd place with 59 votes.)

2971
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:22,310
This won't be easy.

2972
02:11:22,579 --> 02:11:24,679
They might take it.

2973
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,778
If Block Three wins, we're in danger.

2974
02:11:26,779 --> 02:11:28,050
So I kept Block Three in check.

(KHAN of Block 2 enters Round 1.)

02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,568
You're going to hurt if you think we're easy, You'd rather give up

2978
02:11:41,569 --> 02:11:43,368
My feet are on fire

2979
02:11:43,369 --> 02:11:45,238
It's hot, The flame is burning up

2980
02:11:45,239 --> 02:11:47,068
My rap is simple, and I will turn this game around

2981
02:11:47,069 --> 02:11:48,938
But money chase without a break

2982
02:11:48,939 --> 02:11:50,738
My plan is to overtake, It's not changing

2983
02:11:50,739 --> 02:11:52,439
No plan B, I just run the race

2984
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:55,278
The thickness of the cash bundle won't satisfy me yet

2985
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:56,648
The pressure on my shoulders already feel familiar

2986
02:11:56,649 --> 02:11:58,478
It's too fast to say too late

2987
02:11:58,479 --> 02:12:00,478
I easily overtook the punk before me, That was mean

2988
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:01,988
I keep pulling, I don't know how to stop

2989
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:04,049
If you try to stop me, I will put you through trouble

02:16:33,159 --> 02:16:35,128
Even if I say so, you're trying in vain, you punk

3108
02:16:35,129 --> 02:16:36,958
Look at the forest, not the trees

3109
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:38,429
That's why you're buried

3110
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:40,158
Let's have fun and feel it

3111
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:42,169
Here, Rhythm Power, my gang

3112
02:16:42,170 --> 02:16:43,798
Shake it, You don't need to beat around the bush

3113
02:16:43,799 --> 02:16:45,638
We're going in, Every dancer

3114
02:16:45,639 --> 02:16:47,798
Gather and show your own dancing

3115
02:16:47,799 --> 02:16:51,169
Geegooin is ready to go, My specialty is hanging out

3116
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:53,039
Moving as I feel

3117
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,878
- It's hard to rest - He has a unique style.

3118
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:57,180
He has various flows.

3119
02:16:57,579 --> 02:17:00,378
Everyone is excited and energized to run

3120
02:17:00,379 --> 02:17:02,488
The volume goes up, The shouting gets louder

3121
02:17:02,489 --> 02:17:04,149
The light is on, The night gets hotter

3122
02:17:04,350 --> 02:17:06,119
The show everyone has been waiting for

3123
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,760
Let's go, disco

3124
02:17:09,629 --> 02:17:10,629
The voting begins.

3125
02:17:10,829 --> 02:17:13,159
We're ruined. He would get the largest number of votes.

3126
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,229
Eight, seven, six,

3127
02:17:17,829 --> 02:17:23,739
five, four, three, two, one.

3128
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,840
The voting is closed.

3129
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:28,978
(Did he win more than 82 votes, which is what OSUN received?)

3130
02:17:28,979 --> 02:17:31,749
Yes, the cypher is set.

3131
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:35,920
Everyone, make some noise.

3132
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:40,819
They have been doing the cypher for 27 minutes. That's amazing.

3133
02:17:41,629 --> 02:17:42,930
All right, everyone.

3134
02:17:43,329 --> 02:17:46,030
I'll announce the result right away.

3135
02:17:48,829 --> 02:17:49,899
Good!

3136
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:57,408
The top-ranked one that will take Block Money...

3137
02:17:57,409 --> 02:17:59,809
(The top-ranked one that will take Block Money)

3138
02:18:04,909 --> 02:18:05,949
(Is it OSUN of Block 2, the currently top-ranked one?)

3139
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:07,219
(Is it the new strong one, ZENE THE ZILLA of Block 1?)

3140
02:18:07,719 --> 02:18:12,190
is Geegooin of Block Six. Let's go!

3141
02:18:12,819 --> 02:18:15,729
Geegooin!

3142
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:18,860
This is really insane.

3143
02:18:20,729 --> 02:18:21,829
I felt like I could fly.

3144
02:18:22,299 --> 02:18:24,798
We had to win to move on to the next stage.

3145
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:26,799
We were not a team to advance if we kept holding out.

3146
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,239
I did my job. I felt proud to see my team members.

3147
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:31,808
I felt so happy.

3148
02:18:31,809 --> 02:18:34,739
I thought I could slay Round Two with this confidence.

3149
02:18:37,579 --> 02:18:38,679
I didn't know this was possible.

3150
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,519
- You made it. - Great job.

3151
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:42,350
You need to do your share.

3152
02:18:42,989 --> 02:18:44,419
(Block 6 wins 5,000 dollars, the amount bet in Round 1.)

3153
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:45,759
(The current Block Money rankings, Block 2:48,000 dollars, )

3154
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:46,789
(Block 1:42,000 dollars, Block 6:41,000 dollars, )

3155
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:51,260
(Block 4:39,000 dollars, Block 3:35,000 dollars)

3156
02:18:51,559 --> 02:18:54,529
We'll proceed right away.

3157
02:18:54,530 --> 02:18:55,829
Immediately. Let's go.

3158
02:18:56,069 --> 02:18:57,969
- They're doing it right away. - Oh, no.

3159
02:18:58,129 --> 02:19:00,700
- Okay. - Let's go.

3160
02:19:01,670 --> 02:19:03,510
- Here we go. - Let's go.

3161
02:19:03,809 --> 02:19:05,079
We're doing it right away. Darn it.

3162
02:19:05,209 --> 02:19:07,909
Now, every block needs to put 1,000 dollars.

3163
02:19:08,809 --> 02:19:11,010
(Block Money betting is completed.)

3164
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:13,479
DJ Holiship, drop the beat. Let's go.

3165
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:15,919
(Each block discusses which rappers to send out.)

3166
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,749
- Number 2. - It's number 2.

3167
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:19,620
Can you do it on this beat?

3168
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:21,359
Anyone else?

3169
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:23,859
- Can I go? - Do what you feel confident.

3170
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:25,558
I have one.

3171
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:27,898
- HAON, do you have one? - I do.

3172
02:19:27,899 --> 02:19:30,200
- HAON, go if you have one. - You can come if you have it.

3173
02:19:30,569 --> 02:19:33,269
- Are you going to go? - I haven't decided.

3174
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:34,540
JTONG, let's go.

3175
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:36,708
- Go ahead. - No, let's go together.

3176
02:19:36,709 --> 02:19:38,068
Starting to count down. Six,

3177
02:19:38,069 --> 02:19:40,238
- five, four, - You can switch with ShyboiiTobii.

3178
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:42,009
- Switch with ShyboiiTobii. - three, two,

3179
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:43,609
- one! - Hurry up.

3180
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,420
All right. Now,

3181
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:47,319
- rappers to go has been decided. - You come down now.

3182
02:19:47,579 --> 02:19:49,218
I don't think sending many members is a solution.

3183
02:19:49,219 --> 02:19:51,119
You shouldn't get clumsy.

3184
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,718
DJ Holiship, drop that beat.

3185
02:19:53,719 --> 02:19:56,829
Let's go!

3186
02:20:00,629 --> 02:20:03,269
Yes!

3187
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:04,499
Oh, my goodness.

3188
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,039
- Oh, my gosh. - JTONG!

3189
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:07,100
(JTONG of Block 2 enters Round 2.)

3190
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:12,610
If you laugh, blessings will come your way.

3191
02:20:14,209 --> 02:20:15,680
(Laughing)

3192
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:24,019
My favorite seafood is sea cucumber intestine

3193
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,020
Intestine.

3194
02:20:25,021 --> 02:20:27,559
Dive deep into the sea and find

3195
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,958
Suck the intestine of a natural abalone

3196
02:20:30,959 --> 02:20:34,129
Look at the size of the underwear in your bed in the morning

3197
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:38,228
Look, What's happening? The sunlight and weather feel hot

3198
02:20:38,229 --> 02:20:41,439
I can't hold up like this, Buddy, gather to the sea right now

3199
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,610
You idiot, You need to go head first when you're diving

3200
02:20:44,809 --> 02:20:48,548
On a seashore rock under the sun we break a conch with a stone

3201
02:20:48,549 --> 02:20:51,680
My nicely braided hair looks like wet seaweed

3202
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:54,979
Gather dry grass to make a fire

3203
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:58,218
Stocking my branches like a beaver

3204
02:20:58,219 --> 02:21:00,158
Lying on the beach under the sun

3205
02:21:00,159 --> 02:21:01,929
Smoking my root

3206
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:04,789
My pronunciation is splendid like a colorful starfish

3207
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:08,359
My flow swims in your head all day like a jellyfish

3208
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:10,999
Like barnacles stuck in a seashore rock

3209
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
"Barnacles."

3210
02:21:12,001 --> 02:21:14,840
Savage baby on the tetrapod, Welcome to the party

3211
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:19,579
The voting begins.

3212
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:22,579
- Ten, nine, - He's so good.

3213
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:25,218
- eight, seven, - He's strong.

3214
02:21:25,219 --> 02:21:27,479
- He is. - six, five,

3215
02:21:28,149 --> 02:21:30,250
- four, three, - It's better if Block Two wins.

3216
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:32,790
- Yes, that's better for us. - two, one.

3217
02:21:33,489 --> 02:21:34,919
The voting is closed.

3218
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:35,929
(The voting is closed.)

3219
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:38,058
You slayed it again.

3220
02:21:38,059 --> 02:21:40,158
My brother.

3221
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:42,700
I think JTONG will win no matter what.

3222
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:44,899
There's nothing more I can say.

3223
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:46,638
How can you beat that?

3224
02:21:46,639 --> 02:21:48,269
In fact, the game is over.

3225
02:21:48,270 --> 02:21:51,878
We won. I thought my team would produce the top one.

3226
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:57,110
(JTONG of Block 2 gets 1st place with 84 votes.)

3227
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:02,019
JOONIE!

3228
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:03,020
(JOONIE of Block 6 enters Round 2.)

3229
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:05,260
Everyone, you must be tired.

3230
02:22:05,489 --> 02:22:08,218
I will eliminate these punks quickly...

3231
02:22:08,219 --> 02:22:09,958
- so that we can go home. - Is she talking about her team?

3232
02:22:09,959 --> 02:22:11,328
They're in the same block.

3233
02:22:11,329 --> 02:22:12,559
It's her team members.

3234
02:22:12,659 --> 02:22:13,958
Is she talking about us?

3235
02:22:13,959 --> 02:22:15,968
I told you to keep quiet.

3236
02:22:15,969 --> 02:22:18,539
I'm out here for 44 hours

3237
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:19,568
- Here we go. - It's all right.

3238
02:22:19,569 --> 02:22:20,999
I feel tired and annoyed, Lazy for this

3239
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,708
Got no time to think about it

3240
02:22:22,709 --> 02:22:24,238
Twenty-four hours yet I feel so sleepy

3241
02:22:24,239 --> 02:22:26,009
I might go crazy like this

3242
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,539
Who's going to recognize it even though you work hard?

3243
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:29,378
She shouldn't have made a mistake after saying it.

3244
02:22:29,379 --> 02:22:30,878
I know.

3245
02:22:30,879 --> 02:22:32,578
I'll do it next.

3246
02:22:32,579 --> 02:22:34,378
A lazy life, They call me Gudetama

3247
02:22:34,379 --> 02:22:35,988
You can't find me, I'll be in Guatemala

3248
02:22:35,989 --> 02:22:37,689
I'd like to perform after her, very much.

3249
02:22:37,690 --> 02:22:39,359
I hate something complex Did you know that?

3250
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,590
Isn't she standing there?

3251
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:43,759
You should take it.

3252
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:45,958
I'm tired but I still call them my best friends.

3253
02:22:45,959 --> 02:22:47,799
Are you going to go?

3254
02:22:47,959 --> 02:22:49,369
Someone please come on by instead

3255
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:50,968
Sorry but today's just not the day I said

3256
02:22:50,969 --> 02:22:53,000
I really feel like my body's just quite dead

3257
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:56,309
Okay!

3258
02:22:56,809 --> 02:22:57,969
The voting begins.

3259
02:22:58,569 --> 02:22:59,839
- Ten, - She must have been nervous.

3260
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,138
- nine, - You did a good job.

3261
02:23:01,139 --> 02:23:02,478
Eight,

3262
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:03,878
seven,

3263
02:23:03,879 --> 02:23:04,909
six,

3264
02:23:05,149 --> 02:23:07,849
- 5, 4, - She shouldn't use her good looks.

3265
02:23:07,850 --> 02:23:09,119
Three,

3266
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:10,419
two,

3267
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:11,450
one.

3268

The voting is closed.

3269
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:14,520
Good job, JOONIE.

3270
02:23:20,399 --> 02:23:23,199
(HAON of Block 3 enters Round 2.)

3271
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,229
Go.

3272
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:27,839
Love, dream in my life

3273
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,509
- Money and power also in my life - He's so annoying.

3274
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:30,939
My life is like a nonsense quiz

3275
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:32,609
It has a meaning only when someone laughs

3276
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:34,179
Even when not every light shines on me

3277
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:35,949
I know I am a main character now

3278
02:23:35,950 --> 02:23:37,478
You fool, Even if you don't believe me

02:29:36,139 --> 02:29:39,908
"My favorite seafood is sea cucumber intestine."

3455
02:29:39,909 --> 02:29:42,648
I could hear every punchline.

3456
02:29:42,649 --> 02:29:45,779
I thought, "Can I listen to this live?"

3457
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:47,179
Rather than him being my opponent,

3458
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:49,449
it felt like I was watching a concert.

3459
02:29:49,450 --> 02:29:51,250
I enjoyed it so much.

3460
02:29:51,389 --> 02:29:52,888
Let us get that thing once.

3461
02:29:52,889 --> 02:29:54,859
Roh Yun Ha showed...

3462
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:57,058
such fun flows.

3463
02:29:57,059 --> 02:30:00,629
The beat went well to his rap, so it stood out more.

3464
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:02,530
The audience liked it too.

3465
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,639
It seemed Yun Ha was highly likely to take Block Money.

3466
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,209
I will announce the result, everyone.

3467
02:30:09,469 --> 02:30:11,568
It's only 1 vote difference between 1st and 2nd places.

3468
02:30:11,569 --> 02:30:13,078
Gosh.

3469
02:30:13,079 --> 02:30:14,079
I will announce it.

3470
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:16,409
The one who took first place,

3471
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:20,379
the rapper who won 5,000 dollars...

3472
02:30:25,690 --> 02:30:26,789
The one who ranked first...

3473
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:30,229
is Roh Yun Ha of Block Three!

3474
02:30:30,430 --> 02:30:31,929
Go!

3475
02:30:31,930 --> 02:30:34,459
- Yes! - Good job!

3476
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,468
- Make a deep bow, everyone. - Thank you.

3477
02:30:38,469 --> 02:30:39,699
Thank you.

3478
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,100
Thank you.

3479
02:30:41,739 --> 02:30:43,509
- Take the money now, Yun Ha. - Thank you.

3480
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:45,269
- Take it. - Let's go!

3481
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:47,309
Thank you.

3482
02:30:47,709 --> 02:30:49,709
- Take the money. - I mean it. My dopamine level...

3483
02:30:50,350 --> 02:30:51,579
went up like crazy.

3484
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:54,350
I was happy to win in the first place...

3485
02:30:54,450 --> 02:30:57,790
and also very happy to be of help to my team members.

3486
02:30:57,989 --> 02:31:00,319
Everyone was so happy.

3487
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:04,488
It was beyond words. It felt so good.

3488
02:31:04,489 --> 02:31:05,658
(The current Block Money rankings)

3489
02:31:05,659 --> 02:31:08,958
(Block 2 is in 1st place with 47,000 dollars.)

3490
02:31:08,959 --> 02:31:11,069
Although we started in last place in terms of Block Money,

3491
02:31:11,399 --> 02:31:13,138
but Yu Ha took the win.

3492
02:31:13,139 --> 02:31:14,799
It was a hopeful moment.

3493
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,669
We're not going to lose.

3494
02:31:17,670 --> 02:31:20,308
We will be in the top three, no matter what.

3495
02:31:20,309 --> 02:31:22,209
It's because we're Block Three.

3496
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:24,949
One vote difference?

3497
02:31:24,950 --> 02:31:26,978
- You were so good. - I feel sorry.

3498
02:31:26,979 --> 02:31:30,148
I'm sorry that I took 2nd place by 1 vote difference.

3499
02:31:30,149 --> 02:31:33,089
But it's a rule based on the votes...

3500
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:35,189
by the audience on site,

3501
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:38,989
so I'll accept it and wait for the next round.

3502
02:31:39,459 --> 02:31:41,359
I was disappointed with the result.

3503
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:43,899
However, that was the result,

3504
02:31:44,569 --> 02:31:47,299
and I thought we really have to win next time.

3505
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:49,339
All right.

3506
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:50,440
What shall I do?

3507
02:31:51,409 --> 02:31:53,180
This won't be easy.

3508
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:57,048
Block Three had less money than us,

3509
02:31:57,049 --> 02:31:59,279
but they definitely turned the tables.

3510
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,978
If we win one more round,

3511
02:32:00,979 --> 02:32:04,919
we can get a chance to turn the tables.

3512
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,319
So we decided to win one round.

3513
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:09,290
Gosh, we needed to win this.

3514
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:12,329
We're in danger if things go like this.

3515
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:15,559
We're all going to the show match. Remember that.

3516
02:32:16,069 --> 02:32:17,069
Darn it.

3517
02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:20,939
I have a feeling that we'll advance to third place.

3518
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:24,010
I think we can go to the show match.

3519
02:32:24,209 --> 02:32:28,840
I will kill them all and move on to the show match.

3520
02:32:30,709 --> 02:32:32,549
DJ Holiship, drop that beat. Let's go.

3521
02:32:32,620 --> 02:32:33,919
(We can't get eliminated like this.)

3522
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:35,218
(I need to get it together.)

3523
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:37,020
(I need to take it, no matter what. I'll do everything I can.)

3524
02:32:37,489 --> 02:32:39,489
(The last gateway to the show match)

3525
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:41,219
(The fourth Block Match, Kill Them All)

3526
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:42,860
(He's so good.)

3527
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:45,899
(We can win this for sure.)

3528
02:32:47,629 --> 02:32:50,100
(The blocks' fates are on the intense cypher.)

3529
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:51,398
(Here, )

3530
02:32:51,399 --> 02:32:53,200
(I'll announce the hidden match.)

3531
02:32:54,270 --> 02:32:55,298
(The hidden match?)

3532
02:32:55,299 --> 02:32:56,769
(JTONG)

3533
02:32:56,770 --> 02:32:57,770
(It's JTONG.)

3534
02:32:57,771 --> 02:32:59,040
(Then we need to beat JTONG and take the win.)

3535
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:04,350
(Best players of the blocks enter the hidden match.)

3536
02:33:06,379 --> 02:33:10,889
(They go against each other with the blocks' pride on.)

3537
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:13,388
(He can't lose in this match.)

3538
02:33:13,389 --> 02:33:14,719
(This is just crazy.)

3539
02:33:15,889 --> 02:33:17,128
(The match result...)

3540
02:33:17,129 --> 02:33:18,629
(will be announced.)

3541
02:33:20,229 --> 02:33:22,059
(We'll definitely move on to the show match.)

3542
02:33:23,530 --> 02:33:24,530
(We will take the win.)

3543
02:33:24,531 --> 02:33:25,999
(The last block...)

3544
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,370
(to advance to the show match)

3545
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:29,708
(The last match to the finals, )

3546
02:33:29,709 --> 02:33:31,408
(Crew Battle...)

3547
02:33:31,409 --> 02:33:32,409
(starts now.)

3548
02:33:37,379 --> 02:33:40,149
(The last gateway to advance to the finals, Crew Battle)

3549
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:46,959
(The performance gets more intense with a special guest.)

3550
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:51,190
(What's the result of the Crew Battle?)
