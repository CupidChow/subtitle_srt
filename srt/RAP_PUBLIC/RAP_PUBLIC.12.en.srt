149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,678
I poured all of my energy into Block Three...

150
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,110
without taking a single step outside.

151
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,019

We walked the thorny path...

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,529
and got this far.

166
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,439
Block Two must win.

167
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,239
Only one step remains.

168
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,509

169
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,840
I'll bring Block Two to victory...

170
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,039
no matter what.

171

172
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,949

173
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,789

Ever since I made Block Three,

178
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,859
victory has been my goal.

179
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,899
I'll aim for it until the end.

180
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,769

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,070
The current round of Final Block Match is...

182
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,378
the Duet Match.

183
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,049
(Final Block Match: The first round, Duet Match)

184
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,518
For the Duet Match, the two strongest rappers...

185
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,089
of each block will take the stage.

186
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,859
Which rappers will compete in the Duet Match?

187
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,359
I'll introduce the rappers who'll perform first.

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,528
(Each block's rappers will be revealed.)

189
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,359
Block Two's Loopy...

190
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,398
(Duet Match, Block 2's Loopy)

191
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,399
and...

192
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,299
JTONG.

193
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,239
Contending against them are...

194
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,378
Block Three's Roh Yun Ha...

195
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,878
(Duet Match, Block 3's Roh Yun Ha)

196
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,308
(Roh Yun Ha)

197
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,149
and Yang Kyle.

198
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,418
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,548
(Block 2's JTONG and Loopy versus Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle)

200
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:23,048
We expected to see Loopy and JTONG on the stage.

201
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,320
We said, "We need to show our young blood."

202
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,158
From Block Three, rappers who have incredible combat capabilities...

203
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,929
will enter the Duet Match.

204
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,529
The younger rappers stepped forward to take on the older ones.

205
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,129
Wouldn't it be better for the older ones to win?

206
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,298
We'll become the underdogs who revolt against the older ones...

207
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,710
and return in glory.

208
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,809
(Block 2's JTONG and Loopy versus Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle)

209
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,980
Let's get started in earnest.

210
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,378
The starters of the Duet Match are...

211
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,149
Block Two's Loopy and JTONG. Let's go.

212
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,889
(Block 2's JTONG and Loopy)

213
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,589
- Good luck. - We'll be back.

214
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,028
- We'll be back. - Let's go.

215
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:05,860
- Bye. See you later. - We'll be back.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,769
Let's go. Let's go and have fun.

217
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,500
Let's break everything.

218
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,709
Our duet performance was...

219
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,678
a strategic move for the team.

220
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,949
The two most influential members...

221
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,579
of Block Two...

222
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,579
are Loopy and JTONG...

223
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,749
in my opinion.

224
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,489
If the two of them perform together,

225
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,518
they'll definitely win.

226
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,288
They've always been dependable older members.

227
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,330
I'm not worried at all.

228
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,970
(During the Crew Battle, Loopy and JTONG awed the audience.)

229
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,168
In the previous Block Matches...

230
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,638
and related processes, JTONG and I...

231
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,709
gave high-quality performances.

232
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,378
If the two oldest members take the stage...

233
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,609
and give energy to the block,

234
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,850
the younger members will become more spirited.

235
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,388
(Duet Match rehearsal)

236
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:06,658
Run, dopamine rush, Numerous electronics by my side

237
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,888
(A digital fiasco)

238
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,888
(I discern right from wrong of the small and big rumors)

239
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,928
(No time to rest)

240
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,859
(My busy thumbs move without a break)

241
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,028
(Inject information until the end)

242
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,429
(The full brain feels a tingling sensation)

243
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:21,008
The song title is "Dopamine Rush."

244
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,839
It's a song I made while imagining the future mankind...

245
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,109
that lives in the world of accelerated digitization.

246
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,148
We live in an era where we rapidly go through...

247
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,549
provocative issues.

248
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,048
I made the song to warn people...

249
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,919
in the flow of transformation.

250
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,628
(Guitarist Yoon Byeong Joo's appearance will give...)

251
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,729
(a dopamine rush.)

252
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,558
We thought about how we could give...

253
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,899
extra oomph to the performance toward the end.

254
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,169
So I asked Byeong Joo for a guitar accompaniment.

255
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,279
(Yoon Byeong Joo is the guitarist of a band, Lowdown30.)

256
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,278
Was it about 13 years ago?

257
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,648
I met Byeong Joo for the first time.

258
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,190
We continued working together even after that.

259
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,219
For this, Byeong Joo readily gave...

260
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,519
a very good performance.

261
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,628
After giving me a cue, punch these boxes first.

262
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,158
- Okay. - As for me,

263
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,799
I'll hit these boxes first.

264
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,329
I won't go to the back.

265
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,768
When you destroy them,

266
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:25,768
- I'll attack from here. - That's a good idea.

267
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,839
When the guitarist gives an impactful performance,

268
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,439
we'll give a performance of breaking the set.

269
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,038
Dopamine will ooze out at first.

270
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,179
Then it will flow.

271
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,648
(Duet Match rehearsal)

272
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,519
(Block 3 watches Block 2's rehearsal.)

273
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,719
Too many traffic

274
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,759
(JTONG prepared a megaphone performance.)

275
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:45,789
The city is gray

276
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,128
I read everything on this page, Hurry up and give me a new chapter

277
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,229
I can't stand doing things twice, Perhaps it's like a lottery

278
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,230
It was too strong.

279
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,129
Two members who could be a leader performed together.

280
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,298
I got chills.

281
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,240
Dopamine rush

282
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,440
Here it comes.

283
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,178
(Yoon Byeong Joo's guitar performance)

284
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,379
For goodness' sake.

285
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
It was intense.

286
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,759
I know that it won't be an easy match.

287
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,459
(Meanwhile, Loopy and JTONG hide the set-breaking performance.)

288
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,500
It won't be fun if we show everything.

289
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:31,500
It was the kick of our performance,

290
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,740
so we didn't reveal it yet.

291
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,439
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

292
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,109
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

293
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,509
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

294
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,409
Dopamine rush!

295
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,278
You shouted it so many times.

296
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,449
Dopamine rush!

297
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,518
Guys!

298
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,820
Guys, go easy on us.

299
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,289
It was so nice.

300
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,459
It suited them perfectly.

301
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,330
They planned the performance so well.

302
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,158
To be honest, it was very shocking.

303
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,899
I thought there were many performative aspects...

304
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,699
throughout the performance.

305
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,070
JTONG's megaphone.

306
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,569
Boxes at the back of the stage.

307
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,840
Lastly, the intro of the electric guitar.

308
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,209
They pulled them off in a cool way.

309
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,209
It was already insane when they stood on the stage.

310
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,579
Their command on the stage that came...

311
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,048
from their years of experience was incredible.

312
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,149
It immediately made me think, "It won't be easy."

313
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,059
JTONG and Loopy. TONGpy.

314
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,729
No matter which duo from Block Three challenges us,

315
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,899
we'll crush them...

316
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,870
because we practiced hard.

317
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,428
JTONG and I will win the Duet Match...

318
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,970
by a landslide.

319
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,870
The older members will bring a good result.

320
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,309
(Starters of the Duet Match: Block 2's Loopy and JTONG)

321
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,919
It's starting now.

322
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,289
- Let's go. - Good luck.

323
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,719
- Yes. - Let's go.

324
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,629
- Let's go. - Big brothers.

325
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,700
Show everyone.

326
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,959
There's JTONG.

327
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,700
- There he is. - A lion from the netherworld.

328
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,970
Seriously.

329
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,768

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,219
Numerous electronics by my side

333
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,220
A digital fiasco

334
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:32,558
I discern right from wrong of the small and big rumors

Dopamine rush

- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

343

Population that has been reduced by half

344

Empty buildings fill the windy streets

345
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,419
Castrated instincts, turtle-like neck, pale face

346
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,219
We're pitiful animals who lost the reason for being

347
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,249
We waste and spend all in the end

348
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,759
What we need is a moving moment

349
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,399
Dopamine rush

- The city is gray - Dopamine rush

353

We need colors

354
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,509
Find the core

355
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,608
Now, that's the opening.

356
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,779
Too many traffic

357
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,920

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,730
Body and mind

363
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,430
My goodness.

364
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,230
High mountain

365
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,139
Present and next

366
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,199
Show everyone.

367
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,268
- King Loopy! - Let's hear it.

368
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,608
I transform like Venom

369
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,139
I said, "I'm different," but I've been him

370
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,639
Even when I fill it up, the gas drips out

371
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,379
I postpone my work until tomorrow and next

372
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,848
I hate you and everyone else

373
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,518
I use my fingers to pull the triggers

374
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,219
And she's going to pop, do it for me

375
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,548
All of us lost something

376
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:09,249
Yes, I transform every time

377
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Get out

378
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,818
I'm sick and tired of you already, dopamine rush

379
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,318
I need them, wanna go up higher

380
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,358
I don't want to crash

381
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,588
I don't ask questions anymore

382
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,189
Of course, they won't come out in words

383
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,258
We're in a maze

384
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,598
I don't know what my heart feels, I needed more since a while ago

385
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,368
I read everything on this page

386
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,999
Hurry up and give me a new chapter

387
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,399
I can't stand doing things twice

388
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,068
Perhaps it's like a lottery

389
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,508
One minute is too long for a song

390
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,139
Reduce it by ten seconds and put it on TikTok

391
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,879
It's no longer trendy now

392
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,409
I need new stimulation

393
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,548
Forget it, I'm a machine, machine, machine, machine, machine

394
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,579
Forget it, I'm a machine, machine, machine, machine, machine

395
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,889
Forget it, I'm a machine, machine, machine, machine, machine

396
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,959
Forget it, I'm a machine, machine, machine

397
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,858
Machine, machine, machine, machine, machine

398
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,028
Run, dopamine rush

399
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,959
Numerous electronics by my side

400
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,159
A digital fiasco

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,499
I discern right from wrong of the small and big rumors

402
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
No time to rest

403
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,399
My busy thumbs move without a break

404
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,169
Inject information until the end

405
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,839
The full brain feels a tingling sensation

406
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,568
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

407
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,169
- Dopamine rush - He's rapping to the ears.

408
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,808
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

409
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,379
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

410
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,048
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

411
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,608
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

412
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,209
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

413
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,049
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

414
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,119
Here it comes.

415
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,829
(Yoon Byeong Joo of Lowdown30)

416
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,038
What? They were hiding that performance.

417
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,108
Was there such a performance?

418
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,410
- Come on. - What?

419
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,949
- Break it! - Kill it!

420
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,210
Break it more!

421
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,629
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

422
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,199
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

423
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,069
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

424
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:05,569
Go, go, go

425
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,940
Go, go, go

426
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,379
- Dopamine rush - Hey

427
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,078
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

428
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,880
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

429
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,650
- Dopamine rush - Yes

430
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,419
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

431
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,048
- Dopamine rush - Dopamine rush

432
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,119
Dopamine rush

433
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,130
- Yes, yes, yes - Dopamine rush

434
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,199
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

435
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,470
Dopamine rush

436
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,400
- Dopamine rush - Go, go, go

437
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,940
Yes!

438
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:50,309
(You can listen to "Dopamine Rush" on all music streaming services.)

439
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,149
Dopamine is flowing right now.

440
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,649
- Yes. - Dopamine is flowing.

441
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,589
- It was explosive. - My goodness.

442
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,518
- Yes. - My goodness.

443
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,720
It was cool.

444
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,390
It was a strong performance.

445
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,459
As a fellow musician,

446
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,459
I honestly thought it was cool and nice.

447
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,068
The way JTONG began the performance in a standing position...

448
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,940
and used a megaphone was wise.

449
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,509
Loopy's unique movements and cool gestures...

450
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,880
were very strong.

451
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,879
And the electric guitarist gave a solo performance.

452
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,779
It was so cool. It was the best.

453
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,249
I didn't see it during the rehearsal.

454
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,018
They broke the boxes with baseball bats.

455
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,758
It was a secret weapon.

456
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,989
That performance made people go insane.

457
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,429
They started the Final Block Match in an incredible way.

458
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,558
Block Two seized control.

459
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,868
It's time to begin the first round of voting.

460
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,528
The voting begins.

461
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,569
(The 1st round of voting begins for Loopy and JTONG.)

462
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,308
JTONG!

463
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,940
Even JTONG did this.

464
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,009
JTONG did it since the end was approaching.

465
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,980
If you liked the performance, press the circle.

466
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,129
What will the next performers do? They must be pressured.

467
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,189
Yip, yip.

468
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,160
Let's go. Let's make history with a landslide victory.

469
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,028
- It was so much fun. - Yes.

470
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:15,368
Everyone who jumped must've pressed the button.

471
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:16,869
- That's right. - It wouldn't be hard not to.

472
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,669
Five, four, three, two, one.

473
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,868
The voting is closed.

474
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,109
(The 1st round of voting closes for Loopy and JTONG.)

475
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,650
We left no regrets.

476
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,048
When we're on the stage,

477
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,719
we can see the waves the audience members make.

478
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,889
We could definitely see them.

479
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,529
I'm relieved and refreshed.

480
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,029
It was a satisfying performance.

481
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,699
- Yes. - Yes.

482
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,798
- You did so well. - Thank you.

483
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,639
- Was it okay? - It was insane.

484
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,169
- Was it okay? - You did so well.

485
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,608
- Yun Ha. - Let's do it. Let's get them.

486
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,578
It's nice. The stage is heated up.

487
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,939
You can do it.

488
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,379
The atmosphere is getting lively.

489
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,380
- Yes. - Yes.

490
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:05,048
Just as we expected,

491
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,919
they gave an intense performance.

492
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,549
We prepared a song that would let us...

493
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,219
party with the audience.

494
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,518
Our song has a different vibe.

495
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,129
So we thought that there was a chance for victory.

496
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,900
We want to help Block Three members reach the result...

497
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,599
they want.

498
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,268
Now come the opposers of the Duet Match.

499
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,599
They're Block Three's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle.

500
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,239
(Roh Yun Ha)

501
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,740
(Yang Kyle)

502
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,338
(Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle)

503
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,679
They were together since the beginning of Block Three.

504
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,749
I can't wait to see...

505
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,879
how their synergy will be expressed on the stage.

506
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,779
Do you want to see it right away?

507
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,419
- Yes! - Yes!

508
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,889
The opposers of the Duet Match,

509
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,618
Block Three's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle will perform now.

510
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,329
Let's go!

511
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,029
(Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle)

512
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,929
- Good luck. - Let's go.

513
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,429
- Let's go. - You got this.

514
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,729
- Let's go. - We'll be back.

515
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,838
- Pop star, let's go. - Good luck.

516
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,069
- Pop star, right now. - Good luck.

517
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,909
One of the duo candidates was SINCE and me.

518
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,808
There were many combinations.

519
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,048
But I thought that there was a synergy...

520
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,879
the two of them could show.

521
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,989
(The youngest one of Block 3, Roh Yun Ha has shown...)

522
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,058
(incredible rap skills so far.)

523
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:24,899
(Yang Kyle is in charge of energy and spirits in Block 3.)

524
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,329
I wanted a public-friendly and upbeat performance...

525
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,328
that could be enjoyed...

526
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,399
by the young members in the audience.

527
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,338
It was pretty obvious that the duo of the opposing block...

528
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,239
would be JTONG and Loopy.

529
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,409
JTONG and Loopy are the rappers who led the hip-hop scene until now.

530
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,250
Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle are the rappers...

531
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,879
who will lead the scene from now on.

532
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,180
So this is the moment we have a generational transition.

533
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,149
To give the young vibe,

534
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,589
the two of us became a duo.

535
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,159
The song we prepared to sing...

536
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,789
is a short form of "Pop star," "P.S."

537
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,828
(Pop stars, we go up with the winners)

538
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,358
(Pull down the shutters, we're going crazy, jump with us)

539
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,558
(Making up down)

540
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,768
(Move, this show is yours)

541
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,969
(Yes, Block Three style)

542
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,400
(We got up here)

543
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,199
"Although we're rappers,"

544
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,268
"we're like pop stars on the stage."

545
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,939
"And this show is ours." That's the message of the song.

546
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,608
In any case, we reached the final.

547
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,018
"This is our postscript, P.S., for the Duet Match..."

548
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:21,250
"of the final." That's the message of the song.

549
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,819
(Block 3's Duet Match rehearsal begins with Yang Kyle's vocals.)

550
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,919
Yun Ha! Pop star life now!

551
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,828
Pop stars, we go up with the winners

552
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,729
Pull down the shutters, We're going crazy, jump with us

553
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,858
It was our strategy...

554
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:36,499
to give a warm song to people at the end of the year.

555
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,639
Yun Ha and I prepared...

556
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,509
a beautiful and upbeat performance for the Duet Match.

557
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,979
It's a cheerful song we made to party with everyone.

558
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,409
I'll spray water on the stage.

559
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,479
I hope people will enjoy the cool scene with me.

560
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,849
Bring them all right now, Wonstein

561
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,048
Like the rumors, like a miracle, Right now

562
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,088
Who will teach me? They're all lies

563
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,828
We need more melodies to the song.

564
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,258
There was an awkward part...

565
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,499
that seemed a bit weak.

566
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,129
Wonstein filled it up perfectly.

567
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,729
Pop star Roh Yun Ha, Yang Kyle

568
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,670
We're very wary of JTONG and Loopy.

569
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:12,899
We need to do very well.

570
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,969
When it's time for the last hook,

571
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,709
can you turn off the lights completely?

572
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,709
Why don't we move the chair?

573
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,210
- You can put it there. - Okay.

574
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,980
- Then it will be visible. - Right.

575
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,249
It won't be easy to beat JTONG and Loopy.

576
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,618
If we make a mistake, we'll lose.

577
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:33,390
This feels like a deja vu now

578
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,190
What I've accomplished so far is just a fraction

579
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,098
My heart is a warm glacier now

580
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:42,098
I thought that they'd give a performance...

581
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,068
which accentuates their rapping skills.

582
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,569
I didn't see it coming.

583
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,298
Pop stars, we go up with the winners

584
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,410
Pull down the shutters, We're going crazy, jump with us

585
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,279
Yang Kyle and Roh Yun Ha. They're the aces.

586
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,608
I thought I shouldn't put my guard down.

587
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,449
Wonstein

588
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,409
(Wonstein appears to complete Block 3's performance.)

589
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,548
Like the rumors, like a miracle, Right now

590
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,649
Who will teach me? They're all lies

591
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,318
I don't have anything I want to learn, Mom

592
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,588
Right now

593
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:05,589
(The rehearsal for Block 3's Duet Match ended.)

594
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,359
It's awesome.

595
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,499
Pop star.

596
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,559
Thank you.

597
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,699
It's so good. Your live performance skills are strong.

598
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,730
Thank you.

599
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,439
The completeness was impressive.

600
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,169
Pop stars, we go up with the winners

601
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,139
There was a part where they rapped back and forth.

602
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,548
I think they showed a good chemistry there.

603
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,479
They could show a variety...

604
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,919
of color and mood.

605
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,549
That was interesting and fun.

606
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,059
Like the rumors, like a miracle, Right now

607
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,759
Also, Wonstein's voice was really nice.

608
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,029
I was captivated while I listened.

609
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,200
I shouldn't let my guard down.

610
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,899
Yang Kyle and I are representing Block Three.

611
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,268
With a heavy sense of responsibility,

612
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,970
we'll bring back victory.

613
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,369
We really prepared a lot.

614
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,308
We'll have fun interacting with the audience,

615
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:02,180
and we'll easily win.

616
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Trinity.

617
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,419
("P.S." featured by Wonstein)

00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,618
(Lyrics by Roh Yun Ha, Yang Kyle, and Wonstein)

619
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,619
Feels like a

620
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:13,619
Let's go!

621
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,720
Let's go, pop stars.

622
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,390
Deja vu

623
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,559
It's nice.

624
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,970
This feels like a deja vu now

625
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,940
What I've accomplished so far is just a fraction

626
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,710
My heart is a warm glacier now

627
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,910
My name is on your lips

628
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,578
Pop star life now

629
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,249
Pop stars, we go up with the winners

630
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,419
Pull down the shutters, We're going crazy, jump with us

631
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,419
Making up down, Move, this show is yours

632
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,759
Yes, Block Three style, We got up here

633
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:47,619
Camera kiss

634
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,788
I can't leave that out even in the chaos

635
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,588
Hey zoom out because they don't see

636
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,028
Feel like Truman because I give out all of myself

637
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:56,098
Pop star feeling right now

638
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,169
- Pop star feeling right now - Let's go

639
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,268
- Pop star feeling right now - Right now

640
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,368
Bring them all right now

641
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,368
Pop star feeling right now

642
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,479
- Pop star feeling right now - Say what?

643
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,548
- Pop star feeling right now - Let's go

644
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,710
I only live right now

645
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,719
I told you now it's my time

646
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,548
All those who fought me are knocked down

647
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,088
Give up, You can't count my prime time

648
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,258
What a young boy, I'm also surprised at myself

649
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,419
I protect my soul, I just praise him

650
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,459
I remember the starting point without changing

651
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,989
- Hold up - I'm not nervous

652
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,528
Because I got seven brothers

653
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,169
I know the weight of my words, My lyrics are sharper than a knife

654
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,298
I review them before spitting them, I count 1, 2, 3 times

655
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,239
I won't pour your drink, So I should take more

656
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,439
A lot of money and power, I won't be polite anymore

657
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,308
Pop star, All I need is this one night

658
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,578
Your shouts are my trigger

659
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,538
I can't hold it back anymore, Fly with me tonight

660
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,778
End my prequel with me

661
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,548
Pop stars, we go up with the winners

662
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:47,649
Pull down the shutters, We're going crazy, jump with us

663
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,649
- Making up down - Move, this show is yours

664
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,750
Yes, Block Three style, We got up here

665
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,989
Camera kiss, I can't leave that out even in the chaos

666
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,788
Hey zoom out because they don't see

667
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,229
Feel like Truman because I give out all of myself

668
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,298
- Pop star feeling right now - Let's go

669
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,368
- Pop star feeling right now - Here we go

670
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,470
- Pop star feeling right now - Yes, right now

671
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,538
Bring them all right now

672
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,568
- Pop star feeling right now - Let's go

673
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,639
Pop star feeling right now

674
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,778
- Pop star feeling right now - Yes, right now

675
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:17,079
Bring them all right now, Wonstein

676
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,980
Pop star, rock star

677
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,449
Like the rumors, like a miracle, Right now

678
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,449
Who will teach me? They're all lies

679
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,558
I don't have anything I want to learn, Mom

680
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,189
- Don't take away the computer - His voice is nice.

681
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,788
That's how it started in the underground room

682
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,258
This is cliche

683
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,459
Whenever I came, someone won

684
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,598
- It's cool. - Check out my filmography

685
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,798
Search it on the map and go through the shortcut

686
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,598
These guys are unfollowers followers

687
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,969
I feel bad for what they do, Let's take them all

688
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,879
Pop star feeling right now

689
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,879
Pop star feeling right now

690
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,979
Pop star feeling right now

691
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,079
Pop star Roh Yun Ha, Yang Kyle

692
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,348
It's night now, please understand I'm like this sometimes

693
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,018
It's the last time

694
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,588
The main characters, Trinity should bring down the curtains

695
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:01,659
I'm a firefly

696
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,129
- The color is different. - See me as a star in the darkness

697
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,189
It's really different.

698
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,229
Even my scars are beautiful now

699
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,328
Look, Mom, you gave birth to a star

700
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:11,199
I'm up, pop star life now

701
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,538
Numbers different, We're almost there now

702
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,768
Don't you see this plot twist? Even my shortcomings are perfect

703
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,868
My only option, I sell my voice, I won't shut it forever

704
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,639
Are you curious about where I am? I'm on the stage

705
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,009
I threw away the rearview mirror long ago, they're all behind me

706
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,778
If I have to go walk by myself and shine bright

707
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:25,149
For the prime time, set go my time now, I'm ready

708
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,278
This feels like a deja vu

709
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,619
What I've accomplished so far is just a fraction

710
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,960
My heart is a warm glacier now

711
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,700
My name is on your lips

712
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:41,798
- Let's go! - Pop star life now

713
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,528
Pop stars, we go up with the winners

714
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,598
Pull down the shutters, We're going crazy, jump with us

715
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,568
Making up down, Move, this show is yours

716
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,970
Yes, Block Three style, We got up here

717
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:54,008
Camera kiss, I can't leave that out even in the chaos

718
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,879
Hey zoom out because they don't see

719
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,209
Feel like Truman because I give out all of myself

720
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,249
- Pop star feeling right now - Let's go

721
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,318
- Pop star feeling right now - Pop star feeling right now

722
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,489
- Pop star feeling right now - Yes, right now

723
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,459
- Bring them all right now - Bring them all right now

724
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,518
- Pop star feeling right now - Pop star feeling right now

725
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,629
- Pop star feeling right now - Say what?

726
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,699
- Pop star feeling right now - Pop star feeling right now

727
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,230
I only live right now

728
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,699
(You can listen to "P.S." by Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle...)

729
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,869
(on all music streaming services.)

730
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,880
- Pop star. - It's done.

731
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:29,848
- They did well. - They're good.

732
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,710
It's certainly complete.

733
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:35,018
I watched it trying to find what their weakness would be.

734
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:36,420
But I just enjoyed the performance.

735
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:37,890
It just made me enjoy it.

736
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,959
Yang Kyle has an unbelievable charm.

737
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,758
I envied his confident moves.

738
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,028
Yun Ha's rap design and the way he delivers it.

739
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,129
He seemed relaxed,

740
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,470
and his rap could be heard well too.

741
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,868
I think both of them are in their prime days in terms of their skills.

742
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,469
We can't leave out the featured part.

743
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,739
He entered and looked composed.

744
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,809
I think that had the biggest impact.

745
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,579
It felt like a three-person group.

746
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,550
I think we can look forward to the results.

747
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,849
We will begin the first round of voting.

748
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:15,590
(The 1st round of voting begins for Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle.)

749
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,139
Please press it.

750
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:28,440
Please press it.

751
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:35,809
Five, four, three, two, one.

752
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,178
We will close the voting.

753
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,179
(The 1st round of voting ends for Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle.)

754
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,989
Thank you.

755
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,429
I feel very lighthearted.

756
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,229
I kept going to the audience.

757
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,959
I moved around everywhere.

758
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,069
To the back, the side, and the front.

759
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,899
People were having fun with us.

760
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,769
There was nothing better than that.

761
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,609
I have no regrets.

762
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:08,239
I couldn't have done a better job.

763
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,710
I think it came out the way I wanted.

764
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,618
- Good job. - Well done.

765
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:17,420
- Well done. - Good job.

766
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,459
- You did a great job. - You're the best.

767
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,718
- You did a great job. - Well done.

768
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,789
You did a great job.

769
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,129
We had a chance. Our music was the opposite.

770
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,029
And we were going second.

771
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,399
I thought we had an advantage.

772
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,639
It was a battle between pop stars and rock stars.

773
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,170
I think we could win.

774
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:39,309
The feast of devils and the embrace of angels.

775
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,379
I think...

776
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,649
love and peace will warmly embrace...

777
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,079
the devils as well.

778
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,619
That's my careful prediction.

779
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,050
I'm looking forward to it.

780
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,960
The Duet Match ended.

781
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,389
Well done.

782
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,658
They did a great job with the start.

783
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,659
That's right.

784
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,828
Well done.

785
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,500
We have the second round of voting left.

786
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:08,569
Block 2's Loopy and JTONG and Block 3's Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle.

787
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,869
Please come up to the stage.

788
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,210
Yes, sir.

789
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,010
Pop star feeling right now

790
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,479
Okay! Here we go.

791
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,750
They're cool.

792
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,079
(The pride of Busan, JTONG)

793
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,449
Dopamine rush.

794
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,948
It's so cool.

795
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,959
Goodness.

796
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,218
For the second round of voting,

797
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,559
you can only vote for one stage that you liked more.

798
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,558
We will now begin the second round of voting. Let's go.

799
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,869
(The 2nd round of voting begins for the Duet Match.)

800
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
We can't lose.

801
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,420
We can't lose.

802
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,380
(Yang Kyle)

803
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,388
Block Three.

804
00:36:58,389 --> 00:36:59,760
It's Block Two, of course.

805
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,119
Come on.

806
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,029
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

807
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,029
The second round of voting ended.

808
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,070
Thank you.

809
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:14,638
They all did well.

810
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,768
- They both have a strong color. - They're so different.

811
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,578
They had it strong all the way,

812
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:22,678
- and we built it up like this. - Right.

813
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,150
I think it would be moving in a different way.

814
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,750
I'm still...

815
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,448
sweating all over my body.

816
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:31,649
I'm still sweating.

817
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,859
It was fun. Did you have fun?

818
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,559
- Yes! - Yes!

819
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,189
Leaving the results aside,

820
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,658
I'm really glad because I feel like...

821
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,369
I left my footsteps here with a great performance. Thank you.

822
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,439
(Block 2 versus Block 3)

823
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,409
(JTONG and Loopy versus Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle)

824
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:58,948
The result of the first round, Duet Match will be revealed.

825
00:37:58,949 --> 00:37:59,949
Will it be revealed now?

826
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,289
What will it be?

827
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,759
I feel embarrassed because they're all watching.

828
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,889
That's right. There was no one at the semifinals.

829
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,459
We'd win, right?

830
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,800
I hope so.

831
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,030
Please.

832
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,940
The block that won the Duet Match.

833
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,038
Goodness.

834
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,409
I really hate this.

835
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,219
I want to win in the first round.

836
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,538
I think the performance JTONG and I prepared...

837
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,869
was more charming.

838
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,968
The reaction of the audience was really great for us too.

839
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,980
I think we'll have a similar number of votes.

840
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,609
I think I get old during this time.

841
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,820
I feel like I'm getting a month older.

842
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,030
Yes.

843
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,630
Yes.

844
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,828
(Block 2's Loopy and JTONG win the Duet Match.)

845
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,170
The winner is Block Two.

846
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,739
- Yes! - Yes!

847
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,000
Yes!

848
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,980
Did you see that? It's us.

849
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,379
Yes.

850
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,420
- Thank you... - Your ears are alive today.

851
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,250
Put the ears up today.

852
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:47,919
I was relieved.

853
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,058
We did our part.

854
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:53,658
Even if the other members lose,

855
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:57,399
we somewhat made a cushion.

856
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,969
That was a relief.

857
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:03,368
Our members of Block Three trusted us with this match.

858
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,570
I feel sorry.

859
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,709
Still, I think it's a buildup for our dramatic victory.

860
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,979
We'll keep moving forward.

861
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,050
Thank you.

862
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,948
- Well done. - Well done.

863
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:15,119
- Well done. - You're amazing.

864
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,118
The two must be having a heavy heart.

865
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,959
If HAON wins...

866
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,658
in the Leader Match...

867
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,658
I think Block Three will win.

868
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,829
Final Block Match. This round...

869
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,768
is the Leader Match.

870
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,768
(Second round of the Final Block Match, Leader Match)

871
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,569
So far, the role of the block leader...

872
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,379
was really important in RAP: PUBLIC.

873
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,678
From the Infinite Cypher to deathmatches.

874
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,880
There were many moments where leaders decided their block's fate.

875
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,190
We'll once again look forward to their hard work.

876
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,749
I'll introduce the two rappers...

877
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,618
who will show us the leader's power in this round.

878
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,328
Starter, Block Two's leader, ShyboiiTobii.

879
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,329
(Starter of the Leader Match: Block 2's leader, ShyboiiTobii)

880
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,070
And the opposer.

881
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,869
Block Three's HAON.

882
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,669
(Block 2 ShyboiiTobii versus Block 3 HAON)

883
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,178
I'll let you know why...

884
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,480
I became the final leader of Block Two.

885
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:20,019
I'll successfully end the Leader Match...

886
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,090
and bring back victory.

887
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,158
(ShyboiiTobii versus HAON)

888
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,558
We'll start the Leader Match.

889
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,229
Starter, Block Two's leader, ShyboiiTobii.

890
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,329
(Starter in the Leader Match: Block 2's leader, ShyboiiTobii)

891
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,840
(Leader Match: Block 2 ShyboiiTobii)

892
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,339
- It's finally ShyboiiTobii. - ShyboiiTobii.

893
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,868
- He's here. - Let's go.

894
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:44,908
Let's go. Let's show them.

895
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:46,578
- The youngest leader. - Come on.

896
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:48,509
- As you've always done. - Yes.

897
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,549
- Show them. - I'll go.

898
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,379
I'm the leader, and as long as I have that title,

899
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,518
there are many people...

900
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,919
expecting a lot from me.

901
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,659
I should fulfill that expectation.

902
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:03,130
(During Mask Off, the first match of RAP: PUBLIC)

903
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,788
(I don't have anything to say.)

904
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:05,828
(Edgy)

905
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,098
(I've been watching him.)

906
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,159
(ShyboiiTobii's impressive first appearance)

907
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,000
Let go.

908
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,299
(Honestly, I was very angry.)

909
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,768
(He didn't even know me.)

910
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:16,940
(Why did he touch me?)

911
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,509
(Where's yukon's picture?)

912
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,639
(Who's yukon?)

913
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,408
(ShyboiiTobii didn't even remember the name of his blockmate.)

914
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,649
(But as the matches went on...)

915
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,279
(and as he watched his blockmates' performances...)

916
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,889
(Block 3 wins, Block 2 loses)

917
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,349
What?

918
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,859
(ShyboiiTobii watched the moment of Block 2's first defeat...)

919
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,388
(in Block Tournament.)

920
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,359
(The first thing to do...)

921
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,428
(was to comfort the members who went there.)

922
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:42,058
(He was upset that he couldn't show the performance he prepared.)

923
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,630
(But he came to think about how the blockmates would feel first.)

924
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:51,639
(I've found another family here.)

925
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,980
(With the failure came the first moment of goodbye.)

926
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,749
(My heart broke.)

927
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,988
(He expected the victory of Block 2 in Block Competition.)

928
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:04,049
(Block 2 loses, Block 1 wins)

929
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,260
(But they faced another defeat.)

930
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:09,489
(Going to the deathmatch is really good.)

931
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,928
(The repeated failures strengthened his will and desperate heart.)

932
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:15,030
(Isn't this cool?)

933
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:16,928
(I can do this too.)

934
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,129
(Do you have a hook?)

935
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,968
(He started moving actively for the blockmates.)

936
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,308
(ShyboiiTobii made a hook at the spot.)

937
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,178
(We mixed the ingredients we had.)

938
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,678
(That resulted in something amazing.)

939
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:33,149
(Like that, the deathmatch to decide the block's fate started again.)

940
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,018
(ShyboiiTobii did his best in the match...)

941
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:36,920
(with a desperate heart.)

942
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,788
(The rapper we will save...)

943
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,959
(is ShyboiiTobii.)

944
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,860
(ShyboiiTobii became the only one who survived.)

945
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,159
Really.

946
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:49,500
Let's meet again outside.

947
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:53,069
(As he did his best, it was painful to watch...)

948
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,869
(the blockmates that he got attached to leave.)

949
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,379
(I want you to become the leader.)

950
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,808
(I'm confident.)

951
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,279
(I'm confident until the day I die.)

952
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,479
(I wanted to lead Block 2...)

953
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,189
(with the responsibility as the leader.)

954
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,618
(Could I take one for the team?)

955
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,459
(I mean it.)

956
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,689
(He told the members that he wanted to become the leader...)

957
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,928
(and was confident that they'd win.)

958
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:23,368
(ShyboiiTobii became the final leader of Block 2.)

959
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,868
(After becoming the leader, he recruited Block 5's JP and OSUN.)

960
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:29,839
(He also brought Block 5's Block Money of 30,000 dollars.)

961
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,868
(It's 30,000 dollars.)

962
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,209
(30,000 dollars?)

963
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,109
(You're making accomplishments as the leader.)

964
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,808
(I made it right away.)

965
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,709
- It's 59,000 dollars. - It changed.

966
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,979
(He made Block 2 have the highest amount of Block Money.)

967
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,218
(He also succeeded in the Beef Challenge trade with Block 6.)

968
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:44,789
(After I became the leader, )

969
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,618
(we haven't lost yet.)

970
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,218
(The block that won...)

971
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,529
(They won 1st place in the Crew Battle...)

972
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,828
(and advanced to the Final Block Match.)

973
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:56,069
(Block 2 continued to win ever since Shyboiitobii became the leader.)

974
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,768
When I got to know ShyboiiTobii...

975
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,738
An unforgettable trauma

976
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:04,969
I thought he was someone with a pure soul.

977
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,479
He knew how to take care of the block and the members.

978
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,518
I could see that he wanted...

979
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,118
to fill in for our weak parts.

980
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:18,518
So he was suitable as a leader.

981
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,820
I think he's a great leader.

982
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:24,428
I hope he doesn't get too burdened. I want him to have fun...

983
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:28,198
and show us what he wants to do.

984
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,570
The song I prepared for the Leader Match...

985
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,969
is called "Suicide Squad."

986
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,169
There's a movie called "Suicide Squad."

987
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,749
Not everyone looks at the superheroes.

988
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,809
Heroes can exist when there are villains.

989
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,549
It has the message that you can change the world...

990
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,820
even if you're bad.

991
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,489
Suicide squad

992
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,259
Cutting up the tag, I won't take it

993
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,759
Hang with idols, no wifey

994
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,328
Audemars watch, priceless

995
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:59,799
Pacman, I'm not satisfied to be full and I'm like okay

996
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,959
Let's get it now, Tobii and Milli

997
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,729
I brought Kid Milli and Lil Boi.

998
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,098
I looked for people who would go well with my mood.

999
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,439
They gladly accepted it,

1000
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,969
so it went well.

1001
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,178
The concept of this match...

1002
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,650
would be a riot.

1003
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:19,209
I will show my control over the stage.

1004
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,379
I'll nail it with my guts, passion,

1005
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,949
and performance.

1006
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,489
Let's start the camera rehearsal.

1007
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,789
- He's starting. - Let's go.

1008
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,559
(ShyboiiTobii's performance begins with the siren sound.)

1009
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,598
Sein on this beat go insane

1010
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,170
My twin my my sha

1011
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,868
(HAON watches the rehearsal seriously.)

1012
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,599
I was very nervous while watching it...

1013
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,570
because he was my opponent.

1014
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,839
I really like ShyboiiTobii's attitude on stage.

1015
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,709
He always did what he wanted to do.

1016
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,209
I thought that was cool.

1017
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,678
As I expected, as soon as the performance began,

1018
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,578
there was a police car after him.

1019
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,789
He did his thing.

1020
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,989
Kid Milli.

1021
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:00,859
Cutting up the tag, I won't take it

1022
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,388
Hang with idols, no wifey

1023
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,959
Audemars watch, priceless

1024
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,189
Why should I prove more? The grading isn't enough

1025
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,098
Words and words, all violence

1026
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:08,158
Whole squad keep hunna

1027
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,399
Pipe down, hyped up, we're up

1028
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,598
- The rap monster. - The nice and indigo

1029
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,030
- Lil Boi - Yes

1030
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,468
Keep it 100, Bad people make bad things here

1031
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,069
Tapdancing on stage without rapping

1032
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,209
Lil Boi as well?

1033
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,779
Why are they my enemies?

1034
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,808
Lil Boi was unexpected.

1035
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:23,379
I had no idea.

1036
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,109
Let's get it now, Tobii and Milli

1037
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,749
That's my team my team

1038
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,049
He brought the two best rappers in Korea.

1039
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,689
He brought the best reinforcement.

1040
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,519
They're really good rappers. So it was very...

1041
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:34,920
threatening.

1042
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,959
Suicide squad

1043
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,959
(The rehearsal ended with a strong featuring.)

1044
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
That's cool!

1045
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:41,760
Suicide squad!

1046
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,400
They're all very good.

1047
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,229
There is no easy fight.

1048
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,639
There are no easy opponents.

1049
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,800
It's the finals.

1050
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,199
Since it's the finals,

1051
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,969
I plan to show them everything.

1052
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,979
I'll show you why I'm good.

1053
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,749
I'm confident in winning in RAP: PUBLIC.

1054
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,980
I'll win no matter what.

1055
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:04,919
Block Two's leader ShyboiiTobii...

1056
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,488
is the last leader of his block.

1057
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:09,518
He's young, but he led the block with a bold heart.

1058
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,689
Since he represents the block,

1059
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,698
he prepared a strong performance...

1060
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:15,899
with confidence.

1061
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,170
The starter for the Leader Match.

1062
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,098
Block Two's leader, ShyboiiTobii's performance will begin.

1063
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,900
Let's go.

1064
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,110
It's starting.

1065
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,379
I'm looking forward to it.

1066
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,280
It would be over if the deathmatch ShyboiiTobii comes out.

1067
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,078
No one can beat the deathmatch ShyboiiTobii.

1068
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,989
It's starting. ShyboiiTobii.

1069
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,559
(Starter of the Leader Match: Block 2's leader, ShyboiiTobii)

1070
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,859
("Suicide Squad" featured by Kid Milli and Lil Boi)

00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,230
(Lyrics by ShyboiTobii, Kid Milli, and Lil Boi)

1072
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,070
Sein on this beat go insane, My twin my my sha

1073
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,670

1074
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,269
- Sha - It's cool.

1075
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,820
It's sexy.

1076
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:14,319
He'll be possessed.

1077
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,629
When we pull up outside, People turn their heads

1078
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,828
We come out, the siren rings

1079
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:24,129
I might die about mine, Die rich or die trying

1080
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,639
Smoke in my lungs, now in my

1081
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,570
I cannot fallout about no

1082
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,268
Suicide my whole squad lit

1083
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,908
If you open it, I open it too, Wallet

1084
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:36,109
Man I'm way too high, Too geeked up, need an autopilot

1085
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,749
Man I'm with my boi Sein, Going insane in the stu

1086
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,819
- It's cool. - Making hits timeless

1087
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,880
Man we timeless

1088
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,789
I've been gone for a while, I'm back now

1089
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,420
Even if the world turns on me, I can't back down

1090
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,328
I'm going to get in my bag now

1091
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:52,428
I'm smoking

1092
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:53,860
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1093
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,030
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1094
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,300
- I set fire to your house - I set fire to your house

1095
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,610
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1096
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:06,039
Kid Milli, let's go

1097
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,609
Cutting up the tag, I won't take it

1098
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,178
Hang with idols, no wifey

1099
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:11,649
Audemars watch, priceless

1100
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,448
Why should I prove more? The grading isn't enough

1101
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:14,848
Words and words, all violence

1102
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:17,089
Whole squad keep hunna, Burn it up more

1103
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,118
Run it up, run it up, hurry, Suicide squad, put in work

1104
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,218
Loaded up Tobii and Milli, Earn million, bullets on RAP: PUBLIC

1105
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,558
My mouth is the pistol, John Wick

1106
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,589
I do it however it's fun, Don't think, time flies, Son

1107
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,198
- It's sexy. - People all watch, my eighth year

1108
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,428
I put on a calculated expression

1109
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:30,399
When you all go to Hongdae, I'm looking for houses

1110
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,099
Mansion bought with a single payment

1111
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,138
Shyboii Milli, no business

1112
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,738
I don't keep bad friends next to me

1113
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:37,339
I don't make allies with lies

1114
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,968
I don't end it after the one time

1115
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,439
Once we're on, We go together until the end

1116
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,209
That means "squad," You all know what it means, right?

1117
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,709
Pipe down, hyped up, we're up

1118
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,750
- The nice and indigo, keep it G - Lil Boi

1119
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:49,578
Keep it 100 Bad people make bad things here

1120
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,488
Tapdancing on stage without rapping

1121
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:53,018
I spit out all the pay, I fill my mouth

1122
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,788
I eat them up, Game Pacman

1123
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:56,218
I'm not satisfied to be full

1124
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,360
And I'm like okay

1125
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,889
Let's get it now, Tobii and Milli

1126
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,899
That's my team my team

1127
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,459
White T with holes

1128
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,769
Two whips from there

1129
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,729
My friends are sick, I take care of them

1130
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,439
- The next is already full - Lil Boi's live rap is amazing.

1131
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,999
We're three, we count

1132
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,109
Up in the sky, we're too high, Going Buckwilds

1133
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,569
I set fire during daylight

1134
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,209
The red dot follows my head

1135
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,908
My squad lit, We start the mess anywhere, I feast

1136
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:19,379
I get rid of all the tracks, I emptied everything

1137
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,678
Turn on this theme song

1138
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:23,189
My fire never dies

1139
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,719
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1140
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,590
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1141
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,960
- I set fire to your house - I set fire to your house

1142
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,329
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1143
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,530
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1144
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,368
I tear off many tags

1145
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:40,968
I know I'm good but I don't brag

1146
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,368
They all say my life is ruined

1147
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,968
But why am I wearing Yves Saint Laurent?

1148
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:45,709
I skip the trial on the 18th

1149
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,308
I can't be on the same boat with a rat

1150
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:48,879
I change this game

1151
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,908
No cigarette between my fingers

1152
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:52,509
I can't focus, Need some Adderall

1153
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,249
I don't like plans, Man I just kind of roll with

1154
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,549
She wants to see my bedroom

1155
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,488
I don't mix with cheap things no matter what it is

1156
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,988
Expensive apparel still on my body

1157
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:00,658
I won't listen, I'll live the way I want

1158
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,590
Because I never looked up to no hero

1159
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,529
- Let's go - Money bag, money way

1160
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,130
Me and my boys aren't sinning for free

1161
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:09,359
Money in my head, Turn every trouble into dust

1162
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,529
Club throw that money away, We'll make a shower tonight

1163
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,098
We can't be rehabilitated, The green rain, that's all I see

1164
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,610
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1165
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,840
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1166
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,610
Let's go

1167
00:52:21,611 --> 00:52:23,079
- I set fire to your house - I set fire to your house

1168
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,309
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1169
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:27,949
One more time, go

1170
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,650
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1171
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,288
It's hot.

1172
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:32,690
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1173
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,659
- Let's get it - I set fire to your house

1174
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,230
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1175
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,800
- Suicide squad - Suicide squad

1176
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,099
Make some noise for ShyboiiTobii.

1177
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:50,710
Make some noise for Kid Milli and Lil Boi.

1178
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,939
(You can listen to "Suicide Squad" by ShyboiiTobii...)

1179
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,210
(featured by Kid Milli and Lil boi on all music streaming services.)

1180
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,678
The three of them nailed it.

1181
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:01,718
ShyboiiTobii.

1182
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,320
- They're cool. - We won!

1183
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:10,329
It was just fire.

1184
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,559
It was so hot.

1185
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,129
There was real fire too.

1186
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,598
I just watched it without saying anything.

1187
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:17,599
It was so cool.

1188
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,369
I don't keep bad friends next to me

1189
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,968
Kid Milli was really good.

1190
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,499
Lil Boi was crazy.

1191
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,038
The red dot follows my head

1192
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,539
The combination of the three was amazing.

1193
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,979
The audience was jumping with them...

1194
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,309
as it went to the end.

1195
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,650
I thought he had a shot.

1196
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,018
It must have been burdensome too.

1197
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,730
The dopamine was carried on well.

1198
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:47,299
He's like a man today.

1199
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,928
He did better than at the rehearsal.

1200
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,169
It suits the finals.

1201
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,869
We'll begin the first round of voting. Let's go.

1202
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,239
(The 1st round of voting begins for Block 2's ShyboiiTobii.)

1203
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:55,670
Act cute, ShyboiiTobii.

1204
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,510
That's nice. Good.

1205
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:02,179
Thank you.

1206
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,848
Five, four, three, two, one.

1207
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:14,058
The voting is closed.

1208
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:15,289
(The 1st round of voting ends for Block 2's ShyboiiTobii.)

1209
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,828
Block Two's leader ShyboiiTobii can return to his block...

1210
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:20,658
and watch the stage of his opponent.

1211
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:22,699
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1212
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:29,069
(ShyboiiTobii returns to Block 2.)

1213
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,709
ShyboiiTobii.

1214
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,309
- ShyboiiTobii. - ShyboiiTobii.

1215
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,609
You did great.

1216
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,849
Well done.

1217
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,448
There are times I go crazy.

1218
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:41,948
I also don't remember how I did.

1219
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,550
- Let's go - Suicide squad

1220
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,218
I saw the audience enjoy it.

1221
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,719
People were accepting it.

1222
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:51,630
I felt proud.

1223
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,828
I'm really happy...

1224
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,360
because I ended it well without making a mistake.

1225
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:57,529
The opposer of the Leader Match.

1226
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,638
Block Three's leader HAON.

1227
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,038
(Opposer of the Leader Match: Block 3's leader HAON)

1228
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,710
(Leader Match: Block 3 HAON)

1229
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,079
I'll go.

1230
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,980
Our leader.

1231
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,909
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1232
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,549
- I'll enjoy it. - Okay. Have fun.

1233
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,848
- Right. - Don't feel pressured.

1234
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,249
Let's go, Block Three.

1235
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,420
- Team Trinity! - Team Trinity!

1236
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:20,218
Block Three's leader HAON...

1237
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:22,718
was the first member and the leader of Block Three.

1238
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,230
He acted as the reliable center of the block.

1239
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,360
I should definitely win the Leader Match.

1240
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,230
(HAON started as the first leader of Block 3 in RAP: PUBLIC.)

1241
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:33,969
(I became the leader of Block 3.)

1242
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:37,408
(HAON did his best as their leader from the Infinite Cypher.)

1243
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:40,609
(Afterward, he became a hero by showcasing great rap skills.)

1244
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,678
(He fulfilled his responsibility as our leader.)

1245
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,848
(We have to pick 3 rappers to be the elimination candidates.)

1246
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,549
(Those 3 rappers will compete in the deathmatch.)

1247
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,479
(He shared with the entire block about the deathmatch...)

1248
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,448
(as well as the elimination candidates.)

1249
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:54,118
(He didn't make a decision by himself.)

1250
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,359
(He shared everything with us.)

1251
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,859
(The fact that...)

1252
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,158
(he let us select the elimination candidates...)

1253
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,099
(made me feel really grateful to HAON.)

1254
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,468
(He was always considerate of everyone on Block 3...)

1255
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:06,629
(so that they all had their moment.)

1256
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,968
(Did anyone take the 15th beat?)

1257
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,038
(No.)

1258
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:10,939
(He stepped up and took the parts other rappers had a hard time with.)

1259
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,038
(He was the first one to volunteer for the deathmatch...)

1260
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,309
(when he wasn't the leader.)

1261
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:18,109
(HAON feels a huge sense of responsibility for his block.)

1262
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,009
(He's the perfect example of a good leader.)

1263
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,178
(I was reassured to have him as our leader.)

1264
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,419
(The leader represents the block.)

1265
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,518
(ShyboiiTobii became their leader.)

1266
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,959
(When ShyboiiTobii became the leader of Block 2,)

1267
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,058
(HAON took on the role of the leader...)

1268
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:30,359
(with a new sense of responsibility and determination.)

1269
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,359
(He once again demonstrated excellent rap skills...)

1270
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,098
(in Kill Them All as their leader.)

1271
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,030
(He kept competing in the matches as they had the least Block Money.)

1272
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:40,340
(Block 3 won 1st place in Round 5.)

1273
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:42,669
When I saw HAON's sheer determination,

1274
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,839
I thought he was so talented and was happy I joined...

1275
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,638
Block Three.

1276
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,979
HAON. You did a great job as our block's leader.

1277
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,908
Thanks to your leadership, we made it this far.

1278
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,279
I know the weight of the responsibility...

1279
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,249
and burden leaders have to bear.

1280
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,649
So I just hope that HAON can enjoy this match...

1281
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,158
and have fun on stage without any sense of pressure.

1282
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,218
I really want him to perform without any burden.

1283
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,058
You are the leader of our block.

1284
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:06,859
I believe in you. You'll show us the best performance.

1285
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,098
I joined this block for you.

1286
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:09,500
You got this, HAON.

1287
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,569
(Leader Match rehearsal)

1288
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,800
(What is the song HAON prepared for this match?)

1289
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,169
In my opinion, our world has turned into a bit of a cynical place.

1290
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,939
Instead of stoning someone,

1291
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,809
people opted for writing a harsher post.

1292
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:25,779
When I saw what was happening, I was a bit sad.

1293
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,448
("Butterfly")

1294
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:30,649
(It's free, y'all, to dream, yes)

1295
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,919
(Everyone laughed at me, but I'm still going to try)

1296
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,718
So I wanted to write a song...

1297
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,928
for those people and the people who get stoned.

1298
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:40,029
"Spread your wings and look at the world."

1299
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,059
That's the message I wanted to incorporate.

1300
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:47,368
(Lee Young Ji shows up to perform with HAON.)

1301
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:48,799
Lee Young Ji...

1302
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,440
came to the show as my featured artist.

1303
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,038
(HAON and Young Ji won...)

1304
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:54,380
(in the 2nd and 3rd seasons of "High School Rapper.")

1305
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,979
I thought that she and I...

1306
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,979
had been on a similar path in life.

1307
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,218
I thought that the song would be complete in the truest sense.

1308
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:03,250
So I contacted her.

1309
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,749
All right. Let's begin the camera rehearsal.

1310
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,388
They included the wings of butterflies.

1311
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:08,719
Is that the theme? The butterflies?

1312
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,860
(ShyboiiTobii watches HAON's rehearsal.)

1313
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,198
Now that we're in this world, there is no other choice

1314
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,598
We must either hide or spread our wings

1315
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,328
That's the answer to the life I have been living

1316
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,299
My music and goals are miracles

1317
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,399
I don't need speed

1318
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,499
Should I say that the mood of his song...

1319
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,808
was positive and sorrowful?

1320
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,409
I could sense that he was trying to convey his message in his rap.

1321
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:31,579
It's Lee Young Ji.

1322
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,150
It's Lee Young Ji. My gosh.

1323
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,379
But let me level up for the next step we planned

1324
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,218
It will come to bloom again under the flickering lights

1325
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,948
Remember the light that recognized our night

1326
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,118
Be it a moth or a butterfly

1327
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,319
- We still got to - We still got to fly

1328
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,388
She's great.

1329
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:44,859
- It's free, y'all - It's free, y'all

1330
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,129
Lee Young Ji? I think she's so talented.

1331
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,859
Having Young Ji as the featured artist...

1332
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,570
How should I put it?

1333
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:52,368
It's a trump card.

1334
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:54,169
This is so not fair.

1335
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,169
You have to try

1336
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,038
- Yes! - You have to try.

1337
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,279
Lee Young Ji!

1338
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,578
- Thank you. - Hello.

1339
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,109
- Lee Young Ji. - Hello.

1340
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,179
Hello.

1341
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:06,409
ShyboiiTobii.

1342
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:09,679
- Hello. - Hello.

1343
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,349
I hope you liked our song.

1344
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,218
The atmosphere is so different for each block.

1345
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:14,658
- Right. Totally. - The blocks...

1346
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:16,558
- So this is... - all have their own color.

1347
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,259
When our song hurts them, Block Three will heal the wounds.

1348
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,800
We hurt them, and Block Three heals them.

1349
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:22,929
We'll be okay, right?

1350
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,130
They're not an easy match.

1351
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,399
Since the last match was against HAON,

1352
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,139
it was impossible not to feel threatened.

1353
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,139
My goal from the get-go was to win the whole competition.

1354
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,050
I will keep trying to the end.

1355
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:43,119
I will bring victory to our block with the Leader Match.

1356
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:47,459
HAON, the leader of Block Three, said he planned to show us...

1357
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,218
another story of his growth through the match.

1358
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,089
The leader of Block Three, HAON, will perform...

1359
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,399
for the Leader Match now.

1360
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,570
Let's go!

1361
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:02,268
- He's going to start. - It's starting.

1362
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,538
- This is a great song too. - Right.

1363
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:04,709
- Right. - Yes.

1364
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,409
- I can't wait to see him kill it. - Totally.

1365
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,079
- Gosh, HAON will start. - There it goes.

1366
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,280
He will start right away.

1367
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:14,380
(Opposer of the Leader Match: Block 3's leader HAON)

1368
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,389
My gosh, check out the special effects.

1369
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,388
("Butterfly" featured by Lee Young Ji)

1370
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:29,460
(Lyrics by HAON and Lee Young Ji)

1371
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:41,678
It's free, y'all

1372
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,509
To dream, yes

1373
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:47,479
Everyone laughed at me, I'm still going to try

1374
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,388
Butterfly, you must fly

1375
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:53,249
It must hurt

1376
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,960
- But you still have to try - My gosh.

1377
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,959
At one point, everyone hits rock bottom

1378
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,089
When they think they've gotten bigger

1379
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,229
They are contained in the darkness

1380
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,799
Now that we're in this world

1381
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,800
There is no other choice

1382
01:01:02,801 --> 01:01:03,968
We must either hide or spread our wings

1383
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,599
That's the answer to the life I have been living

1384
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:07,768
My music and goals are miracles

1385
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:09,499
I don't need speed, why? Because light is my attribute

1386
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,968
So it's not in slow motion, It's beast mode

1387
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:12,908
I fly higher, I just focus

1388
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:13,979
There's drama in my life

1389
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,879
When I acted with gratitude, I received more love

1390
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,709
The place I land is full of floral scents

1391
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,809
Don't downplay my life with your allergy

1392
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,319
Here's a thing about my life

1393
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,650
Your fingers are so weak that you can't break me

1394
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:25,788
I fly gracefully, I don't want to see nirvana

1395
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:27,960
But I'm ready to die

1396
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,658
It's free, y'all

1397
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,789
To dream, yes

1398
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:35,558
I'm still going to try

1399
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,530
- Look at his eyes - Butterfly

1400
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,238
It must hurt

1401
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,069
But you still have to try

1402
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,969
Have to try

1403
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,209
Butterfly

1404
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,939
- There she is! Young Ji. - Swag.

1405
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,909
- Young Ji! - Butterfly

1406
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,749
Ladies and gents, Lee Young Ji.

1407
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,618
Manifestate, no hesitation

1408
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:01,459
All those hard times in my life are like fiction

1409
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,788
The Almighty told me, He gave me the best talent

1410
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,158
I still remember the thrill from that day

1411
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:05,259
- Look, my vision is clear - Vision

1412
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,328
Life is gambling

1413
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:07,329
- Do not mumble when you trip - When you trip

1414
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,999
The pitch-black darkness is before your eyes

1415
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,058
- When I chirp - Chirp

1416
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,169
- When I swerve on them - Swerve

1417
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:13,098
Life goes on, and we've still got to move on

1418
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:14,839
- Money fame, That's all that we got - That's all that we got

1419
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,899
But love and wings

1420
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,939
- That's all we lost - That's all we lost

1421
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,609
Remember the wings when they spread to the fullest in life

1422
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,669
But right now, under some standards

1423
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,738
- They are tucked away - Tucked away

1424
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:22,678
But let me level up for the next step we planned

1425
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,408
It will come to bloom again under the flickering lights

1426
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:26,479
Remember the light that recognized our night

1427
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,480
Be it a moth or a butterfly

1428
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:28,920
- We still got to - We still got to fly

1429
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,089
- It's free, y'all - It's free, y'all

1430
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,018
- To dream, yes - To dream, yes

1431
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:35,018
- Everyone laughed at me - Hey!

1432
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:36,859
- I'm still going to try - Try

1433
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,859
- Butterfly - Hands up!

1434
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,729
You must fly

1435
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,829
It must hurt

1436
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:45,130
Let's go!

1437
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,799
Let me introduce myself again, I'm 24

1438
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,968
My life still feels

1439
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:50,808
Strange, where did I come from and where will I go?

1440
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,768
I asked myself that, but I had never left

1441
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,779
In no time, only money piled up in me

1442
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,538
I don't want to be alone, The answer is in my two hands

1443
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:57,578
I must have been walking too long

1444
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:58,649
The path I walked must have been dirty

1445
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,979
It might be hard to smile

1446
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,320
- Like I did back then - Hey!

1447
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,419
- So I'll calm myself down deeply - Deeply

1448
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,319
- Under the mask they put on me - On me

1449
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,259
I shine forever with the expectations they have of me

1450
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,118
When I silence them, they turn into darkness

1451
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,029
I fly to the sky with gratitude, All the dramas

1452
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,959
And problems are split in half like I'm King Solomon

1453
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,629
In no way, there's desperation in my action

1454
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:15,799
Even if I hit rock bottom, I'm going

1455
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,328
- To fly out - One, two

1456
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:20,369
- One, two, three. Let's fly! - Let's fly!

1457
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,868
- It's free, y'all - It's free, y'all

1458
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:24,768
- To dream, yes - To dream, yes

1459
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,808
- Everyone laughed at me - Hey!

1460
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,738
- I'm still going to try - Hey!

1461
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,649
- Butterfly - Butterfly

1462
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,678
You must fly

1463
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,479
It must hurt

1464
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,219
- But you still have to try - Have to try

1465
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,119
Have to try

1466
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,388
- Say what? - Butterfly

1467
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:42,488
My gosh.

1468
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,190
- Put your hands up. - Butterfly

1469
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,129
Have to try

1470
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,260
- Butterfly - Butterfly

1471
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,468
(You can listen to "Butterfly" by HAON...)

1472
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,199
(on all music streaming services.)

1473
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,779
- Hey! - Hey!

1474
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,510
- Those are bright smiles. - Hey.

1475
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:08,578
That was crazy. My throat is hurting a lot...

1476
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:11,349
because I'm feeling overwhelmed emotionally.

1477
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:14,058
- Gosh, he killed it. - That was a real butterfly.

1478
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,090
How romantic.

1479
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,889
It was like a butterfly was flying away.

1480
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:18,959
Well, two winners...

1481
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,759
from "High School Rapper" performed together.

1482
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,630
Their synergy was incredible.

1483
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:26,198
I thought that we shouldn't lower our guards.

1484
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:27,768
The most memorable part of the performance was,

1485
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:30,268
"I don't know where I came from and where I will go,"

1486
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:31,738
"but I've been here the whole time."

1487
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:34,538
The lyrics represented the dilemma he was struggling with...

1488
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:36,479
while living his life.

1489
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,709
But it sounded like he kept trying.

1490
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,819
So that part resonated with me personally.

1491
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,348
When I watch HAON perform,

1492
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:46,119
something about his performance makes me emotional.

1493
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:49,589
Nothing can beat a touching performance...

1494
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:53,058
like that in my opinion.

1495
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:54,230
So he will probably win.

1496
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,969
We will begin the first round of voting. Let's go.

1497
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,500
(The 1st round of voting begins for HAON in the Leader Match.)

1498
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:06,710
Thank you.

1499
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,809
- There's no way he will lose. - Right.

1500
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,808
But this might be a tough call for the audience.

1501
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,079
This is totally based on their preferences.

1502
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:19,089
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

1503
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:21,488
The voting is closed now.

1504
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:22,559
(The voting is closed for the Leader Match.)

1505
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,689
HAON, the leader of Block Three, you can leave the stage for now.

1506
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,760
Thank you.

1507
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,630
Thank you.

1508
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,599
(He returns to the waiting room after the performance.)

1509
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:38,710
That was so cool. I mean it.

1510
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:41,079
- Well done. - You were great.

1511
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,079
You were incredible. Seriously.

1512
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,480
I'm relieved.

1513
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,618
I want to give myself a pat on the back.

1514
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:49,480
I especially want to thank Young Ji.

1515
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,320
She was indeed on another level.

1516
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,820
The energy she drew out from the audience was crazy.

1517
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:59,428
I think I was able to show all the raw emotions...

1518
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:01,900
I felt while writing this song through our performance.

1519
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,000
I have no regrets.

1520
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,299
The Leader Match is over, everyone.

1521
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,768
Only the second round of voting remains now.

1522
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:10,908
These rappers put on incredible performances...

1523
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:12,069
on behalf of their blocks.

1524
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,968
I will invite ShyboiiTobii, the leader of Block Two,

1525
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:16,038
and HAON, the leader of Block Three,

1526
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,980
back to the stage. Let's go.

1527
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:27,319
Honestly, there's no way they can beat us with this.

1528
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,488
His message was so cool.

1529
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:29,959
- Right. - Spread your wings.

1530
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,090
- He poured his heart into this. - That always resonates with people.

1531
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,959
It's up to their taste.

1532
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,558
But objectively, ShyboiiTobii's performance was good.

1533
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:37,300
ShyboiiTobii was so laid-back.

1534
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,170
We will begin the second round of voting. Let's go.

1535
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,800
(The 2nd round of voting for the Leader Match begins.)

1536
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,150
(Shy)

1537
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,150
What are you doing?

1538
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:58,449
- Stop it. - I'm sorry. I'll stop.

1539
01:06:58,519 --> 01:06:59,619
(I'll do it.)

1540
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:04,690
There's a heart battle going on.

1541
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:11,900
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

1542
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:14,440
The voting is closed.

1543
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,769
By the way, those two leaders worked really hard.

1544
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,639
Everyone deserves a round of applause.

1545
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,480
- Well done. - He did a great job.

1546
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,009
Your performances were quite different...

1547
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,678
given the theme of the songs and so on.

1548
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:28,980
What did you think of each other's performance?

1549
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,250
Well,

1550
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:31,719
that was hot.

1551
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,690
Things got so heated...

1552
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,059
that I almost called 911.

1553
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,320
Okay.

1554
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,928
Did you like that?

1555
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:38,960
(Nodding)

1556
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,259
It was like my performance hurt some people,

1557
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,828
but his performance healed their wounds.

1558
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:44,099
It was a healing vibe.

1559
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:48,139
So when I was listening to his song, I felt at peace.

1560
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:52,210
(ShyboiiTobii versus HAON)

1561
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,969
The final result...

1562
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:57,380
of Round Two, the Leader Match, will be revealed.

1563
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,710
The winning block of the Leader Match is...

1564
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,320
Don't worry. I think ShyboiiTobii will win.

1565
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,619
ShyboiiTobii killed it.

1566
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:10,090
Please.

1567
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:14,860
My gosh. My heart is pounding like crazy.

1568
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,629
I don't think ShyboiiTobii's performance...

1569
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,869
was overwhelmingly good that my performance would be overlooked.

1570
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:26,510
I thought losing with this kind of performance would make no sense.

1571
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,180
Please.

1572
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:33,109
ShyboiiTobii didn't make any mistakes.

1573
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:34,679
The quality of his performance was quite high.

1574
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,149
We could look forward to getting a good result.

1575
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,158
Okay.

1576
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:49,859
(HAON is the final winner of the Leader Match.)

1577
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:52,068
- Nice. - Nice.

1578
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:53,100
Nice.

1579
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:54,770
I'm so proud of you.

1580
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,170
Nice.

1581
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,510
Well done.

1582
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,739
You're indeed our leader.

1583
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,609
That's all right. You're still amazing!

1584
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:03,279
Hey.

1585
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,180
This was a meaningful victory.

1586
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,850
I didn't have any regrets. So I'm happy with the result.

1587
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:11,850
Well done, HAON.

1588
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,119
- Great job. - Well done.

1589
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:16,788
Now that we made it this far after all those hardships,

1590
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:19,260
we cannot afford to lose.

1591
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:20,828
We're so close to winning.

1592
01:09:20,829 --> 01:09:22,960
I'll make sure we win the whole competition.

1593
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:26,398
I lost the match. But in the end,

1594
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,169
I gained a lot from this match.

1595
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,470
In my eyes, I'm a winner too. Thank you.

1596
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,538
That's all right. You're amazing, ShyboiiTobii!

1597
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:34,909
- You put up a good fight! - You're so cool!

1598
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,409
Winning second place after making it this far?

1599
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:40,449
That will put me in a tight spot.

1600
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,920
We will win no matter what.

1601
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,689
Oh, my. Everyone.

1602
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,319
Only the last match remains now.

1603
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:52,858
We're reaching the end. Oh, no.

1604
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:54,359
I was barely on the show.

1605
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,029
This is not fair.

1606
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,000
Their fates are at stake on this last round.

1607
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:02,469
It's called the Block Match.

1608
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:04,239
(Round Three, Final Block Match)

1609
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:08,979
RAP: PUBLIC tells the story of rappers...

1610
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,448
who came together as a team under the name of a block...

1611
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:13,879
while sharing tears and laughter...

1612
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,550
as they fought their way toward victory.

1613
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,288
In the last round of the Final Block Match,

1614
01:10:18,289 --> 01:10:21,689
the entire block will perform together and show their teamwork.

1615
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,459
As all the rappers from each block...

1616
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,590
will perform together,

1617
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:28,728
I am expecting to see a more intense and powerful match.

1618
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,728
All right. The last round, Block Match,

1619
01:10:30,729 --> 01:10:33,329
will be kicked off with Block 2. And Block 3 will perform after them.

1620
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:44,140
Here's Block 2, the block to perform 1st!

1621
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,349
Block Two!

1622
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:48,350
(Block 2, the starters for the Block Match)

1623
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,619
Two!

1624
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:54,319
I'm looking forward to the 8-on-8 performance.

1625
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:56,459
For this match,

1626
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,829
the entire block will perform together.

1627
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,199
Everyone will shine in this performance.

1628
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:04,130
We were so happy and had fun while preparing for it.

1629
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:05,868
Ever since we started on this show,

1630
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:07,799
we all wanted to perform in this match.

1631
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,470
We got here like we talked about. How do you feel?

1632
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:13,568
This was a journey that no single person...

1633
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,139
could have led us through.

1634
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,439
So that's incredibly touching.

1635
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,309
- I feel reassured. - Yes.

1636
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:21,818
Everyone had their own role.

1637
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,149
So we could make it this far.

1638
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,849
You're not going to cry after the performance. Right?

1639
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,920
Don't cry.

1640
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,919
I won't cry today. Not today.

1641
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,589
- I'm not wearing pink today. - Really?

1642
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,259
- Yes. Not today. - This bunny's ears...

1643
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,089
- won't droop down today. - Right. Not today.

1644
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,529
These ears won't droop down today.

1645
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,359
You should put two water bottles in the ears.

1646
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:39,729
- Like this? To make them stand up? - To make them stand up.

1647
01:11:40,369 --> 01:11:42,170
When we first joined Block Two,

1648
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:44,568
Loopy said that continuing the show with the same rappers was the goal.

1649
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:45,609
Right.

1650
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:50,779
(Loopy was the 1st leader and member of Block 2 during the formation.)

1651
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,148
I hope rappers who believe that...

1652
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:57,889
by working together, we can accomplish things...

1653
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:00,819
that can't be done alone would come to my block.

1654
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:02,559
I'll take yukon, number 60.

1655
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:09,130
(Young-blood rappers joined Block 2 under Loopy's leadership.)

1656
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,159
Raf Sandou.

1657
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:15,270
I wanted to impart my skills and experience to them,

1658
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:19,139
so our block could show a coming-of-age story.

1659
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,340
That was my goal.

1660
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,978
It was a really difficult path to make it this far.

1661
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:23,979
We kept losing.

1662
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,210
Right.

1663
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:27,920
(Block 2 competed against Block 3 in the Block Tournament.)

1664
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:34,250
(They faced their 1st loss on the show by 1 vote.)

1665
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:36,959
(He felt the weight of being a leader...)

1666
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,760
(for the first time in the deathmatch.)

1667
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:41,099
(The defeated leader, KHAN.)

1668
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,568
(Announce the rappers who will have to leave the show.)

1669
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:48,699
(Block 2 lost 2 rappers in the 1st deathmatch.)

1670
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,868
People left, and new rappers joined.

1671
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,409
We made it this far because we had the same goal.

1672
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,979
(Foggyatthebottom newly joined the block when they lost rappers.)

1673
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:02,420
- We've never met before. - My gosh.

1674
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,189
(Let's go.)

1675
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,420
Let's go.

1676
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,288
(Block 2's competitiveness got stronger...)

1677
01:13:10,289 --> 01:13:12,260
(thanks to the old-and-new mix with the arrival of JTONG.)

1678
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:15,060
I wanted to put myself...

1679
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,300
in a diverse environment, so I could improve.

1680
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:20,198
(But as they lost the Block Competition, )

1681
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:21,800
(the entire block had to compete in the deathmatch.)

1682
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:26,739
(Block 2's passionate performance touched everyone's heart.)

1683
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,778
Watching your performance in the deathmatch...

1684
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:30,938
was the most memorable.

1685
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:33,148
Out of all the performances I watched so far,

1686
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:34,380
it's in the top three.

1687
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:35,850
(But in the end, )

1688
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:39,789
(they lost 2 rappers by 1 vote.)

1689
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,118
(They were desperate, )

1690
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:44,729
(but they had to say goodbye to their blockmates.)

1691
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,229
Our block lost all the matches...

1692
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:49,729
after I became the leader.

1693
01:13:49,899 --> 01:13:51,429
When other blocks were happy that they won,

1694
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:53,269
our block lost and was in pain.

1695
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,640
So we were able to bond more deeply as the competition...

1696
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:57,199
progressed.

1697
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:59,269
Unfortunately, we lost some rappers.

1698
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,579
Then new rappers joined our block.

1699
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,179
The only block where no rappers left.

1700
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,850
- Yes. - Our block.

1701
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,648
We were able to come this far because of the respect we had...

1702
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:12,618
for each other until the end and the new rappers...

1703
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,220
- who gave us new energy. - That's why...

1704
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:17,488
(Thanks to the recruit OSUN's performance, )

1705
01:14:17,489 --> 01:14:19,189
(Block 2 is striving.)

1706
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,228
(With his first singing rap, )

1707
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:24,430
(JP proved his unique music style.)

1708
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,139
(Foggyatthebottom's sincere performance...)

1709
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,139
(completed Block 2's balance.)

1710
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,509
(Reaching the peak of their abilities, )

1711
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:35,478
(Block 2 killed all Crew Battle performances.)

1712
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:38,648
(The overall 1st place...)

1713
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:40,210
(is Block 2.)

1714
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:43,118
(Ranking 1st in the Crew Battle, )

1715
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:44,589
(Block 2 advanced to the Final Block Match.)

1716
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,949
(Didn't I tell you not to worry?)

1717
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,819
Great rappers came to our block.

1718
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,090
It's destiny. Do we say we were meant to be?

1719
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,759
Is this the right word?

1720
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,699
- Friendship? - It's indeed friendship.

1721
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,460
Friendship.

1722
01:14:56,461 --> 01:14:58,399
I think it's friendship for real.

1723
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:01,999
From start to end, the puzzle pieces fit in perfectly.

1724
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,839
If this rapper brought this, the other rapper brought the other.

1725
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,578
We filled each other's shortcomings.

1726
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:10,639
It's the Final Block Match.

1727
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,810
I feel like we're taking a group photo.

1728
01:15:12,979 --> 01:15:16,078
We'll make a fun memory together in the final performance...

1729
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,750
where we'll flourish for the last time.

1730
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,720
The song we prepared for the Block Match is "LAST MOVE."

1731
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,089
It has the message that this is...

1732
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,890
the last move as Block Two.

1733
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,839
Because eight rappers had to take part in the song,

1734
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,799
all of us thought...

1735
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,538
using the same beat all through the song would be boring.

1736
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:42,139
The mood of the song changes twice.

1737
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,709
It's like 3 songs in 1.

1738
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,278
(I don't know, I just quit college, On the street)

1739
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:49,148
(I'm a go-getter)

1740
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:51,049
(My Prada shines even though it's black)

1741
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,648
(Punk, I do look way better)

1742
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:54,519
(Surprised like the first encounter)

1743
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,788
(That jerk pops out pretending to be kind)

1744
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:57,389
(Dig up what your favorite rapper did)

1745
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,260
(Behind your back)

1746
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:03,358
It's diverse but a performance with one color.

1747
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:05,430
It's Block Two itself.

1748
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:08,698
Today is the day we've all been waiting for.

1749
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:11,640
Let's win and go home with a smile.

1750
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:13,509
Block Two.

1751
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:15,210
- We made it! - We made it!

1752
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:17,978
We've got one last step left.

1753
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:20,448
So that our time together isn't in vain,

1754
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:22,250
we will go forth.

1755
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,489
When I was in Block 3, Block 3 beat Block 2.

1756
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:28,188
When I was in Block 2, Block 2 beat Block 3.

1757
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:30,420
Have faith in me. Put your faith in me.

1758
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:33,089
We'll come down after a cool performance.

1759
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,960
Please enjoy it. Thank you.

1760
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:43,170
Block Two is the winner. Come at us.

1761
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,340
I'm full of confidence. We will win no matter what.

1762
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:49,579
You'll see Block Two without its leash.

1763
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,078
Block Two has shown...

1764
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:54,649
the most refreshing performance on RAP: PUBLIC.

1765
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,249
As the block is a group of unique rappers,

1766
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,318
they've prepared a performance...

1767
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:03,420
where the eight members' charms will explode for this match.

1768
01:17:07,529 --> 01:17:10,328
The starters of the Block Match. Here's Block Two's performance.

1769
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:13,199
Let's go!

1770
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:14,599
(Foggyatthebottom, Nosun, OSUN, JP, )

1771
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,699
(ShyboiiTobii, JTONG, Loopy, KHAN)

1772
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:18,068
- Block 2's "LAST MOVE." - Let's go, Block 2.

1773
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:20,108
Block 2, we made it. In 1, 2, 3.

1774
01:17:20,109 --> 01:17:21,710
- Block Two, we made it! - We made it!

1775
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,310
It's about to begin.

1776
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,050
- They're here. - Good luck.

1777
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:26,979
Yes.

1778
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,379
("LAST MOVE" by ShyboiiTobii, JP, Foggyatthebottom, )

1779
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,489
(Loopy, Nosun, JTONG, KHAN, OSUN)

1780
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:34,858
- Yes, looks cool. - It starts like "The Godfather."

1781
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:35,890
How cool.

1782
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:43,359
Hey

1783
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,970
I don't even know

1784
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,629
I don't know what they see in me

1785
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,238
Put my heart on my soul

1786
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,299
Rocking Comme des Garcons

1787
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,368
- That's cool. - I got different types of colors

1788
01:17:50,369 --> 01:17:51,409
Different type

1789
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,339
Saving my breath after causing trouble

1790
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,978
The weight of life changes

1791
01:17:54,979 --> 01:17:56,380
In the arms of grave even today

1792
01:17:56,609 --> 01:17:58,608
Bewildered from suffocating

1793
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:00,249
Making more problems

1794
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,179
Drive me crazy, burn all emotions

1795
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,749
You demons

1796
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,448
In a fishbowl

1797
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:07,188
I'm swimming, We've gone

1798
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:08,788
- Wild and free, eeny miny moe - JP's live rap is solid.

1799
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:10,459
Caught the flame, Throw away your hope

1800
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,488
While wandering around in our life

1801
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:13,688
You're going to find the Almighty

1802
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,459
Can't waste no time, time is gold

1803
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,959
I'm scared, karma might need us

1804
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,269
See, I'm bobbing my head one time

1805
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,129
The days I've been dreaming of when I was a kid

1806
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,938
Married to this game, hate me more

1807
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:23,739
Passing out nonstop

1808
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,639
Falling down near the end zone

1809
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,238
Confused, keep in deep low

1810
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:28,839
No, this is different

1811
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,578
All for nothing, What are you aiming for

1812
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:31,608
Hermes buckle

1813
01:18:31,609 --> 01:18:33,448
I mix prescribed drugs with alcohol again today

1814
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:34,978
Cherry blossoms bloom in my studio

1815
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:36,919
Hustle call me a workaholic

1816
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,288
The destination is far away

1817
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:39,889
My team made of tight-circle

1818
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:41,519
My future was dark, lit charcoal

1819
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,419
Now we lit, I made a miracle

1820
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,188
- Pop-out syrup, fixing, knockout - I love it.

1821
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:46,788
Love with my pick lemonade

1822
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,499
Rottweiler, my dogs aren't playing

1823
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,129
Ain't nobody safe, We bugging all day

1824
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,970
- Nice. - I don't even know

1825
01:18:52,329 --> 01:18:53,898
I don't know what they see in me

1826
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:55,270
Put my heart on my soul

1827
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,568
Rocking Comme des Garcons

1828
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:58,738
I got different types of colors, Different type

1829
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,270
Saving my breath after causing trouble

1830
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:02,009
The weight of life changes

1831
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:04,139
In the arms of grave even today

1832
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,849
Bewildered from suffocating

1833
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,478
Making more problems

1834
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:09,278
- Drive me crazy, burn all emotions - They have good teamwork.

1835
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:10,879
You demons

1836
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,618
In a fishbowl

1837
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:14,219
I'm swimming, We've gone

1838
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,858
Wild and free, eeny miny moe

1839
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:17,659
Caught the flame, throw away your hope

1840
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,670
- This performance is fierce. - Burn

1841
01:19:27,869 --> 01:19:30,069
- Burn - Burn

1842
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:33,069
Burn

1843
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,140
Foggy

1844
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:36,778
- Yes - Let's get it

1845
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:38,849
I created the path and swam here

1846
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:40,908
My mouth smells of caviar

1847
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,948
You can't take coffee inside a luxury store

1848
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:45,049
Then have another worker come here and work

1849
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:47,118
I swipe my credit card like a scratch-back

1850
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:49,288
Honey spread branch, it's new and thick

1851
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:51,259
- One hug, and jump into the ice - Ice

1852
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,459
The pants get wet like a ghost was seen

1853
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,689
- Gosh - Gosh

1854
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,599
The sweatsuit came from DON C

1855
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,629
The fog is here, The street is having a party

1856
01:19:58,630 --> 01:19:59,799
Members, brothers, family

1857
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,039
Only valid people around me, see

1858
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,568
The Red Devils should be winning

1859
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:04,738
- I can clearly hear the lyrics. - Too many lights

1860
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:06,038
- I can see the path - Yes

1861
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:08,139
I went to Unit 301 and lay down, Leaning

1862
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,809
- Money standing tall just like - Go

1863
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,749
- Yes - Yes

1864
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,849
- Yes - Yes

1865
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,978
- Yes - Everybody!

1866
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,519
- Yes - How he turned up was cool.

1867
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,648
- Yes - Yes

1868
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,658
- Yes - Yes

1869
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:24,658
- Yes - Yes

1870
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:26,259
- Yes - Everybody!

1871
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,858
I don't know, I just quit college

1872
01:20:27,859 --> 01:20:30,299
On the street, hey, I'm a go-getter, get it

1873
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,368
My Prada shines even though it's black

1874
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,329
Punk, I do look way better, get it

1875
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,238
My amigo is gone, move again kilo

1876
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,470
And on set, No quavo baby

1877
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,438
I'm down, passing down under my chin again

1878
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:42,609
I bet on my victory in this match again

1879
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:45,009
The bag is full of money scent

1880
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:47,078
You're still a crawling baby

1881
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:49,179
Both the police and bank chase me

1882
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,278
Not sunny, this foggy, now raining

1883
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,149
Neck water, I swim like I'm breathing

1884
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,219
Everyone besides us is anxious

1885
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,288
My teeth are all VV, no stainless

1886
01:20:57,289 --> 01:21:00,059
Red bottom, I stepped again on another rat

1887
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,459
Stacking this paper, This doesn't make sense

1888
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,698
The path we've taken, man, we don't repent

1889
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:05,629
Know I keep me a 40, we're hopping the fence

1890
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,769
They don't know that jerk

1891
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,129
- Still paying the rent - How cool.

1892
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,169
Wandering when I'm sipping on that soju

1893
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,309
Baby, he made phony, I'm done, told you

1894
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:14,408
Useless punks say too much, fold you

1895
01:21:14,409 --> 01:21:16,438
Alone on this floor, nobody will hold you

1896
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,849
So I just lay back, Let the sunset burn

1897
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:21,948
I return, Block till the next right turn I shoot

1898
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:23,978
I go up the curb again, You haven't seen what I've seen

1899
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,849
Reborn, and I'm riding with my troops

1900
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,349
- My troops - Cash in 100K right away

1901
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,488
I can't become broke, 5 to 0, coming dashing

1902
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:31,559
Carrying pain, Leave a rose on my casket

1903
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,828
This has always been me, See the lights and we're crashing

1904
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:34,858
Step back, buss back

1905
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:37,059
Like dogs, We're running with the pack

1906
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,299
- I'm scared of how good they are. - I never look back, baby

1907
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,069
I don't want to come right back here

1908
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,538
Honestly, I don't look at daylight

1909
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:45,738
Spin right back if you don't have the same vibes

1910
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:46,769
Shawty always calling

1911
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:47,809
When it be the late night

1912
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:50,339
Like gum, sticky on my hip like

1913
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,148
Going back and forth with the chappa

1914
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:54,408
- Going back and forth - Yes

1915
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,578
Going back and forth, Get your walk up

1916
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,749
Going back and forth, Get your walk up

1917
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,648
Going back and forth, Get your walk up

1918
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,288
Going back and forth with the chappa

1919
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:04,959
- Going back and forth - Yes

1920
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,228
- Going back and forth - Yes

1921
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:07,488
- Yes - Screech

1922
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,000
Come on down, JTONG!

1923
01:22:12,329 --> 01:22:17,100
Everybody, make some noise!

1924
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:20,038
This appearance is wild.

1925
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:21,368
Kind-hearted girl

1926
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,039
Marry me

1927
01:22:23,609 --> 01:22:26,350
Cook me meals with 8 dishes until I'm 70

1928
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,619
My verse is lyrical like a collection of poems

1929
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,949
I pick my ears after listening to yours

1930
01:22:33,819 --> 01:22:36,260
Yours is nasty

1931
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:39,359
I crash into anything like a giraffe

1932
01:22:39,859 --> 01:22:42,560
I grip hard and blow it like a pipe

1933
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,599
My performance in bed is a pass

1934
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,169
The red lights blind my eyes

1935
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,769
Perhaps those are red lips

1936
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:49,999
I dance under the bright moon

1937
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,038
You and I both kill it all night long

1938
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:53,269
Your moves are surely different

1939
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:55,039
Dripping, my body skin is hot

1940
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,809
Staying up the long night with you

1941
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:59,109
My woman is always here with me

1942
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,850
- Go crazy - Crazy

1943
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:02,549
- My shawty so freak - My shawty so freak

1944
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,618
Turning round and round

1945
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:05,849
The merry-go-round waist goes spinning

1946
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,448
Life changes after doing two jobs

1947
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:09,118
Your lover is where you are

1948
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:11,959
Running wild nonstop even tonight, rude forever

1949
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,158
- Walking wobbly - Walking wobbly

1950
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:14,788
- Throwing sideways, taking in - Throwing sideways, taking in

1951
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,399
- The young punk shakes his leg - The young punk shakes his leg

1952
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,000
The young punk shakes his leg, Why is the punk stuttering?

1953
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,670
Even if you try, she wants to sleep with me

1954
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:24,140
We're different every day, We move from scene to scene

1955
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:28,039
Kind-hearted girl, marry me

1956
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:31,510
Cook me meals with 8 dishes until I'm 70

1957
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,278
My verse is lyrical like a collection of poems

1958
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:35,279
Look at his aura.

1959
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,880
I pick my ears after listening to yours

1960
01:23:38,789 --> 01:23:41,250
- Yours is nasty - Yours is nasty

1961
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,189
I crash into anything like a giraffe

1962
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:47,529
I grip hard and blow it like a pipe

1963
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,828
My performance in bed is a pass

1964
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:52,169
You don't even get my point

1965
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,169
I'm still proud of what I said

1966
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,868
Bring it three octaves up, the bed is done

1967
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:57,398
Get the orchestra going

1968
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,709
- Surprised like the first encounter - That's amazing.

1969
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:00,568
That jerk pops out pretending to be kind

1970
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:03,738
Dig up what your favorite rapper did behind your back

1971
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,349
See, my size is a six

1972
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:07,179
I copy something else, She freaked out

1973
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,719
You ugly thing, I love you back

1974
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,349
The guys are free

1975
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,948
- A connection through a friend - A friend

1976
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:13,618
- Being sober is tough, I'm a psycho - Psycho

1977
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:15,019
Provoke the brothers and they'll follow you

1978
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,818
I'll be suicidal if I grow old like you

1979
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:17,819
Yes

1980
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,288
Why don't you notice? They are sick of these rappers

1981
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:20,959
Say "thank you" when I give it to you, punk

1982
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,559
Without peace, your teeth are in danger

1983
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,129
Pretending to give it, but pulling back

1984
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:26,228
- My path has been an unpaved road - Unpaved road

1985
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:28,738
You're insane if you want my respect

1986
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:29,898
Break up now

1987
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:32,840
Kind-hearted girl, marry me

1988
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:36,409
Cook me meals with 8 dishes until I'm 70

1989
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:39,978
My verse is lyrical like a collection of poems

1990
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:42,680
I pick my ears after listening to yours

1991
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:46,189
Yours is nasty

1992
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,020
I crash into anything like a giraffe

1993
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:52,430
I grip hard and blow it like a pipe

1994
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,699
My performance in bed is a pass

1995
01:25:01,369 --> 01:25:03,038
I can't hear you guys.

1996
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:04,199
Make some noise!

1997
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:11,850
You thought it was over, right?

1998
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:16,379
- Block Two, we going - Block Two, we going

1999
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,479
You thought it was over, right?

2000
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:21,349
- Block Two, we going - What?

2001
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:24,459
- Block Two, we going - What?

2002
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,759
- Block Two, we going - What?

2003
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,059
- Block Two, we going - What?

2004
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,269
- Block Two, we going - What?

2005
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:37,538
- Block Two, we going - What?

2006
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:40,839
- Block Two, we going - What?

2007
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:44,609
- Block Two, we going - What?

2008
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,278
Block Two, we made it!

2009
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:49,249
- Block Two, we made it! - Block Two, you hear me?

2010
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,979
Block Two, we made it!

2011
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:54,149
Make some noise!

2012
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,260
Block Two!

2013
01:25:58,760 --> 01:25:59,760
(Busan's pride, JTONG)

2014
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:07,728
- Block Two! - Block Two!

2015
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,908
- Block Two! - Block Two!

2016
01:26:11,909 --> 01:26:13,710
- They were cool. - Respect.

2017
01:26:15,609 --> 01:26:17,979
- The performance made people wild. - Exactly.

2018
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:21,380
The color is intense.

2019
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:23,749
The strong point of Block Two is...

2020
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,849
they don't turn back.

2021
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:28,788
"What we like. What we think is cool."

2022
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:30,619
They went all out.

2023
01:26:30,689 --> 01:26:33,260
It was a performance just like Block Two.

2024
01:26:33,729 --> 01:26:34,729
They were amazing.

2025
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,158
They were like tough men.

2026
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,600
Gosh, darn.

2027
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:39,029
It was intense.

2028
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,698
We're lucky to be the opposers.

2029
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:42,868
The first round of voting begins. Let's go.

2030
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:44,538
(The 1st round of voting begins for Block 2's Block Match.)

2031
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:49,809
- Block Two! - Block Two!

2032
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:52,210
- Block Two! - Block Two!

2033
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:05,829
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

2034
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:09,130
The first round of voting is closed.

2035
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,659
Well done.

2036
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:14,670
We did it. We won.

2037
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:18,099
As we prepared three moods,

2038
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,709
it must've satisfied the audience...

2039
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:23,279
with all kinds of tastes.

2040
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:26,409
It was the first performance without any regrets.

2041
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:28,819
We did what we were good at...

2042
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,180
to make everyone shine.

2043
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,619
That was our strategy.

2044
01:27:31,989 --> 01:27:33,819
We killed the performance.

2045
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:35,760
It was a fun performance. Let's go end this match.

2046
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,989
- It's time for the curtain call. - Exactly.

2047
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:42,659
Guys. Strength doesn't solve everything.

2048
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,799
Block Two prepared a powerful and smashing performance.

2049
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,800
But our block's warmth will beat that.

2050
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:50,399
Prepare to be surprised.

2051
01:27:50,539 --> 01:27:52,609
I'm afraid...

2052
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:55,539
we'll take the victory.

2053
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,978
Moving on, the Block Match opposer.

2054
01:27:58,979 --> 01:28:00,078
It's Block Three.

2055
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:01,479
(Block Match Opposer, Block 3)

2056
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:05,649
While surviving, Block Three...

2057
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,319
showed the most affection to each other.

2058
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:12,929
In the Block Match, we have a lot of stories...

2059
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:17,399
and emotions we went through during RAP: PUBLIC.

2060
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,369
Remember what I said when we first entered the Village?

2061
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:21,899
What did you say?

2062
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,469
- When we did... You weren't there. - No.

2063
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,538
- We weren't in Block Three. - Oh, right.

2064
01:28:25,539 --> 01:28:27,709
- He's right. - On the first day,

2065
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:30,179
I told the guys I could see our final performance.

2066
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,408
- Really? - Yes.

2067
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:32,648
- That was what he said. - Yes.

2068
01:28:32,649 --> 01:28:34,609
- You saw the future. - It's going as planned.

2069
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:38,078
When I first formed Block Three,

2070
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,688
my goal was to perform a memorable stage.

2071
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:43,720
The rappers I kept an eye on during the Mask Off.

2072
01:28:44,189 --> 01:28:48,288
(HAON recruited rappers with various charms.)

2073
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:52,270
(HAON recruited rappers with various charms.)

2074
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:54,430
Harmony. Perfect balance.

2075
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,099
- We had a good start. - For real.

2076
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,339
HAON formed the block.

2077
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:03,680
And thinking that the leader was important for the missions,

2078
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:07,180
we all picked HAON as the leader.

2079
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:09,448
(HAON became the first leader of Block 3...)

2080
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:10,948
(with his great rap skills and insight.)

2081
01:29:10,949 --> 01:29:12,618
- How nostalgic. - Right.

2082
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:14,118
That was months ago.

2083
01:29:14,119 --> 01:29:15,858
- It was spectacular. - Yes.

2084
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:17,118
- It was eventful. - For real.

2085
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,129
- The process was... - Once.

2086
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:21,188
- very democratic. - Of course.

2087
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,559
There was not a moment when our block...

2088
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,158
- wasn't democratic. - I agree.

2089
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,999
What's more, HAON opened...

2090
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,670
the first deathmatch that way.

2091
01:29:29,869 --> 01:29:31,869
I had to choose the elimination candidate.

2092
01:29:32,069 --> 01:29:33,869
When everyone was contemplating,

2093
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,140
the eldest Reddy...

2094
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,078
(I'll be the elimination candidate.)

2095
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:40,279
(Reddy volunteered to be the elimination candidate.)

2096
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,479
I was grateful.

2097
01:29:41,649 --> 01:29:44,219
Yang Kyle and James An volunteered as well.

2098
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:46,988
(Block 3's elimination candidates were decided voluntarily.)

2099
01:29:46,989 --> 01:29:49,759
Without hesitating, they willingly became elimination candidates.

2100
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,358
I really appreciated it.

2101
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:53,629
Had it not been for the two,

2102
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:55,429
our block wouldn't be who we were.

2103
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,729
It was very reassuring.

2104
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,430
I thought this was a true team.

2105
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,399
(After Reddy's 5 wins and intense matches during the Block Breaker)

2106
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,670
(Block Breaker)

2107
01:30:06,671 --> 01:30:08,539
(Block 3 lost and had to do the deathmatch.)

2108
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,939
It's okay. Don't feel too bad about it.

2109
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,479
(However, they were the only block all the rappers survived.)

2110
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,549
When the three main rappers survived...

2111
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:18,789
the deathmatch.

2112
01:30:18,989 --> 01:30:20,920
When we played the hidden camera prank.

2113
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:23,960
- Did you win? - Only me.

2114
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,930
- Only you? - Only me.

2115
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:31,130
- Everyone survived! - What?

2116
01:30:31,329 --> 01:30:32,868
- For real? - You scared me.

2117
01:30:32,869 --> 01:30:34,169
I told you.

2118
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,270
We told you.

2119
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:36,939
It went according to plan, right?

2120
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:38,470
Everything is over now.

2121
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:41,770
I thanked the deity for the first time in a while.

2122
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,608
Because of the crisis,

2123
01:30:43,609 --> 01:30:46,380
our block's bond became stronger.

2124
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,749
(HAON worried about the duties and weight of a leader.)

2125
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,889
I could clearly see what a hard time HAON was having.

2126
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:56,020
To be of help, even if it's just a little,

2127
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,988
I became the next leader.

2128
01:30:57,989 --> 01:30:59,159
We're in your care.

2129
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,659
(Reddy is the new leader to ease HAON's responsibilities.)

2130
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:07,199
(But they lost in the Block Tournament.)

2131
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,438
(Reddy took part in the deathmatch again.)

2132
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:12,339
It was my second deathmatch.

2133
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:16,239
As the leader, I couldn't let my block members...

2134
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,879
go home.

2135
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,079
Let's go back together.

2136
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:21,909
Let's do this.

2137
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:26,448
(Thanks to Reddy, )

2138
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:29,689
(DOMMIU survived.)

2139
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,398
(But losing to Block 7's leader Chaboom, )

2140
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:41,930
(he had to send BBULKUP home in tears.)

2141
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,199
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2142
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:49,310
When I sent BBULKUP home,

2143
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:52,579
it was really tough on me.

2144
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:55,879
But here's the thing. That was the hardest moment,

2145
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,219
but it helped us bond as one.

2146
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,919
That was what I was after. You know that, right?

2147
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,750
- Thank you. As expected from you. - No problem.

2148
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:06,659
- I'm suddenly in a bad mood. - A bad mood?

2149
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,100
I'm suddenly in a rage.

2150
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:11,828
With BBULKUP's elimination,

2151
01:32:11,829 --> 01:32:13,929
we needed a stronger strategy.

2152
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:17,398
During the night, Chaboom mentioned he wanted...

2153
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:20,470
to perform with me, so we recruited him.

2154
01:32:20,609 --> 01:32:23,109
(Strengthening the strategy by recruiting Chaboom from Block 7)

2155
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:26,279
Is it over?

2156
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,309
(Rapper OSUN...)

2157
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,778
(has been recruited to Block 5.)

2158
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:30,219
(However, to their surprise, Block 3 heard...)

2159
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,288
(OSUN would join another block after recruiting Chaboom.)

2160
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:33,350
(Are you going to another block?)

2161
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:34,919
(I've joined Block 5.)

2162
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,688
- I thought we, Block Three, - What?

2163
01:32:36,689 --> 01:32:39,288
Had a stronger bond than any other blocks.

2164
01:32:39,289 --> 01:32:41,429
So it was shocking...

2165
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:42,729
when OSUN moved to another block.

2166
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:46,930
(Block 3 has 7 members again as they didn't recruit anyone.)

2167
01:32:47,329 --> 01:32:51,669
(In the next match, the Block Competition, )

2168
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:52,738
(Block 3 achieved an overwhelming victory...)

2169
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:53,809
(with a powerful energy after recruiting Chaboom.)

2170
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,309
I was very proud.

2171
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,938
The performance and the diss rap.

2172
01:32:56,939 --> 01:32:59,309
It was mostly Chaboom's idea.

2173
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:01,880
I thought it was a good decision to recruit him.

2174
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:04,448
I was happy that we finally won.

2175
01:33:04,449 --> 01:33:06,749
But I felt the absence of OSUN.

2176
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:10,919
So I thought I should recruit a strong rapper...

2177
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,358
to protect my blockmates and win.

2178
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:16,499
(He took the initiative and made an offer to recruit SINCE...)

2179
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,430
(to strengthen the team.)

2180
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,429
I contemplated a lot...

2181
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,969
after receiving the offer.

2182
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:27,210
And I came to the conclusion that I should win.

2183
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:29,839
So I joined Block Three.

2184
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,909
(Block 3 was once again heading toward victory as she joined them.)

2185
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,750
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2186
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,148
(After that, they became a block filled with love and peace...)

2187
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:36,050
(by replacing their leader from Reddy to HAON.)

2188
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:38,578
I'm the last one to join Block Three anyway.

2189
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:40,288
So I remember Kill Them All.

2190
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:41,720
- Because at that time... - Right.

2191
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,959
(Before the Kill Them All Match where Block Money was important, )

2192
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,188
(they couldn't take part in the Beef Challenge.)

2193
01:33:45,189 --> 01:33:49,799
(In the end, Block 3 ended up with the least amount of Block Money.)

2194
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,759
In the end, we started the Kill Them All Mission...

2195
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,869
in the most disadvantageous position.

2196
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:55,299
- I think this is best. - Yes.

2197
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,769
(Block 3 comforted one another and was determined to win...)

2198
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:00,238
(despite the worst situation.)

2199
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,579
- Let's just focus on preparation. - Let's do that.

2200
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:06,510
(After Roh Yun Ha took 1st place in the Kill Them All Match, )

2201
01:34:06,979 --> 01:34:10,578
(SINCE and Leader HAON showed great performances.)

2202
01:34:10,579 --> 01:34:11,579
It's Block Three.

2203
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,389
(They had the 2nd most amount of Block Money and survived.)

2204
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:18,118
We had the least amount of Block Money, so it was risky for us.

2205
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,358
But we ended up taking second place.

2206
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:21,429
That's why it's memorable.

2207
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:23,629
- Yes. Nothing was easy. - Seriously.

2208
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:24,858
- It was true. - Not even once.

2209
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:26,069
I was so relieved we advanced to the Crew Battle.

2210
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:28,969
(As Block 3 had the 2nd most amount of Block Money, )

2211
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:30,470
(they advanced to the Crew Battle.)

2212
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:33,739
(SINCE and DOMMIU's performance showcased the women's power.)

2213
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:35,880
(After "Teabagging" with the addictive chorus, )

2214
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,539
(they showed a performance filled with their story...)

2215
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:43,220
(and made it to the final in 2nd place by just a 12-vote difference.)

2216
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:47,090
I don't like...

2217
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,889
that our block made it to the Final Match...

2218
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:51,619
in second place.

2219
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,559
After the Block Breaker and the Block Tournament,

2220
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,158
we got to compete against Block Two again...

2221
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:59,429
in the Final Block Match.

2222
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:00,698
We'll try to win...

2223
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:03,538
the final rematch.

2224
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:05,470
Let's go, Block Three. Team Trinity.

2225
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:08,408
("What A Night")

2226
01:35:08,409 --> 01:35:11,710
The song we prepared this time is "What A Night."

2227
01:35:15,449 --> 01:35:16,818
(There's nothing to be afraid of)

2228
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:18,179
(Why are we all here?)

2229
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,550
(It went from me to we, even if the show ends)

2230
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:24,960
(We came a long way)

2231
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,158
(We held out until the end, we're almost there)

2232
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,529
(We'll leave with the footprints of 8 people)

2233
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,868
Throughout the Block Match,

2234
01:35:33,869 --> 01:35:36,398
we spent so much time together.

2235
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,069
It was so tough, but we were happy.

2236
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:42,709
As everyone worked hard, I wanted to relax, have fun,

2237
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,078
and celebrate with everyone. That's what the song means.

2238
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:47,078
It's going to be a beautiful performance like the title.

2239
01:35:47,079 --> 01:35:50,578
As it's our last performance,

2240
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:54,688
it'll fittingly leave the audience...

2241
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:56,760
feeling warm and happy in the end.

2242
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,658
- Let's start the engine. Ready? - Let's go!

2243
01:35:58,659 --> 01:36:00,959
- Let's go! - Let's go, Block Three! Team...

2244
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,260
- Trinity! - Trinity!

2245
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:10,340
Exciting and intense performances are good.

2246
01:36:10,369 --> 01:36:11,769
But the warmth that touches people's hearts...

2247
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:14,840
We'll show you that something soft can prevail over something hard.

2248
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:17,978
Through this performance,

2249
01:36:17,979 --> 01:36:20,549
they'll show their even more refined teamwork.

2250
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:21,978
Are you ready to have fun?

2251
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:23,019
- Yes! - Yes!

2252
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,778
- Are you ready? - Yes!

2253
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,749
The opposers in the Block Match, Block Three, will perform now.

2254
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:31,719
Let's go!

2255
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,159
(Block 3, the opposers in the Block Match)

2256
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:35,189
- Here they go. - It's starting.

2257
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,899
HAON, please stand by.

2258
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,670
Guys, you should scream louder when Block Three comes out.

2259
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:46,609
- Yes! - Yes!

2260
01:36:54,949 --> 01:36:56,479
It's crazy.

2261
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:58,880
Okay, Block Three. I think we're ready.

2262
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:00,350
Let's go.

2263
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,259
("What A Night" by HAON, Reddy, SINCE, Chaboom, )

2264
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,729
(James An, Roh Yun Ha, DOMMIU, and Yang Kyle)

2265
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:19,809
Holy Trinity, yes, we're going up

2266
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:21,038
There's nothing to be afraid of

2267
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:22,679
Why are we all here?

2268
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,408
Running away or turning around, what's up?

2269
01:37:25,409 --> 01:37:26,948
I didn't think of losing

2270
01:37:26,949 --> 01:37:28,948
Because my girlfriend is pretty

2271
01:37:28,949 --> 01:37:31,119
We're going to have fun tonight

2272
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:34,090
Who's in the house tonight?

2273
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:36,519
Put your three hand signs in the sky

2274
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,520
Three

2275
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:39,389
No matter where you are, get out of there right now

2276
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:40,728
Because I'm on my

2277
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:42,228
He's walking

2278
01:37:42,229 --> 01:37:45,929
On the water, water, water

2279
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:47,299
Pouring, pour up

2280
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,669
My fam going up

2281
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:50,169
- Greatest team - Hands up!

01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,738
- We hot, cheers - It's like a high school musical.

2283
01:37:51,739 --> 01:37:52,769
I said many times

2284
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,438
- Life is good - Life is good

2285
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:55,639
- And I think our love - And I think our love

2286

01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:01,978

01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:04,818
- What a night - Baby

2291
01:38:04,819 --> 01:38:07,648
- What a night - What a night

01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:15,929
What a night, water bomb

2296
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,259
- Wet the beautiful night - Beautiful night

2297
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:19,828
- Today is ours, raise your glass - He's a veteran.

2298
01:38:19,829 --> 01:38:21,228
- The glass is a trophy - The glass is a trophy

2299
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,398
- Pour it tonight - Pour

2300
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:23,698
Open three fingers

2301
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:26,169
You have indigestion because of me on the screen

2302
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,368
My instinct comes from outer space

2303
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:31,709
The way they look at me has changed, why?

2304
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:34,349
It went from me to we, even if the show ends

2305
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:36,148
Three-time handshake

2306
01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:37,379
- Trinity - Trinity

2307
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,380
We came a long way

2308
01:38:38,381 --> 01:38:39,948
- Finally, Team Trinity - Team Trinity

2309
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:41,788
I spit out countless verses

2310
01:38:41,789 --> 01:38:42,889
- Infinity - Infinity

2311
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:44,059
There were hardships too

2312
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:45,688
- But I know it is what it is - What it is

2313
01:38:45,689 --> 01:38:47,288
We cross the finish line now

2314
01:38:47,289 --> 01:38:49,228
- We go up to the sky - We go up to the sky

2315
01:38:49,229 --> 01:38:50,858
Welcome the finale

2316
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:51,959
I'm the fiancee who will be with victory

2317
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,398
- In front of everyone - Everyone

2318
01:38:53,399 --> 01:38:54,669
Many crises are mise-en-scenes

2319
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:56,568
- The preview on this stage - Stage

2320
01:38:56,569 --> 01:38:57,669
After seeing the long-awaited ending

2321
01:38:57,670 --> 01:38:58,999
Let's raise a heartfelt toast

2322
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,509
Everyone, put your glasses up

2323
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,839
Ring, ring, clink the glasses as if you ring the New Year's bell

2324
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,478
- What a beautiful night - What a night

2325
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:09,179
Congratulations, you're the main character

2326
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,549
Tonight

2327
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:13,349
- What a night - What a night

2328
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:16,219
- What a night - Sing it!

2329
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:19,059

2331
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:22,589
- What a night - What a night, let's go

2332
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,328
Team Trinity, we going up

We're on the come up like crazy

2334
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:27,228
On the stage, me to we

2335
01:39:27,229 --> 01:39:28,669
We showed them on TVING

2336
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:30,868
Everything that has already passed is a precious memory

2337
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:31,969
- Onto melodies - Melodies

2338
01:39:31,970 --> 01:39:33,068
Oh, we making cheese

2339
01:39:33,069 --> 01:39:34,839
I'm not going to mention it, peace

2340
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,278
I run toward the future

2341
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:37,709
Block Three runs with me

2342
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:39,709
What I've wanted to do so far is just having some fun

2343
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,108
- Dive into water, splash, - Splash

2344
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:42,549
- Smile for the camera flash - Flash

2345
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,019
Time and time again, I've got to

2346
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,618
Express my gratitude, thanks

2347
01:39:45,619 --> 01:39:46,849
It was darn long

2348
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,850
How many fights and nights?

2349
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:48,988
I remember all the names

2350
01:39:48,989 --> 01:39:51,118
- Left behind us - Behind us

2351
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,288
What a beautiful sunset

2352
01:39:52,289 --> 01:39:53,959
It's already the last night

2353
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:54,960
It's time to show what we have

2354
01:39:54,961 --> 01:39:56,799
- To the heated world - World

2355
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,198
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

2356
01:39:58,199 --> 01:39:59,868
Don't worry, I'll be walking with you closely

2357
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:01,669
Tell me when it's hard, I'll think with you

2358
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:02,769
Have a drink and pour out your troubles

2359
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:03,999
- I'll also have a big dream now - Big dream

2360
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,538
Perfect timing because we three

2361
01:40:05,539 --> 01:40:06,738
Unlock my hands and run

2362
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:08,710
I kiss the trophy TRINITY won

2363
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,379
- What a beautiful night - Beautiful night

2364
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:16,049
I hope this moment stops

2365
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:17,949
- With TRINITY - With TRINITY

2366
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:20,049
- Such a good life - Good life

2367
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:21,448
It stops like destiny

2368
01:40:21,449 --> 01:40:23,118
- It's so fantastic - So fantastic

2369
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:24,220
DOMMIU.

2370
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:25,559
Don't you know about it?

2371
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,658
- Why is it so good? - As we're together

2372
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:28,589
TRINITY, we're so amazing

2373
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:31,059
He told me that we will get it

2374
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,459
Before the sunrise

2375
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,568
Enjoy this beautiful night

2376
01:40:34,569 --> 01:40:35,629
No words are needed

2377
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,368
- We the perfect balance - Balance

2378
01:40:37,369 --> 01:40:38,469
Make a toast, what are you doing?

2379
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,509
- Raise your glasses higher - Higher

2380
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:41,868
- TRINITY, take over - TRINITY, take over

2381
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,379
Turn one more page

2382
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,679
- And start the next chapter again - And start the next chapter

2383
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,379
I've never thought

2384
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:48,408
- It was weird - It was weird

2385
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:50,318
We obviously deserve this life

2386
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:51,419
- Every corner of your heart - Every corner of your heart

2387
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,148
Will be lit up by us

2388
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:55,448
Fill this song with our memories

2389
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:57,288
- So they can't be erased - Erased

2390
01:40:57,289 --> 01:41:00,259
To the TRINITY Island, slide away

2391
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,959
- It's bright even at night - Night

2392
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,398
- Day and night - Day and night

2393
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:05,858
- We hustled - We hustled

2394
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:07,269
That's why the drink in the glass

2395
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,698
- Is so sweet, man - Is so sweet, man

2396
01:41:08,699 --> 01:41:11,599
To the TRINITY Island, come through any day

2397
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,568
Filled with love and peace

2398
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,078
We held out until the end, we're almost there

2399
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:19,408
We'll leave with the footprints of eight people

2400
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:22,549
- We're singing like na na na na - We're singing like na na na na

2401
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:24,778
- Give me your night - Give me your night

2402
01:41:24,779 --> 01:41:27,188
- We on the TRINITY Island - We on the TRINITY Island

2403
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:28,189
- Beautiful - Beautiful

2404
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:30,188
Let's raise our glasses to the sky on the island

2405
01:41:30,189 --> 01:41:32,658
- To the sky - To the sky

2406
01:41:32,659 --> 01:41:35,358
- Shine your mind, not tonight - Shine your mind, not tonight

2407
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:38,299
Don't want to say good night tonight

2408
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,728
- Oh, no - Oh, no

2409
01:41:39,729 --> 01:41:40,969
- I'm not going to sleep - I'm not going to sleep

2410
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,938
Everybody, put your glasses up

2411
01:41:42,939 --> 01:41:44,238
- Put them up - Put them up

2412
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:47,640
Ring, ring, clink the glasses as if you ring the New Year's bell

2413
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:50,510
- What a beautiful night - What a night

2414
01:41:50,739 --> 01:41:52,438
It really looks like the finale.

2415
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,549
You're the hero tonight

2416
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:56,349
- What a night - What a night

2417
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:59,118
- What a night - What a night, say

2418
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,988
- What a night - What a night

2419
01:42:01,989 --> 01:42:04,858
- What a beautiful night - What a night

2420
01:42:04,859 --> 01:42:07,688
- What a night - What a night

2421
01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:10,599
- What a night - What a night

2422
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,528
- What a night - What a night

2423
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:15,769
- What a night - What a night

2424
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:16,799
- One more time - One more time

2425
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,339
- What a night - What a night

2426
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:22,238
- What a night - What a night

2427
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:25,278
- What a night - What a night

2428
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:29,578
- What a beautiful night - What a night

2429
01:42:29,579 --> 01:42:32,349
(You can listen to "What A Night" on all music streaming services.)

2430
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:34,619
- Thank you. - Team Trinity, Block Three.

2431
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:36,460
Thank you.

2432
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,729
It's a beautiful night.

2433
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:45,430
Thank you.

2434
01:42:47,229 --> 01:42:48,229
Thank you.

2435
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:52,069
It was a beautiful night.

2436
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:55,738
Their style is clearly different from ours. I like how...

2437
01:42:55,739 --> 01:42:57,379
- they're in contrast with us. - I agree.

2438
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,210
Votes will be divided based on people's preference.

2439
01:42:59,609 --> 01:43:01,908
Unlike our team, their song was cheerful.

2440
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:03,978
They made a song...

2441
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:07,149
that was perfect for the finale.

2442
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:08,789
It was very nice and warm.

2443
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,859
It felt like all my sins were getting washed away.

2444
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:14,459
It was very warm and happy.

2445
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,659
The song was good to hear at the end of the year.

2446
01:43:16,829 --> 01:43:18,799
After HAON said hello,

2447
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,868
all the blockmates came down onto the stage.

2448
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:24,169
It was cool and matched the image of their block.

2449
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:26,639
It was like they wrapped up the entire race...

2450
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,869
with the performance.

2451
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:29,510
I'd like to listen to it again.

2452
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,180
You're amazing.

2453
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:38,118
Well done.

2454
01:43:38,119 --> 01:43:39,619
A shout-out to BBULKUP, my brother.

2455
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,750
- Hey. - Thank you.

2456
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,890

and performing without regrets.

2462
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:03,478

It was clear that all the blockmates were enjoying it...

2476
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,239
for the last time.

2477
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,140

Everyone, have you made up your mind?

The final result will be revealed in a minute.

2504
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:21,078
Before announcing the winner,

2505
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:23,049
there have been many rappers who were loved very much,

2506
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:26,179
but unfortunately, they had to leave the show.

2507
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:28,589
We have a special performance...

2508
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:31,119
that will make the Final Block Match more spectacular.

2509
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:36,729
Is there any rapper that you want to see again?

2510
01:46:36,829 --> 01:46:39,029
- Kohway. - Owen.

2511
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,869
Jo Gwang Il!

2512
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:43,599
Among so many rappers,

2513
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,169
four rappers who clearly had a strong presence prepared...

2514
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:50,139
a performance in a group that you've never seen before.

2515
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:53,608
Let's find out who they're right now.

2516
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:56,920

(Composed by APRO, WILL NOT FEAR, VTL, Luci Gang)

2519
01:47:16,369 --> 01:47:18,140
We on ambush plan

2520
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:21,438
No, nobody can predict what we're doing next

2521
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:24,278
No, nobody can see us, You can't see through us

2522
01:47:24,279 --> 01:47:26,948
When nobody is paying attention, Unexpectedly

2523
01:47:26,949 --> 01:47:28,608
We run to them, AMBUSH THEM

2524
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:31,948
I'm not done until it's really done, So watch out for the AMBUSH

2525
01:47:31,949 --> 01:47:34,948
No backing down, boy, We're coming like an AMBUSH

01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:37,919
Four Korean zombies without KO, FLATBUSH

2527
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,889
Torchlight on our eyes, Towards that target, AMBUSH

2528
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:42,129
Been out of sight in camouflage

2529
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:43,599
My five senses got sensitive

2530
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,459
Without worrying, I seized my chance including yours

2531
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:49,469
Running with a sickle, Kim Bok Nam, You pulled a knife, you can't leave

2532
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:52,438
Swing it hard and I breathe only when I bury the corpse

2533
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:53,868
I go straight to the boss phase

2534
01:47:53,869 --> 01:47:55,538
Try to dodge this jab

2535
01:47:55,539 --> 01:47:56,908
Step fast, no Holloway Max

2536
01:47:56,909 --> 01:47:59,639
Flow may be laid back Move 24-7 at the right time

2537
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,509
Like possessed whenever on stage, I can't be scratched

2538
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:04,778
My time is up, I will feel it any minute now

2539
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:07,919
A narrow space when I leave, I increase it by two times

2540
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,889
Mama said every day is go time, Keep rolling to the last stop

2541
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:13,688
Keep talking, I can't hear you, Any nonsense, I toss it back

2542
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:16,698
Little mama dream big, So I can't let them hypnotize me

2543
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:18,828
Okay, move out of my way Overturn everything here, Bish

2544
01:48:18,829 --> 01:48:21,068
My head is dizzy every day, I empty another green bottle

2545
01:48:21,069 --> 01:48:22,969
Before finishing the drink, I swallow cigarette smoke

2546
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:24,139
You there, what's your problem?

2547
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:25,999
Actually, I don't care

2548
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,969
You bother me, so get lost, gargle with soju, wipe out everything

2549
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:31,078
I get it, I get it, I get it, My hair turns white

2550
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:33,078
I'm faded it, I get it I hit the innocent wall again

2551
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:34,978
My fist swells, but I must go faster, farther

2552
01:48:34,979 --> 01:48:36,879
There's no time, I must go farther, My pockets are empty

2553
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,148
I keep losing what I have, What do you want more from me?

2554
01:48:39,149 --> 01:48:40,889
I barked like a dog, I made it, I made it

2555
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:42,419
I made it, I made it, My head is dizzy again

2556
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,788
No matter how many times I say, you don't listen

2557
01:48:43,789 --> 01:48:45,389
I can't see, I can't hear

2558
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,988
I don't know where I'm going

2559

Trample again and again, Hallelujah mode

2574

Anyway, around me, It's Fight Club

2575

No time, boy, finish it off in O'Malley style

2576
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:30,068
Try to block it, One, two punch

2577
01:49:30,069 --> 01:49:31,568
Before he got punched, he was good

2578
01:49:31,569 --> 01:49:34,639
What did you do in November? I wiped out punks around me

2579
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,839
I think it's hot, My sweetie, come to me

2580
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,439
Because my feeling is very good

2581

Keep maintaining Raw

2582

A scheme to trap me down below

You said I won't make it, But I always rise

2585

It must be a bubble, it's surprising

2586
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:49,988
Look who's back, Now KP is two times the threat

2587

Luci wins again in 2025, so watch

2589
01:49:53,729 --> 01:49:56,028
Pumped up pace, No backup plan, just advance

2590
01:49:56,029 --> 01:49:58,629
Standing when the mask is uncovered, I keep my manners

2591
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:00,028
The winner will be determined anyway

2592
01:50:00,029 --> 01:50:01,669
So what's your game? What do you want?

2593

When cameras go off, we compete even harder

2594
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:05,398
I endure it, My vision gets farther

2595
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:07,709
With the vision of a late night, Seeing through at night

2596
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:10,578
I maintain, sometimes I fail, But I'll wipe it clean once

2597
01:50:10,579 --> 01:50:13,038
- Don't mess with the Block, boy - And I got my shine

2598
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:15,179
Instead of being brazen If not Tutankhamun, it'll be doomed

However, their appearance has an unexpected cute side.

2625
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,959
(ZENE THE ZILLA, DAMINI, and JEFFERY WHITE)

2626
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,270
(Composed by Fleeky Bang, Tray B, Don Mills, and SIG SAUER)

2627
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:47,469
At the end, it will be us who remain

2628
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:50,379
Korean rappers are lousy, Always drinking alcohol vibe

2629
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:51,908
Going like a rocket, Feel like I'm Voyager

2630
01:51:51,909 --> 01:51:53,408
I keep a Drako, I'm not a soldier

2631
01:51:53,409 --> 01:51:54,948
Everything is dead, I can't see my enemy

2632
01:51:54,949 --> 01:51:56,448
Red eyes, a thief, not a rapper

2633
01:51:56,449 --> 01:51:57,948
Our appearance disorients the rappers

2634
01:51:57,949 --> 01:51:59,448
We scare the rappers for fun

2635
01:51:59,449 --> 01:52:00,818
We were born the same, We walk differently

2636
01:52:00,819 --> 01:52:02,118
One, two, three

2637
01:52:02,119 --> 01:52:03,618
It's the Block Block Block

2638
01:52:03,619 --> 01:52:05,419
- Block Block Block Block - One

2639
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,929
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2640
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:08,459
- Block Block Block - One

2641
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:09,959
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2642
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,499
- Block Block Block - One

2643
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,028
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2644
01:52:14,029 --> 01:52:15,528
Burn your CD aye

2645
01:52:15,529 --> 01:52:16,969
You all are like diddy aye

2646
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:18,438
You're all Drake, Put it on like I'm K Dot

2647
01:52:18,439 --> 01:52:20,438
I'm the man, You're boy like girl aye

2648
01:52:20,439 --> 01:52:21,938
Tokyo or France, I'm rocking in the show

2649
01:52:21,939 --> 01:52:23,368
Not AKUMA human but Superman

2650
01:52:23,369 --> 01:52:24,938
I hit the top, you go down slowly

2651
01:52:24,939 --> 01:52:26,478
If you diss me, you'll be dead

2652
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:29,108
Two-tone on my body, That's making me Nemo

2653
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:30,648
When Daejeon punks see me, they get shocked

2654
01:52:30,649 --> 01:52:32,148
Because I came from the bottom

2655
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:33,278
Shawty said she's Christian

2656
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:34,948
So I gave her one Dior

2657
01:52:34,949 --> 01:52:36,618
I took her to Daytona

2658
01:52:36,619 --> 01:52:37,919
Because she's skinny and brown

2659
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,959
YEL YEL

2660
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,389
I'm a good friend, Double Down in front of me

2661
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:42,929
I hide myself in front of cameras

2662
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:44,459
FLEEKY AND BANG is a psychopath

2663
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,759
One for the money, two for my bro

2664
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,198
I don't care about the shoot

2665
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:50,499
2025 FREE YO

2666
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:53,139
Headshot if you are really curious

2667
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:54,309
Still I pull that trigger

2668
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:56,068
My finger is too fat

2669
01:52:56,069 --> 01:52:57,778
I'm really dangerous

2670
01:52:57,779 --> 01:52:59,108
You'd better watch out

2671
01:52:59,109 --> 01:53:00,608
Do it two times, Double Down

2672
01:53:00,609 --> 01:53:02,148
I'm really very harsh

2673
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:03,578
Big brother Fleeky Polo Tray

2674
01:53:03,579 --> 01:53:05,148
I call that dirty play

2675
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:06,889
Block One, Block One, Block One, Block One

2676
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:08,389
Moving about with the chopper

2677
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:09,988
Spinning like a helicopter

2678
01:53:09,989 --> 01:53:11,419
I'm trapping, Mom, I'm sorry

2679
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,988
Should I rob you or not

2680
01:53:12,989 --> 01:53:14,590
Chopper is really shiny

2681
01:53:14,829 --> 01:53:17,529
In the Korean rapping scene, there are so many losers

2682
01:53:17,829 --> 01:53:19,259
If we met five years ago

2683
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:20,799
- Bring me some bread, my friend - Hey

2684
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,299
One Pocket Chicken, Coke

2685
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:23,738
And Matstar

2686
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:26,198
I will pay you back later, Buy it with your own money

2687
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:28,868
The girl you call Shawty, She's at my house already

2688
01:53:28,869 --> 01:53:30,139
It's a secret

2689
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:31,880
This is wrong

2690
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:33,908
After seeing me on TV, Internet gangsters suffer

2691
01:53:33,909 --> 01:53:35,078
- PTSD - PTSD

2692
01:53:35,079 --> 01:53:36,679
Everything they want

2693
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,448
Money, girls, honor, I take them all

2694
01:53:38,449 --> 01:53:39,919
Going like a rocket, Feel like I'm Voyager

2695
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,389
I keep a Drako, I'm not a soldier

2696
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:42,948
Everything is dead, I can't see my enemy

2697
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:44,488
Red eyes, a thief, not a rapper

2698
01:53:44,489 --> 01:53:45,858
Our appearance disorients the rappers

2699
01:53:45,859 --> 01:53:47,459
We scare the rappers for fun

2700
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:48,959
We were born the same, We walk differently

2701
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,129
One, two, three

2702
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:51,959
It's the Block Block Block

2703
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,528
- Block Block Block - One

2704
01:53:53,529 --> 01:53:55,269
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2705
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:56,528
- Block Block Block - One

2706
01:53:56,529 --> 01:53:57,969
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2707
01:53:57,970 --> 01:53:59,538
- Block Block Block - One

2708
01:53:59,539 --> 01:54:01,408
- Block Block Block Block - Make some noise

2709
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:03,439
- Block Block Block Block - Block One

2710
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,408
- We already won - Already won

2711
01:54:05,409 --> 01:54:06,409
Mills is going to do it

2712
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:08,009
Go up and pull down the pants

2713
01:54:08,010 --> 01:54:11,118
Everything you do and write, They're all stale

2714
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:12,519
There's nothing to wrap

2715
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,049
- Just wrap some gimbap - Just wrap some gimbap

2716
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:15,648
- Block One - Block One

2717
01:54:15,649 --> 01:54:17,358
We already won

2718
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:18,519
Mills is going to do it, got that

2719
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,358
I'm going to flip that friend flow

2720
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:23,059
These lyrics sound familiar

2721
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:25,059
They weren't officially distributed

2722
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,499
- So that's okay, Let's go - That's okay

2723
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,799
Why are you wearing a mask?

2724
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,398
You won't hide your green fragrance

2725
01:54:29,399 --> 01:54:30,469
Thank you for the food

2726
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:32,538
A heap of food frugally made by Mnet

2727
01:54:32,539 --> 01:54:33,839
Yes, thank you for your work

2728
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,368
Yes, it's time for a pickup

2729
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:36,908
Money, popularity, Everything is only in the present

2730
01:54:36,909 --> 01:54:38,408
We're born naked, we die with nothing

2731
01:54:38,409 --> 01:54:40,009
- Block One, already won - Block One, already won

2732
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:41,509
Give me that won, that's what I want

2733
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:43,749
We're so delicious they want to see us again

2734
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:45,978
So here you go, take it, A special song

2735
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:47,389
Yes, we got on a pirate ship

2736
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:48,818
My pants got worn out, From rolling too much

2737
01:54:48,819 --> 01:54:50,389
But money mended them

2738
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:51,788
Sorry, darling

2739
01:54:51,789 --> 01:54:53,059
I'm neither a boy nor a girl

2740
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,788
And I'm homeless

2741
01:54:54,789 --> 01:54:56,129
I can't be in the group or be independent

2742
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:57,599
You keep talking

2743
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,028
About my body being this and that

2744
01:54:59,029 --> 01:55:00,669
Step back, I won't walk, A game where there's nothing to gain

2745
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,499
I insist, rather be luggage than a sidekick

2746
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,698
Before hip-hop, it's Seoul

2747
01:55:03,699 --> 01:55:05,398
Shorty if short, Beanpole if tall

2748
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:06,969
No matter what, there's a fight

2749
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:08,438
I take control of your unconsciousness

2750
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:09,938
I won't adapt even in my next life

2751
01:55:09,939 --> 01:55:11,538
You adjust yourself to me, I can't do it, baby

2752
01:55:11,539 --> 01:55:12,978
Why would we be Block One here

2753
01:55:12,979 --> 01:55:14,478
I go back to being myself

2754
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:17,049
Oh, my gosh, I can't change my habits

2755
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:20,118
- I dodge many laws deftly - Deftly

2756
01:55:20,119 --> 01:55:21,618
You get punished whenever you deserve it

2757
01:55:21,619 --> 01:55:23,049
- You pretty one - You pretty one

2758
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:25,858
When it gets deep, a bubble

2759
01:55:25,859 --> 01:55:27,390
- Bubble - I'm truthful

2760
01:55:27,489 --> 01:55:29,089
- Squirrel - Squirrel

2761
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:32,198
Such a total loser, Every day, she comes

2762
01:55:32,199 --> 01:55:35,068
And calls me like nothing is wrong

2763
01:55:35,069 --> 01:55:37,269
Honey, why is your voice trembling like that?

2764
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:38,499
- Two, three, go - Two, three, go

2765
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,038
Going like a rocket, Feel like I'm Voyager

2766
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:41,469
I keep a Drako, I'm not a soldier

2767
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:42,769
Everything is dead, I can't see my enemy

2768
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:44,478
Red eyes, a thief, not a rapper

2769
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:45,908
Our appearance disorients the rappers

2770
01:55:45,909 --> 01:55:47,448
We scare the rappers for fun

2771
01:55:47,449 --> 01:55:48,908
We were born the same, We walk differently

2772
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:50,349
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2773
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:51,978
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2774
01:55:51,979 --> 01:55:53,519
- Block Block Block - One

2775
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,988
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2776
01:55:54,989 --> 01:55:56,519

01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:57,959
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2778
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,488

- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2780

- Block Block Block - One

2781
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:03,999
- It's the Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2782
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,459
- Block Block Block - One

2783
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,999
- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2784
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,528

- Block Block Block Block - Block Block Block Block

2786
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:11,469

2787
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:13,068
- Block Block Block Block - Hey, hey

2788
01:56:13,069 --> 01:56:14,538
- Block Block Block - Hey!

2789
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:16,568
Let's go, Block One.

2790
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:19,038
(You can listen to "WON" by Block One...)

2791
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:21,409
(on all music streaming services.)

2792
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:27,749
Have a good day.

2793
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,920
Yes.

2794
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,819
Thank you.

2795
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,788
Starting from Mask Off where they met...

2796
01:56:36,789 --> 01:56:39,198
without knowing who was who...

2797
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:40,969
to six Block Matches,

2798
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:45,300
RAP: PUBLIC has finally ended, everyone.

2799
01:56:51,609 --> 01:56:53,238
Which Block will be...

2800
01:56:53,239 --> 01:56:55,908
the winner of RAP: PUBLIC?

2801

Stay tuned until the end and find out.

2802
01:56:58,449 --> 01:57:01,520
I will be saying goodbye for one last time.

2803
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,760
Thank you very much for being with us for the Final Block Match.

2804
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,969
(The final voting result of the Duet Match)

2805
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:22,470
(Block 2's Loopy and JTONG won.)

2806
01:57:23,909 --> 01:57:26,978
(We're only one step away from winning.)

2807
01:57:26,979 --> 01:57:28,749
(Let this be...)

2808
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,179
(a beautiful night.)

2809
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:32,448
(Block 2 has amazing energy.)

2810
01:57:32,449 --> 01:57:34,589
(We will win no matter what.)

2811
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:38,288
(The final voting result of the Leader Match)

2812
01:57:38,289 --> 01:57:42,090
(Block 3's HAON won.)

2813
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:43,559
Well done.

2814
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,228
If our Block wins,

2815
01:57:45,229 --> 01:57:48,699
everything we went through will turn into gold.

2816
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:51,438
Like the Midas touch.

2817
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:53,909
I hope that it turns out that way.

2818
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:59,379
I believe that our Block is the best...

2819
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:01,409
on RAP: PUBLIC.

2820
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:03,948
We're more sincere than anyone else...

2821
01:58:03,949 --> 01:58:05,079
about this type of music.

2822
01:58:05,479 --> 01:58:07,489
I'm confident that we'll win.

2823
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:10,960
We will definitely win and take the money.

2824
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:16,028
(The chemistry between Loopy and JTONG showed...)

2825
01:58:16,029 --> 01:58:19,529
(outstanding presence on stage during the Duet Match.)

2826
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:27,038
(Leader ShyboiiTobii's powerful energy...)

2827
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:31,279
(left an impact during the Leader Match.)

2828
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:39,318
(Block 2 members showed an explosive synergy effect...)

2829
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:42,350
(during the Block Match.)

2830
01:58:45,819 --> 01:58:49,089
I came on RAP: PUBLIC in order to win.

2831
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:50,698
As a team,

2832
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,129
we overcame many difficulties.

2833
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:55,299
What will happen to Block Three at the end...

2834
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,339
I'm very sorry, but we will...

2835
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:59,569
We're going to win.

2836
01:59:01,239 --> 01:59:04,038
(Roh Yun Ha and Yang Kyle's skills with strong foundation...)

2837
01:59:04,039 --> 01:59:06,880
(completed their performance during the Duet Match.)

2838
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:13,349
(With Leader HAON's honest message, )

2839
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:16,989
(he resonated in the audience's heart during the Leader Match.)

2840
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:23,688
(Block 3 members' perfect teamwork...)

2841
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:28,369
(shined during the Block Match.)

2842
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:37,069
(Which is the final Block to win RAP: PUBLIC?)

2843
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:46,978
This is making me nervous.

2844
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:47,989
Me too.

2845
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:52,689
Announce it already.

2846
01:59:56,029 --> 02:00:01,199
Based on the result of the Final Block Match...

2847
02:00:01,329 --> 02:00:04,770
and the total number of votes from all rounds,

2848
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,238
the final winning Block...

2849
02:00:07,239 --> 02:00:09,108
- will be revealed. - Oh, my goodness.

2850
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:10,539
In one go?

2851
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,238
The result isn't revealed yet,

2852
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:15,209
but I am sure of it.

2853
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:16,979
This is a game we can't lose.

2854
02:00:18,149 --> 02:00:21,550
I feel very nervous, but I hope we win.

2855
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:24,189
I want to see a miracle, just one more time.

2856
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,960
The Block that is the final winner...

2857
02:00:28,529 --> 02:00:30,090
This is real.

2858
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:18,809
- I hope we win. - My hands are sweating.

2859
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:20,408
- Seriously. - Look at this.

2860
02:01:20,409 --> 02:01:21,409
I'm really sweating.

2861
02:01:22,109 --> 02:01:23,949
In the Final Block Match,

2862
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:27,390
after summing up the total votes...

2863
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:41,069
The Block that is the final winner...

2864
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:52,439
(Block 2 is the final winner of RAP: PUBLIC.)

2865
02:01:56,149 --> 02:01:59,449
We won.

2866
02:02:00,449 --> 02:02:02,688

You worked hard.

2873
02:02:23,369 --> 02:02:24,438
We really won.

2874
02:02:24,439 --> 02:02:26,639
Block Two, we made it for real.

2875
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:27,750
I felt so happy.

2876
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:31,420
I'm so happy. I feel a bit dizzy now.

2877
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,119
It feels terrific. It's awesome.

2890
02:03:02,779 --> 02:03:05,849
First, I feel so many emotions...

2891
02:03:05,850 --> 02:03:07,549
and I have so many things to say.

2892
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:09,020
I'm so happy that we won.

2893
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:12,318
It was my first time doing something like this, and I learned a lot.

2894
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:15,658
I was like a stranger, but you trusted me and accepted me.

2895
02:03:15,659 --> 02:03:17,028
I appreciate it very much.

2896
02:03:17,029 --> 02:03:20,559
And they were once my team.

2897
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:23,228
Block Three was my home team.

2898
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:24,800
I give my sincere thanks to them.

2899
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:30,569
And I have one more thing to say.

2900
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:38,679
XWALLY, yukon, Ga Yeon, and Raf Sandou,

2901
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:39,880
I kept my promise.

2902
02:03:47,529 --> 02:03:48,959
- My heart feels full. - That's awesome.

2903
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,130
I'm overwhelmed.

2904
02:03:53,130 --> 02:03:56,269
We showed everything we prepared.

2905
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:58,000
So there's no regret on our performance.

2906
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:00,698
I feel so sorry for my team members.

2907
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:02,839
Still, goodness.

2908
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,879
I got to know so many wonderful people.

2909
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,578
I think that's the best outcome.

2910
02:04:07,579 --> 02:04:09,608
I did my best to enjoy RAP: PUBLIC...

2911
02:04:09,609 --> 02:04:11,649
more than anyone, I guess.

2912
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,719
It seems that I tried so many things, everything I could.

2913
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:18,420
It was a very precious show to me and I appreciate it so much.

2914
02:04:19,159 --> 02:04:22,689
And I hope the viewers watching this...

2915
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:26,299
recognize that people...

2916
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,328
in the hip-hop scene in Korea...

2917
02:04:29,329 --> 02:04:31,969
are awesome, talented, and nice.

2918
02:04:31,970 --> 02:04:33,938
So many friends...

2919
02:04:33,939 --> 02:04:35,709
created wonderful scenes.

2920
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:38,978
As everyone cooperated here,

2921
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:42,978
for numerous people who make hip-hop music,

2922
02:04:42,979 --> 02:04:46,979
we could deliver a lot of things.

2923
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:49,449
I was in this after such a long time.

2924
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,960
See? We're darn good.

2925
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:53,220
Keep up the good work.

2926
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:01,430

Thank you!

2931
02:05:12,739 --> 02:05:14,279
It's over!

2932
02:05:14,449 --> 02:05:16,350
- Thank you for your work! - It's over!

2933
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:17,948
I'm done!

2934
02:05:17,949 --> 02:05:20,278
- It's over! - You worked hard.

2935
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:21,719
You can smile. You did a good job.

02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,488
- Thank you for your work. - Yes!

2937
02:05:23,489 --> 02:05:24,688
- Thank you. - You worked hard.

2938
02:05:24,689 --> 02:05:27,219
- Thank you for your work. - Let's take a photo together.

2939
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:28,389
- It was fun. - Photo.

2940
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:29,629
I was happy.

2941
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:30,729
This is nice.

2942
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,329
You did a good job.

2943
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:47,210
A secluded space.

2944
02:05:47,949 --> 02:05:51,619
Mysterious and unknown to the outside world.

2945
02:05:52,779 --> 02:05:55,890
And 60 rappers who have gathered here.

2946
02:05:57,789 --> 02:05:59,019
They created a village.

2947
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:00,420
It's a dystopia.

2948
02:06:01,329 --> 02:06:02,989
- It's going to be fun. - Please say a word.

2949
02:06:03,689 --> 02:06:05,028
Here we go.

2950
02:06:05,029 --> 02:06:07,459
They have formed their own group and faction,

2951
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:10,869
and developed their strength to fight together.

2952
02:06:13,399 --> 02:06:15,340
They had to defend their group...

2953
02:06:15,909 --> 02:06:18,608
by competing in numerous competitions.

2954
02:06:18,609 --> 02:06:20,278
It's one vote's difference.

2955
02:06:20,279 --> 02:06:22,279
- Go! - Go!

2956
02:06:22,649 --> 02:06:24,148
- Goodness. - I'm sorry.

2957
02:06:24,149 --> 02:06:26,749
Rapper MOON,

2958
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:28,520
please leave now.

2959
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:32,390
As a result, the people who protected their group...

2960
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:34,960
survived until the end...

2961
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:38,500
and achieved their goal of uniting together.

2962
02:06:38,699 --> 02:06:40,499
You should do it first.

2963
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:43,130
- Why... - Hello?

2964
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:44,699
In this society,

2965
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:47,239
every moment has been documented.

2966
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:53,180
Fierce survival through the cracks made by competition.

2967
02:06:55,609 --> 02:06:57,719
Let's enjoy every moment in RAP: PUBLIC.

2968
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,550
- We can do it! - We can do it!

2969
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:04,390
In this society, there's happiness and laughter.

2970
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:05,760
In 1, 2, 3!

2971
02:07:06,659 --> 02:07:07,788
We did it!

2972
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:10,090
- You can do it! - Go for it!

2973
02:07:12,529 --> 02:07:16,270
Also, sadness and tears coexist.

2974
02:07:18,539 --> 02:07:20,800
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

2975
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:23,140
You did well. Don't cry.

2976
02:07:23,609 --> 02:07:26,380
It was a good opportunity and I met good people.

2977
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:29,579
It was a very meaningful time.

2978
02:07:30,279 --> 02:07:32,648
There won't be an experience like this again.

2979
02:07:32,649 --> 02:07:33,949
Now that it's all over,

2980
02:07:35,949 --> 02:07:37,989
I can only remember that it was pleasant.

2981
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:41,460
The joys and sorrows they have shared.

2982
02:07:42,329 --> 02:07:44,159
They made 60 stories...

2983
02:07:44,659 --> 02:07:47,329
of each individual's special moments.

2984
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:52,670
Perhaps, the stories they have written down...

2985
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:55,869
are not much different from our lives.

2986
02:07:57,039 --> 02:07:59,479
The society created by rappers,

2987
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:04,920
and the society in which all of our stories are recorded.

2988
02:08:06,949 --> 02:08:09,319
This is RAP: PUBLIC.

2989
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:13,560
And now,

2990
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:15,659
let us begin the next game.
