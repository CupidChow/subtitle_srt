1
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:14,289
(This video contains explicit language.)

2
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:24,994
A secluded space, mysterious and unknown to the outside world.

3
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,964
This is the first society where only the sole survivor reigns,

4
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,074
RAP:PUBLIC.

5
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:46,174
In this place, where cooperation and competition coexist,

6
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,643
they can only decide their fate through a game...

7
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,714
that uses rap as a weapon.

8
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:57,154
Here, those who have vowed...

9
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,725
to take over RAP:PUBLIC have gathered.

10
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:04,894
Now, let me introduce the 60 members of RAP:PUBLIC.

11
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:12,375
This is a show where all contestants are crazy about rap.

12
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,745
Then I'll be the strongest. I'm glad that I'm here.

13
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,245
I think I'm the best among the newbies.

14
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:21,644
I don't care who my opponents are.

15
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:23,584
I'll end all of them.

16
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,855
I'll definitely turn this place into my darn world.

17
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:28,884
Hey, get lost.

18
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,325
You provoked me first.

19
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:32,494
I didn't provoke you, okay? For goodness' sake.

20
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:34,024
Just make a diss track.

21
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,265
I'm down with that.

22
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:37,334
To be honest, I don't trust you.

23
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:41,135
Politics, betrayal, scheme, and strategy.

24
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:46,234
Avoiding what that team is good at would be the best choice.

25
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,545
I think I raised a snake.

26
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:49,704
I think there'll be an insane betrayal.

27
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:51,875
I hate...

28
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,143
Politics...

29
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:57,554
and betrayal aren't accepted in the hip-hop scene.

30
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,354
Is it you?

31
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,184
It's my team. What a joke.

32
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,655
What a little snake.

33
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:04,355
You punk, I looked after you.

34
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,995
I want to let my emotions take over and beat him up.

35
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:08,394
Curl up your fist

36
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,334
- Go right ahead. - No!

37
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:11,335
No!

38
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,534
I have no choice but to do it. I need to save the team.

39
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:24,814
I gained a family here.

40
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:27,484
I was the one who messed up.

41
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,254
Why do they need to leave when I was the one who messed up?

42
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,384
All of us survived, for goodness' sake!

43
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,324
That's right.

44
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,455
What's wrong?

45
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:39,895
Don't cry.

46
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,824
Isn't this too much?

47
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,435
Darn it.

48
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:48,563
I really can't do this anymore.

49
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,834
This is really insane.

50
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,974
The rules are bleeding us dry. Seriously.

51
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:57,845
For them, only three rules are given.

52
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,745
First, form your own faction, the block.

53
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:07,585
Second, eliminate the other blocks and protect your own.

54
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,754
And third, the one and only goal.

55
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:17,965
Be the last block to survive and take over RAP:PUBLIC.

56
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,834
Please keep watching to see...

57
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,634
what fate awaits them in the very end,

58
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:26,835
who'll be the last block to survive and be the winner.

59
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,145
Now, let us begin the game.

60
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:53,294
(RAP:PUBLIC)

61
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,685
This is the one and only society you establish with rap.

62
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:12,585
Welcome to RAP:PUBLIC.

63
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:17,554
This is a place where you'll survive using rap as your weapon...

64
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:21,794
and a new society where your backgrounds will be reset.

65
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:25,565
In this society, you can protect yourself and your block...

66
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:29,364
by attacking and defending by rap.

67
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:33,474
Strategies such as alliances and betrayals are allowed.

68
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,304
I guess being good at rapping isn't the only solution.

69
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:40,784
Someone could backstab me.

70
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:42,783
I was the one behind the first betrayal.

71
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,384
I didn't know that I'd get betrayed right away.

72
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,214
Backstabbing jerks need to be eliminated.

73
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,654
- I mean... - Go back!

74
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,623
- Be quiet and go back. - He moved like a snake.

75
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,223
I'm here to take out a snake, for goodness' sake.

76
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,793
This wasn't the picture I had in mind.

77
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,194
I'll take him out next time.

78
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,464
I'll never go down.

79
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,493
Do you feel like the boss now you got an offer to join?

80
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,565
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

81
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:03,874
One block that survives through unity and competition...

82
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,075
will receive the prize of 300,000 dollars...

83
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:10,744
and become the first owner of RAP:PUBLIC.

84
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:11,914
Three hundred thousand dollars?

85
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,575
Three hundred thousand dollars? Okay.

86
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:14,885
Thank you for the prize.

87
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,614
I'll need to eliminate all the rapper behind me.

88
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,315
The process of individuals forming power...

89
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,984
and gaining authority in society...

90
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:27,595
begins by checking each other's skills.

91
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:30,164
Thus, we prepared this.

92
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:48,984
Are we starting right away?

93
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:52,655
We're jumping in without so much as a warning.

94
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,454
Why are there two microphones?

95
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,655
Most shows don't have a battle from the very start.

96
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:01,164
This is the first step of becoming a member of RAP:PUBLIC,

97
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:03,424
Mask Off.

98
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,664
During Mask Off,

99
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:09,405
you'll let go of any prejudices such as age, popularity, and gender.

100
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:13,205
You'll check each other's weapons and test the waters during a battle.

101
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,603
We let go of our popularity in society...

102
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,114
and only compete with our skills in this system.

103
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:21,384
That means we can really be judged for our raps.

104
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,345
The rules are as follows.

105
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:27,553
The rapper who wants to start will take the stage...

106
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,885
and accept another rapper's challenge.

107
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,394
When a rapper who wants to oppose the starter...

108
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,924
comes up the stage, the battle will begin.

109
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:39,134
If you're like me right now

110
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,064
Ask me and find out

111
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:44,704
The result will be decided by the other rappers' votes...

112
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,473
after the starter and opposer's performances end.

113
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,474
(The result will be decided by the other rappers' votes.)

114
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,574
Afterward, the winner...

115
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,913
will receive the powerful authority to take off...

116
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,085
the loser's mask.

117
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,385
It'll be the first authority...

118
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,624
only the winners can enjoy.

119
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:04,054
This is getting interesting.

120
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,024
I'm beginning to get the picture.

121
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,794
I'll step on the others and advance.

122
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:11,465
Now, Mask Off will begin.

123
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,965
If you want to be the starter,

124
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:16,664
please come up to the stage.

125
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:24,845
He went up the stage right away.

126
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:28,815
What? Hey.

127
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:30,715
That's insanely cool. How did he go up right away?

128
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,014
Isn't he nervous?

129
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,054
He has guts.

130
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:38,924
Come on up.

131
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:40,025
- Gosh. - Yes.

132
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,494
If you want to be the opposer,

133
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,934
please come up to the stage.

134
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,314
Good luck.

135
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,315
How cool.

136
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,585
Now, the battle will begin.

137
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,885
I'll rip off his mask.

138
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,254
I'll be the winner anyway.

139
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,284
I'm confident.

140
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:09,484
Ready.

141
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:13,854
Start.

142
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:15,864
All right.

143
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:18,135
What?

144
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,233
Roll on my cash, I dash forward without looking

145
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,704
I throw on an outfit and it has the style of Milano

146
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,103
We don't bow to the fakes, we open accounts instead

147
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,505
I'm Messi before the ball, so start recording without a word

148
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,014
Back in the day, man in the mirror

149
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,143
Man in the mirror

150
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,584
After wandering in the maze, I raise the white flag

151
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:36,784
Rap and push over the wall like a domino

152
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,184
Born to be a big man, I feel like Cobain

153
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,753
- Everyone was keeping quiet. - Eighty-two

154
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,684
- Was everyone still asleep? - Half of my line

155
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:44,624
Tattoo on my wrist

156
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,824
E style, my tobacco

157
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,494
Spanish talker, and estoy loco

158
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:51,665
Yes.

159
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:56,565
I'll go right away.

160
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,704
Hop out of the Genesis Coupe

161
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,044
It's time to move on, I know what to do

162
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,903
This alley continues to be dark and dirty

163
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:04,013
It's like the redevelopment block

164
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,344
I'll sweep everything off so that no one comes back

165
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,914
Don't you dare to come after me I'll knock out your breath

166
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,243
I used to be on the run

167
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:09,915
But I crush everything now I'm sipping it like juice

168
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,653
- Yes! - All right.

169
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:13,055
How did he get the rhythm so perfect?

170
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,185
Yes. Shout it out.

171
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,224
What is it? Yes.

172
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:19,954
Gotta go, put in that sweat

173
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,363
Gotta go, make it wave

174
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:22,364
Gotta go, make it rain

175
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:23,824
Because of the money that made me a savage

176
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:25,034
My life is still a race

177
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,194
I run like Tay-K, Ain't nothing safe here

178
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:28,664
Feel like I'm Tyreek, I aim for a touchdown

179
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,003
When I move, that's a hot place

180
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,373
The review mirror is still full

181
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:33,034
Their lights try to stop me

182
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,403
They can't even put a dent, rats are their nicknames

183
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,873
The most you can do is rap

184
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,414
You flinch, that's the reality

185
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:38,814
I don't even need to look because he's fake

186
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,174
That's why success is my thing

187
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,944
Just live like that, I'll check on my wrist

188
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,814
I'm the one, I'm the one, you're going to pass the crowd

189
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,853
I run for 24 hours like I'm Kobe Bryant

190
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,753
I was stuck in the mud, I'm going to take the spot

191
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,425
He said, "What are you going to do? Set the game this time"

192
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:54,565
Yes.

193
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,623
Let's go.

194
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:57,965
It's obvious who the winner is.

195
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:04,534
The battle has ended.

196
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:05,633
(The battle between Starter 2 and Opposer 43 ends.)

197
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,644
We will now begin the vote.

198
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:12,473
Please stand behind the rapper who has done better...

199
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:14,644
in your opinion.

200
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,983
The vote begins now.

201
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,955
(The voting begins.)

202
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,724
The vote is now closed.

203
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:32,035
- Oh, no. - What?

204
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,504
The result of the vote will be revealed.

205
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:39,435
(Starter loses with 2 votes. Opposer wins with 56 votes.)

206
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:43,244
(Opposer, number 43 wins.)

207
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:46,075
There's no one behind me.

208
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:48,715
(My goodness)

209
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:53,084
The rappers behind me split like the Red Sea.

210
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,483
It was cruel.

211
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,523
The starker the difference is between the skills,

212
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:59,594
the more cruel the picture will become.

213
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:04,494
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper Two's mask.

214
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:15,945
(gamma)

215
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,814
(Lose: gamma)

216
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,014
It's gamma.

217
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,555
Gosh, it was so disappointing.

218
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:27,853
I didn't expect such a big difference...

219
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,724
between the votes.

220
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,555
If I get another chance, I can slice him up.

221
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:35,964
I'd like to take off my own mask.

222
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:37,023
It's humiliating...

223
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:38,964
to have someone else take off my mask.

224
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,435
I really don't want to lose.

225
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:46,574
The winning rapper, Rapper 43.

226
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,804
(The winning rapper, Rapper 43)

227
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:50,404
Take off your mask.

228
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,785
As soon as I heard his rap, I thought that he might be...

229
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:02,954
(KHAN)

230
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,624
(Win: KHAN)

231
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,354
I could tell from his hairstyle.

232
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:14,465
Mask Off.

233
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,234
I won the battle with a score of 56 to 2.

234
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,233
I'm not nervous yet.

235
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,374
My goal is victory.

236
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:23,644
We'll proceed with the next battle.

237
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:28,415
If you want to be the starter, please come up to the stage.

238
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,854
Gosh, he was very fast.

239
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,654
Come on up, you losers.

240
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:38,325
What?

241
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,955
For goodness' sake.

242
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:41,523
He swore at us.

243
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:43,295
He swore right away.

244
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:45,435
His confidence is insane.

245
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,565
If you want to be the opposer,

246
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,835
please come up to the stage.

247
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,144
I won't keep it long. I'll send you home.

248
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,014
Fight.

249
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,983
He swore at us. He called us losers.

250
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:11,094
It'd be strange to hear that and stand still.

251
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,425
I decided to destroy him.

252
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,024
It'll be fun. It'll be electrifying.

253
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,165
Ready.

254
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:21,305
Start.

255
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,734
Let's go.

256
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:30,104
You loser.

257
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:34,175
Your eyes tell me that you can't rap even if your life depended on it.

258
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:35,685
What a loser.

259
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:39,114
He began by swearing.

260
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,514
We have a pottymouth.

261
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,925
This is stressing me out.

262
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,394
I hope hip-hop will go under

263
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:49,095
All the rappers in Korea are doomed

264
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,464
They write comments with their faces covered

265
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,095
Because of this punk's mom joke, I lost all my upvotes

266
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,603
Korean hip-hop musicians are fighting on Instagram again

267
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:59,174
I'll go scratch them up, Let's go and attack them

268
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,873
Why would a rapper talk so much? This punk is all serious again

269
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,574
Say what you want with rap, you punk You get offended

270
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,373
Like a loser

271
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:08,444
- You get offended like a loser - He knows how to annoy someone.

272
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,513
Hip-hop losers, pipe down

273
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,314
Lee Chan Hyuk got you wiping down, Men's Tear got you wiping down

274
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,983
Keep going, fight now A traditionalist should shut it

275
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:18,194
Gosh, my comment is at the top What a dopamine rush

276
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:20,223
Hip-hop? I don't know Why should I care?

277
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:22,763
Just die, you know that's the only way to end this

278
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:25,393
My dopamine level is recharged I'll sleep with my feet stretched

279
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:28,205
Do I feel guilty? These punks can't see me anyway

280
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,345
All right.

281
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:37,845
- That was intense. - He's good.

282
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,345
I'll rip him apart.

283
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,545
Drop the beat.

284
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,884
What are you saying?

285
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,124
Do I look like a loser? Okay, let's go.

286
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,394
Let's go.

287
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,123
I won't keep it long You need more years of aging

288
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,594
Tone, lifestyle, rhyme The things you squeezed out

289
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,194
You're busy figuring out what's superior like the past me

290
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,733
You self-disrespect without knowing what's happening

291
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:03,734
I won't keep it long

292
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,204
- This is interesting. - I need more achievements

293
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,373
- It isn't because I'm good - He's taunting the opposer.

294
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:07,873
I live in an unjust society

295
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,344
I know that talent and success are two different things

296
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,814
I catch up with the tog dogs even if I must rip my legs

297
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,544
Let me be honest with you

298
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,214
You seem to be far from the truth

299
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,414
Your fake lyrics and jewelry get on my nerve

300
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,853
No, I simply accept what I can't change

301
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,284
Know that your antics won't work, my friend

302
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,353
But I know rap is still beautiful

303
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:28,023
Although I was born a nerd, I got the artisan groove

304
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:30,523
Move, if it gets on your nerve

305
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,363
If it gets on your nerve

306
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,864
Don't trust the faulty goods who pretend to be rappers

307
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,564
I won't keep it long Show me your limits

308
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:38,904
You can't beat me anyway

309
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:42,874
(The battle between Starter 1 and Opposer 31 ends.)

310
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:47,315
You know, the starter's laugh was too strong.

311
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:50,815
We will now begin the vote.

312
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,984
(The voting begins.)

313
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,024
The music needed confidence, but he got intimidated.

314
00:15:58,295 --> 00:16:00,924
My opponent messed up a bit.

315
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,065
I think I'll win.

316
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,494
The vote is now closed.

317
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:08,305
(Starter wins with 41 votes. Opposer loses with 17 votes.)

318
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,233
(Starter, number 1 wins.)

319
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:16,404
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper 31's mask.

320
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,715
(O'Domar)

321
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,814
(Lose: O'Domar)

322
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:27,854
It's O'Domar.

323
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,524
It's O'Domar.

324
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,325
It's O'Domar.

325
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:39,935
The winning rapper, Rapper One. Take off your mask.

326
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:42,133
Who is it?

327
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,404
I had my eyes on him. I'm so curious about his identity.

328
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:49,045
(Kaogaii)

329
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:51,644
(Win: Kaogaii)

330
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:53,274
Kaogaii!

331
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:54,614
Kaogaii.

332
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,483
He rapped well with confidence.

333
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:59,154
He rapped with ease. It was no joke.

334
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,955
Spirit. Kaogaii has the spirit.

335
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,285
I'm Kaogaii,

336
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,555
and I'm here to take over RAP:PUBLIC.

337
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,095
My performance was very fresh. That's all.

338
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:13,364
We'll proceed with the next battle.

339
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,035
I want to perform early on, but I'm a bit nervous.

340
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,604
I'm thinking about performing early on.

341
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:24,475
If you want to be the starter, please come up to the stage.

342
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:26,775
Please come up to the stage.

343
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:30,614
He can jump well.

344
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:34,154
I didn't feel nervous at all when I got here.

345
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,424
I thought, "It'll be fun."

346
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:36,884
Hello.

347
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,124
Who wants to compete against me?

348
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,124
Please come on up.

349
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,194
It's Roh Yun Ha.

350
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,535
It's Yun Ha.

351
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:46,134
Roh Yun Ha.

352
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:48,463
Hello, everyone.

353
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:51,034
I'm here to crush the old rappers.

354
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,604
I'm Roh Yun Ha. It's nice to meet you.

355
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:54,845
(He placed 2nd on "High School Rapper 4.")

356
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,173
(He's the best among those who were on "High School Rapper.")

357
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:57,244
(He'll take over the Korean hip-hop scene.)

358
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:58,414
(He entered the semifinal of "Show Me the Money 11.")

359
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,545
(The monster rapper of the survival shows, Roh Yun Ha)

360
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,143
I have an advantage when it comes to rap battles.

361
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:05,684
It'll be embarrassing if I lose.

362
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,585
If you want to be the opposer, please come up to the stage.

363
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,154
He's too talented.

364
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,565
He's a bit of a scary opponent.

365
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,163
- My goodness. - Who could he be?

366
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:24,235
That's cool. That's really cool.

367
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,634
Everyone is brave.

368
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,603
I wasn't going to do this early on,

369
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:32,414
but my body took me here.

370
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:36,943
I heard his voice and recognized him as Roh Yun Ha.

371
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:38,453
Then I thought, "No one is going up the stage."

372
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:41,014
"If I beat him,"

373
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,555
"it'll be fun for the onlookers."

374
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,055
Ready.

375
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,424
Start.

376
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,825
Let's go.

377
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:53,864
Let's go.

378
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:56,064
It's Roh Yun Ha.

379
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,364
Yes.

380
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,074
Twenty-twenty-four, it's on the season.

381
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,274
I can feel it, now, it's my time

382
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,613
Why? Punk, I always do well

383
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,984
Don't come at me, you'll be knocked down

384
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,683
Yes.

385
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,254
Press down, how you doin?

386
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,584
A greeting is a trick, a lot of fakes out

387
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,883
What do you want me to do? These punks sure talk a lot

388
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:19,224
Blah, blah, they always blame the system

389
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,724
Your rap tells me why this place is going down

390
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,994
Even when I put on a mask, people figure out who I am

391
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,234
You know how my flow goes, the source is clearly clear

392
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:28,534
Baby, I'm not a clone All of my words are stunning

393
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,903
The choice is yours, I'll cater to you if you want it

394
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,034
Yes

395
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,943
Don't waste it, I'm making money I need more commas, so tasty

396
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:37,304
I act like Hollywood, probably even stretching

397
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:39,643
Because it's my dream to be the GOAT It won't be easy

398
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,744
Fresh all the time, always giggling

399
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,883
I'm still 22, ain't no creaky

400
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,113
I make a move

401
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,153
- I'm like a bouncer - He's good.

402
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:49,025
This is my type, move out of the way if you know

403
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,424
It's game over if your rap makes people dance.

404
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:58,735
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time, I'm done

405
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,203
Roh Yun Ha!

406
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:03,464
He's really good.

407
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,805
He's energetic.

408
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,134
Give me the beat right away.

409
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,275
Yes.

410
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:19,554
Now, getting my hair dyed costs one percent of my monthly salary

411
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:22,754
All I need is one microphone Even if I win the lottery

412
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,453
Like Nucksal of 2015

413
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:27,653
The pessimistic and nerdy guy You envy my chromosomes

414
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:30,923
After my album became a hit, pressure built up deep in my heart

415
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:34,363
I'm going through a slump, but that's my catalyst

416
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:38,334
Who am I? I'm a blade that becomes sharp before death

417
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:40,574
Those who got defeated by us call me bad

418
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,044
AI can replace you Your chain is rusty, take that

419
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,603
Have an emergency meeting with Auto-Tune

420
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:46,873
Use meditation instead of pills from a psychiatrist

421
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:48,883
The game changer with the third eye

422
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,514
Please don't cry Your hands and feet are tied

423
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:55,353
Break the peace, if this is a movie, we're only at the trailer

424
00:20:55,354 --> 00:21:00,025
I'll be on Wikipedia as the leader of the seventh-generation hip-hop

425
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:03,194
- Yes. - Take that

426
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:07,393
(The battle between Starter 10 and Opposer 28 ends.)

427
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:08,704
It was so cool.

428
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,403
He did really well.

429
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:11,604
It was neck-and-neck.

430
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,104
We will now begin the vote.

431
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:18,545
I don't know which one to choose.

432
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,745
Both of them did well.

433
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,325
The result of the vote will be revealed.

434
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:32,995
Is it a tie?

435
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:35,595
I think we'll see a tie for the first time.

436
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:37,495
No way. More people are on that side.

437
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:39,364
More people are on that side. Maybe I'm wrong.

438
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:49,144
(Starter wins with 35 votes. Opposer loses with 23 votes.)

439
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:52,644
(Starter, number 10 wins.)

440
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:55,684
Take off the losing rapper,

441
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,614
Rapper 28's mask.

442
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:08,765
(skyminhyuk)

443
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:11,094
(Lose: skyminhyuk)

444
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,595
He's incredibly talented.

445
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,204
(With his album, "Liberation," skyminhyuk became a rising star.)

446
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:18,774
Had I done better...

447
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:21,035
Had six more people come to my side...

448
00:22:23,604 --> 00:22:25,943
The winning rapper, Rapper Ten.

449
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,374
Take off your mask.

450
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:31,984
(Roh Yun Ha)

451
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,515
(Win: Roh Yun Ha)

452
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,564
I headbutted my opponent like the bull of Red Bull and won today.

453
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:47,295
I'll headbutt my opponent like a bull and win next time as well.

454
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:48,664
Yes.

455
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:51,634
(Mask Off continues on.)

456
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,505
Here's a big one.

457
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:54,775
He's so big.

458
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:57,944
He's the size of a fridge.

459
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,213
Don't play around with me, you bastard

460
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,554
Get some bangs and be pretty

461
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,554
I didn't even carry a backpack in my school days

462
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,953
But my account balance shows so many zeroes

463
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:12,324
Teachers asked me, "What will you do if you don't study?"

464
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:13,393
Come on out now

465
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:14,755
They looked at me and frowned

466
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,295
What?

467
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,464
For goodness' sake.

468
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:19,295
Turn off the beat.

469
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:22,235
What was that?

470
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:23,604
He did it again.

471
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,835
(Polodared)

472
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:29,744
He's well-known for it.

473
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:31,203
He was rapping on "Show Me the Money."

474
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,975
"For goodness' sake. Turn off the beat."

475
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,344
(His appearance on "Show Me the Money 10" went viral.)

476
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,245
(Turn off the beat!)

477
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:41,314
There's one thing in common, I say

478
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:44,423
To my side thing and my oppositions, "Drop yo' location"

479
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,794
Even if you guys know it, you can't copy and paste it

480
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:48,324
You can't even be my imitation

481
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:50,194
I'm going to knock one of you out and tuck you tight

482
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:51,835
- What? He's so good. - Good night, I be cooking so heavy

483
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,894
Somebody go and get me some Michelin stars

484
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,604
(Yang Kyle)

485
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,735
- Was he the winner of "RAPCUP?" - Yes.

486
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,774
They're going to find out who's a real rookie

487
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,504
Everyone's attention is on the rising star

488
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:05,113
The themed stocks are getting wiped out

489
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:06,575
But I'm keeping my balance

490
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:08,314
I've never taken a break, I've always been moving

491
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:10,345
Everyone became a sage like Rick Rubin

492
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:12,184
- My landlord, I swear - He's so good.

493
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:15,584
(Marv)

494
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:16,785
Marv.

495
00:24:17,184 --> 00:24:18,394
You're cool.

496
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:21,254
I'm like a boxer because I need the hunnid round

497
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:22,923
- He was so good. I was shocked. - I'm like Lee Bong Ju

498
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:24,495
Because I always walk them down

499
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:26,064
- My songs are like a coup d'etat - He's good.

500
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,463
They make the whole town rise

501
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:30,304
I'm a controversial rapper, everyone falls for me

502
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:31,305
It was unbelievable.

503
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,434
- Yes. - I haven't seen him before.

504
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:36,403
They went, "He's on the rise these days."

505
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:37,404
(Tray B)

506
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:38,475
Tray B.

507
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:43,045
So there are talented rookies I don't know about.

508
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:45,015
(Lose: BBULKUP)

509
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,383
- BBULKUP. - BBULKUP?

510
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,454
BBULKUP?

511
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:49,224
- Isn't he a YouTuber? - Is he a YouTuber?

512
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:50,354
I think he is.

513
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,654
JOONIE?

514
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:53,954
JOONIE.

515
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,664
She's pretty.

516
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,265
- I think she's an idol. - She's pretty.

517
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,335
There was a variety of people.

518
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,104
Was she a foreigner?

519
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:05,535
(Drain K, JP)

520
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:06,674
(James An)

521
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:07,835
(DAMINI)

522
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,045
(Kang Hyuk)

523
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:13,314
(Kim Ga Yeon)

524
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:14,713
(VIIN)

525
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,985
VIIN.

526
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:18,954
- Kim Ryul. - Kim Ryul.

527
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,515
He's handsome.

528
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,453
There are so many rappers from various genres.

529
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:24,684
It'll be fun.

530
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,454
We'll proceed with the next battle.

531
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:30,225
If you want to be the starter,

532
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,363
please come up to the stage.

533
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,394
Please come up to the stage.

534
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:36,005
He took the stage right away.

535
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:40,104
Come up and beat me.

536
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,204
What?

537
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:43,775
What? Is it a provocation?

538
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,275
His spirit is impressive. Okay.

539
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,383
If you want to be the opposer,

540
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:50,444
please come up to the stage.

541
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,354
He's built like a warrior.

542
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:55,854
Who could he be?

543
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,394
Don't get tight.

544
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,255
What?

545
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:02,664
I'm curious.

546
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,794
I knew that I was going to win...

547
00:26:05,795 --> 00:26:07,795
because nobody raps like me.

548
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,364
Now, the battle will begin.

549
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,134
Ready.

550
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,345
Start.

551
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:18,874
Let's go.

552
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,584
Yo, everything dead, I'm smoking your fam

553
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,683
BIG YEL, we keep clicking

554
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,254
Yo, everything dead, I'm smoking your fam

555
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,484
BIG YEL, we keep clicking

556
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,393
Like a loser, you asked your friend if he knew Fleeky

557
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:34,994
CRAY and KAY, I hate oldies

558
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:36,393
I wonder you're dead, like I'm Stevie

559
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,064
No one can deny it, B, A, N, G, O, A, T, feel like Keke

560
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,834
I'll send all these rappers home

561
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:42,064
Hurry up and call the taxis like Jay Park

562
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:45,274
They said I wouldn't survive, but I show them my Day-Date

563
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:48,234
Hope out the V, hurry up and rob me if you can

564
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:51,103
You can't copy my swag, your album is a copy of mine

565
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:53,913
You keep falling and I keep rising

566
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,713
Feeling like I'm Kobe, 24, ain't no stopping

567
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:58,183
Celine and Prada and Fendi, I'm rocking

568
00:26:58,184 --> 00:26:59,683
I never have beef with beggars

569
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,014
You can't reach my level

570
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:02,524
Like Jack Harlow, What's popping?

571
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,024
Everything dead, everything dead

572
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:05,423
Everyone's dead except for BIG YEL

573
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,824
KAY G, RUNNER, my boys, facts

574
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,224
I see an opp, CRAY, go blast

575
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:10,994
Fashion killer like Rocky, I have a party every night

576
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,663
You're 30 and broke

577
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:13,933
So you live with your mom, you're not Coogie

578
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,764
Losers, don't listen to my music Same goes for the oldies

579
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,163
Wipe your keyboard and mouse, you punk

580
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:19,835
You ended up that way because of your mom

581
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,075
He's good.

582
00:27:27,144 --> 00:27:28,713
He changed, "Gang, gang, gang."

583
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:29,985
How did he hold it in?

584
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:31,953
He was good.

585
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,414
I thought that he'd win.

586
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,153
I don't know who he is.

587
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,224
Who is he?

588
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:37,884
I'm going to show you the real gang, gang.

589
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:47,933
Same number, who this?

590
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:51,534
My designer items are never fake My chopper is shiny

591
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:55,345
If I see you, then I really got you

592
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:59,143
Hold up, one minute, wait

593
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,814
You know you're a side piece like a side dish

594
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:06,613
Just one shot, one glass My chain looks like an apple

595
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:10,254
With my chopsticks, I eat you like soy sauce

596
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,825
Trap, car, honk, honk, honk

597
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:17,694
My chopper sings well, noraebang, bang, bang

598
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:21,633
Don't do it, you not a stepper, Don't go

599
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:25,304
Whip the work like kimchi, Like a middle-aged woman

600
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:27,674
Bro, sit down, sit down

601
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:31,305
I got the fire, I can start anything

602
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:35,144
Running down, there goes my gun

603
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:38,954
And if I want it, then I take it

604
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:45,694
That was so fresh.

605
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,423
Yes, sir.

606
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:48,964
(The battle between Starter 51 and Opposer 13 ends.)

607
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:52,464
Now, that was some real gangster rap, for real.

608
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,294
I thought it was crazy.

609
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,464
Should I say it was original? I liked his spirit.

610
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:59,475
We will now begin the vote.

611
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,204
My gosh, this is a close one.

612
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,274
Please proceed with voting.

613
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:07,874
(The voting begins.)

614
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,015
I don't know whom to pick this time.

615
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:13,184
What?

616
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,055
My gosh, this one is neck and neck.

617
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,025
This one will come down to the wire.

618
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:21,124
(The vote is now closed.)

619
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:24,794
(Starter: 25 votes, Opposer: 33 votes)

620
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,664
(Opposer 13 wins.)

621
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,674
Honk!

622
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:39,413
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper 51's mask.

623
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:40,745
(Remove the mask from the losing rapper, Rapper 51.)

624
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:45,453
(Fleeky Bang)

625
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:47,585
(Fleeky Bang)

626
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,354
(His gang-gang-gang meme went viral among teenagers.)

627
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,064
(This rapper established himself in the scene with his own style.)

628
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:57,393
(He's the future of the Korean hip-hop scene.)

629
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,735
(His album is incredible. I can't believe he's only a rookie.)

630
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,694
- The winning rapper, Rapper 13. - Gosh.

631
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:04,835
Rapper 13. Take off your mask.

632
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:07,934
A rapping guru showed up at the battle.

633
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:09,373
Was he an evil grandpa or something?

634
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,144
It was like he was spitting out evil spells.

635
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,544
Take off your mask.

636
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:17,614
(The winning rapper, Rapper 13, takes off his mask.)

637
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:22,554
(Double Down)

638
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:25,995
(Double Down)

639
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:27,824
My name is Double Down.

640
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:30,194
My occupation is a rap star.

641
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:34,295
I'm from TSP. Top Shelf Product is my label.

642
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:36,005
We're based out in New York.

643
00:30:36,104 --> 00:30:38,463
And they're here with me now in Korea.

644
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:40,775
I'm with Nosun and Foggyatthebottom.

645
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:42,845
Double Down?

646
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:45,104
That explains why he didn't understand Korean that well.

647
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,614
It was really unexpected that Fleeky Bang lost.

648
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,545
Fleeky Bang is quite popular.

649
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:53,555
To put it simply, no one saw it coming.

650
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:58,325
Well, I'll make sure to win if I get to go up against him again.

651
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:00,423
Anybody can get it.

652
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:02,295
I think it will be hard to top me.

653
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:05,264
We'll proceed with the next battle.

654
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:06,464
Let's go.

655
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,364
Why don't we lighten the mood? What do you say?

656
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:13,633
Anyone who wants to challenge this rapper, please come up...

657
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:15,474
Please come up to the stage.

658
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,005
- Gosh. - Oh, shoot!

659
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:18,975
He backed off.

660
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,944
Bless. Let's have a good one.

661
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:26,085
I didn't have a particular reason behind choosing him.

662
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:28,383
I thought I should perform soon...

663
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:30,985
before I lost any more energy in order to win the battle.

664
00:31:31,854 --> 00:31:32,854
Ready.

665
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:37,124
- Start. - Let's get it.

666
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:44,005
Yes, let's go.

667
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:48,173
I hop on a coupe, they all call me a baller

668
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,673
Looking at you makes me pity you, I'll make you my daughter

669
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,173
I won't stop, I'm flowing like water

670
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:52,844
She's making me sweat, and she's making me hotter

671
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,314
The moment I open my eyes, my thoughts swarm in

672
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:56,044
The chains around my neck all freeze up

673
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,344
- Who is that? - Come at me, I'm always ready

674
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,014
To slaughter, you have it tough, trying to act

675
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,784
My movements are low-key, I'm witty like Manu Ginobli

676
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,453
My girl gives you a nosebleed

677
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,853
But don't be a fool because you're not my Brodie

678
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:06,623
Where the fun are my medals and trophies

679
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,894
I'll bang you in the head, I stole and copied that boy

680
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,464
Okay.

681
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:16,235
He just went for it.

682
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,704
My gosh.

683
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:19,735
DJ, drop the beat!

684
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:24,275
After hearing his flow, I thought his rap was weak.

685
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,174
I thought I had an 80 percent chance that I would beat him.

686
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:32,314
Gold

687
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:33,754
Let's go.

688
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:36,585
- Gold - Gosh, this one will be intense.

689
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:39,624
The captain gold, I'm on that captain gold

690
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,463
Dollar bills rain down, straight to my account

691
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:43,893
I stand at the starting line

692
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,633
I begin again for the hall of fame

693
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:46,764
Tell them, I'm trying to eat

694
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,633
I'll eat everything up like in the eating show

695
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,264
So I've got to say...

696
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:53,305
- My gosh. - Oh, shoot!

697
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:56,444
Hey, you there, you know how it goes

698
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,044
Hey, you, there it goes

699
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,074
There it goes

700
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:01,114
Oh, shoot.

701
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:02,444
Oh, my.

702
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:05,985
He must have been really nervous.

703
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,653
Hey, 100 in 1 day, she was great

704
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,184
Now, I'll be munching at the Chinese buffet

705
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:12,755
You come to

706
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:16,825
(Rapper 4 continues rapping without the music.)

707
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:20,734
I've got it bad, shop for my meal, and talk about...

708
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:21,795
What?

709
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,975
And talk about...

710
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,173
(The battle between Starter 33 and Opposer 4 ends.)

711
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,544
- Oh, shoot. - Oh, shoot.

712
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:32,143
(Sighing)

713
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,174
I totally bombed it.

714
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:35,815
I'm too good to mess up this early on.

715
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,785
He totally bombed it. This is so bad.

716
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,985
My head just went blank.

717
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:44,285
We will now begin the vote.

718
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:46,924
My gosh, it's a pity that number four totally bombed it.

719
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:50,124
He was even wearing gloves. His hands must be sweating.

720
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:51,525
There's nothing I can do.

721
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,604
- Oh, my. - He didn't get a single vote?

722
00:33:58,164 --> 00:34:00,373
(Starter: 56 votes, Opposer: 2 votes)

723
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,345
(Starter 33 wins.)

724
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:03,745
Goodness.

725
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,844
Seeing a lot of people on this side...

726
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,145
when you're on the stage must make you so angry.

727
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,714
It was humiliating.

728
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:16,285
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper Four's mask.

729
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,794
It was so disappointing and sad.

730
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:29,664
It was humiliating.

731
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:31,134
I totally bombed it. I couldn't bounce back from it.

732
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:33,935
I have no idea who number four is.

733
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,975
- My gosh. Seriously? - Goodness.

734
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:44,185
Everyone is shocked.

735
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:47,884
(GOLDBUUDA)

736
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:51,423
(GOLDBUUDA)

737
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,924
- It was GOLDBUUDA? - It was GOLDBUUDA.

738
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:55,125
It really is him.

739
00:34:56,464 --> 00:34:58,164
Yes, sir. I'm New Wave Dangun.

740
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:01,265
GB, the One Love. Hello, I'm GOLDBUUDA.

741
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,863
(Lil Cherry and GOLDBUUDA, the siblings are beloved...)

742
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,705
(for their unique style.)

743
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:06,975
It was unexpected.

744
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:09,245
I never imagined that I would see him on RAP:PUBLIC.

745
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:13,415
I wanted to compete on RAP:PUBLIC for a reason.

746
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,384
So far, I've been performing with Lil Cherry as a duo.

747
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:19,713
I don't want to be seen as just Lil Cherry's brother.

748
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:21,284
I wanted to branch out on my own...

749
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,653
and be acknowledged as a solo rapper.

750
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,024
That's why I'm here.

751
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:28,294
Number 33. Take off your mask.

752
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,725
(XWALLY)

753
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,665
- It's XWALLY. - It's XWALLY.

754
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:38,503
GOLDBUUDA has been in this industry for a long time.

755
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,673
He's a very talented rapper, actually.

756
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:44,575
But his rap was so weird.

757
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:49,714
My gosh, it has to be the most embarrassing moment of my career.

758
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,714
- It's great to see you here. - Hey.

759
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:53,583
- You did well. - It's okay.

760
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,983
Oh, dear. I was so nervous.

761
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:59,355
It'd be great if you could cut out the losing rappers' performances.

762
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:02,294
Please.

763
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:07,694
Do you want to take off the mask?

764
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:11,504
But so many people are trying to grab the microphone.

765
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,874
I just want to take off my mask now.

766
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,274
It's so stuffy to have it on.

767
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,974
Anyone who wants to rap first, please come up...

768
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,774
Anyone who wants to rap first, please come up to the stage.

769
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:27,813
All right. Let's have fun with it.

770
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:29,954
My gosh, this is going to be a fun one.

771
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,024
Go for it.

772
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,894
I had to come up after hearing her voice.

773
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,424
- Who is that? - Who is it?

774
00:36:35,665 --> 00:36:37,394
His voice sounds familiar.

775
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,424
Ready.

776
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:42,765
Start.

777
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:44,064
Okay, let's go.

778
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,305
I climbed up the ladder, one step at a time

779
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,274
After my album, the mainstream media is my next step

780
00:36:51,404 --> 00:36:53,014
People thought I would get eliminated early on

781
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:55,414
But I showed them how it was done and got my sweet revenge

782
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,144
Hundreds of thousands of dollars hit my bank account

783
00:36:57,145 --> 00:36:58,883
I put out an album along with several tapes

784
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,313
But they still follow the gossip, so I do another pull-up

785
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:03,785
I must raise my pay again, so I came back

786
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:05,225
She's good.

787
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,154
Who says I'm overplaying my image when I haven't shown anyone my butt

788
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,494
You'll be the first to follow me

789
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,964
Saying you're my fans, so don't act so innocent

790
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:13,963
She's good.

791
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,034
Music is what I want to sell first, and the rest is a side hustle

792
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:17,664
I just get paid for my rap

793
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:18,665
I'll break down this wall

794
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,704
- Even if it breaks my head - She's too good.

795
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,374
Timing is on my side

796
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,375
Those who claim the scene is dead

797
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:23,443
- And have no faith should get lost - I love it.

798
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:25,244
Being certain in the uncertain times is the real deal

799
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,543
Before you complain about the cap, find yourself first

800
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,684
I want a lot of money, and so do you

801
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:30,944
But you can't be like me

802
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,253
Here's why, it's not about your age or looks

803
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:34,313
It's because

804
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:35,414
- You're not as good as me, so what? - She's so ballsy.

805
00:37:35,415 --> 00:37:36,584
So what?

806
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:40,055
- Oh, shoot. Oh, my. - Yes!

807
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,194
- Gosh, she killed it. - Yes!

808
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:43,724
- Let's go, my brother. - My gosh.

809
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:46,164
I don't know who she is, but she's incredible.

810
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:47,595
Hey, what the heck!

811
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:51,564
- She's so good. - That was so cool.

812
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:54,074
She's a warrior.

813
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:56,245
Her vocalization was so good.

814
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:57,944
I was really impressed.

815
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:00,313
Let's have a blast.

816
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:02,015
- Let's go. - Let's go.

817
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:03,245
Let's get it.

818
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,844
Even his beat is getting me excited.

819
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:06,855
- Isn't this Hangzoo? No? - Put your hands up.

820
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,555
Hey!

821
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:17,394
Pay attention, look at my stuff, look at my team

822
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,894
I see red

823
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:22,293
With the funky rhythm, I'll be kicking with tension

824
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:25,664
A drunk dog

825
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:29,034
Gets the party started, Akaraka

826
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:32,344
I don't know what people say, I just let it happen

827
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:35,644
These sorry rappers from tonight, they're just all talk

828
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:38,284
The king has come to RAP:PUBLIC

829
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:39,354
- She crushed him. - Like Einstein taking a school exam

830
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:42,055
The chemistry of different classes with the Ngannou Punch

831
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:45,753
A drunk dog

832
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:48,555
Gets the party started, Akaraka

833
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:53,435
(The battle between Starter 29 and Opposer 40 ends.)

834
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:57,765
We will now begin the vote.

835
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:00,904
Yes, 29 went crazy.

836
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:03,074
The lady killed it.

837
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,975
My gosh, she was way too good.

838
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:07,774
(What's the result of their battle?)

839
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:10,784
(Starter: 56 votes, Opposer: 2 votes)

840
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,285
She won by a landslide.

841
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,555
Oh, my.

842
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:17,725
(Starter 29 wins.)

843
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,754
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper 40's mask.

844
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:26,595
- Be bold. - Go.

845
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,265
Go ahead.

846
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,403
- It's Geegooin. - What?

847
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,935
(Geegooin)

848
00:39:33,134 --> 00:39:35,535
(Geegooin)

849
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:37,944
The winning rapper, Rapper 29.

850
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,713
Take off your mask.

851
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,075
(The winning rapper, Rapper 29, takes off her mask.)

852
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:47,214
(SINCE)

853
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:48,814
(SINCE)

854
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:50,154
It was SINCE.

855
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:53,094
(She left a strong impression after winning second place...)

856
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:54,924
(on "Show Me the Money 10.")

857
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,494
(She was the first female rapper...)

858
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,294
(to win the New Artist of the Year in 2022.)

859
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,165
What?

860
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,974
Were they on different teams?

861
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:09,173
- On "Show Me the Money 10?" - They had a thing.

862
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,404
Yes, right!

863
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,614
- No way. - Will that continue here?

864
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:14,914
(They met on "Show Me the Money 10.")

865
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:17,515
(And he surprised her with a love confession.)

866
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:19,185
That's why I bombed it.

867
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:21,555
- Gosh. - You killed it.

868
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,725
I had no idea you would be here.

869
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:26,395
Then how many contestants from "Show Me the Money" are here?

870
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:28,625
I knew people from "Show Me the Money" would be here.

871
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:32,094
Smoke in my mouth, I'm riding to the airport

872
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,693
It takes 4.1 seconds to hit 100km per hour

873
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,534
I'm a VVIP in whatever city I'm in

874
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:37,403
Pick up the phone right now

875
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:38,504
That's Seong Kyung, right?

876
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:39,634
Boi B.

877
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:41,305
(Boi B wins.)

878
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:45,075
It rained until yesterday

879
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:48,015
I go to the top, look down, and laugh

880
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,684
I go to the top and have my city at my feet

881
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:51,813
It's Mckdaddy.

882
00:40:51,814 --> 00:40:53,813
I watched "Show Me the Money" a lot.

883
00:40:53,814 --> 00:40:55,154
I was quite surprised.

884
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,624
Now I'm chilling and high like palm trees

885
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,354
I'm ready to take flight again when you're blinded by jealousy

886
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:02,094
That's why some guys avoid me even more

887
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:03,764
Failures are great for success

888
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:05,325
And I believe in myself

889
00:41:06,194 --> 00:41:08,134
(Reddy)

890
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,764
- That's Reddy? - No wonder.

891
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:12,834
I had no idea.

892
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,144
No, the dollar bills are my dopamine

893
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:18,504
Piles of them give me orgasm like cocaine

894
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:20,714
What do you want to gain from this game?

895
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:22,884
There are things that are better than money

896
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:26,214
The moment I heard his voice, I had a feeling it was Jo Gwang Il.

897
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,355
It was Jo Gwang Il.

898
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:31,153
(Jo Gwang Il)

899
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,625
He was the winner of "Show Me the Money 10."

900
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,424
I thought the lineup for this show was just insane.

901
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:37,924
We'll proceed with the next battle.

902
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,264
Anyone who wants to rap first,

903
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,294
- please come up to the stage. - Oh, my.

904
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:43,805
- Please come up to the stage. - Oh, my.

905
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:46,804
Shoot. That was too fast.

906
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:48,605
Hey, watch out.

907
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:50,774
Darn it. I should've learned how to run first.

908
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:53,245
If you think you're the best, come up.

909
00:41:54,544 --> 00:41:55,574
Oh, my.

910
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:56,645
He seems so intense.

911
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:58,185
I'm glad I didn't go up.

912
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,225
You asked for me, so I'm here.

913
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:09,595
You asked for me, so I'm here.

914
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:13,895
You might have made a mistake.

915
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:16,134
That was savage.

916
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,004
He's pretty cool.

917
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:20,575
You know, that guy. Number eight.

918
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,075
Who do you think he is? Check out his posture.

919
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,375
The way he was standing up...

920
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,874
I've seen it somewhere.

921
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,245
I've seen him stand like that.

922
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:31,245
It's him.

923
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:32,785
You're right.

924
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:35,515
Ready.

925
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:39,024
Start.

926
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:40,325
Drop the beat.

927
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:44,194
Hey, this is me, 59.

928
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,204
Listen.

929
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:52,604
Cheer three times right on time

930
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,503
I'll sing a Korean song

931
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:57,374
Look at that fine lady, but you're still as arrogant as ever

932
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,113
Tell her you can't make it

933
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,313
I, born in 2005, am making my way back

934
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,813
I undid the leash on Pavlov's dog

935
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:07,414
I'm dodging stones, even the ones meant to fly

936
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:10,153
F-I-V-E-L-I-N-E-S, it's time to rise

937
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,923
It's a rare beautiful day

938
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:14,554
Hello, ladies, I'm the young master of the 21st century

939
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:16,963
I tend to leave the mistakes of the past far behind me

940
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,964
When people pretend to be mentally ill in this scene

941
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:21,963
It was some kid stuff, that was back in the day

942
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:24,463
I got pens and notebooks, I was only 14

943
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,704
There were desks all around me

944
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:29,974
But you got no color even with that big head of yours

945
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:32,204
See if you can dance like me, you punk

946
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:35,114
You got no sense of rhythm, so you can't pull this off

947
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:37,313
See if you can dance like me, you punk

948
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,813
You got no sense of rhythm, so you can't pull this off

949
00:43:39,814 --> 00:43:42,414
Even your vocabulary is subpar and pathetic

950
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:45,455
Now bring me a coffee without the syrup

951
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:47,555
My gosh, he was about to kiss number eight.

952
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,395
Cute.

953
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:51,064
Okay. I liked the dance, though.

954
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:53,363
I thought he was on fire.

955
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,594
I loved it.

956
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:56,265
When he rapped, I could feel his aura too.

957
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,404
Let's go, DJ.

958
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:08,614
His vocalization is insane. He's got a booming voice.

959
00:44:09,584 --> 00:44:11,443
The deity blessed me with nothing but the best

960
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:12,514
- It's him, right? - Yes.

961
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:13,515
It's him, right?

962
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:15,354
I'm leading the orchestra with my natural finesse

963
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,554
This accent has been with me since I was in middle school

964
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:19,024
Why do I need advice?

965
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:20,325
- His vocalization is so clear! - I didn't need anything else

966
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,923
So I'm reaching nirvana and dunking my desires in the Nile

967
00:44:23,924 --> 00:44:25,023
He's much better.

968
00:44:25,024 --> 00:44:27,693
These fools think I'm angry, but I turn my rage into art

969
00:44:27,694 --> 00:44:29,164
- Who is that? He's rocking it. - I know

970
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:31,664
How to handle drama in my life just like a movie director

971
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:34,034
Everything is under control, cameras are rolling

972
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:35,903
This will be another memory, Obviously, it'll be a hit again

973
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:37,773
I'm no murderer, but I kill it every time

974
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:39,644
I'm killing this beat, and this is all real

975
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:41,474
Since I was a rookie, I've stood shoulder to shoulder

976
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:43,314
They never put me down just because I'm young

977
00:44:43,845 --> 00:44:45,043
- He's on fire. - I walk weird and am out of line

978
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:47,153
They say I slur my words on purpose just like this

979
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:49,954
Manifest it all, hardships or whatever, now I want it all

980
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:51,883
I don't care if it's pain or gains, I'll grab my backpack

981
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:53,653
I'm a traveler, ready to go anywhere in the world

982
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:55,624
I'm even ready to pick up whatever comes my way

983
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,193
I have my eyes on the throne

984
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,294
- I know who he is. - I've got nothing to fear

985
00:44:58,694 --> 00:44:59,765
It's him, right?

986
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:02,495
I have my eyes on the throne

987
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:04,503
I've got nothing to fear

988
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:05,504
- I'm a gem in the dark - They're fighting.

989
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:07,004
They're fighting.

990
00:45:07,904 --> 00:45:08,935
Wait, they won't.

991
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:13,674
I like number eight more.

992
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,245
What was that? That was wild.

993
00:45:18,714 --> 00:45:19,714
He's so good.

994
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:21,814
It was overwhelming.

995
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:23,855
The real deal has come.

996
00:45:24,384 --> 00:45:25,884
The battle has ended.

997
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:27,825
He did better than me on my beat.

998
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:30,064
But number 59 had more to show.

999
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,825
(The voting begins.)

1000
00:45:36,095 --> 00:45:37,265
I like it here.

1001
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:39,364
What's going on? This is the right side.

1002
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:43,145
I think his showmanship on the stage was better.

1003
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:44,944
I was hooked on his rap.

1004
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:52,785
(The vote is now closed.)

1005
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:55,114
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1006
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,855
(Starter: 19 votes, Opposer: 39 votes)

1007
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:01,555
(The opposer, number 8, wins.)

1008
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:04,265
Take off the losing rapper,

1009
00:46:04,524 --> 00:46:05,964
Rapper 59's mask.

1010
00:46:19,645 --> 00:46:21,474
- OSUN. - OSUN.

1011
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:22,575
OSUN.

1012
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:23,714
Five Lines.

1013
00:46:24,185 --> 00:46:26,084
He was on "High School Rapper," right?

1014
00:46:26,415 --> 00:46:27,855
He lost a lot of weight.

1015
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:29,984
The winning rapper,

1016
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:33,254
number eight. Take off your mask.

1017
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:45,404
(HAON)

1018
00:46:46,605 --> 00:46:49,105
(HAON)

1019
00:46:53,174 --> 00:46:55,214
Gosh, this is unexpected.

1020
00:46:56,285 --> 00:46:57,415
I had a feeling it might be him.

1021
00:46:58,484 --> 00:46:59,515
- I was right. - What?

1022
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:01,285
- Is he in a bad mood? - What?

1023
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,084
No, he's been like that the whole day.

1024
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,194
Hello.

1025
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:09,254
It's been six years...

1026
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:10,963
since I starred in "High School Rapper 2."

1027
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:11,995
My name is HAON.

1028
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:14,394
Hi, let me introduce myself

1029
00:47:14,395 --> 00:47:18,035
(He drew attention early on with his one-of-a-kind style.)

1030
00:47:18,404 --> 00:47:19,874
(With his unparalleled rap skills, he was constantly in the limelight.)

1031
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,375
(Then he won the competition.)

1032
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:23,844
I'll continue to impress you...

1033
00:47:23,845 --> 00:47:25,705
and bring something new to the table.

1034
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:27,515
Let's see, bozo

1035
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:30,944
(He released his 1st full-length album 6 years since debut.)

1036
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:32,983
(- HAON is the future. - HAON, you don't need to meditate.)

1037
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,213
(- This is the flow of the year. - His new style rocks.)

1038
00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:35,483
(He made his return, gaining praise for his improved talent.)

1039
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:38,125
I looked at the screen and saw his name there. I was like,

1040
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:39,994
"What? Really?"

1041
00:47:39,995 --> 00:47:41,094
I didn't see it coming.

1042
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:42,554
I had no idea he would be here.

1043
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:44,824
"He's on the show too?" That's how I felt.

1044
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:47,095
I started to write lyrics because I was motivated...

1045
00:47:47,194 --> 00:47:48,495
by HAON.

1046
00:47:48,794 --> 00:47:51,605
I thought, "Gosh, we were meant to meet."

1047
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:53,904
If I get a chance to battle him again,

1048
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:56,035
I'm going to get back at him for this.

1049
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:01,515
Honestly, I'm furious.

1050
00:48:03,384 --> 00:48:04,645
You already gave up.

1051
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:07,084
It's not that I gave up. I'm going with plan B.

1052
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,184
You're aware that...

1053
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:11,325
your decision pushed us closer to the worst-case scenario, right?

1054
00:48:12,285 --> 00:48:15,055
Well, right.

1055
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:16,995
All right. That's all I needed to hear.

1056
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:20,064
I'm off.

1057
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,935
- He's angry. - Of course, he is.

1058
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:31,274
(Meanwhile, the battles have been going on for a long time.)

1059
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:38,185
(This rapper is enjoying all the battles without a break.)

1060
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,584
What do you call that? The nail extensions.

1061
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,023
The one with the nail extensions.

1062
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:46,825
The one with nail extensions as long as fingers.

1063
00:48:47,055 --> 00:48:48,995
Her nails were as long as this.

1064
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:51,624
She couldn't stay still when other people were rapping.

1065
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,994
I was really curious about this rapper.

1066
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:55,693
I was like, "Who is this girl?"

1067
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:57,364
What are those? Are those Wolverine nails?

1068
00:48:57,864 --> 00:48:59,464
She put swords on her nails.

1069
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:04,173
If there's anything you would like to say, go ahead.

1070
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,805
Nice to meet you all. Let's go.

1071
00:49:06,814 --> 00:49:09,375
Me! Please let me do it.

1072
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:14,484
Ms. Wolverine has been wanting to battle it out for some time.

1073
00:49:14,814 --> 00:49:16,984
Gosh, I really want to battle it out.

1074
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:21,125
Please come up to the stage.

1075
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,824
- Please come up to the stage. - Darn it.

1076
00:49:23,825 --> 00:49:25,963
When will I get to do it?

1077
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,793
So how is she going to grab the microphone?

1078
00:49:27,794 --> 00:49:30,464
I don't think she can do it because of her nails.

1079
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:32,904
Me! Please let me do it.

1080
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,134
Let her do it. She's so desperate.

1081
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:39,574
Yes!

1082
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:41,944
(Rapper 45 finally gets on the stage after a long wait.)

1083
00:49:42,214 --> 00:49:43,645
Let's go, Nails!

1084
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,515
My biggest curiosity was how she would handle the microphone.

1085
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,484
Ms. Wolverine. Hey, she did it.

1086
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:49,753
Hello. Is it working? Yes.

1087
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:53,424
Her nails were super long. And she was missing three nails.

1088
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:56,463
The battle begins now.

1089
00:49:56,464 --> 00:49:57,495
Ready.

1090
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:01,634
Start.

1091
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:03,035
Let's go.

1092
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:11,444
Let's go.

1093
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:14,273
I'm spitting out another verse, move it, if you don't, you'll crash

1094
00:50:14,274 --> 00:50:15,773
Time's flown by

1095
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:17,543
But how could I forget my past?

1096
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:19,184
I get one shot at a life

1097
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:20,684
The genre of my theme song is an adventure

1098
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,383
This fool's no good, she's a joke, straight up

1099
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:23,954
Look me in the eyes, speak the truth

1100
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:25,684
You say I need to get a grip, but what are you on?

1101
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:28,494
You stupid head, get lost

1102
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,164
Even I think I'm too fly

1103
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:31,793
And that's my problem

1104
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:33,563
I'll be banging and go out with a bang, no doubt

1105
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:34,994
There will be a big bang after I'm gone

1106
00:50:34,995 --> 00:50:36,034
A pretty girl calls me up

1107
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:38,333
It goes off all night long, but I won't answer it

1108
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,034
I'm sorry, I'm busy

1109
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:42,004
What am I up to? I'm popping another one

1110
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:44,645
Yes.

1111
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:45,705
Respect.

1112
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,645
He's skilled indeed.

1113
00:50:51,145 --> 00:50:53,714
All right. Here I go.

1114
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:55,813
I'm looking forward to this. I hope she does well.

1115
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:57,424
I'm so curious about her rap.

1116
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:00,424
Okay.

1117
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:04,363
I got my wisdom tooth out, yes, it's out, and it hurt

1118
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:05,863
- I got my wisdom tooth out - What did she say?

1119
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:07,534
- Yes, it's out, and it hurt - She got her wisdom tooth out?

1120
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,764
I got my wisdom tooth out, yes, it's out

1121
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:10,765
- And it hurt - And it hurt

1122
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:12,934
I got my wisdom tooth out, yes, it's out

1123
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:14,575
- And it hurt - Okay.

1124
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,305
It hurt like crazy once I got my wisdom tooth out

1125
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:20,213
The anesthesia wears off, and the pain doubles and triples

1126
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:22,974
Doc, do something, what am I going to do?

1127
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:24,443
I can't eat spicy or salty food

1128
00:51:24,444 --> 00:51:26,514
What? How am I going to live now?

1129
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:28,153
But now that it's gone, it feels nice

1130
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:29,923
I don't know why I got scared then

1131
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,284
- I pulled out every rotten tooth - Who is that?

1132
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:33,653
That put me in pain, out like that

1133
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:36,224
Oh, my wisdom tooth

1134
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:38,424
Get rid of the bad memory

1135
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:41,495
Toss the tooth away

1136
00:51:41,734 --> 00:51:45,133
- Toss it aside with my depression - What is this?

1137
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:47,604
Just like the wisdom tooth that was irritated and rotten,

1138
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,673
Self blame was only taking up space in my head

1139
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:51,974
So erase it from my mind right away

1140
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,374
I got my wisdom tooth out, yes, it's out

1141
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,375
- And it hurt - And it hurt

1142
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,514
- I got my wisdom tooth out - I got my wisdom tooth out

1143
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:57,583
- Yes, it's out - Yes, it's out

1144
00:51:57,584 --> 00:51:58,584
- And it hurt - And it hurt

1145
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,613
I got my wisdom tooth out, yes, it's out

1146
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:01,614
- And it hurt - And it hurt

1147
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:03,824
I got my wisdom tooth out, yes, it's out

1148
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:04,854
- And it hurt - And it hurt

1149
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,994
- I took out my wisdom - I can totally feel it.

1150
00:52:06,995 --> 00:52:08,054
And it hurt

1151
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:10,363
I took out my wisdom

1152
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:12,423
- And it hurt - She's a great performer, though.

1153
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,494
I took out my wisdom

1154
00:52:13,495 --> 00:52:15,594
- And it hurt, I took out - I can't stop dancing to it.

1155
00:52:15,595 --> 00:52:18,665
I took out my wisdom, and it hurt

1156
00:52:19,364 --> 00:52:22,205
(The battle between Starter 34 and Opposer 45 ends.)

1157
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:24,605
I'll vote for her.

1158
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:27,443
It was so catchy.

1159
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,813
I'll remember her performance for at least three years.

1160
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,484
It hurts like crazy when you get your wisdom tooth out.

1161
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:33,454
I want her to get one more wisdom tooth out.

1162
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:34,484
So she can perform one more time.

1163
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:37,484
She gave it all.

1164
00:52:38,924 --> 00:52:39,924
You were in a lot of pain.

1165
00:52:39,925 --> 00:52:41,325
The battle has ended.

1166
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,464
You were in a lot of pain.

1167
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:45,794
- Oh, shoot. Gosh. - My gosh.

1168
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,594
Did it hurt?

1169
00:52:49,595 --> 00:52:51,535
Your nails are dropping like flies.

1170
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:54,734
What? They're disposable after one use. Where are they?

1171
00:52:55,274 --> 00:52:56,605
Thank you.

1172
00:53:00,274 --> 00:53:02,975
We will now begin the vote.

1173
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:05,614
Gosh, I don't know.

1174
00:53:05,984 --> 00:53:07,484
- The fun one ought to win. - I'm not sure.

1175
00:53:08,154 --> 00:53:09,214
I'll go to the wisdom tooth girl.

1176
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:11,654
Her style is so unique.

1177
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:14,424
It was the first time people started to sing along.

1178
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:17,463
People were quite responsive when she rapped.

1179
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:18,625
So I was a bit worried.

1180
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:22,794
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1181
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:29,475
(Starter: 41 votes, Opposer: 17 votes)

1182
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,345
(Starter 34 wins.)

1183
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:32,904
She lost, but she put up a good fight.

1184
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:35,114
But clearly, he was a better rapper.

1185
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:39,284
She doesn't seem serious about rapping like other people.

1186
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:41,213
If she was in pain because she got her wisdom tooth out,

1187
00:53:41,214 --> 00:53:42,514
she should go to a dental clinic.

1188
00:53:42,515 --> 00:53:44,384
I think she came to the wrong place.

1189
00:53:44,924 --> 00:53:48,794
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper 45's mask.

1190
00:53:53,765 --> 00:53:54,864
Hello.

1191
00:53:56,294 --> 00:53:57,434
Who is she?

1192
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:58,605
I can't wait to find out who she is.

1193
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:05,504
Who is that?

1194
00:54:05,505 --> 00:54:06,674
(COCONA)

1195
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:08,514
(COCONA)

1196
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:10,114
- COCONA? - COCONA?

1197
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:11,844
- Do you know her? - No.

1198
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:13,384
Thank you.

1199
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:15,454
Hello.

1200
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,284
I'm an optimistic musician...

1201
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:20,325
who stays true to her music. My name is COCONA.

1202
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:25,064
The winning rapper, 34. Take off your mask.

1203
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,034
(ZENE THE ZILLA)

1204
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,994
- ZENE THE ZILLA. - Hello.

1205
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:31,034
(ZENE THE ZILLA)

1206
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:33,935
She took out her wisdom tooth? I wonder how much pain she was in.

1207
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:36,705
We'll proceed with the next battle.

1208
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:40,814
Anyone who wants to rap first, please come up to the stage.

1209
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:43,145
Please come up to the stage.

1210
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,384
Oh, no.

1211
00:54:45,544 --> 00:54:46,584
Gosh, he looks like a bear.

1212
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,614
- There he is. - Gosh.

1213
00:54:49,884 --> 00:54:51,225
He looks big.

1214
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:53,384
My gosh.

1215
00:54:56,154 --> 00:54:57,495
- What? - What?

1216
00:54:58,964 --> 00:55:02,234
Well, this is a nerve-racking moment.

1217
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:05,233
What? I think I know who this is.

1218
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:07,004
I think it's Mills.

1219
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:08,435
It was impossible not to recognize him.

1220
00:55:09,004 --> 00:55:10,204
Every rapper must be able to.

1221
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:11,375
How could anyone not recognize him?

1222
00:55:12,245 --> 00:55:13,673
- That must be Don Mills, right? - Yes.

1223
00:55:13,674 --> 00:55:15,814
Given the build, it has to be Don Mills.

1224
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,484
It's Don Mills, right?

1225
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:22,354
Hello, I'm Don Mills.

1226
00:55:22,355 --> 00:55:23,415
Nice to meet you, everyone.

1227
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:25,023
(This talented rapper...)

1228
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:27,325
(with tons of experience dominated the scene.)

1229
00:55:27,654 --> 00:55:31,165
(The master of infectious hooks is famous for his cheerful vibe.)

1230
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:34,864
My identity is a secret.

1231
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,205
My gosh. Come on.

1232
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:40,503
I didn't want my identity to be revealed.

1233
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,833
So I tried to hide it.

1234
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:43,943
But I couldn't help it. I spoke like my usual self.

1235
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:46,605
I'm envious. Everyone recognizes his voice.

1236
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:48,543
Anyone who wants to challenge this rapper,

1237
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:50,484
please come up to the stage.

1238
00:55:52,745 --> 00:55:54,254
That's so cool.

1239
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,923
It was clear to everyone that it was Don Mills.

1240
00:55:56,924 --> 00:55:59,484
Despite knowing that, he still went for it. How confident.

1241
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:01,125
I love his fighting spirit.

1242
00:56:01,654 --> 00:56:03,153
Actually, I'm a huge fan.

1243
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:04,363
Thank you.

1244
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:05,694
Let's have a good one.

1245
00:56:06,024 --> 00:56:07,193
Let's go!

1246
00:56:07,194 --> 00:56:09,265
- Let's go! - Gosh, he's got a nice attitude.

1247
00:56:09,464 --> 00:56:10,535
Ready.

1248
00:56:13,435 --> 00:56:14,435
Start.

1249
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,044
Let's go.

1250
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:21,274
Let's go.

1251
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,214
Hey, let's go.

1252
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,614
What?

1253
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:30,654
What did you do when I was on the move?

1254
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:32,324
- What? - Okay.

1255
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:34,095
What did you do when I was on the move?

1256
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:37,194
What did you do when I was on the move?

1257
00:56:38,694 --> 00:56:40,534
What did you do when I was on the move?

1258
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:42,794
Clickety-clack, you were holed up at home all day

1259
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:45,963
Your fingers are busy, flying on the keyboard

1260
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:49,075
For me, I've been stuck in reality, paying off my loan

1261
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:52,305
I'd rather forget unfamiliar words like rent and credit scores

1262
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,645
They say starting is half the battle

1263
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:56,674
But it's been over ten years I've been playing this game

1264
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:58,785
My monthly royalties? They just make me sigh

1265
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:01,713
My monthly royalties? They just make me sigh

1266
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:03,314
My monthly royalties? They just make me sigh

1267
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:06,354
My monthly royalties? They just make me sigh

1268
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:07,653
This makes no sense

1269
00:57:07,654 --> 00:57:08,894
People say it'll work out, but who are they kidding?

1270
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:10,964
Money is flowing out like the water from a broken jar

1271
00:57:11,364 --> 00:57:14,064
No one's to blame but yourself, What a fool you are

1272
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:17,404
This mindset won't get you paid

1273
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:20,535
You'll chase away the success even when you get close.

1274
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:23,774
Are you scared? Just do something and get over it

1275
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:26,645
What did you do when I was on the move?

1276
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:29,845
What did you do when I was on the move?

1277
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:33,084
What did you do when I was on the move?

1278
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:36,213
What did you do when I was on the move?

1279
00:57:36,214 --> 00:57:38,583
Hey.

1280
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:40,294
- Mills is going to do it. - What was that?

1281
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:42,355
- Mills is going to do it. - What was that?

1282
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,664
- What? - Hey.

1283
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,064
- Mills is going to do it. - What did you say?

1284
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:46,564
Hey.

1285
00:57:47,694 --> 00:57:48,765
Thank you.

1286
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:50,305
He has no intention of hiding his identity.

1287
00:57:50,364 --> 00:57:51,934
He must find it funny too.

1288
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,133
"Mills is going to do it?"

1289
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:54,503
He made it so obvious.

1290
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,134
Gosh, I have no idea who he is.

1291
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,904
I thought that he was losing it.

1292
00:57:59,845 --> 00:58:02,374
All right, give me the beat.

1293
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,415
Let's go.

1294
00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:10,154
What?

1295
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:16,023
You guys keep asking me, so who's stepping up first?

1296
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:17,363
With one shot, your mind goes blank

1297
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:18,423
- Don Mills might lose. - Know your place

1298
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:19,793
I'm grinding like a dog

1299
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:21,633
Every step I took has put me on the right path

1300
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:23,064
- I've never lost my way, so what? - He's crushing it.

1301
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:26,863
Your future is bleak, you're stepping on thin ice

1302
00:58:26,864 --> 00:58:28,673
You can't gauge the depth below

1303
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:29,903
Darkness fills your eyes under your feet

1304
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:31,574
I'm balling like Embiid from Philly, that's how I'm feeling

1305
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:33,744
It's too late, defeat suits you

1306
00:58:33,745 --> 00:58:36,713
Oh, man, I get the hotheads to sit down

1307
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,043
I baptize them in flames with oil over their heads

1308
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,684
When you complain, I keep stoking the fire

1309
00:58:39,685 --> 00:58:40,884
- Who is that? - I have no idea.

1310
00:58:41,754 --> 00:58:43,983
Everything splits in two, XO just like tic-tac-toe.

1311
00:58:43,984 --> 00:58:45,685
You can't be my opponent

1312
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:50,863
- You'd better say my name right - Okay.

1313
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,863
Fight, keep it on sight, come at me

1314
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:55,293
This is the highlight, double time it, keep the rhyme tight

1315
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:56,363
If you come at me thinking we're equal

1316
00:58:56,364 --> 00:58:57,464
- Here's what I'll say to you, bye - Don Mills is in big trouble.

1317
00:58:57,765 --> 00:59:01,204
Your future is bleak, you're stepping on thin ice

1318
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,974
They don't want me, but I'm stunning, man

1319
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:04,504
They don't want me, but I'm stunning

1320
00:59:04,805 --> 00:59:05,975
- Oh, my. - My gosh.

1321
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:08,875
Sorry, Don Mills.

1322
00:59:10,015 --> 00:59:11,114
Good work.

1323
00:59:12,944 --> 00:59:14,515
The battle has ended.

1324
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:18,024
Don Mills is famous, and everyone knows him.

1325
00:59:18,754 --> 00:59:20,454
But he leaned on Don Mills...

1326
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:22,253
while doing his own thing.

1327
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:25,625
I thought number 11 was gutsy.

1328
00:59:25,825 --> 00:59:27,693
We will now begin the vote.

1329
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,164
(The voting begins.)

1330
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:30,364
My gosh, this one is hard.

1331
00:59:30,464 --> 00:59:31,904
I'm kind of torn.

1332
00:59:32,805 --> 00:59:34,475
- I don't know whom to vote. - Right.

1333
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,734
There's nothing I can do.

1334
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:39,404
I still think Don Mills did a bit better.

1335
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:41,314
It would've been better if he didn't mess up.

1336
00:59:43,274 --> 00:59:45,884
The 1st part was great, but the 2nd part was a bit lacking.

1337
00:59:46,145 --> 00:59:47,754
The vote is now closed.

1338
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:50,154
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1339
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:54,955
What? He lost?

1340
00:59:55,754 --> 00:59:59,464
(Starter: 24 votes, Opposer: 34 votes)

1341
01:00:00,194 --> 01:00:01,495
His mistake must have affected the result.

1342
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:04,334
Take off the losing rapper,

1343
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,234
Rapper 14's mask.

1344
01:00:10,004 --> 01:00:11,444
- Good work. - Good work.

1345
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:15,043
Thank you.

1346
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,543
(Don Mills)

1347
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:18,444
- Oh, no. Don Mills! - Thank you.

1348
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:20,613
I think I'm off to a great start.

1349
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:23,923
My performances will improve as the show goes on.

1350
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,284
I'll end up winning the whole thing.

1351
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:26,685
That's my big picture.

1352
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:29,754
The winning rapper, 11.

1353
01:00:30,154 --> 01:00:31,464
Take off your mask.

1354
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,264
Who is this?

1355
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:34,294
Who's he?

1356
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:37,265
Who is he?

1357
01:00:44,904 --> 01:00:46,805
(Daniel Jikal)

1358
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,313
(Daniel Jikal)

1359
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:49,744
- Daniel Jikal. - I see.

1360
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:50,883
Daniel Jikal?

1361
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:51,914
You know him?

1362
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,044
I've never seen him before.

1363
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:54,915
Daniel Jikal.

1364
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:57,225
My head went blank.

1365
01:00:58,625 --> 01:00:59,754
I don't remember his name.

1366
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:02,495
Jack Kiri.. Or something.

1367
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:03,754
Oh, no.

1368
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,224
Hello. I'm from the States.

1369
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:09,495
I'm with P NATION, which is run by PSY.

1370
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:12,004
I'm a rookie artist, Daniel Jikal. Nice to meet you.

1371
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,875
Wait. Isn't he from P NATION?

1372
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,205
P NATION.

1373
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:21,015
A solo artist from P NATION.

1374
01:01:21,714 --> 01:01:23,015
- A solo artist? - Yes.

1375
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:26,345
I'm seeing many new faces.

1376
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:28,515
Actually,

1377
01:01:29,484 --> 01:01:30,584
I thought...

1378
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:34,625
he was Swings.

1379
01:01:35,055 --> 01:01:36,523
(Actually, I'm a huge fan.)

1380
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:38,024
(He exchanged greetings while mistaking the identity.)

1381
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,765
But he wasn't Swings.

1382
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:42,963
I think everyone here is quite objective.

1383
01:01:42,964 --> 01:01:44,564
They're only judging based on the performances.

1384
01:01:45,904 --> 01:01:48,075
We'll proceed with the next battle.

1385
01:01:52,845 --> 01:01:55,645
(Rapper 23 is the starter this time.)

1386
01:01:58,345 --> 01:01:59,415
Let's go.

1387
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:01,254
Before accepting a challenger,

1388
01:02:01,314 --> 01:02:03,584
you can address the group.

1389
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:05,984
Well,

1390
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:08,424
I'm looking for someone who will make a beautiful memory with me.

1391
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,424
I'm looking for someone who will make a beautiful memory with me.

1392
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:14,834
(Bowing)

1393
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:18,305
(Ignoring)

1394
01:02:19,464 --> 01:02:20,575
Who is that?

1395
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:21,904
I don't like him.

1396
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:26,645
You may address the starting rapper.

1397
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:29,444
I don't want to.

1398
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,244
I don't want to.

1399
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,915
- My gosh. - He doesn't want to.

1400
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:36,015
- The battle... - Oh, my.

1401
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,724
will begin now.

1402
01:02:37,725 --> 01:02:39,523
I've been watching him.

1403
01:02:39,524 --> 01:02:40,693
I'm really curious.

1404
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:42,455
- He acts so cool. - Ready.

1405
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:43,964
I'm serious.

1406
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:45,495
Ready.

1407
01:02:48,694 --> 01:02:49,694
Start.

1408
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:52,004
Okay. Let's go.

1409
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:08,414
Yes, I'm smoking a pack too much

1410
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:10,184
I'm walking outside, don't be playing

1411
01:03:10,185 --> 01:03:12,153
I'm winning all games, going crazy

1412
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:13,883
My money is the greenest salad

1413
01:03:13,884 --> 01:03:15,894
These fools all come from the same package

1414
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:17,693
They're all the same

1415
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:19,624
Don't waste my time, I've got missions

1416
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:21,394
I'm high up on the chain, at the highest with two million

1417
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:22,594
Yes, I'm back on the street

1418
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:26,164
These fools keep talking about stupid stuff

1419
01:03:26,165 --> 01:03:28,034
You keep chasing the money

1420
01:03:28,035 --> 01:03:29,934
Just no one will stick with you

1421
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:31,844
Just no one will stand by you

1422
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:33,704
You'll have to ask her to stay

1423
01:03:33,705 --> 01:03:35,543
You'll have to make something of yourself

1424
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:37,814
But I don't need to buy the lotto

1425
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:45,125
You, L-B-A-K, we're going right now

1426
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,625
Thank you.

1427
01:03:51,864 --> 01:03:53,095
Thank you.

1428
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:56,095
- Thank you. - His vibe was cool.

1429
01:03:56,395 --> 01:03:57,605
It was hip.

1430
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,734
That was weak, for real.

1431
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,475
That was weak, for real.

1432
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:08,044
Let's go.

1433
01:04:15,654 --> 01:04:16,714
What?

1434
01:04:17,285 --> 01:04:19,625
What?

1435
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,724
Life is too short, I'm going to give it my best

1436
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,224
So I won't have any regrets even if I die

1437
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:25,664
I've got to keep my soul, I can't sell my soul

1438
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:27,333
I sold everything but my soul

1439
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:29,063
This is the life I chose, it was my call

1440
01:04:29,064 --> 01:04:30,733
I changed a lot after I failed high school

1441
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:32,333
I've got to take the risk, I've got to flick the wrist

1442
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:34,403
To make big money, I can't play by the rules

1443
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,003
She wants my wood, her name is Vivian

1444
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:38,074
She tells me not to leave yet

1445
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:39,874
She tells me not to leave yet

1446
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,644
I tell her what's up because I have to make it big

1447
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:43,244
It's a pity, but there's nothing I can do

1448
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:44,844
I don't want to be on TV

1449
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:46,443
Because people will see my face

1450
01:04:46,444 --> 01:04:48,814
I only want to do whatever I want

1451
01:04:49,754 --> 01:04:51,324
I pop some Zs, just so I can sleep

1452
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:53,023
White teeth ain't no

1453
01:04:53,024 --> 01:04:54,624
Time, that's all I need

1454
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,324
Or witch, hold my microphone

1455
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,994
You guys are just wannabes

1456
01:04:57,995 --> 01:04:59,624
My life is about to get good

1457
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,264
I'm a little boy with some big dreams

1458
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:03,063
I just want to get geeked

1459
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:04,764
My bad like Mona Lisa

1460
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:07,773
I want a neck piece from nature that's more expensive than yours

1461
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:11,074
The whole body turns into a freezer, cocaine and Nike on my feet

1462
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,044
Step on the blood with my fresh kicks

1463
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:16,245
Step on the blood with my fresh kicks

1464
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:20,044
Step on the blood with my fresh kicks

1465
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:27,924
(The battle between Starter 23 and Opposer 27 ends.)

1466
01:05:33,595 --> 01:05:35,265
To be honest, I was furious.

1467
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,964
He didn't even know me. How could he put his hand on me?

1468
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:40,334
It was really annoying.

1469
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,805
We will now begin the vote.

1470
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,044
Let's go.

1471
01:05:46,805 --> 01:05:48,075
I don't know whom to vote for.

1472
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,144
It's harder to vote as we continue.

1473
01:05:50,145 --> 01:05:51,584
- That's right. - Right?

1474
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,515
The voting is now closed.

1475
01:05:54,355 --> 01:05:55,684
This looks even.

1476
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:56,915
- It looks even, right? - Seven, eight...

1477
01:05:56,955 --> 01:05:57,955
It does.

1478
01:05:58,185 --> 01:05:59,984
When I saw how many people were standing behind him,

1479
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:01,125
I thought it wouldn't be easy.

1480
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:02,555
I was confused.

1481
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,024
I think it may be a tie or I could turn the table around.

1482
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:07,634
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1483
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:26,745
(Starter: 26 votes, Opposer: 32 votes)

1484
01:06:26,915 --> 01:06:28,984
(Opposer 27 wins.)

1485
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,383
Having good manners is really important.

1486
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:32,753
I really hated how number 23 touched number 27 at the end.

1487
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:34,954
Why did he act so recklessly like that?

1488
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:36,225
That was disappointing.

1489
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:38,794
Take off...

1490
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,423
Rapper 23's mask.

1491
01:06:40,424 --> 01:06:41,995
(Remove the losing rapper, Rapper 23's mask.)

1492
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:47,705
(MASON HOME)

1493
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:49,804
(MASON HOME)

1494
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,504
- Who's that? - MASON HOME.

1495
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:53,475
- He belongs to a hip-hop team. - I don't know him.

1496
01:06:53,645 --> 01:06:55,313
Everyone from OKASHII is here.

1497
01:06:55,314 --> 01:06:56,345
The whole crew is here.

1498
01:06:57,444 --> 01:06:59,083
(OKASHII is currently the most popular hip-hop crew...)

1499
01:06:59,084 --> 01:07:01,154
(for their trendy tracks.)

1500
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,484
I was surprised that OKASHII came.

1501
01:07:03,814 --> 01:07:05,225
They're really hot right now.

1502
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:06,524
He wasn't so good.

1503
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,523
I didn't know who he was...

1504
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,054
even after taking off his mask.

1505
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:11,864
So I thought I picked the right opponent.

1506
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:17,064
The winning rapper, 27. Take off your mask.

1507
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,034
Shy.

1508
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:22,233
(ShyboiiTobii)

1509
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:24,205
Hey, shy, ShyboiiTobii.

1510
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:27,244
He was ShyboiiTobii.

1511
01:07:27,245 --> 01:07:28,444
Oh, shoot.

1512
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:33,443
Hello, I won the Rookie Award in Korean Hip-hop Awards this year.

1513
01:07:33,444 --> 01:07:35,515
I'm ShyboiiTobii. It's nice to meet you.

1514
01:07:36,314 --> 01:07:37,983
(XWALLY, ShyboiiTobii, and Tray B were nominated for the award.)

1515
01:07:37,984 --> 01:07:39,855
(ShyboiiTobii beat the contenders and won the Rookie Award.)

1516
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,293
(He's a crazy rookie. I look forward to his album.)

1517
01:07:42,294 --> 01:07:43,454
(He's really good. I can't say anything else.)

1518
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:44,594
(This is real hip-hop. I've been waiting for a day like this.)

1519
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:47,693
ShyboiiTobii is the leader of rappers these days.

1520
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:50,094
I'm surprised to see that he tries new things that way.

1521
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:52,334
He's kind of on another level.

1522
01:07:53,004 --> 01:07:54,375
He's really good.

1523
01:07:55,975 --> 01:07:59,075
Please stay in your position.

1524
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:01,774
ShyboiiTobii lied that he wasn't participating.

1525
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:04,015
He asked ShyboiiTobii, and he said he wasn't.

1526
01:08:04,174 --> 01:08:05,214
- Really? - Yes.

1527
01:08:06,714 --> 01:08:08,653
Honestly, I can't trust you.

1528
01:08:08,654 --> 01:08:10,784
What do you mean? Do you think I'd diss you?

1529
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:12,224
Yes, I do.

1530
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:14,294
I said I wouldn't.

1531
01:08:14,455 --> 01:08:16,695
Darn it. He doesn't get it at all.

1532
01:08:17,765 --> 01:08:20,464
The beef challenge starts soon.

1533
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:24,565
The selected rapper is ShyboiiTobii.

1534
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:27,634
- Is ShyboiiTobii crying? - Yes.

1535
01:08:28,735 --> 01:08:29,975
He's so young.

1536
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,844
The lineup is so outstanding.

1537
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,214
I know. Most of them are named rappers.

1538
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:56,833
Let's go

1539
01:08:56,834 --> 01:08:57,864
Everybody kings and queens

1540
01:08:57,865 --> 01:08:59,964
But guess I'm going to have to step in the ring

1541
01:09:00,164 --> 01:09:01,503
The ring doesn't suit you

1542
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,573
- Your song doesn't have any meaning - It's him.

1543
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:05,203
I'll have to teach a thing or two

1544
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:07,043
Everybody's on the same stuff

1545
01:09:07,044 --> 01:09:08,814
The boring flow and lyrics

1546
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:10,073
You better cover your flows

1547
01:09:10,074 --> 01:09:13,145
You hide you're clumsy and stuff a fancy painting in the song paper

1548
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,883
You pay attention to choreography only and lose the musical value

1549
01:09:16,884 --> 01:09:20,083
If the song only has a vibe not content, it's no use

1550
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:22,024
You prick up yourself with clothes that don't fit

1551
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:24,094
The fit matters more than what's inside

1552
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,724
What's wrong with this world?

1553
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:27,194
What's wrong with you? Me?

1554
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:30,265
Rather than answering the question, show me my many mistakes

1555
01:09:30,695 --> 01:09:32,364
I know I'm not good enough, I make you feel tired

1556
01:09:32,365 --> 01:09:33,834
You're perfect and on the top tier

1557
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,604
I don't need such greed

1558
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:38,145
I only need a family

1559
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:41,944
Well done.

1560
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:43,314
He definitely has a good tone.

1561
01:09:43,315 --> 01:09:46,044
- Right. It's him. - That was great.

1562
01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:47,515
Anyone can tell.

1563
01:09:47,954 --> 01:09:50,783
The winning rapper, 32. Take off your mask.

1564
01:09:50,784 --> 01:09:51,824
(The winning rapper 32 takes off his mask.)

1565
01:09:57,355 --> 01:09:58,824
Owen.

1566
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:00,065
Owen.

1567
01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:01,634
- Yes! - Owen.

1568
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:05,364
I can recognize Owen only from his voice.

1569
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:07,704
- He has an ID on his neck. - He's unrivaled.

1570
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:10,134
Owen's rap was good, as expected.

1571
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:12,744
(Rapper 46 goes on to the stage.)

1572
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:14,475
DJ, beat drop.

1573
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:19,515
- Look - Let's go.

1574
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,414
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show

1575
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:23,913
He's different.

1576
01:10:23,914 --> 01:10:25,423
Sit back, relax, and look

1577
01:10:25,424 --> 01:10:26,753
It's him, right?

1578
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:28,793
Might just be another problem here

1579
01:10:28,794 --> 01:10:31,123
Everyone shows cheezy acting that seems so familiar

1580
01:10:31,124 --> 01:10:33,323
There's an atelier with a different spark in Mangwon

1581
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:35,934
It surely creates the best quality from South Korea

1582
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,564
Everyone is bling or pretends to be bling

1583
01:10:37,565 --> 01:10:38,604
He's skillful.

1584
01:10:38,605 --> 01:10:40,104
Wipe off all the nonsense, bus comp

1585
01:10:40,105 --> 01:10:42,673
You're a rock star who needs the camera on

1586
01:10:42,674 --> 01:10:44,904
You're a fake DJ with the line not connected

1587
01:10:44,905 --> 01:10:47,274
He's darn good.

1588
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:49,573
You're Jacks of all trades, You pretend to adopt

1589
01:10:49,574 --> 01:10:51,713
You're not good at rap, You're not good at singing

1590
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,283
Although your looks bloom, it will soon fall like cherry blossoms

1591
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:56,154
But I explode like Mount Vesuvius

1592
01:10:56,155 --> 01:10:58,684
Although I'm a bit slow, the structure is Fantastic Four

1593
01:10:58,685 --> 01:11:01,024
If you only think of collateral benefits, stop it now

1594
01:11:01,025 --> 01:11:03,623
Not many riches in the world and even less among creators

1595
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:04,624
Darn it

1596
01:11:05,865 --> 01:11:08,164
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show

1597
01:11:08,534 --> 01:11:10,364
He's good.

1598
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:13,365
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the darn show

1599
01:11:14,305 --> 01:11:16,033
Darn.

1600
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:17,804
- Gosh. - He's strong.

1601
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:19,304
He's amazing.

1602
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:20,573
Sexy rap.

1603
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:21,845
He's darn good.

1604
01:11:22,275 --> 01:11:25,645
The winning rapper, 46. Take off your mask.

1605
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:28,754
That's him.

1606
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,754
Right, Khundi Panda.

1607
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:36,453
- Panda. - Khundi Panda.

1608
01:11:36,454 --> 01:11:39,924
Of all the opponents, Khundai Panda. Darn it.

1609
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:43,934
I say the best verse was from Khundi Panda.

1610
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:46,305
It's legendary.

1611
01:11:48,074 --> 01:11:49,604
The show will hit the jackpot.

1612
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,204
The production crew cast strong ones.

1613
01:11:51,704 --> 01:11:54,814
I can't believe all these rappers are here.

1614
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:57,244
There were still so many rappers with a mask on.

1615
01:11:57,784 --> 01:12:00,284
Then how many good rappers are there?

1616
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:02,055
I'm doomed.

1617
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:04,985
We'll proceed with the next battle.

1618
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,854
Anyone who wants to rap first,

1619
01:12:09,855 --> 01:12:11,364
please come up to the stage.

1620
01:12:11,365 --> 01:12:12,424
Let's go.

1621
01:12:13,964 --> 01:12:15,234
It's nice to meet you, losers.

1622
01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:16,294
(It's nice to meet you, losers.)

1623
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:17,804
Goodness.

1624
01:12:17,805 --> 01:12:19,865
Oh, my.

1625
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,374
Can I perform one more time?

1626
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:23,534
Don't stop me. Darn it. I'm going to go on the stage.

1627
01:12:26,044 --> 01:12:29,914
Anyone who wants to challenge this rapper, please come up to the stage.

1628
01:12:32,784 --> 01:12:34,914
I guess you're feeling hot. I'll take off your mask.

1629
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,314
Darn.

1630
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:39,025
This is fun.

1631
01:12:39,525 --> 01:12:41,794
- Nice. - Darn.

1632
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:44,025
I'm curious. I'll slay you.

1633
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:46,293
Ready.

1634
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:48,963
- It's going to be fun. - All right. Let's see.

1635
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:49,994
Start.

1636
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:52,065
DJ run that stuff up

1637
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:56,974
It's messed up, brother, ride or die

1638
01:12:56,975 --> 01:12:58,144
You dig

1639
01:12:58,145 --> 01:13:01,174
This man does it for free, it's free

1640
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:07,314
I dress up like Uijeongbu High, I'm darn trendy

1641
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:10,154
I'm immature, I'm like a little kid

1642
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:12,724
I'm the bomb, and I'm about to blow up

1643
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:16,594
I'm a human landmine Call me D.I.L.F Dad I love to

1644
01:13:16,595 --> 01:13:19,663
Darn it, Set a yacht afloat on the Soyang Dam, homie

1645
01:13:19,664 --> 01:13:22,993
I ain't playing no games with you, I don't recommend making friends

1646
01:13:22,994 --> 01:13:26,003
Our relationship is cold and brutal I'm highly enriched uranium

1647
01:13:26,004 --> 01:13:29,203
My hobby is launching nuclear missiles, I'm from Baekdu bloodline

1648
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:32,203
Drop the bomb in this world

1649
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:35,243
I'm going to beat everyone in Seoul and Pyeongyang

1650
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,544
I'm going to empty the folders in your computers

1651
01:13:38,645 --> 01:13:41,913
If we fail, it's treason, if we succeed, it's revolution

1652
01:13:41,914 --> 01:13:44,555
I'm an older brother since I was young

1653
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:47,224
I'm a king, I'm the boss, Lee Kyoung Young

1654
01:13:47,225 --> 01:13:50,595
A lot of zeros in my account, I mark a dot under my eye like BIBI

1655
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:53,163
My chestnut jelly, Make fake gang, Kill them all

1656
01:13:53,164 --> 01:13:56,333
One, two, all right

1657
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:59,134
One, two, all right

1658
01:14:00,004 --> 01:14:02,605
Darn it. This is insane.

1659
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,704
His rap has so many punchlines.

1660
01:14:06,345 --> 01:14:08,174
It's full of wits.

1661
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,073
I'll start right away.

1662
01:14:10,074 --> 01:14:11,384
(I'll start right away.)

1663
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:16,155
The beat sounds nice.

1664
01:14:20,424 --> 01:14:23,423
I represent my city, My hometown is on the beat

1665
01:14:23,424 --> 01:14:26,024
I police the punks that ruin the ecosystem

1666
01:14:26,025 --> 01:14:28,564
Press F at the moment you're caught

1667
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:30,764
I find your location right away

1668
01:14:30,765 --> 01:14:33,203
I'm already waiting with my aim fixed

1669
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:35,804
I know the flow of your movement

1670
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,144
I'm calm like a captain, This is my passive

1671
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:40,503
Although I fight alone the cost of life is high like AP

1672
01:14:40,504 --> 01:14:41,743
Who is she? She's good.

1673
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:42,974
Better let up on me

1674
01:14:42,975 --> 01:14:45,383
I have accustomed moves The counterattack changes the angle

1675
01:14:45,384 --> 01:14:47,883
I stick to not riding although they treat me as a rebel

1676
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,083
Even if you push your way

1677
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,614
- You're just a loser to me - She's good.

1678
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,123
So even if you intervene I will step on it

1679
01:14:53,124 --> 01:14:55,524
You might know my ID but you can't trace my IP

1680
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:57,993
I squeeze through a gap when there's no chance of living

1681
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:01,534
You have no idea I turn the tables without a device, All Mighty

1682
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,294
I turn the tables, All Mighty

1683
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:07,305
She's good.

1684
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:10,305
Thank you.

1685
01:15:11,235 --> 01:15:13,145
- This is fun. - I like it.

1686
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:17,114
We will now begin the vote.

1687
01:15:17,115 --> 01:15:18,145
(The voting begins.)

1688
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,644
I can't decide. They were both good.

1689
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:22,054
- The vote begins. - They were both really good.

1690
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:23,284
I can't decide.

1691
01:15:23,555 --> 01:15:25,253
It was a battle between two spears.

1692
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,725
It depends on your taste, I guess.

1693
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:29,095
I thought hard when I chose one.

1694
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:30,954
I'm not sure.

1695
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:32,865
I don't know.

1696
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:34,794
It's a close match.

1697
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,565
(The vote is now closed.)

1698
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:39,164
I guess it's half and half.

1699
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:41,334
A tie? Is it our first tie?

1700
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:44,944
The vote result was neck and neck this time.

1701
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:46,775
(The vote result was neck and neck this time.)

1702
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:54,384
I guess it's half and half. He said it was neck and neck.

1703
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:57,615
- Is it a draw? - Who won?

1704
01:15:58,824 --> 01:16:01,953
(Starter 30 votes, opposer 28 votes)

1705
01:16:01,954 --> 01:16:04,525
(The starter rapper, 41 wins.)

1706
01:16:07,494 --> 01:16:11,034
I think it's a 1 or 2 vote difference.

1707
01:16:16,475 --> 01:16:19,244
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper 18's mask.

1708
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:22,015
Who's the female rapper? Is it someone I don't know?

1709
01:16:22,815 --> 01:16:23,874
Let's see who she is.

1710
01:16:31,214 --> 01:16:32,584
(Luci Gang)

1711
01:16:32,985 --> 01:16:34,923
It's Luci Gang.

1712
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,854
- Luci Gang. - Luci Gang!

1713
01:16:36,855 --> 01:16:38,194
- It's someone you like. - Gang.

1714
01:16:38,195 --> 01:16:40,725
- Luci Gang's good. - You're right. She's good.

1715
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:42,735
Hi.

1716
01:16:42,834 --> 01:16:44,534
Everyone in the underground knows me.

1717
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:45,764
It's me, Luci Gang.

1718
01:16:45,765 --> 01:16:47,663
Luci Gang is amazing. Even her live singing is good.

1719
01:16:47,664 --> 01:16:50,975
She's an artist with a strong personal color.

1720
01:16:51,475 --> 01:16:53,275
Darn it. I should've done better.

1721
01:16:53,874 --> 01:16:57,014
Rapper 41. Take off your mask.

1722
01:16:57,015 --> 01:16:58,514
- Do you know him? - The winning rapper,

1723
01:16:58,515 --> 01:17:00,044
- Do you know 41? - forty-one.

1724
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:09,854
(Chaboom)

1725
01:17:09,855 --> 01:17:12,025
- I'm his fan. - Chaboom!

1726
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:16,564
My goodness.

1727
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:17,934
(Chaboom)

1728
01:17:17,935 --> 01:17:20,435
- Let's go! - Chaboom!

1729
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:21,874
It's Chaboom.

1730
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,475
Darn, what the heck?

1731
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:25,873
(The center of attention...)

1732
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,975
(for Korean-style gangster rap, Rapper Chaboom)

1733
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,713
I had no idea he was Chaboom.

1734
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:33,784
Chaboom is a participant I didn't expect to see.

1735
01:17:33,985 --> 01:17:36,115
It left a big impression.

1736
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,654
Isn't it exciting to be able to...

1737
01:17:37,655 --> 01:17:39,624
attack someone right away...

1738
01:17:39,824 --> 01:17:40,924
with what I've got?

1739
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:45,924
(Mostly all of the rappers' identities have been revealed.)

1740
01:17:46,464 --> 01:17:48,934
Are there four left?

1741
01:17:48,935 --> 01:17:50,095
Or five?

1742
01:17:52,605 --> 01:17:54,534
We'll proceed with the next battle.

1743
01:17:57,935 --> 01:18:00,605
(Rapper 53 wants to rap first.)

1744
01:18:02,874 --> 01:18:04,645
Wait. That tattoo looks familiar.

1745
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:07,244
Anyone can come up to battle.

1746
01:18:15,555 --> 01:18:18,395
Let's wrap it up well and take the mask off quickly.

1747
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,765
She has a cool voice.

1748
01:18:22,435 --> 01:18:24,095
With that voice, she must be good.

1749
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,504
Cool. I like fights.

1750
01:18:27,664 --> 01:18:29,935
Rapper 54 is a woman, but she's taller.

1751
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:32,475
Don't say things like that.

1752
01:18:33,145 --> 01:18:34,174
Ready.

1753
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:38,145
Start.

1754
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:39,544
I'll start right away. Give me the beat.

1755
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:47,884
Let's go.

1756
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:51,963
I'm killing brown deer, I never drive, It was like cardio

1757
01:18:51,964 --> 01:18:55,564
It might not reach you, You know there's no negotiation here

1758
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:57,234
Keep your eyes open or you'll get run over

1759
01:18:57,235 --> 01:18:58,264
And you'll wish for it

1760
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:00,404
Being blinded by the flash of light means that's the light of ambition

1761
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:02,404
Cheese with the evil, I will bloom dark

1762
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,673
Who can resist? Apples with Adam and Eve

1763
01:19:04,674 --> 01:19:06,543
Borrow a 100,000 dollars, you're still a commoner

1764
01:19:06,544 --> 01:19:08,614
Borrow one million dollars, you're a criminal

1765
01:19:08,615 --> 01:19:10,274
Borrow ten million dollars, and what are you?

1766
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:12,444
I dream again, The cause of my narcolepsy was this

1767
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:14,583
And it messed up the place, I don't even need to analyze

1768
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:17,154
Don't be considerate of me, That's better manners

1769
01:19:17,155 --> 01:19:19,054
Go back to when I was a student and tell myself,

1770
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:21,224
"Like prince, that is an elephant"

1771
01:19:21,225 --> 01:19:23,293
Yes, everything is the same

1772
01:19:23,294 --> 01:19:25,364
Everyone is living with a mask on, I'm No Face

1773
01:19:25,365 --> 01:19:27,293
Hiding is comfortable like a fool

1774
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:29,364
I bite and tear you apart first, It's already an apocalypse

1775
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:30,463
Nothing can be done in this era of hatred

1776
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:31,464
Who is the villain?

1777
01:19:31,465 --> 01:19:33,663
Swim down and bury them at the bottom of the deep sea

1778
01:19:33,664 --> 01:19:35,703
Leave them and swim up

1779
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,874
There's no change in the future

1780
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:42,074
His body identified who he was.

1781
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,243
He's iconic.

1782
01:19:44,244 --> 01:19:46,214
- That was clean. - How peaceful.

1783
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,253
He was the definition of clean.

1784
01:19:48,254 --> 01:19:49,384
Give me the beat.

1785
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:53,754
I say

1786
01:19:56,254 --> 01:19:57,324
It's Lee Young Ji.

1787
01:19:58,124 --> 01:19:59,464
Isn't this a tanghulu-type beat?

1788
01:20:00,494 --> 01:20:01,764
Party is over

1789
01:20:01,765 --> 01:20:04,365
You've got no more customers, so go catch the flies

1790
01:20:04,664 --> 01:20:06,764
Rather than being caught in love I can't buy

1791
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:09,633
I smoke a lot like I've got a hundred lungs

1792
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:11,873
I've come, and all the jerks are in trouble

1793
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:14,474
A debauchee who has never performed on an underground stage

1794
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:17,315
How they act with the rookie spotlight makes me laugh

1795
01:20:18,044 --> 01:20:19,243
- I drive it into them - Nice.

1796
01:20:19,244 --> 01:20:20,444
I shoot a bullet into their tongue

1797
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:21,783
It might be better breathing heated air

1798
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:22,913
I suck in the familiar air

1799
01:20:22,914 --> 01:20:25,083
It's crazy, emitting smoke

1800
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:27,753
It's crazy, emitting smoke

1801
01:20:27,754 --> 01:20:30,024
My fuel efficiency is great, always full of gas

1802
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,054
- I'm stuffed - What?

1803
01:20:31,055 --> 01:20:32,293
With the artist's drinking table

1804
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:33,864
A fairy glass is in my hand before I know it

1805
01:20:33,865 --> 01:20:36,594
My camouflage covers up popular music

1806
01:20:36,595 --> 01:20:37,764
Please fix yourself up

1807
01:20:37,765 --> 01:20:39,764
Your inside and outside are different from mine

1808
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:42,434
The media field is stinking with rotting corpses

1809
01:20:42,435 --> 01:20:44,703
I've got latta, my artistic framework

1810
01:20:44,704 --> 01:20:47,944
Do you have money ready? Shoulder the cost of my strong will

1811
01:20:47,945 --> 01:20:49,444
We won't put up with it

1812
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:51,114
One hundred thousand dollars per capita isn't enough

1813
01:20:51,115 --> 01:20:53,913
The seller sets the price, but nobody wants me

1814
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:56,654
The TV show that disgusted you yesterday

1815
01:20:56,655 --> 01:20:59,924
Becomes tasty when it becomes my business, come mucho

1816
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:03,453
- Yes. - "Come mucho."

1817
01:21:03,454 --> 01:21:04,595
I'm going to that side.

1818
01:21:05,025 --> 01:21:06,095
That was the bomb.

1819
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:10,793
She made some sexy music. I like that.

1820
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:11,864
I like that too.

1821
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:12,935
Who is she?

1822
01:21:13,004 --> 01:21:14,004
Do you know her?

1823
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:15,604
Do you know her?

1824
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:17,533
Gosh, I got captivated.

1825
01:21:17,534 --> 01:21:20,844
Someone rapping like her was new.

1826
01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:23,374
We will now begin the vote.

1827
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:26,283
Rapper 53 had better techniques,

1828
01:21:26,284 --> 01:21:28,214
but Rapper 54 was more interesting.

1829
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,414
She's good.

1830
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:30,815
Low-key.

1831
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:34,724
I was kind of fired up.

1832
01:21:34,725 --> 01:21:36,954
She made the sound sticky-icky.

1833
01:21:37,155 --> 01:21:40,765
(Starter loses with 19 votes. Opposer wins with 39 votes.)

1834
01:21:41,124 --> 01:21:42,864
(Opposer, Rapper 54, wins.)

1835
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:44,735
Good.

1836
01:21:45,204 --> 01:21:46,503
She was bound to get more votes.

1837
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:48,333
It's the difference in style.

1838
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:49,774
I'm not saying Rapper 53 was bad.

1839
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:52,203
Rapper 54 prepared something that grabbed...

1840
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:53,743
people's attention.

1841
01:21:53,744 --> 01:21:54,904
It was inevitable.

1842
01:21:54,905 --> 01:21:56,413
Rapper 54 was great.

1843
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:59,244
Take off the losing rapper,

1844
01:21:59,584 --> 01:22:01,015
Rapper 53's mask.

1845
01:22:08,655 --> 01:22:10,354
(Hash Swan)

1846
01:22:10,355 --> 01:22:11,453
- Gosh. - Hash.

1847
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:12,993
He still looks very young.

1848
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,225
Hash Swan. Right.

1849
01:22:14,525 --> 01:22:15,794
It's him.

1850
01:22:16,964 --> 01:22:18,663
I love Hash Swan.

1851
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:20,334
He's an artist I like.

1852
01:22:20,765 --> 01:22:22,634
I was happy to see him.

1853
01:22:23,504 --> 01:22:27,074
The winning rapper, 54. Take off your mask.

1854
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:29,945
I'm curious. I want to know who she is.

1855
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:31,074
Who is she?

1856
01:22:34,445 --> 01:22:35,515
Who is it?

1857
01:22:35,815 --> 01:22:37,355
(Hippie Kunda)

1858
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:40,953
Hippie Kunda?

1859
01:22:40,954 --> 01:22:42,595
(Hippie Kunda)

1860
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:44,454
- Hippie Kunda? - Hippie Kunda?

1861
01:22:45,464 --> 01:22:47,824
- Hippie Kunda? - Is it like Khundi Panda?

1862
01:22:47,865 --> 01:22:48,865
- Hippie Kunda. - Hippie Kunda.

1863
01:22:48,866 --> 01:22:50,964
Her name is similar to Khundi Panda.

1864
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:52,133
- Do you know her? - What?

1865
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:53,765
- Do you know her? - No.

1866
01:22:54,105 --> 01:22:55,105
Who is she?

1867
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:56,935
I don't know. I've never seen her before.

1868
01:22:57,805 --> 01:23:02,073
Hi. I'm Hippie Kunda who is in charge of the rap and artwork...

1869
01:23:02,074 --> 01:23:04,945
for Korea's mixed hip-hop duo 99' Nasty Kidz.

1870
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:08,384
She's someone who knows how to rap instinctively.

1871
01:23:08,615 --> 01:23:11,754
It's my first time meeting Hippie Kunda.

1872
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:14,324
She shocked me.

1873
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:16,323
I bet she'll be good at music.

1874
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,595
Hippie Kunda the dark horse.

1875
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,323
She's a new face.

1876
01:23:19,324 --> 01:23:21,095
Totally. Nice.

1877
01:23:24,195 --> 01:23:28,204
Anyone who wants to rap first, please come up to the stage.

1878
01:23:31,435 --> 01:23:34,644
(After a long wait,)

1879
01:23:34,645 --> 01:23:35,913
(Rapper 19 takes the stage.)

1880
01:23:35,914 --> 01:23:39,685
Before accepting the challenge, please say a word.

1881
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:46,923
He should've turned his thumb down,

1882
01:23:46,924 --> 01:23:48,055
even if it was obvious. Right?

1883
01:23:48,754 --> 01:23:50,524
Anyone who wants to challenge this rapper,

1884
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,395
please come up to the stage.

1885
01:24:01,634 --> 01:24:03,004
I want to take off the mask and become comfortable.

1886
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,275
Let's do this.

1887
01:24:04,735 --> 01:24:06,044
I get him.

1888
01:24:06,605 --> 01:24:09,574
We'll proceed with the battle.

1889
01:24:09,845 --> 01:24:10,845
Ready.

1890
01:24:13,884 --> 01:24:14,884
Start.

1891
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:16,555
Let's go.

1892
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:20,025
Bring the volume up.

1893
01:24:30,695 --> 01:24:34,404
I don't feel anything, I've been full of anger recently

1894
01:24:34,405 --> 01:24:35,703
Be more honest

1895
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:38,133
Just say the only reason is for money

1896
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:40,304
That jerk is a hypocrite and a liar

1897
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:41,774
Get caught, and you're dead

1898
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,014
I take my faith piece off my neck

1899
01:24:43,015 --> 01:24:45,484
And toss it away in hopes you'll listen to me

1900
01:24:45,485 --> 01:24:47,344
Not you, jerk, you're to rest in peace

1901
01:24:47,345 --> 01:24:49,114
Eat this even if you die

1902
01:24:49,115 --> 01:24:51,054
Rockstar life, I wear your pants down

1903
01:24:51,055 --> 01:24:52,883
My Amiri is from Beverly

1904
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:54,724
Those who are bothered, remember this

1905
01:24:54,725 --> 01:24:56,454
- We have someone good. - I'll show you I'm speedy

1906
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,423
There's no peace here, you stupid

1907
01:24:58,424 --> 01:25:00,293
To realize just now that I'm crazy

1908
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:02,133
It's no cartoon or Disney

1909
01:25:02,134 --> 01:25:03,993
It's plain obvious you are all geeking

1910
01:25:03,994 --> 01:25:05,764
I did it for the team and my twin

1911
01:25:05,765 --> 01:25:07,633
I learned the K-town Street late

1912
01:25:07,634 --> 01:25:09,503
Not for the meme, no need for scheming

1913
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,434
Keep it 100, you know what I mean

1914
01:25:11,435 --> 01:25:13,043
I wear several rings and miss none

1915
01:25:13,044 --> 01:25:15,043
Just leave, there is no goodbye or kissing

1916
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:17,275
Working more and more with no weekend

1917
01:25:21,084 --> 01:25:22,615
That was clean and amazing.

1918
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:23,883
- It was tight. - Yes.

1919
01:25:23,884 --> 01:25:25,155
- That was intense. - It was no joke.

1920
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:28,555
Give me the beat.

1921
01:25:39,865 --> 01:25:42,604
Take a sip drip bish, Yes, I'm on the way

1922
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:45,474
I don't need it, shut it up Who dare judge me?

1923
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:48,344
Even your mother wants to see me

1924
01:25:48,345 --> 01:25:51,073
Light a cigarette and drink another glass

1925
01:25:51,074 --> 01:25:53,985
Yes, I'm back, I went astray, but wait

1926
01:25:54,044 --> 01:25:56,753
I need an oxygen tank, I'll soon leave, I faded it

1927
01:25:56,754 --> 01:25:59,654
Get drunk, get lost, and Jack Daniel's

1928
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:02,423
It kills my brain, Take my card before paying

1929
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:05,194
Every single one wants me to dance as they want

1930
01:26:05,195 --> 01:26:08,394
But I don't know, the evil being talks to me through the mirror

1931
01:26:08,395 --> 01:26:09,764
What are you talking about? My head is swimming

1932
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:11,094
I can't hear you

1933
01:26:11,095 --> 01:26:12,934
The ceiling is spinning, the walls are tightening in

1934
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:13,935
It's not bad

1935
01:26:13,936 --> 01:26:15,264
Take it all out

1936
01:26:15,265 --> 01:26:16,934
Stack on my dizzy head

1937
01:26:16,935 --> 01:26:18,743
There's spit on the ground, so dodge it on your own

1938
01:26:18,744 --> 01:26:19,844
I don't know, I'm faded it

1939
01:26:19,845 --> 01:26:21,604
Okay, get lost, move aside, and straighten up

1940
01:26:21,605 --> 01:26:22,974
Yes, I don't need any friends

1941
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:24,444
Okay, get lost, move aside

1942
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,384
Eat them all, stack on stack

1943
01:26:34,884 --> 01:26:35,994
What a shame.

1944
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:39,025
Thank you.

1945
01:26:43,095 --> 01:26:44,634
The battle has ended.

1946
01:26:45,704 --> 01:26:49,333
Please stand behind the rapper who has done better...

1947
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:51,374
in your opinion.

1948
01:26:52,845 --> 01:26:54,204
(The voting begins.)

1949
01:26:59,345 --> 01:27:00,384
Oh, my gosh.

1950
01:27:01,044 --> 01:27:02,913
- Oh, no. That's... - What now?

1951
01:27:02,914 --> 01:27:04,615
- What's he going to do? - That's bad.

1952
01:27:05,155 --> 01:27:08,485
Isn't this the lowest ever?

1953
01:27:09,994 --> 01:27:11,054
Only one?

1954
01:27:11,055 --> 01:27:13,624
I think it's the biggest difference.

1955
01:27:13,824 --> 01:27:15,895
He must feel...

1956
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:19,264
Earlier, I realized...

1957
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:21,633
if my opponent has overwhelmingly many behind him,

1958
01:27:21,634 --> 01:27:23,633
- it's humiliating. - Right.

1959
01:27:23,634 --> 01:27:25,744
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1960
01:27:28,074 --> 01:27:29,414
He won.

1961
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:32,044
(Starter 19 wins.)

1962
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:36,555
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper 48's mask.

1963
01:27:37,454 --> 01:27:39,884
- Who is it? - I wonder who it is.

1964
01:27:40,584 --> 01:27:41,725
I have no idea.

1965
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:45,793
Oh, my... What?

1966
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:47,293
No way.

1967
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:49,134
- No way. - I can't believe it.

1968
01:27:49,494 --> 01:27:52,905
(The losing rapper, 48, takes off his mask.)

1969
01:27:54,865 --> 01:27:56,904
Oh, my... What?

1970
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:59,043
- It's PUNCHNELLO. - PUNCHNELLO is here too.

1971
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:00,044
(PUNCHNELLO)

1972
01:28:00,445 --> 01:28:04,573
(With his flashy rap skills and overwhelming stage presence,)

1973
01:28:04,574 --> 01:28:08,413
(he became the winner of "Show Me the Money 8.")

1974
01:28:08,414 --> 01:28:13,155
(The skilled rapper PUNCHNELLO)

1975
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:15,695
Oh, my. What?

1976
01:28:16,395 --> 01:28:17,454
What?

1977
01:28:19,525 --> 01:28:21,463
I can't believe this.

1978
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:22,864
PUNCHNELLO got only one vote.

1979
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,865
That makes no sense.

1980
01:28:25,235 --> 01:28:26,964
- This is shocking. - I know.

1981
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:28,874
Honestly, it was shocking.

1982
01:28:29,105 --> 01:28:32,704
I believe PUNCHNELLO has...

1983
01:28:32,905 --> 01:28:35,003
what it takes to get more votes.

1984
01:28:35,004 --> 01:28:37,544
He was a winner of a hip-hop survival show.

1985
01:28:37,775 --> 01:28:40,015
But it's merciless here.

1986
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:42,155
No way.

1987
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:48,283
The winning rapper, 19. Take off your mask.

1988
01:28:48,284 --> 01:28:49,525
(The winning rapper, 19, takes off his mask.)

1989
01:28:52,395 --> 01:28:53,494
It's him, right?

1990
01:28:58,634 --> 01:28:59,664
Probably.

1991
01:29:01,164 --> 01:29:03,003
(Loopy)

1992
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,904
- Who is it? - Loopy.

1993
01:29:04,905 --> 01:29:05,945
(Loopy)

1994
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:08,373
(With his unique tone and flow,)

1995
01:29:08,374 --> 01:29:10,673
(he stamped his presence on the domestic hip-hop scene.)

1996
01:29:10,674 --> 01:29:11,914
Even before the first line,

1997
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:14,913
I knew it was Loopy.

1998
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:18,284
He was clearly on another level.

1999
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:24,195
- Who is it? - Loopy.

2000
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:27,065
Loopy won.

2001
01:29:27,865 --> 01:29:29,164
Loopy is here too.

2002
01:29:29,895 --> 01:29:31,334
But Owen and Loopy...

2003
01:29:34,605 --> 01:29:37,104
I didn't expect to see Loopy here today.

2004
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,374
I haven't met Loopy for two years.

2005
01:29:41,405 --> 01:29:44,174
Owen and I...

2006
01:29:46,384 --> 01:29:50,253
When I first began my career...

2007
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:53,123
as a rapper in Korea,

2008
01:29:53,124 --> 01:29:54,754
we began together.

2009
01:29:55,954 --> 01:30:00,525
(Loopy and Owen relied on each other in the same crew.)

2010
01:30:01,725 --> 01:30:03,734
(I hope you listen to our music more.)

2011
01:30:03,735 --> 01:30:06,134
(Everyone's music in my agency.)

2012
01:30:08,334 --> 01:30:11,334
After a series of events,

2013
01:30:11,805 --> 01:30:14,003
he said it was time...

2014
01:30:14,004 --> 01:30:17,015
to create his own world.

2015
01:30:17,544 --> 01:30:18,614
(Owen decided to be independent...)

2016
01:30:18,615 --> 01:30:19,743
(after spending a long time with Loopy.)

2017
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:21,815
After that moment,

2018
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:25,253
I stopped keeping in touch with anyone in the crew.

2019
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:27,454
I focused on my own fight.

2020
01:30:28,185 --> 01:30:33,124
(So the two took different paths after drifting apart.)

2021
01:30:33,924 --> 01:30:36,634
(2 years later, today)

2022
01:30:38,164 --> 01:30:41,033
(Loopy and Owen recognized each other...)

2023
01:30:41,034 --> 01:30:45,435
(solely based on their voices.)

2024
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,145
Let's see. I want to sit down.

2025
01:31:01,124 --> 01:31:02,254
Good job.

2026
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:06,464
It was Loopy.

2027
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:09,395
I didn't know.

2028
01:31:10,935 --> 01:31:12,264
I didn't know either.

2029
01:31:12,265 --> 01:31:13,265
- No? - No.

2030
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,774
It was orange.

2031
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:22,145
The color was orange when we had a hug.

2032
01:31:23,174 --> 01:31:24,474
It was orange.

2033
01:31:24,475 --> 01:31:25,615
(It was orange.)

2034
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:31,555
As we continue the missions,

2035
01:31:32,324 --> 01:31:35,524
if we make any musical exchanges,

2036
01:31:35,525 --> 01:31:37,155
I'll be glad.

2037
01:31:42,895 --> 01:31:44,464
I'm sorry.

2038
01:31:46,704 --> 01:31:47,704
Don't be.

2039
01:31:49,534 --> 01:31:50,574
I get it.

2040
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,445
- Isn't this the last battle? - The real last battle.

2041
01:32:00,884 --> 01:32:02,883
I wonder how they survived until the end.

2042
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:04,714
- It must be really tough. - For real.

2043
01:32:05,315 --> 01:32:06,924
The last battle.

2044
01:32:07,424 --> 01:32:11,624
Anyone who wants to rap first, please come up to the stage.

2045
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,294
Go.

2046
01:32:17,595 --> 01:32:18,664
He's the main character.

2047
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:24,373
I respect hip-hop culture,

2048
01:32:24,374 --> 01:32:26,203
and I love hip-hop so much.

2049
01:32:26,204 --> 01:32:29,014
I respect hip-hop artists.

2050
01:32:29,015 --> 01:32:30,345
Yes!

2051
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:32,615
I recognize that voice.

2052
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:34,043
- Who is it? - What?

2053
01:32:34,044 --> 01:32:35,044
- Who is it? - I'm not telling you.

2054
01:32:35,714 --> 01:32:36,815
Masta Wu?

2055
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:38,883
No? Okay.

2056
01:32:38,884 --> 01:32:40,524
Anyone who wants to challenge this rapper,

2057
01:32:40,525 --> 01:32:42,555
please come up to the stage.

2058
01:32:47,324 --> 01:32:48,324
I wonder who it is.

2059
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:50,864
He came up last.

2060
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:52,095
He waited and waited.

2061
01:32:52,235 --> 01:32:55,134
Who came up last?

2062
01:32:55,464 --> 01:32:59,174
Say a word to the starter.

2063
01:33:05,044 --> 01:33:06,084
What?

2064
01:33:06,685 --> 01:33:08,845
- A dog? - It's a puppy.

2065
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,253
- A dog? - It's a puppy.

2066
01:33:12,254 --> 01:33:14,253
- Big dog. - It's a puppy.

2067
01:33:14,254 --> 01:33:15,324
What's going on?

2068
01:33:15,754 --> 01:33:18,355
- How did he wait until the end? - I know.

2069
01:33:20,525 --> 01:33:22,895
What was that about? To bark like that...

2070
01:33:24,095 --> 01:33:26,664
He remained to the end like he was in the lead...

2071
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:28,105
just to bark?

2072
01:33:28,265 --> 01:33:31,504
The battle will begin now.

2073
01:33:31,775 --> 01:33:32,845
Ready.

2074
01:33:36,574 --> 01:33:37,615
I hope he does well.

2075
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:40,185
- Start. - DJ, you know what to do.

2076
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:43,714
Hey. Let's go!

2077
01:33:50,095 --> 01:33:52,824
Hip-hop hooray hoo

2078
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,364
- Ray hoo - Ray hoo

2079
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:58,195
- Hip-hop hooray hoo - Who is it?

2080
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:00,463
- Ray - I see.

2081
01:34:00,464 --> 01:34:01,534
Gosh.

2082
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:04,304
I'd never given up, I don't do that

2083
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,644
I move on and get back on my feet

2084
01:34:06,645 --> 01:34:08,274
- The voice sounds familiar. - I've thought about it

2085
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:09,913
- I love his rap. - Two or three times

2086
01:34:09,914 --> 01:34:12,314
But I never said it before

2087
01:34:12,315 --> 01:34:15,114
I take it as karma and take it to the end

2088
01:34:15,115 --> 01:34:17,185
I really do this for do or die

2089
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,253
I don't have the answer so ask someone else

2090
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:23,054
I force myself because I don't want to lose this

2091
01:34:23,055 --> 01:34:25,623
It's simple if you settle it because that's how I made it

2092
01:34:25,624 --> 01:34:26,963
Mayday

2093
01:34:26,964 --> 01:34:29,564
My voice celebrates my payday

2094
01:34:29,565 --> 01:34:33,365
Until tomorrow becomes today, I work hard for this, man

2095
01:34:33,435 --> 01:34:36,274
I'm being tested Every moment is an audition

2096
01:34:36,275 --> 01:34:38,304
I can't help but be myself

2097
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:41,573
But where are you looking for me with a bitter smile?

2098
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:44,714
Kkakdugi with a glass of soju, Life is not a big deal

2099
01:34:45,985 --> 01:34:47,315
Hip-hop, I'm loving it

2100
01:34:55,725 --> 01:34:57,355
Experienced showmanship.

2101
01:34:57,824 --> 01:34:59,794
- I think it's OG. - I know.

2102
01:34:59,924 --> 01:35:00,924
That was darn nice.

2103
01:35:05,595 --> 01:35:06,605
The dog?

2104
01:35:07,065 --> 01:35:08,305
- It's the dog. - Yes.

2105
01:35:08,865 --> 01:35:11,574
Who on earth is he?

2106
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:12,975
He wants the beat on.

2107
01:35:20,584 --> 01:35:22,985
What if he keeps barking?

2108
01:35:24,784 --> 01:35:27,423
One, two, three, what the heck is going to happen?

2109
01:35:27,424 --> 01:35:29,954
We gone wild, bark like lunatics

2110
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:33,463
Four, five, six, we just go, push it

2111
01:35:33,464 --> 01:35:35,694
Don't look back never give up

2112
01:35:35,695 --> 01:35:36,695
Oh, what?

2113
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:38,264
One, two, three

2114
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:39,604
- What the heck is going to happen? - I think I know who it is.

2115
01:35:39,605 --> 01:35:42,003
We gone wild, bark like lunatics

2116
01:35:42,004 --> 01:35:43,033
For real?

2117
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:45,673
Four, five, six, we just go, push it

2118
01:35:45,674 --> 01:35:48,105
Don't look back, never give up

2119
01:35:48,445 --> 01:35:51,043
I do my dance, My pants are hanging on my butt

2120
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:52,413
Hold the crotch and massage the leg

2121
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:54,114
When she sees it, she says oh, my gosh

2122
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:55,543
Then I approach her

2123
01:35:55,544 --> 01:35:57,083
Nice to meet you, Hi, honey

2124
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,484
My mic is a long and big eggplant

2125
01:35:58,485 --> 01:36:00,424
It's thick like the bottom of a tree

2126
01:36:00,624 --> 01:36:03,324
I'm from Busan I'm so heated up, so don't stop me

2127
01:36:04,155 --> 01:36:05,224
I'm from Busan

2128
01:36:05,225 --> 01:36:07,463
- I'm so heated up, so don't stop me - Right?

2129
01:36:07,464 --> 01:36:10,095
I'm smoking like the king beggar, Need oxygen for spicy respirator

2130
01:36:10,935 --> 01:36:13,434
Gas, what I spit, Serious coughing in this

2131
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:15,934
Mr. Lee coming straight from the street

2132
01:36:15,935 --> 01:36:17,974
Stamp on everything Me, Northfacegawd

2133
01:36:17,975 --> 01:36:19,503
Lob, we triple trouble

2134
01:36:19,504 --> 01:36:21,104
Take them to the corner

2135
01:36:21,105 --> 01:36:22,913
Steal everything I find in you

2136
01:36:22,914 --> 01:36:25,514
Welcome to my life, This is concrete jungle I live in

2137
01:36:25,515 --> 01:36:28,815
Yes I'm living in the wild, I'm a hungry wild animal

2138
01:36:28,945 --> 01:36:31,554
One, two, three, what the heck is going to happen?

2139
01:36:31,555 --> 01:36:34,185
- We gone wild, bark like lunatics - So cool.

2140
01:36:35,084 --> 01:36:36,993
One, two, three, what the heck is going to happen?

2141
01:36:36,994 --> 01:36:40,195
We gone wild bark like lunatics

2142
01:36:41,065 --> 01:36:43,934
Four, five, six, we just go, push it

2143
01:36:43,935 --> 01:36:46,334
Don't look back never give up

2144
01:36:47,164 --> 01:36:49,974
One, two, three, what the heck is going to happen?

2145
01:36:49,975 --> 01:36:51,874
We gone wild

2146
01:36:53,405 --> 01:36:56,043
Four, five, six, we just go, push it

2147
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:58,445
Don't look back never give up

2148
01:37:11,655 --> 01:37:13,664
That was crazy. Do you know him?

2149
01:37:14,025 --> 01:37:15,293
- You don't know him? - No.

2150
01:37:15,294 --> 01:37:16,533
Amazing.

2151
01:37:16,534 --> 01:37:17,634
Shoot.

2152
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:19,365
That was darn crazy.

2153
01:37:23,074 --> 01:37:24,504
I can't believe he's here.

2154
01:37:24,874 --> 01:37:27,073
Why did the barking sound so cool at the end?

2155
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:28,174
I know.

2156
01:37:28,574 --> 01:37:29,974
Did I call that man a dog?

2157
01:37:29,975 --> 01:37:31,573
- Yes. - Darn. I'm sorry.

2158
01:37:31,574 --> 01:37:32,985
The battle has ended.

2159
01:37:33,345 --> 01:37:35,743
That was the main stage. It was awesome.

2160
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,414
That was insane.

2161
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:40,283
To me, it wasn't a battle.

2162
01:37:40,284 --> 01:37:43,155
One, two, three, what the heck is going to happen?

2163
01:37:43,494 --> 01:37:45,454
I was in a concert hall as the member of an audience.

2164
01:37:45,624 --> 01:37:49,735
Like magic, I got sucked into it.

2165
01:37:50,034 --> 01:37:51,935
I felt like I was bewitched and returned to earth.

2166
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:55,204
We will now begin the vote.

2167
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,904
- I can't help it. - Please...

2168
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:00,203
stand behind the rapper who has done better...

2169
01:38:00,204 --> 01:38:01,774
- in your opinion. - Go with the energy?

2170
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:02,974
I have no choice.

2171
01:38:02,975 --> 01:38:05,373
- We will proceed with voting. - His performance was insane.

2172
01:38:05,374 --> 01:38:08,115
He was good too, but...

2173
01:38:08,445 --> 01:38:10,115
I don't remember his performance.

2174
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:11,954
Gosh, that was...

2175
01:38:12,315 --> 01:38:13,985
- No luck with the battle? - Exactly.

2176
01:38:14,284 --> 01:38:16,253
Rapper 25 did a good job too.

2177
01:38:16,254 --> 01:38:18,395
The result of the vote will be revealed.

2178
01:38:20,824 --> 01:38:23,334
(Starter loses with 3 votes. Opposer wins with 55 votes.)

2179
01:38:23,565 --> 01:38:25,294
His performance deserved more than three votes.

2180
01:38:25,464 --> 01:38:27,203
(Opposer 35 wins.)

2181
01:38:27,204 --> 01:38:30,074
Take off the losing rapper,

2182
01:38:30,574 --> 01:38:31,975
Rapper 25's mask.

2183
01:38:32,235 --> 01:38:33,704
He did a good job too.

2184
01:38:39,015 --> 01:38:42,084
I think he's either the first generation rapper or a veteran.

2185
01:38:42,244 --> 01:38:43,615
I can never guess it.

2186
01:38:46,784 --> 01:38:47,954
Oh, my gosh.

2187
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:49,324
Amazing.

2188
01:38:49,855 --> 01:38:50,924
That's crazy.

2189
01:38:52,324 --> 01:38:53,793
(Bizzy)

2190
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:56,735
- Amazing. - That's crazy.

2191
01:38:56,865 --> 01:38:59,294
(Bizzy)

2192
01:38:59,964 --> 01:39:01,964
Hello. I'm Bizzy Bee.

2193
01:39:02,504 --> 01:39:05,074
A dreamer who never stops trying.

2194
01:39:05,334 --> 01:39:06,673
(17 years of experience)

2195
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:09,174
(The leader of Korean hip-hop culture)

2196
01:39:09,744 --> 01:39:11,913
(The 1st generation rapper, Bizzy continues to try something new.)

2197
01:39:11,914 --> 01:39:13,044
So cool.

2198
01:39:13,315 --> 01:39:15,913
I could feel his love for hip-hop.

2199
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,354
I grew up with his influence.

2200
01:39:18,355 --> 01:39:19,953
I began hip-hop after listening to his music.

2201
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,484
I even have his album "Bizzionary" at home.

2202
01:39:22,485 --> 01:39:25,695
He appeared as a producer in another competition before.

2203
01:39:28,294 --> 01:39:31,594
(He appeared as a producer with Tiger JK.)

2204
01:39:31,595 --> 01:39:32,935
I was surprised.

2205
01:39:35,265 --> 01:39:38,435
The winning rapper, 35.

2206
01:39:38,534 --> 01:39:39,673
So darn cool.

2207
01:39:39,674 --> 01:39:40,874
He's darn tall.

2208
01:39:41,504 --> 01:39:42,703
He's the rapper of rappers.

2209
01:39:42,704 --> 01:39:44,115
Take off your mask.

2210
01:39:44,714 --> 01:39:46,044
This is awesome.

2211
01:39:50,115 --> 01:39:51,784
He's probably...

2212
01:39:52,155 --> 01:39:54,855
a hero to my generation.

2213
01:39:54,924 --> 01:39:58,395
He's like a dragon.

2214
01:39:58,794 --> 01:40:01,765
This person is someone I'd never get to meet in person.

2215
01:40:02,565 --> 01:40:05,065
He's out of this world.

2216
01:40:05,294 --> 01:40:06,664
You don't see him on hip-hop shows.

2217
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:08,765
Take off your mask.

2218
01:40:12,105 --> 01:40:13,174
This is unbelievable.

2219
01:40:13,645 --> 01:40:15,775
- Hey. - Yes.
