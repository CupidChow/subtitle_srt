1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,928
(RAP: PUBLIC)

2
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,058
Block 4 and Block 5 will proceed with a match.

3
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,069
- Let's go. - Let's go.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,300
He's giving the finger.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,838
These blocks are so solid.

6
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,070
I don't think anyone will lose.

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,209
It's so hard to predict the outcome.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,839
I think this match will be fun.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,438
Isn't it a match between the hosts?

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,509
Do you guys have something to say?

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,079
- No. - No.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,119
There's no need to get on his bad side.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,419
- He farted. - That's a bad manner on TV.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,489
The Block Match between Block 4 and Block 5 will begin.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,929
(Block Breaker, Block 4 versus Block 5)

16
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,129
(Block 4)

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,258
(Block 4 had a strategic meeting before Block Breaker.)

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,729
- We can get any beats. - That's right.

19
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,268
Shall we listen to a few beats...

20
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,098
- and take a pick? - That sounds good.

21
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,669
It'll be the best if they don't overlap.

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,239
- You're right. - As for me,

23
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,579
I'll take the leftovers.

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,279
You can pick the beats you're comfortable with.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,809
Just put me in the back.

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,179
- The very back? - If the match comes to me,

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,579
I'll slam the verses in there.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,120
Let's go with that system.

29
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,559
Our leader, Boi B went, "Do what you guys can do."

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,158
"I'll take care of the rest."

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,359
He's so trustworthy. He's the best leader.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,170
(Block 4 members choose the beats they want.)

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,140
Shall we begin the meeting?

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,708
- There are opponents... - Yes.

35
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,208
We can be strong against.

36
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,039
Shall we write down such combinations?

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,348
If Mckdaddy comes out...

38
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,979
Can you guys go easy on me? I can do the 6th and 11th beats.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,679
- We haven't gotten to them yet. - No?

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,889
- Right now, we're talking about... - Let's talk about it later.

41
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,749
- the best combinations. - Yes. Let's talk about that first.

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,818
Do they have a member who's good at the lazy beat?

43
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,658
- MASON HOME. - Right.

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,828
They might give that beat to MASON HOME...

45
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,059
and say, "We can do any beats, so the order doesn't matter."

46
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,060
They might do that.

47
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,598
The thing is,

48
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,239
there are two beats I have confidence in.

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,399
Then tell us. Go ahead and tell us.

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,908
- Now, tell us the beats. - The beats.

51
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,679
- COCONA, go 1st. - I want the 6th and 11th beats.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Does anyone else want them?

53
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,280
(Does anyone else want the beats COCONA chose?)

54
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,849
- All right. Then I'll take them. - Okay.

55
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,318
I just need to do well no matter who comes out.

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,819
I was thankful for the situation.

57
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,619
They can do both the trap beat and boom bap beat.

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,859
That's right. This block has many members...

59
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,388
- who can do various beats. - Yes.

60
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,990
To be honest, they're good at everything.

61
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,529
(Block 5)

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,929
(Block 5 members are also looking for the suitable beats.)

63
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,598
This is really bad.

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,799
Do you mean the beats?

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,369
I'm not saying that you chose badly.

66
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,409
- But there's nothing I can do well. - Really?

67
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,449
- What's wrong? - There's nothing I can do well.

68
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,948
As I practiced, I was like, "There's nothing."

69
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,948
"There's nothing suitable. What should I do?"

70
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,019
These beats aren't suitable.

71
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
There are only five I can do.

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,489
There are 2 beats with the tempo of 124bpm.

73
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,159
I really can't do them.

74
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,628
I need to squeeze verses into this beat.

75
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,658
Same here. It's a bit of a tight fit.

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,929
There weren't many beats we could do well.

77
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,769
I could see that everyone was struggling...

78
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,439
to find the suitable beats.

79
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,468
(Block 4)

80
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,609
Here's what I think about PUNCHNELLO.

81
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,179
If he competes in the round he's comfortable with,

82
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,448
- no one in Block Five can beat him. - I agree.

83
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,818
If he competes in the round...

84
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,149
- he's comfortable with... - It's true.

85
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,848
I was quite worried.

86
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,389
People had too much expectation.

87
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,189
Just in case. Number one is PUNCHNELLO.

88
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,589
The leaders of all blocks,

89
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,300
- please gather at the Choice Block. - I'll be back.

90
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,659
- My goodness. - See you soon.

91
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,999
I didn't think about this.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,098
I didn't want to do it.

93
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,770
But I had standards for choosing the elimination candidates.

94
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,079
- If we lose, - Okay.

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,740
Three members need to enter the deathmatch.

96
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,409
Oh, no.

97
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,310
I'll be open with you.

98
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,090
I chose Ryul, VIIN, and COCONA.

99
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,559
I chose them as the elimination candidates...

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,530
because I wanted to leave behind the members with a competitive edge.

101
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,459
I need to write down the names until the clock hits 50 minutes,

102
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
so...

103
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:20,999
Boi B told us about his choices for the elimination candidates.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,568
- The ones for the deathmatch? - Yes.

105
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,639
I want to do it.

106
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,169
I want to do it.

107
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,439
I don't think I'll last long.

108
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,508
So I want to enter the deathmatch.

109
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,409
You should enter the deathmatch and come back alive.

110
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,278
You might end up wasting your verses.

111
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,680
Still, I'll do it.

112
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,279
- PUNCHNELLO? - Yes. I'll join the group.

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,050
Although PUNCHNELLO did exceptionally well...

114
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,920
on other shows...

115
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,559
(Despite having proven his talent, PUNCHNELLO lost in Mask Off...)

116
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,490
(with the biggest difference in the votes.)

117
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,259
I have no confidence.

118
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,699
I have a big fear of doing a disservice to the team.

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,339
So I thought, "This is bad."

120
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,198
I felt really bad.

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,370
He's really talented.

122
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,540
I wanted him to be more ambitious.

123
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,480
When I looked at Ryul,

124
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,910
he was rapping really diligently.

125
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,879
I wondered if I should exclude Ryul since he was more desperate.

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,249
I was really torn.

127
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,089
I kept picking up PUNCHNELLO and Ryul's names.

128
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,318
PUNCHNELLO, I added your name.

129
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,529
Okay.

130
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,230
- Let's not make that happen. - Okay.

131
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,660
PUNCHNELLO, are you struggling to adjust to the show?

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,730
You talked as if you'd get eliminated.

133
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:28,829
Oh, that?

134
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,768
I thought that mindset would put me more at ease.

135
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,099
No. That won't happen.

136
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,839
- That's right. - We'll win no matter what.

137
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,508
(At that moment, Block 5 members practice together.)

138
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,240
- Shall we spit out the verses? - Okay.

139
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,878
Are we spitting out the verses?

140
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,209
- Let's start with the first beat. - Okay.

141
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,778
A movement like a shadow you haven't seen

142
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,620
You can't follow me, Your voice goes hoarse at your turn

143
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,519
- It's nice. - It's nice.

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,528
It was what made me once more

145
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,259
I think he'll win.

146
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,100
I think he'll win.

147
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,299
You can pull off this beat too.

148
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,128
Stepping on this boarder got me feeling like

149
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,699
You just need to rap faster.

150
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,739
You just need to be faster

151
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,508
You can pull off this beat too.

152
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,969
I used up a lot of my verses,

153
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,110
so I want Khundi Panda to have a clean sweep.

154
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,050
That's the picture I'm going for.

155
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:15,949
The first one is the most important.

156
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,119
- We need to decide on that. - The first one is important.

157
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,619
I think Khundi Panda will beat everyone...

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,319
if he goes first.

159
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,588
In any case, JP wanted me to go first.

160
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,660
In that case,

161
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,159
I'll go first unless something comes up.

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,329
- First? - I think I should go first.

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,169
Although JP is the leader, I brought the members together.

164
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,470
So I think I should show them what I can do.

165
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,799
Seriously, Khundi Panda might go first...

166
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,409
- and have a clean sweep. - That's right.

167
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,579
He has so many verses.

168
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,778
So if the Block Four members...

169
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,008
send out the weak ones first to make him use up his verses,

170
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,050
he won't waver.

171
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,578
- Seriously. - The general consensus...

172
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,319
called for a killer performance on my part.

173
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,290
I don't want to be honest and say...

174
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,129
that it's pressuring.

175
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,059
It's the same, but I feel you

176
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,328
It's pitch black

177
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,828
Both you and I

178
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:11,638
There's no right answer, Even if it's your share

179
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,909
You can't say it outright

180
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,839
Even if you're older than me, you'll be like my little brother

181
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,680
Practice?

182
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,050
Everyone is talented, so it's good.

183
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,379
Hey. I see that everyone is busy.

184
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,489
I'm confident that we won't lose.

185
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,389
I showed a good performance in the last round,

186
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,088
so I believe that my teammates will show a good performance...

187
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,629
this time.

188
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,930
The Block Match between Block 4 and Block 5 will begin.

189
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,599
Your nerves will ease right away.

190
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,170
So go up there and rap in a cool way.

191
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,138
- Yes, sir. - One, two, three.

192
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,139
- Let's go! - Let's go!

193
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,708
- What? Let's do it too. - Let's do it too.

194
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,778
- How should we do it? - Up or down?

195
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,508
- Down. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

196
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,509
- Let's go! - Let's go!

197
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,180
- Let's cover our ears. - They weren't in sync.

198
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,920
Which block do you think will win?

199
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,588
I think Block Five will do well.

200
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,360
I wonder which verses JP will show.

201
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,889
JP, that monster.

202
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,430
Block Four isn't an easy target.

203
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,889
Ready.

204
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,399
- Start. - It'll be so much fun.

205
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,938
(COCONA of Block 4 takes the stage for the 1st beat.)

206
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,939
What?

207
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,779
Show us what you can do.

208
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,409
Take 1 step, 2 steps forward and pose

209
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,379
There are grounds for my confidence, My charisma is unmatched

210
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,219
Yes, my outfit, camera pose

211
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,949
I'm so beautiful, oh, yes

212
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,950
If you want to control me

213
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,950
- Just pause right there - She's good.

214
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,658
What waits for me is the full-course picanha meal

215
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,459
After visiting the farm, I'll be one of the goats

216
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,489
- I put in twice the effort - Her rap improved.

217
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,490
- I was lonely at times - What?

218
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,158
It's a battle, you didn't put in one-eighth of the effort

219
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,099
So why do you think that you're better?

220
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,798
- Look up, the sun is hot - What? She's good.

221
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,898
I absorb the energy

222
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,168
And let go of yesterday

223
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,969
A rapper who got used to the repeating pattern

224
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,970
- She's good. - Only chasing the paper

225
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:55,038
I follow my dream, Yes, show me the money

226
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,008
I won't budge because I say what I want to say

227
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,678
Take 1 step, 2 steps forward and pose

228
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,479
There are grounds for my confidence, My charisma is unmatched

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,048
Yes, my outfit, camera pose

230
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,209
- I'm so beautiful, oh, yes - She's completely different now.

231
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,219
She's walking on a fine line.

232
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
If you want to control me

233
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,449
- Just pause right there - There's rawness.

234
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,648
What waits for me is the full-course picanha meal

235
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,518
After visiting the farm, I'll be one of the goats

236
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,559
I put in twice the effort, I was lonely at times

237
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,490
Okay.

238
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,899
Give him the microphone.

239
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,899
The microphone.

240
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,929
Take it.

241
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,970
"Take it."

242
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,209
In conclusion, choose between forgiveness and vendetta

243
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,408
- If not a rebellion - What?

244
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,878
- Que sera sera - What?

245
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,939
- No one can beat that. - A follower or a trendsetter

246
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,609
In the darts of defeat

247
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,249
The target is the mind, not body

248
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,979
If you're scared of standing up to injustice

249
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,619
If you're happy to obey

250
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,648
- Silence is better - Bring it on!

251
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,819
- Dream is nice, reality too - She's disturbing him too much.

252
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,319
They give me a 90-degree bow

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,329
A scene that's like a casino you visited for the first time

254
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,689
- In life, it's not all that - I think her manners...

255
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,200
- could affect the votes. - I feel betrayed often

256
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,928
Love, people, cheating, cheating

257
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:54,768
You don't see those things only in dramas

258
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,898
They happen all the time

259
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,668
- He's good. - Your thoughts get twisted

260
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,369
But the society takes care of your mental fortitude

261
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,168
- That's cheating. - Just accept it

262
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,209
Or count your age

263
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,808
- And hide your craziness - Those types are hard to take on.

264
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,939
Defy, new type, I learned your type early on

265
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,080
- You're a teacher - You know,

266
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,378
- Or a student - She's cheerful,

267
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,508
- but lacks managers. - Your value is old

268
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,648
So you need to make a choice

269
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,079
- What is she doing? - Do or die, then comes

270
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,648
A suicide, it's sad, but it's someone's solution

271
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,388
It doesn't apply to life only

272
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:18,658
- That's what a defeat is - She's disturbing him...

273
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,919
- Can you interpret the words? - too much.

274
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,829
It's a shame that we came this far

275
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,499
Wake up from your dream, You haven't beaten anything

276
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,259
Come up with it yourself, your master plan

277
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,469
- It was a bit annoying. - She stole the spotlight.

278
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,039
- It was too much. - Seriously.

279
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,940
- You have the worst manners. - Seriously.

280
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,969
"You have the worst manners."

281
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,138
Khundi Panda struggled a lot.

282
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,279
You should've dialed it down.

283
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
She has the worst manners.

284
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,649
Calm down. It's okay.

285
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:44,980
She disturbed me too much.

286
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,388
I bet it was impossible to focus.

287
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,518
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

288
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,990
I bet it disturbed him a lot.

289
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:53,889
Did I lack manners?

290
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,689
Very much so.

291
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,860
What are they going to do?

292
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,230
COCONA blocked out the sounds.

293
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,370
I'm sorry. I didn't realize that I lacked manners.

294
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,768
It's okay.

295
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,509
Khundi Panda, calm down.

296
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,639
No one else in Block Four will do such a thing, except for COCONA.

297
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,840
The result of the vote will be revealed.

298
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,250
It'll be a big twist if she beats Khundi Panda.

299
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,019
I think I'll lose.

300
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,519
No.

301
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,490
No way.

302
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,730
- Are you serious? - My goodness.

303
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,190
Are you serious?

304
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,330
No way.

305
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,169
- Are you serious? - Really?

306
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,370
Unbelievable.

307
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,429
Will she win?

308
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,440
(COCONA loses with 15 votes. Khundi Panda wins with 32 votes.)

309
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,398
That's too bad.

310
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,539
Good.

311
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,740
It was dangerous.

312
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,808
- She did well. - It was a trick.

313
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,839
- It was a strategy. - It was a strategy.

314
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,710
I can't believe she did that.

315
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,949
Judging by rap alone, Khundi Panda was much better.

316
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,678
I have so much respect for Khundi Panda.

317
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,320
- Not everyone can do that. - Not everyone can do that.

318
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,918
He's a true winner.

319
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,919
Seriously.

320
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,119
- Well done. - Thank you for your hard work.

321
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,460
- Nice. - Well done.

322
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,600
Nice.

323
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,460
Is it 6 to 6 now?

324
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,599
Since Khundi Panda is choosing the beat,

325
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,340
I think skyminhyuk or PUNCHNELLO will come forward.

326
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,399
I choose the 16th beat. Let's go.

327
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,740
The 16th beat? That's me.

328
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,080
- He'll do well - Hey.

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,178
I don't need them, the numbers in my phone

330
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,518
The Summer Games of recent updates, Put that nonsense away

331
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,548
Even if I'm down, just walk away, None of your business

332
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,048
When I get lonely at times

333
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,288
I look around the club everyone was in

334
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,788
Can you believe the faces that pop up in your head?

335
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,419
The comfortable life is a debt

336
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,329
Sulking is best when you do it alone

337
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,959
It's the Truman's disease, The world is a set

338
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,158
The lines criticize the pretense

339
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,229
Will the sun rise from the west side?

340
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,658
- I congratulate the good events - He's good.

341
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,268
But I only send money

342
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,499
They tell me not to get pressured

343
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,569
- Hey, my reply is like a debt - He's really good.

344
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,099
Babble with that knowledge, Just shut it

345
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,709
Criticize me with that knowledge

346
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,308
- I look worse with knowledge - He's good.

347
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,739
All of us have changed

348
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,479
I hate those changes, not the song

349
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,979
I want to erase all the worries.

350
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,579
- F my friends and other ones - Who'll go against him?

351
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,878
F myself, why is my personality like this?

352
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,018
Just shut it, Criticize me with that knowledge

353
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,849
- skyminhyuk or SINCE. - I look worse with knowledge

354
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,418
All of us have changed

355
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,119
I hate those changes, not the song

356
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,689
I want to erase all the worries

357
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,288
F my friends and other ones

358
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,789
F myself, why is my personality like this?

359
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,558
- That was perfect. - Perfect.

360
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,570
He's good.

361
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,230
She's here.

362
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,269
- Here she comes. - It's a strong one.

363
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,049
Okay. Yes.

364
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,449
Twenty-four dancing in TikTok

365
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,018
For a viral video, I stomp my feet like King Kong

366
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,479
If you ask me if it's wrong, I ziplock my lips

367
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,489
It's for survival, It's better than staying home

368
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,048
I need to run on my feet

369
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,489
To sell my songs

370
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,189
Perhaps I'll taste the salty dollars

371
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,729
But I don't feel them on my feet

372
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,989
My friend asked me if there were any other ways

373
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,990
And I just smiled

374
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,959
Rap is the only thing I can do

375
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,699
If I can't do this, I'll need to rest in peace

376
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,168
Even if my limbs get cut off, I can't give up my tongue

377
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,729
Even without the mechanism of the music charts, I'll do it

378
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,038
I want to be an alternative, It'll be someone's insight

379
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,969
- She's so good. - An idealist's disaster

380
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,569
Good music and good lyrics

381
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,209
- People focus on who's wearing less - She's good.

382
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,579
Depending on the number of views

383
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,408
They decide whether or not to click, And it's no surprise

384
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,709
Getting drunk on air freshener is bad for the health

385
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,549
I just want to exude my unique pheromones

386
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay. Hey. Okay.

387
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:09,519
That's energy.

388
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,518
- Okay - She has energy.

389
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,889
She had fun on the stage.

390
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,859
- Well done. - Everyone is really talented.

391
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,000
It was great.

392
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,429
What should I do?

393
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,799
I'm torn.

394
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,899
It's a difficult choice.

395
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,579
It was SINCE's performance I enjoyed the most.

396
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,479
It'll be hard to take consecutive wins.

397
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,879
Go easy on me.

398
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,778
It's fun to compete as a team.

399
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,820
The result of the vote will be revealed.

400
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,220
What will happen?

401
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,159
If SINCE gets eliminated, Block Four will take a big loss.

402
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,490
It was strong.

403
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,659
It was too strong.

404
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,860
What will be the result?

405
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,230
- My goodness. - Will it be neck-and-neck?

406
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,399
It's neck-and-neck.

407
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,980
(SINCE wins with 28 votes. Khundi Panda loses with 19 votes.)

408
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,808
- Let's go. - All right.

409
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,179
This is becoming fun.

410
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,779
This is becoming fun.

411
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,950
One member got eliminated in each team.

412
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,689
- Nice. - All right.

413
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,489
- I knew that you'd win. - You didn't disappoint.

414
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,819
- Well done. - Well done.

415
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,259
- It was intense. - You did well.

416
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,700
I can see a pattern. Your spirit is important.

417
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,100
- Your spirit is important. - I think that's all you need.

418
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:29,870
Perhaps she'll beat everyone.

419
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,538
What am I going to do? I need to rap as well.

420
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,808
Being good at rapping isn't everything.

421
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,839
It's all about the spirit.

422
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,340
No matter who goes next, rap with confidence.

423
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,039
Will Block Four continue to win?

424
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,350
Give me the 14th beat.

425
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,220
Okay.

426
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,960
- Hey. Yes. - Yes.

427
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,428
I told you that I made it

428
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,028
The tomorrow I longed for is finally here

429
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,798
- Scale the remnants of the past - I'll go next.

430
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,369
I'll show you how I've changed like Ailee

431
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,369
Independent lady, I don't live like a sloth

432
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,339
- I make money and invest in myself - She's good.

433
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,469
- It's not that great. - I'm my own ant

434
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,038
- I think we'll win this time. - I want more fun than that

435
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,869
I bet everything for my rawness

436
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,008
I can't work with scammers

437
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,579
Like someone who has never dated, My value is all natural

438
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,148
Pull up to Cheorwon, Turn up to the very end

439
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:16,749
My dream goes from a few dollars to 100 billion dollars

440
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,548
Ambitions in my heart, They exceed the reality

441
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,178
My heart is running across the green field

442
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,749
I'll build a picturesque house

443
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,918
No such thing as zero dollars, I open my wallet every day

444
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,658
You live once, so spend freely and earn more

445
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,459
- No takebacks, no failures - She raps so passionately.

446
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,758
I bet everything like Kwak Cheol Yong

447
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,788
I go across the Mapo Bridge

448
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,599
- Like they wished in the movie - No. She's only good at rapping.

449
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,258
I kept my eyes on the light and got out of the tunnel

450
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,099
I don't look back, I ain't no Seolhyun

451
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,969
Although I dream big, I don't bite what I can't chew

452
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,138
I ain't no Seolhyun

453
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,308
Although I dream big, I don't bite what I can't chew

454
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,808
- How will anyone beat that? - I stick to the basics

455
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,239
How will I forget to rap? Spitting out the verses is the best

456
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,378
- She made so much preparation. - They become one

457
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,508
Going forward is the mission

458
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,148
I build up the pain, I put a line over it

459
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,119
My effort will reach the sky and bring lingering emotions

460
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,649
What?

461
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,418
- Yes! - What?

462
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,059
It's Luci Gang.

463
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,959
- My goodness. - It's Luci Gang.

464
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,590
You never know. She might rip up the stage.

465
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,729
- Hey. - Let's go.

466
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,229
Put a leash on those who bark

467
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,828
They wag their tails because they're nothing like me

468
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,528
- What? - I run and get a 39°C fever

469
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,169
The rappers with no ice stomp around loudly

470
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,768
Open a project, scrap it, Spend money, earn some more

471
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,338
Not even Dok2 can steal my style

472
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,338
A stray cat to the bones, Luci

473
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,709
I throw up if I have to obey

474
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,740
Excuse me, I'm so sorry, but you're so boring

475
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,548
Watch this mukbang today, I'm gonna eat you like Trolli

476
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:24,549
She's good.

477
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,578
Selling sob stories is the worst

478
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,379
I ain't your Mary Poppins

479
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,618
- I tell my crying ex - SINCE is getting owned.

480
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,919
I can't give you what you want

481
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,959
Ten minutes like Lee Hyo Ri

482
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,989
No, I push them down

483
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,018
- She's good. - Even before the hook comes

484
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,858
- A liberal arts major, I prove it - She's insane.

485
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,288
- This is a child's play - This performance is legendary.

486
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,459
Peddlers should get lost, I'm allergic to powder all seasons

487
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,768
I rise like the sun in the dark, Look, it's like Jeongdongjin here

488
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,298
I'm like a coy cat

489
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,038
But it's always the quiet ones who cause trouble

490
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,838
- I can't wait anymore - If she writes such a line...

491
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,368
- That was... - I want more money

492
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,909
I'm like a coy cat

493
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,508
But it's always the quiet ones who cause trouble

494
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,149
I create a ruckus, this is my spot

495
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,879
You'll throw up your hands

496
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,848
This is a game

497
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:03,219
- I'll twirl my hair like broccoli - This is a legendary performance.

498
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,459
- A hairdresser's tender touch - You don't know who'll win.

499
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,059
I love it to death, It's like a heat wave in winter

500
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,899
- Yes. - Yes.

501
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,899
- Yes. - What was that?

502
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,899
It's so hard to choose the winner.

503
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,099
I'm torn.

504
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,439
- Seolhyun and cat. - Seolhyun and cat.

505
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,469
It was shocking.

506
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,538
You know, I... My goodness.

507
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,579
This is hard. Both of them did an amazing job.

508
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,609
We need more time.

509
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,278
Give us ten more seconds.

510
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,679
- We need more time. - We need more time.

511
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,980
We need a bit more time.

512
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:35,990
It'll be hard to choose the winner.

513
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,788
You did so well.

514
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,288
- I don't know how I performed. - Me neither. I was out of it.

515
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,129
Both of them did so well. They were so cool.

516
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,758
I want to watch this match again.

517
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,829
The result of the vote will be revealed.

518
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,099
(Block Breaker, Block 4 versus Block 5)

519
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,269
Maybe it'll be a tie.

520
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,769
- It'll be neck-and-neck. - I think SINCE did better.

521
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,970
Luci Gang fought hard, but SINCE was too strong.

522
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,879
That line about the cat...

523
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,479
The flow was insane.

524
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,078
That line about the cat had an insane flow.

525
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,150
I almost adopted a cat.

526
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,749
What will happen?

527
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,650
- If she beats SINCE... - If she wins, it'll be insane.

528
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,220
My goodness.

529
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,589
It's a close match.

530
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
(SINCE wins with 31 votes. Luci Gang loses with 16 votes.)

531
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,929
(Block 4's SINCE wins.)

532
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,970
It's too bad. She did well.

533
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,740
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

534
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,338
- Luci Gang did well. - She did really well.

535
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:32,778
Why do I feel like we keep losing...

536
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,179
- by a small margin? - I feel the same way.

537
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,650
- Two consecutive wins? - Yes.

538
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:36,848
Well done.

539
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,118
- Well done. - Well done.

540
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,679
SINCE is hard to beat.

541
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,219
She has incredible energy.

542
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,919
This is totally unexpected.

543
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,989
- Seriously. - Block Five is a strong team,

544
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,230
but two ace members are out already.

545
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,159
They acted cool and chose six members.

546
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,730
It put them in a disadvantage.

547
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,930
This isn't easy.

548
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,629
- Please give me the 10th beat. - The 10th beat is slow.

549
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,670
What was the tenth beat?

550
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,170
- Yes. - Okay.

551
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,338
- I think she'll nail it. - Yes.

552
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,308
I kick it every time I see a zero like a soccer player

553
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,008
The numbers come and go and my bank account can't keep up

554
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,909
- I paid so much in taxes last month - Oh, my gosh!

555
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,479
I understand now that the seed money is wealth

556
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,318
I used to survive on the earned income tax credit

557
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,319
- Now, I pay - Who wants to go next?

558
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,319
- For my manager's insurance - Shall I go next?

559
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,818
I still have a long way to go

560
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,449
What I need more than money is infinite stamina

561
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,159
Okay, it's fun to go up every day

562
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,858
When I want a break, I get it with my friends

563
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,629
Don't turn on the GPS, I'll call you a chauffeur

564
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,229
I welcome tomorrow and hope that it'll be like today

565
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,399
- I've never seen someone like her. - We exchange good news like a rally

566
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,058
I make a stable landing at a place I want

567
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,798
Well-being got added to our conversation topics

568
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,798
- I'm grateful that rap saved me - You guys won't need to compete.

569
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,469
I put up the columns of my house with my verses

570
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,239
I seized the chances with a scoop net

571
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,639
I got dark bags under my eyes due to my intense schedule

572
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
But what can be done?

573
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
- No one can beat that. - There are ups and downs

574
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,409
There are times I feel lonely like Dok Island

575
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,239
But I need to speed up like a Lamborghini

576
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,909
I won't go back, This is a one-way trip

577
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,220
Don't look for me on the ground, It'll be a no-show

578
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,548
- Okay. - Okay.

579
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,249
- Okay. - Okay.

580
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,548
- Okay. - Okay.

581
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,059
Hey.

582
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,319
Oh, no.

583
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,589
- Yes. - Here comes the machine.

584
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,358
How many times should I play this on repeat?

585
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,999
Sitting bench, don't press the stick

586
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,969
My chest be pumping on beat

587
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,429
I ain't obese, but I'm cutting my carbs

588
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,739
So I get a little fit and lean

589
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,038
All my life, I've been fooling myself

590
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,768
Chasing the lucid dreams that don't happen at all

591
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,108
- He's seriously good. - I ain't that young no more

592
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:12,379
Not many days when I'm sober, so hit me on the phone

593
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,179
Busted, I feel the vibration

594
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,348
F that, they need some vibrato

595
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:17,548
Can't even feel my toes

596
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,848
A bit abusive from what I've been told

597
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,588
Mamacita got my back, It's kinda expensive

598
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,249
Need that baggage claim by Thursday

599
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,858
That's my meal for my fat

600
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,659
- He's a strong one. - You're getting arrogant

601
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,788
Because I'm mocking y'all from 9 to 5

602
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,288
All you can do is clear your throat

603
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,929
How did this happen?

604
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,399
It's time to get back on the gear

605
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,028
We'll be stacking up something by the end of the year

606
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,999
My hormones be tangling from working out every day

607
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,338
So I guess I am growing more beard

608
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:43,439
Wake up at 4am, My patterns are getting messed up

609
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,508
I check my phone

610
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,639
- It's like a finishing touch. - Who's up right at this time

611
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,778
To send a message

612
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,649
- It's like Infinite Cypher. - I need to focus on my own stuff

613
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,379
- Should be on a session - This is a good one.

614
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,919
People only care about themselves

615
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,348
But I think that's not an obsession

616
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:56,149
Manifested, yes

617
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,689
- Manifested, yes - He just keeps going.

618
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,459
- He's insane. - Manifested, yes

619
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,890
- This is like two songs. - Manifested, yes

620
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,088
- Manifested, yes - Yes.

621
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,429
Manifested, yes

622
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,329
- He's hurried. - What on earth is up, y'all?

623
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,470
- Manifested, yes - JP!

624
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,739
Yes.

625
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,239
- My goodness. - He's the master of rapping.

626
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,439
- I hope he gets sick next time. - It was so fascinating.

627
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
He played with the beat. How did he do that?

628
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,578
- What a lunatic. - He's an expert.

629
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:22,349
Is JP a monster of the missions?

630
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,680
He's incredible.

631
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,519
I don't know if I did well.

632
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,479
- There's no way he'll lose. - The rhythm was sick.

633
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,588
I think he'll win.

634
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:29,689
Seriously...

635
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,989
- You did better. - That's what I honestly think.

636
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,558
- No, I rapped terribly. - Come on.

637
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,690
If SINCE wins this round, we'll lose.

638
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,029
The result of the vote will be revealed.

639
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,660
(Block Breaker, Block 4 versus Block 5)

640
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,829
SINCE did really well too.

641
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,700
It was unbelievable.

642
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,200
He turned the tables.

643
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,509
What will be the result?

644
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,079
- It's divided. - It's divided.

645
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,380
(SINCE loses with 10 votes. JP wins with 37 votes.)

646
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,949
JP did well.

647
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,179
- JP. - JP did well.

648
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,719
- You were so cool. - Well done.

649
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
You did well.

650
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,319
It was insane.

651
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,518
- Please take off the block mark. - It's okay.

652
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,858
- Thank you. - Let's go.

653
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,858
He crushed SINCE.

654
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,660
He entered the match at the perfect timing.

655
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,098
- Well done. - You were so cool.

656
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,768
The video will be incredible.

657
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,199
Everyone's incredible.

658
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,798
I'll be disgusted if JP chooses the beat right away.

659
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,499
- Big mountains remain. - Yes.

660
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,940
Very big mountains remain.

661
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,369
You're also a huge mountain in their eyes.

662
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,209
I choose the first beat. Let's go.

663
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,339
Let's go.

664
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,479
- Bounce, bounce - He chose the beat he's good at.

665
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
- Come on. - Of course.

666
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,419
Maybe I should call my ex one time

667
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,588
Hold on, these problems are stuck in my darn brain

668
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,318
I keep talking to myself

669
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,758
But I'm practically unconscious, Keep the coffin open

670
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,889
Let's take a short break, I'm back on my own vibe

671
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,329
It's all right, let's go, it's fine

672
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,328
I wish I won several lotteries, I have a mean headache

673
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,798
I pretend to hold back, but I keep moving

674
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,400
But the time passes so slowly

675
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:52,868
I don't believe that I'm sick

676
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,268
I just push myself to excuse myself

677
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,838
There isn't anything I want afterward, so there's no possibility

678
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,379
You'll be locked in my own fantasy

679
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,608
- I'm about to drown - He's so good...

680
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,808
- To my own deep end - at rapping.

681
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,950
- Who will go next? - I don't know.

682
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,180
Yes.

683
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:08,450
- Peace. - PUNCHNELLO!

684
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,349
- PUNCHNELLO. - Hey.

685
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,788
- It's PUNCHNELLO. - Hey.

686
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,789
Will he redeem himself after what he did in Round One?

687
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,489
Boy in the mirror, he's all grown up

688
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,058
A lot of numbers decorate my bank account

689
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,298
- I drink and get drunk all day - He's back.

690
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,699
My eyes are never normal, I'm like a dried pollack

691
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,598
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Okay, whatever

692
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,098
Is throwing things trending now?

693
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,669
I threw and broke things

694
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,038
I look at myself in the mirror, yes

695
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,739
Then I pose and break the mirror

696
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,169
My reflection is a downright mess

697
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,709
I hit it before I sigh, a shot of Jack Daniel's

698
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,239
What a foolish face, bling

699
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,808
What am I supposed to do after I own everything?

700
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,209
Tell me, Mr. Tony Montana

701
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,679
What am I supposed to do now?

702
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,219
Yes, it's messed up, so step aside

703
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,548
I pass out after spitting out my ambition

704
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,318
Yes, it's messed up, so step aside

705
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,719
I pass out after spitting out my ambition

706
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,288
Yes, it's messed up, so step aside

707
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:47,758
I pass out

708
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,929
I pass out after spitting out my ambition

709
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,758
I can't see anything, so I swing my fists around

710
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,229
I've committed too many sins to go to the good place

711
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,699
I duck under alcohol-dripping money and hold my breath

712
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,328
I'm gone, my energy is drained now

713
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,798
I've been hiding my madness among the lunatics

714
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,598
I can't go back now as I've come too far

715
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,200
My sense of direction is awful that I can't find my way back

716
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,970
Holy cow!

717
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,680
That's the PUNCHNELLO I know of.

718
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,508
- Yes, that's PUNCHNELLO. - You crushed it!

719
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,250
That guy is so off-the-wall. He's usually so quiet.

720
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,720
- How did he do that? - PUNCHNELLO was on fire.

721
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,750
The result of the vote will be revealed.

722
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,849
Both of them are amazing rappers with incredible stamina.

723
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,819
- This one is tough. It's close. - Right.

724
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,018
I'm not sure about this one.

725
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,059
We won.

726
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,430
(PUNCHNELLO wins with 41 votes. JP loses with 6 votes.)

727
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,629
That's a bummer.

728
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,269
- PUNCHNELLO! - It's hard to beat two in a row.

729
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,400
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, no. It's okay.

730
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,409
This battle is really close.

731
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,069
But Block Five has fewer rappers.

732
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,538
- They only have three rappers left. - My gosh. That was really quick.

733
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,048
If they lose,

734
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:43,450
half of their block could get eliminated.

735
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,480
Then they'll be in big trouble.

736
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,588
Please play the 17th beat.

737
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,619
That's mine.

738
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,099
I can make it work with this beat.

739
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:03,900
Those fools over there just keep talking

740
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,798
They ask if I've got no pride

741
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,769
And I tell them, "I don't, you jerks"

742
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,609
It's okay. Go!

743
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,538
Take everything, I don't need it now

744
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,608
What are you talking about? My head is spinning every day

745
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,149
What are you going on about, you jerk?

746
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,318
I'm busy, get lost

747
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,949
- He's back. - Drink it up, bring me the whiskey

748
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,048
- What do you want to do? - My head is spinning every day

749
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,049
- Do you want to? To play it safe? - What are you going on about?

750
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,618
- It doesn't matter. MASON, take it. - I'm busy, get lost

751
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,058
Drink it up, bring me the whiskey

752
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,389
I drink and smoke like a lunatic, I rap to make money

753
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,429
I toss it out after using it up

754
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,159
I crawl everywhere as if it's no big deal

755
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,699
Then I roll down my stiff shoulders, get that away

756
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,899
You think acting stupid is my thing?

757
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,500
No, I've always been stupid

758
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,028
You think acting stupid is my thing?

759
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,598
No, I've always been stupid

760
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,640
Take that!

761
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,670
I see. MASON HOME will go for it?

762
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:44,339
This is the perfect beat for MASON HOME.

763
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:48,609
- Let's go! - Yes.

764
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,910
- OKASHII! - Let's go.

765
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,778
Hit the one and another one

766
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,219
It feels like I make money rain

767
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,848
You're not trapping on this beat and game

768
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,249
You're doing it like the funny gang

769
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,118
- I can now rake in - He's good. Nice.

770
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,318
I'm trying again

771
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,189
Now, don't trust them

772
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,459
You're doing it like the funny gang

773
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,329
So... Yes...

774
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,599
What? He forgot his verse?

775
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,568
- It's okay! - Let's get it!

776
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,939
- Yes. - Hey!

777
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,608
Hit the one and another one

778
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,078
It feels like I make money rain

779
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,709
I'm banging it, man

780
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,749
I eat it up, Pac Man

781
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,779
Hey.

782
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:25,579
My gosh, this one...

783
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,980
- My gosh, this one... - He's a good one. It was his beat.

784
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,519
His opponent was way too good.

785
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,559
- PUNCHNELLO's energy was stronger. - Right.

786
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,490
The result of the vote will be revealed.

787
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,500
We won.

788
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,828
(PUNCHNELLO wins with 38 votes. MASON HOME loses with 9 votes.)

789
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,000
- Hey! - Nice!

790
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,798
PUNCHNELLO!

791
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,569
Block Five only has Hash Swan and Mckdaddy now?

792
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,508
I'm so sorry.

793
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,569
- Gosh, no. - It's okay.

794
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,739
- We... - Is our verse too dry?

795
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,508
Let's get our energy up. Come on, we've got to fight it.

796
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,680
I didn't imagine that we'd lose to our opponents this quickly.

797
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,220
All of a sudden, I got nervous.

798
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,920
"What? Are we going to lose?"

799
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,788
I'll go with the 18th beat.

800
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,899
If this beat is faster than the last one, I'll go.

801
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,960
If it's not, you'll go.

802
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,739
Me and Kidd King

803
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,969
Yes, Min Hyuk, let's just take the money

804
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,970
I don't care about your livelihood

805
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,538
Get lost, yes, I made it

806
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,139
- Yes! - I got here on my own, I'm better

807
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,209
Middle finger to my enemy

808
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,008
You have no idea that I paved this path for everyone

809
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,778
Then you'd better kneel, don't you know who I am?

810
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,078
Shut your mouth, and pay me your dues

811
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,848
Forget about your clan, yes, so who are you?

812
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,389
Get lost, you jerk, I'm on my own

813
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,818
Forget about your clan and opinion

814
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,518
You must've thought I was easy, get your head on the ground

815
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,719
All you talk is nonsense

816
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,588
Shut your mouth, and pay your dues, I bet you didn't know

817
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,959
I take everything, yes, we take everything

818
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,329
- I'll wipe you clean - Who's going next?

819
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,258
There's no way I'll go back, for sure

820
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,798
I'll be objective, so get lost

821
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,328
I'm ready to fire my best shot every day

822
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,899
I'm a lawn mower that weeds out the newbies

823
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,298
You know nothing, but your mouth keeps moving

824
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,068
I can't breathe because I've accomplished so much

825
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,868
Don't block my path, and get lost, I'll keep going up and up

826
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,680
No one can stop us, for real

827
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,109
It's Hash Swan.

828
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,319
- Hash Swan hasn't gone yet. - Hey.

829
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,919
- Let's go, man! - Let's go!

830
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,118
From paradise to purgatory

831
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,660
I feel like Dante

832
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,518
My next life will probably be

833
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,630
- His rap is delicious. - In Mangwon

834
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,829
- Okay! - Deungchon Outlet in Mangwon

835
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,558
My high school friend

836
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,028
Drank too much today as always

837
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,129
Hey, forget it, hang up the phone, I can hear your brain whizzing

838
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,798
I paid back everything, it was my mom's deposit

839
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,338
I try to transcend myself, that's me, Tony

840
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,108
I melted two necklaces from the show and made a froggy bonnet

841
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,008
What? The champagne glasses hanging upside down

842
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:32,679
There come Holmes and my wayside

843
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I go to paradise every night

844
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,680
Yes.

845
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,680
Gosh, that was good.

846
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,980
I'm not sure about this one.

847
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,689
Goodness, why is this so hard?

848
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,618
I'll go with a better live performance.

849
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,819
This one is really tough.

850
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,190
I really don't know whom to vote for.

851
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,789
The result of the vote will be revealed.

852
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,559
Please!

853
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,199
(Block 4 has 5 rappers left.)

854
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,569
(On the other hand, Block 5 has only 2 rappers left.)

855
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,709
- What? - It's neck and neck.

856
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,710
Aren't they off by a vote only?

857
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,279
He won by one vote. Oh, my!

858
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,109
- One vote? - One vote?

859
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,420
Aren't they off by a vote only?

860
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,349
Aren't they off by a vote only?

861
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,890
(Hash Swan of Block 5 wins.)

862
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:19,118
- This one was really close! - He won by one vote!

863
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,558
- Goodness, 1 vote. - He won only by 1 vote.

864
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,859
Winning rapper,

865
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:25,229
take off the losing rapper's block mark.

866
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,660
- My gosh, they were both good. - Right.

867
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,328
- Well done. - Great job.

868
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,568
- You crushed it. - Gosh, seriously.

869
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:31,569
You were so cool.

870
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:32,569
This is going to be fun now.

871
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,699
- This is fun. - It's going to be good now.

872
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,170
I'm not sure who's going to win now.

873
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,839
I'll go with the second beat.

874
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,980
I'm sure skyminhyuk will take this one.

875
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,379
- I'll go. - You think you can do it?

876
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,410
Yes, I can.

877
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,720
Swan.

878
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,049
It suits him.

879
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,288
My wrist is shining, and it's prime time

880
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,289
It's raining money, sorry

881
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,788
Forget about your tequila, My bad, it's old news now

882
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,058
I feel like a boss, Even when I get a nosebleed

883
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,288
I still shine

884
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,489
I lived in Gimpo for five years

885
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,028
Now, I'm spotted in Yeouido

886
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,429
I don't want to get your problem

887
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,999
I don't want to get your diamonds

888
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,598
- He's so cool. - I wanted to drive a Porsche

889
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,599
That's why I got my driver's license

890
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,999
- He's good. - We're on the 24th floor

891
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,199
- He's good. - We're on the 24th floor

892
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,639
It's way too high that my ears are hurting

893
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,108
So I needed 911

894
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,439
It's our prime time, yes

895
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,679
It's my prime time, right

896
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,739
My dream came true

897
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,108
Cheese on, The Quiett's camera

898
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,109
I dream about

899
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,979
What more I can have and visualize them

900
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,278
I'm the nutcase

901
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,720
Who can say things you can't daresay

902
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,048
- My gosh, this is crazy. - I had lots of time in high school

903
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,558
Now, people line up to buy my time now

904
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,588
People waste 15 seconds

905
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,288
On YouTube to see us

906
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,858
The underground scene in Mangwon is sold out

907
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:31,229
It's Victoria Secret now

908
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,758
- There he is. - That was so cool.

909
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:35,099
- There he is! - Oh, my!

910
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,430
- This is it. - Hello.

911
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,068
I'm Sky.

912
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,109
- Sky! Swag! - Let's go!

913
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,868
I realized that he got the momentum going.

914
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,079
But I knew it was my time to shine.

915
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
People say I changed

916
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:49,879
But I'll deny it

917
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,608
I'm not done yet

918
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,719
Put wings on me

919
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,219
I've got GRANDLINE by my side

920
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,419
- I'm with my homies - He's getting started.

921
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,848
The thought of wanting to survive

922
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,759
Makes me stronger too

923
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,288
- The night is over, the sun's up - My gosh.

924
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,088
- He's aggressive. - No matter what you say

925
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,288
I won't think about giving up for now

926
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,028
- I don't want to die yet - He's good.

927
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,529
To think I'll give up on my dream, my last flame is burning up

928
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,399
- Even if it's time to give up - Hey!

929
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,528
I'll give my best

930
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,739
- What on earth did you do? - Hey!

931
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,169
- Why are you tired? - Hey!

932
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,838
I'll tell you exactly who I am

933
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,068
You can take everything from me

934
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,409
But I can't let you have hip-hop, never

935
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,739
Dream on, and keep breathing

936
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,048
I may not be the same innocent boy

937
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,909
But I'll keep breaking my limit and open my eyes wide

938
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,419
- Take a good look around you - He went the farthest.

939
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,479
The world is on your side

940
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,018
Don't give your enemies the middle finger

941
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:30,149
Embrace them with love

942
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,889
I'll give courage to people who said I couldn't make it

943
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,429
Without hiding anything to the people who believe in me

944
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,258
I'll give them everything, and the only thing I can't do now

945
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:40,930
Is to stop my flow on this beat

946
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,299
Get that through your head

947
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,970
Get that through your head

948
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,039
His rap is delicious.

949
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,539
Get that through your head

950
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:50,640
Get what through our head?

951
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,079
Okay!

952
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,479
- We got it. - We got it.

953
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,508
My gosh, this one...

954
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,079
Hash Swan did a good job, though.

955
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,980
Goodness, he kept pushing with his energy.

956
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,118
- He's determined. - Right. Seriously.

957
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,420
- I love his energy. - That was amazing.

958
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,519
Which one do you prefer?

959
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,220
(Skyminhyuk)

960
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,389
My goodness, that was really hot.

961
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,058
- Right. - Gosh, this was crazy.

962
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,299
- Do we seem too down? - I kept doing this.

963
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,430
I guess we were supposed to run around more.

964
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,529
The result of the vote will be revealed.

965
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,970
Let's see.

966
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,410
(skyminhyuk wins with 36 votes. Hash Swan loses with 11 votes.)

967
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,019
That was a legendary performance.

968
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,618
Winning rapper, take off...

969
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:39,319
- the losing rapper's block mark. - Let's go!

970
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,889
They only have Mckdaddy left.

971
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,629
- Right. - It must be a lot of pressure.

972
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,689
It's just Mckdaddy now.

973
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,599
But he just has to beat skyminhyuk and Boi B.

974
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,470
- Then he might have a shot. - Those two are weak.

975
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,039
I think Mckdaddy can turn the table around.

976
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,869
What verse could put a stop to this momentum right now?

977
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,039
My goodness. This is getting complicated.

978
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,880
Okay. I'll go with the eighth beat.

979
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,109
Let's go.

980
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,389
What is this?

981
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,559
Let's go!

982
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,829
In the past

983
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,399
In the past when I rapped, people disapproved

984
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,129
If you don't get my vibe, just take a corner

985
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,569
A tooth for a tooth

986
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,638
I'm like Bruce Lee, and now, I feel like Kwon Sang Woo

987
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,638
Uzi on my tongue, after battling it for several years

988
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,138
My tracks have been a hit one after another

989
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,468
I got the upper hand, when you run away,

990
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,808
I punch you in the stomach

991
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,408
After sinking you down, I'll bet my chips

992
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,308
I can pay for omakase with my lady without installments, feel that swag

993
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,479
Look at the color of his face, it's the shade of grapes

994
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,219
Back to the basement, the most successful fugitive

995
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,859
Time to run, I can bite all the hunting dogs

996
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,118
- He's going down again? - Hey, stop coming here.

997
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,058
Time to run, I can bite all the hunting dogs

998
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,029
This game is a series of betrayals

999
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,759
I'll take the one for the team

1000
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,468
They just lie all day long, no

1001
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,169
I want to dominate on those stupid rappers

1002
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,769
I'm an amazing rapper, so I'm okay

1003
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,509
I've got to take a breath

1004
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,309
Breathing into the fire, okay?

1005
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,209
Kill Five!

1006
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,909
Kill Five!

1007
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,179
My gosh.

1008
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:18,050
- He's a great performer. - That was crazy.

1009
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,719
Yes.

1010
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,919
Just be you!

1011
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,118
No pressure!

1012
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,558
Just be yourself! You can do it.

1013
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,699
- Come on. - Yes.

1014
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,158
I don't know where I came from

1015
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,928
I can't even guess it, I just follow my heart

1016
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:31,468
That's what I did, and here's what I know for sure

1017
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,698
I know where I'm headed

1018
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,339
I turn down easy wins

1019
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,109
- I'll end up owning them all - My gosh, he's so good.

1020
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,709
I, MCK, took a big step

1021
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,408
My status keeps pushing me on

1022
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,509
I never compromise

1023
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,538
The warning signs go off every day, and I test my fate

1024
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,009
You sell your dreams on eBay

1025
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,779
Sorry, I'm too good for you to beat now

1026
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,518
You can't beat me until I retire, I'll take you out

1027
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,078
I'm on people's lips

1028
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,848
I buried my past on top of the seeds

1029
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,419
- His rap is so cool and solid. - I already got a taste and am blind

1030
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,460
I've created something I can't take back

1031
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,988
This is fate, the mirage from last night is vivid

1032
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,859
Regardless of the times, I can top it

1033
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,558
I'm the boss, the hero, and the master

1034
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,799
I'll be in the top five and take that spot

1035
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,968
With this skill, I'm well-versed

1036
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,629
It's only a way to spread my name

1037
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,368
There's no downhill for me, the uphill path may be tough

1038
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,070
But squeeze out my past memories

1039
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,039
- My gosh. - Yes!

1040
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,710
This is hard.

1041
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,979
They're different.

1042
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,408
- It depends on your preference. - It really comes down to that.

1043
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,379
Gosh, both of them were so good.

1044
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,879
His rap is so sharp and piercing.

1045
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,078
Yes, his rap was good.

1046
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,749
- Chop it. Slice it. - Yes.

1047
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,289
But skyminhyuk's rap did draw me in.

1048
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,289
This one is tough. It's really tough.

1049
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,900
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1050
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,260
My gosh.

1051
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,698
Let's get ready to throw him into the air.

1052
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,069
- To throw him into the air? - Yes.

1053
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,039
(Block Breaker)

1054
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,139
My gosh.

1055
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:48,840
I'm so nervous.

1056
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,509
- My gosh. - What?

1057
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,750
- What? - It came down to one vote.

1058
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:59,190
(skyminhyuk wins with 27 votes. Mckdaddy loses with 20 votes.)

1059
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,559
(skyminhyuk of Block 4 wins.)

1060
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,289
Good work!

1061
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,599
I didn't even get to go, but it's over.

1062
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,769
He's heavy.

1063
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,739
We only defeated three of them.

1064
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:18,669
You know what? They had a good strategy in the beginning.

1065
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,908
I thought Block Five was invincible.

1066
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,279
No one wanted to go after them.

1067
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,408
COCONA started off the battle and took all the momentum.

1068
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,749
This is crazy.

1069
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,379
They used their raw energy to win this battle.

1070
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,679
It was all about their energy.

1071
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,948
(Block 4 wins, and Block 5 loses.)

1072
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,590
- My gosh. - Thank you.

1073
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,419
- We'll accept our defeat. - We'll accept our defeat.

1074
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,388
- We'll accept our defeat. - We totally accept our defeat.

1075
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,829
Gosh, seriously.

1076
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,428
It was really exhilarating.

1077
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,268
The fact that all of us survived...

1078
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,868
It was really amazing.

1079
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,799
I'm so proud of everyone on my team. I love them.

1080
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,109
Actually, the most thrilling moment of this match was...

1081
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,408
PUNCHNELLO is back.

1082
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:53,908
PUNCHNELLO. He's crazy about rap.

1083
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:54,939
It felt like dreaming.

1084
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,479
I wasn't confident.

1085
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,050
But I felt reassured to have them as my team.

1086
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,050
I think I contributed to our win in a small way.

1087
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,718
At least for this battle.

1088
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,760
(Chuckling)

1089
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Good job.

1090
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,629
- Nice work. - Good job.

1091
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,959
Well, some things are bound to happen.

1092
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,300
- Right. - It's bitter, though.

1093
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,098
But here's the problem.

1094
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,400
We don't know whom JP chose for the elimination.

1095
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,499
We should think about the elimination.

1096
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,009
Now, people will get eliminated.

1097
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,570
That was more concerning.

1098
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,408
Next, Blocks 1 and 7...

1099
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,809
will compete in the match.

1100
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:34,880
I really don't know which block is going to win.

1101
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,489
- This is going to be fun. - Hey, you got this.

1102
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,488
But don't hit me. Good luck.

1103
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,698
My gosh. This is a big match!

1104
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,058
This one is going to be fun to watch.

1105
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,729
It's going to be really fun.

1106
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,630
My gosh, this one is going to be intense.

1107
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,739
I think this match might be the highlight.

1108
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,009
- Good luck. - Let's go, Don Mills!

1109
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,139
He's still got it.

1110
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:02,779
The rappers in Block One seemed really tough.

1111
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,510
They seemed very masculine.

1112
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,679
They were like beasts.

1113
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,480
This one will be fierce.

1114
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,889
JTONG looks like he belongs in a noir movie.

1115
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,919
Of course, JTONG is the one I feel the most threatened by.

1116
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,319
I can only say it's because it's JTONG.

1117
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,589
Through his first performance,

1118
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,429
he showed us why he's a force to be reckoned with.

1119
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,428
- I see big guys over there too. - They're big.

1120
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,500
- Right? - Yes.

1121
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,070
It seemed their style was influenced by the hip-hop scene abroad.

1122
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:28,500
They looked like real hip-hop gangsters.

1123
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,768
Even the girl on that block is tall.

1124
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,369
Their builds are unbelievable.

1125
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,749
They remind me of the American game, "GTA."

1126
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,250
They definitely exuded an overwhelming presence.

1127
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,118
We couldn't underestimate any of them.

1128
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,448
They all had an element of surprise.

1129
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,448
They're very unique too.

1130
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,859
Owen is the rapper I considered the strongest.

1131
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,929
I think he's a great rapper.

1132
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,900
I didn't see this coming. But Owen...

1133
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,269
He made me worry.

1134
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:58,800
- That suits you. - This one...

1135
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,010
(Owen didn't feel good when the block was practicing.)

1136
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,879
I think he had a cold.

1137
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,920
He was under the weather the whole time.

1138
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,260
He seemed a lot worse than I thought.

1139
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,389
Oh, shoot.

1140
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,630
- Do you want Tylenol? - No, I'm okay.

1141
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,269
It...

1142
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,869
Owen, do you want to go in the first half?

1143
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,739
I'm not feeling good at all.

1144
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,879
Ultimately, being able to use him...

1145
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
at least once in the match was important for the block.

1146
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,489
So I'm a bit worried.

1147
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,259
Korean savages versus real gangsters.

1148
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,920
My gosh, this is intense.

1149
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,530
Okay. I'll do my best, sir.

1150
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:01,859
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1151
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,900
He's so cool.

1152
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,369
Do your best, my junior.

1153
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,210
Nice. This is great.

1154
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,840
The way they talked to each other was really funny.

1155
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,980
- My gosh. There's a boomer. - Goodness.

1156
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,738
That was a sensitive topic!

1157
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,980
- My gosh. That's intense. - Goodness.

1158
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,150
It's like a skit.

1159
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,348
Both blocks have a fierce image on the show.

1160
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,218
It might be energy versus energy.

1161
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:28,690
I bet this one will be a bloodbath.

1162
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:33,829
The Block Match between Block 1 and Block 7...

1163
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,300
will begin now.

1164
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,530
Let's go!

1165
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Ready.

1166
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:42,909
Gosh, this one will be fun.

1167
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,639
Start.

1168
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:48,408
I like the beat.

1169
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,679
- Yes. - Hey.

1170
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,779
- GOLDBUUDA! - GOLDBUUDA!

1171
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,848
- GOLDBUUDA! - GOLDBUUDA!

1172
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,689
- GOLDBUUDA! - GOLDBUUDA!

1173
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,718
- GOLDBUUDA. - We'll win this one, 100 percent.

1174
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,229
GB coming from Miami, they just better believe

1175
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,529
From day one, I've been stacking on them like cold Cheddar cheese

1176
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,299
- His rap is quite dandy. - I flew countless miles to be here

1177
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,828
Yes, we're still on this

1178
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:09,928
I can't even tell who's my ally

1179
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:11,828
- Should I go? - Or who's my enemy

1180
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,169
I'm done counting all the bodies

1181
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,399
I got rid of them

1182
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,669
Do you want to boss up your life?

1183
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,169
- All you have to do is - I'm not sure about this one.

1184
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,968
Get in with me, when we walk into the club

1185
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,178
We're going to murk all those villains

1186
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,408
And I'm generous with my dough

1187
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:24,078
So I won't regret later because I've already got

1188
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,809
His respect and favor

1189
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,589
- Let's go, Marv. - Let's go!

1190
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,949
- Yes. - Let's go.

1191
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,989
He's good too.

1192
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:35,860
He and JP have a similar style.

1193
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,629
If your heart is the diamond, it can't hold a candle to mine

1194
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,999
- I stick to what I've been doing - Gosh, he's good.

1195
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,328
When the sun goes down

1196
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,999
- No future's guaranteed, right now - He's really good.

1197
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,269
I must escape this place, my hometown I see every day

1198
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,069
I go on with my day, my eyes fixed on the to-do list

1199
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,578
Then my pocket gets deep, and my guts get bigger

1200
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,348
Not all of my track has to be a hit

1201
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:57,749
I know life is unfair

1202
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,419
When I catch a lucky break, everyone gets jealous

1203
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,479
Say, yes

1204
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,420
- Yes. - Yes.

1205
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,920
(The voting begins.)

1206
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,859
When it's about drawing people in, he'll win no matter what.

1207
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,929
What do I do? The beat was perfect for Marv.

1208
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,460
His rap was much better.

1209
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,329
The first one sounded pretty much monotone.

1210
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,929
(The voting is closed.)

1211
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,070
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1212
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:22,598
(Block Breaker)

1213
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,769
It's 8-on-8.

1214
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,780
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1215
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,739
My gosh, I guess it was a landslide.

1216
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,320
(GOLDBUUDA loses with 7 votes. Marv wins with 37 votes.)

1217
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:37,519
(Marv of Block 7 wins.)

1218
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,618
- Yes. - Winning rapper,

1219
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,289
take off the losing rapper's block mark.

1220
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,129
It was a given.

1221
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,230
- No. - So close.

1222
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:49,598
Marv has a great voice.

1223
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,769
This is what I wanted to see.

1224
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:53,468
- Was it comfortable to watch? - I just like him.

1225
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:55,238
When the beat number gets announced,

1226
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,939
- I'll read the name. - Okay.

1227
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,940
Good.

1228
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,780
(Block Breaker)

1229
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,610
- It's okay. You did well. - It's okay.

1230
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,649
- It's okay. - You did well.

1231
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,849
They're really strong.

1232
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,719
Give me the 12th beat. Let's go.

1233
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:13,018
This is yours.

1234
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,689
Yes I'm a menace

1235
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,919
Shooting is my hobby

1236
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,959
- I'm the man in the middle - He's good.

1237
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,529
Feel like a Dabin, I get to giggle

1238
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,299
- Can you do this? - I dive on the beat and make rhythm

1239
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,058
Go home if you can't do it

1240
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,698
Get lost to the arms of your parents

1241
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,198
I run in my inline skates

1242
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,939
It's too fast, but I'm fine

1243
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,968
I don't do with that, Shake off your worries

1244
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,468
Get far away from all the negative feelings

1245
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:32,808
Like a walkie-talkie, while walking

1246
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:34,908
I organize my day in my head

1247
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,408
Even if I wear my slippers the wrong way

1248
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,348
I just walk if that fits me better

1249
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,078
There's nothing more stupid than giving me the answers

1250
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,880
I'm above that

1251
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,750
Good going!

1252
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,928
Gangsters, tattoos on our bodies

1253
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:57,629
Seen a lot of that? Then you'd be surprised while having fun with us

1254
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,729
Let's go

1255
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,598
Look at me again

1256
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,069
What's the matter with the time?

1257
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,069
I can't wait, let me have fun

1258
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,709
I don't need Mom's nagging

1259
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,479
- They're weird - I think we won this.

1260
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,979
- Good. - Mom's phone calls

1261
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,979
I won't pick them up anymore, I'll go crazy today

1262
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,718
Like a gangster

1263
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,018
Why is this addictive?

1264
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:17,189
Shout until your lips go pale

1265
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,489
Let's jump in together

1266
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:20,589
Like a gangster

1267
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,788
Like a gangster

1268
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:24,129
Shout until the underwears tear off

1269
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,229
Let's jump in together

1270
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,260
Let's go

1271
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:29,260
Like a gangster

1272
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,739
- He went with the energy. - Let's go.

1273
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,010
That was hot.

1274
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,679
He's the gangster!

1275
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:43,909
Like a gangster

1276
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,908
- Like a gangster - That was good.

1277
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,018
It almost got loose, but he picked it up at the end.

1278
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:50,089
This is bad. I was bewitched.

1279
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,948
Me too. I was bewitched.

1280
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,260
What is this?

1281
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,659
It sticks in your head.

1282
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,260
(The voting is closed.)

1283
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,389
I'm curious.

1284
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,800
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1285
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,599
Let's go.

1286
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:15,010
(Kang Hyuk wins with 28 votes. Marv loses with 16 votes.)

1287
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,250
(Block 1's Kang Hyuk wins.)

1288
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,550
Well done.

1289
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,150
Here you go.

1290
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,058
Well done.

1291
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:29,789
- Well done. - You did well.

1292
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,159
I'll go now.

1293
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,300
The verse was "Like a gangster," so "like gangster" won.

1294
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,570
He's a performer.

1295
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:39,869
He'll have a good performance.

1296
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,570
This is fun.

1297
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,610
It gets clear to me after watching this...

1298
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,880
that the energy on stage is very important.

1299
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,880
I'll go with number 20. Let's go.

1300
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,250
- What is this? - What is this?

1301
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,388
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1302
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:00,319
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1303
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,189
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1304
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,328
I'm crazy

1305
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:05,359
I want detox

1306
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,459
- So wait, soon I'll be a demon - This was a twist.

1307
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,859
Soon I'll be a demon

1308
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,968
- Soon I'll be a demon - Who'd do this?

1309
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:11,968
When do I take the pills?

1310
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,468
Right after breakfast

1311
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:14,968
- Right after lunch - Right after lunch

1312
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,169
- Right after dinner - Right after dinner

1313
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,808
What is this? I don't know

1314
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:19,169
I don't know what it is

1315
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,479
I take more pills

1316
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,238
- Tray B or Polodared would do it. - I get crazier

1317
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,379
I blow away the money I saved

1318
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,110
- He'd do it really well. - We go bang, BigBang

1319
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,919
Bang

1320
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,948
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1321
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,618
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1322
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,988
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1323
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:41,099
D-O-P-A-M-I-N-E

1324
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:46,800
It's Tray B.

1325
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:51,109
Darn you

1326
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,880
Darn you

1327
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,908
All my brothers, we wore matching black shirts

1328
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,408
Where are we going?

1329
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,980
We don't think about it

1330
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,448
I can't control my brother

1331
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,948
You're darned

1332
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:05,249
I said, "Put the mask on"

1333
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,859
My whole squad go into action

1334
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,359
I need the money and money all day

1335
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,959
So I cannot funk with nobody like

1336
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,859
No matter how many great albums he has or how much he earned

1337
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,428
It's nothing if you're not my brother

1338
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:14,459
You cannot call me your friend

1339
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,129
- He's "gee" like Girls' Generation - He's really good.

1340
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,598
- He's so good. - They never tested me at school

1341
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,170
But they try to test me

1342
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,939
They would be like, "Tray B, why are you so hard?"

1343
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,538
I don't see you as a person if you're not my brother

1344
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,038
I feel like I'm Kiturami, too hot

1345
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,639
I feel like I'm Johnny Dang, busting my opponent

1346
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:26,979
Catch me on block

1347
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,638
You don't have money but you've got a lot of time

1348
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,149
Dirty Play, YEL, we're going to bow

1349
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,650
Tray B is back right now

1350
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:44,729
Encore.

1351
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,729
- Encore. - Encore.

1352
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,729
- Encore. - Encore.

1353
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,730
They said "encore."

1354
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,730
- Encore is amazing. - What's going on?

1355
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:54,639
Tray B!

1356
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:56,538
This is bad. What do we do?

1357
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:57,570
I want to watch it again.

1358
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:58,768
It was so fun.

1359
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,840
It's like I came to a show.

1360
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,538
This is an expensive show.

1361
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,879
- Tray B was really good. - He really was.

1362
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,049
It was very nice.

1363
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,110
Tray B.

1364
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:08,150
He's good. They both were really good.

1365
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,519
The result will be revealed.

1366
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:19,030
(Kang Hyuk loses with 6 votes. Tray B wins with 38 votes.)

1367
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,460
(Block 7's Tray B wins.)

1368
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,598
The winning rapper,

1369
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,139
take off the losing rapper's block mark.

1370
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,070
That was really good.

1371
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,939
"Darn you" was really awesome.

1372
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:35,079
That made him look like a very strong person.

1373
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,749
Well done.

1374
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,808
- I'm sorry. - Don't worry.

1375
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,779
- You did really well. - You did really well.

1376
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,848
Good.

1377
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,519
I just need two more from Tray B.

1378
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:46,989
I'll go with number eight. Let's go.

1379
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,929
He's going with it right away.

1380
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,238
Darn you

1381
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:05,809
- Darn you - Darn you

1382
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,538
Money is the best no matter what

1383
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,749
I'm the national MC, it all turns out as I say

1384
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,109
You all pretend to be strong

1385
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,549
But you're too small for me, No, Michelangelo

1386
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,218
- He's good. - I've been in my booth 24-7

1387
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:18,419
While they talk about me, I develop myself every day

1388
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,359
SCH YEL, We're going to boom

1389
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,320
BIG, Tray B, they know what I do

1390
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,289
I sigh listening to your rap

1391
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,428
Your rap doesn't have dreams

1392
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:28,259
Fake rapper, they never talk true

1393
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,268
Fake rapper, you're talking about who?

1394
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:32,169
My brothers are so hard, I knew

1395
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,138
- You know who I am - Is this difficult?

1396
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,339
Tray B and my brothers

1397
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,138
- I always make new, adios - Do you want to do this?

1398
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:38,139
I'm thinking.

1399
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,839
SCH YEL, we're not

1400
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,280
But we blow together like

1401
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,150
I can do it too.

1402
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,149
I choose from the tags

1403
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,419
Tray B, I'll keep it thugging

1404
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,948
And balling like I'm DeRozan

1405
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,718
- I don't know who's next to me - This was really good.

1406
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:51,788
I feel like I'm Chief Keef

1407
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:53,119
I don't like

1408
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,888
- Darn you - Darn you

1409
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,729
- Darn you - Darn you

1410
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,730
He's really good.

1411
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,400
He was flowing.

1412
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:06,639
I thought he won that round. But...

1413
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,849
- Yes, JTONG! - Now?

1414
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,949
- Darn. - Darn.

1415
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,618
I run hard on the track every night

1416
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,718
I'm the one wearing all-black

1417
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,488
The big presence on stage is coming

1418
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,558
I'm 185cm, they call me TONG

1419
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,488
He just does it in public

1420
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:32,328
- He stops it with long branches - He'd be really scared.

1421
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,299
I fix it deeply front and back

1422
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,329
I can't hold it, I'm coming

1423
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,899
Let's make it through

1424
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,969
Experience it, my level goes through the roof

1425
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,598
I bark toward a higher wealth

1426
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,409
Woof

1427
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,908
I'll bark when I'm in the booth

1428
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:52,380
- He might skin him. - The roof because I got the truth

1429
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,678
I got a lot accomplished

1430
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,649
- He's really unrivaled. - I followed my heart

1431
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,718
- I'm stubborn like a rock - He's really cool.

1432
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,719
I came from the mountain

1433
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,558
Take a deep breath and bring my energy up

1434
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,518
Now watch me, I refine my lines

1435
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,860
Microphone and logic, My nail and hammer

1436
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,360
I go back to a pile of dirt

1437
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,328
I got a lot accomplished

1438
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:12,029
I followed my heart

1439
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,468
I carve in my best from start to end

1440
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,368
I go back to a pile of dirt

1441
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:18,110
- Yes! - Yes.

1442
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,579
JTONG.

1443
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,380
I got goosebumps.

1444
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,749
Darn you

1445
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,819
- Darn you - Darn you

1446
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,949
Darn you too!

1447
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,459
This is difficult.

1448
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,690
How do I do this?

1449
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:38,960
This is difficult. What do I do? No.

1450
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,599
I don't know.

1451
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:43,300
- This is really... - I don't know about this.

1452
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:46,369
I don't know. I'll just press it.

1453
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,940
I don't know about this. I think it could be even.

1454
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,039
There are so many people who rap well.

1455
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,110
It's so hard to make a living.

1456
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:57,408
(The voting is closed.)

1457
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:58,779
Who do you think won?

1458
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,019
I don't know yet. The energy...

1459
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,019
I think Tray B rapped better.

1460
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,789
No. There's no way...

1461
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,820
Our captain shouldn't lose.

1462
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,090
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1463
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,828
(Block Breaker)

1464
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:15,230
It would be awesome if he defeats him here.

1465
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,500
What would it be?

1466
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,170
What?

1467
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,069
Darn.

1468
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,709
Go. Let's go.

1469
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,039
Goodness.

1470
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:28,079
What?

1471
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,550
(What's the result of the two rappers' battle?)

1472
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,119
- Yes! - Yes!

1473
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,388
(Block 7's Tray B wins.)

1474
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:42,359
- Darn you. - Darn you.

1475
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,629
(JTONG loses with 21 votes. Tray B wins with 23 votes.)

1476
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,159
We lacked two votes.

1477
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,199
It's okay.

1478
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:50,899
Two votes?

1479
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,900
- Two votes. - What?

1480
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,900
- Goodness. - How?

1481
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:58,138
I can't believe I'm watching this.

1482
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,509
- But he was really good. - He was really good.

1483
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,209
Tray B is really strong.

1484
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,279
He's really strong. He's so good.

1485
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,579
I really liked JTONG's performance.

1486
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,249
You never know what would happen.

1487
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,889
You never know.

1488
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:14,018
The winning rapper,

1489
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:16,518
take off the losing rapper's block mark.

1490
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,658
(Block Breaker)

1491
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:19,589
- Tray B. - Tray B.

1492
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,259
- Tray B. - Tray B.

1493
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,828
We got on the flow.

1494
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:25,869
It's turning out the way we planned.

1495
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,369
Goodness.

1496
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,968
- We have the flow. - Well done.

1497
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:31,070
Well done.

1498
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,038
It was so close.

1499
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:35,308
- It was nice. - Well done.

1500
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:37,379
- You did well. - It's okay.

1501
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,409
Let's see what beat this one is.

1502
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,179
I'll go with number 11.

1503
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,719
It's a beat he's good with.

1504
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,030
Darn you

1505
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:56,159
- Darn you - Darn you

1506
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,698
What number is this?

1507
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,339
- I'll go. - You'll go?

1508
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,638
Look, look at my eyes

1509
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,408
Tray B is spicy, I need me the ice

1510
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:05,069
I'm annoying so don't try

1511
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,678
They all imitate the YEL style

1512
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,509
- I think Fleeky Bang will come out. - Hit the club hit them up dot squad

1513
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,749
You watch that from the side and secretly take a picture

1514
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,109
They're all like BE'O

1515
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,078
Because we're stars and they're counting stars

1516
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,518
They all miss and we're mister

1517
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,149
Broke boys, get out of my way

1518
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,348
- Just watch me - Why is he so good?

1519
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,558
I feel like I'm T-ara, You drive me crazy

1520
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,058
A hundred out of a hundred They're wasting my time

1521
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:25,029
- Turn the heater off, because I'm - Fleeky Bang will come out.

1522
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,729
We're going to pull up on your block every day, every night

1523
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,529
SCH YEL, let's go

1524
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,999
Me and my brother, let's go

1525
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,799
Tray B is here, let's go

1526
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,569
I go around your neighborhood, Let's go

1527
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,569
- I'll show you, let's go. - Let's go

1528
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,808
Yes, let's go

1529
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:39,109
- Yes, let's go - Let's go

1530
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,808
Yes, let's go

1531
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:44,249
- SCH YEL, let's go - Let's go

1532
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,250
Darn you

1533
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:46,749
Darn you

1534
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,320
Why isn't Fleeky Bang coming out?

1535
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,089
(Darn you)

1536
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,919
Darn you

1537
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,328
- Darn you - Respect.

1538
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,689
Darn you

1539
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,359
She's trying to keep airplane mode

1540
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,098
She still wants to play more

1541
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,328
- What's that? - Party going wild for the night

1542
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:06,468
- What's that? - Destroy this like claymore

1543
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,299
She knows what's her asset

1544
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,038
Why do you see me with the same set

1545
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,768
Can't even see where the stains are at

1546
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,609
Already on the next thing

1547
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:15,238
- Next thing, next stage - He's good.

1548
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,879
We're on a van then hold that up

1549
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,379
Living like vacation

1550
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,678
Still laid back, tied up with a session cascade

1551
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,419
Why do you try to work on it

1552
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,189
They all try to work on it

1553
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,948
Stop coming at me

1554
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,989
Just head out if you won't play

1555
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,729
- Darn you - Darn you

1556
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,929
- Darn you - Darn you

1557
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,730
- That's powerful. - Goodness.

1558
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,238
What are you talking about?

1559
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,300
(What are you talking about?)

1560
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,739
Goodness.

1561
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,138
This is crazy.

1562
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,709
- This is so hard. - What do I do?

1563
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,178
It's so fun.

1564
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:53,049
Why is he so good?

1565
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,119
Goodness.

1566
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:57,348
He's from your company. He's good.

1567
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:59,789
He's really good.

1568
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,059
I knew he was good.

1569
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,029
"Darn you" is stuck in my mind.

1570
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,359
I shouldn't keep singing it.

1571
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,659
(The voting is closed.)

1572
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,159
I don't know.

1573
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,599
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1574
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,629
(Block Breaker)

1575
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,670
What will it be?

1576
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,069
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1577
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,599
- Gosh. - Goodness, this is...

1578
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,670
This is a close one.

1579
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,079
(JEFFERY WHITE loses with 19 votes. Tray B wins with 25 votes.)

1580
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,118
(Block 7's Tray B wins.)

1581
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,150
We got it.

1582
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,388
- No! - Well done.

1583
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:35,820
The winning rapper, take off the losing rapper's block mark.

1584
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,030
- It's just... - Tray B is beating them.

1585
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,658
Tray B is winning against all of them.

1586
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,000
He's a tank.

1587
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,469
They don't have many cards left.

1588
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
We're in trouble.

1589
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:50,098
- Well done. - It's okay. Well done.

1590
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,538
We keep losing with a few votes.

1591
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,769
- Well done. - Let's recover now.

1592
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,339
Tray B broke our block.

1593
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,809
We needed someone strong.

1594
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,949
Tray B is wiping them out.

1595
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,449
Will we be wiped out?

1596
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,889
We underestimated their power.

1597
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,260
I'm going to rest today.

1598
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:10,118
- I'll rest. - What?

1599
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,389
We have to cut the flow.

1600
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,729
What would he do now?

1601
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,960
I'll go with number 17.

1602
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,340
- Who's on number 17? - It's Fleeky Bang.

1603
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,570
There's Don Mills too.

1604
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,670
I'll go. I'll do this one.

1605
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,079
Do you want to go? You can go if you want.

1606
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,848
They all ask who's Tray B

1607
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:34,078
Shut it

1608
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,578
Born as a man, no tears

1609
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,249
I only shed awesomeness

1610
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,448
- I only want cash - I'll go.

1611
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,558
There's no one but Tray B

1612
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,959
Wait, where did you go?

1613
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,729
The coward rapper already left

1614
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,459
They know I'm too hot, My rap is a bit spicy

1615
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,259
I smoke your brother, He feels like he is menthol

1616
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,658
I like beef, take out all the vegetables

1617
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,399
I'm Cha Mu Sik, I earn ten million pesos

1618
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,669
I'm Giannis, I keep it a buck

1619
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,299
Don't talk to me nice, I don't want to funk

1620
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,839
They say they're so high but stay at that low

1621
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,499
I'm balling even if I'm in the court

1622
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,439
You better shut it when I hit from the back

1623
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,109
He says, "I got a call, What do I do?"

1624
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,138
I don't care about your boy

1625
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:02,479
I answer the phone and say, "I'm daddy"

1626
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,009
Who's the best these days? Tray B

1627
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,678
Who's the coolest these days? Tray B

1628
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,879
Who's the hardest these days? Tray B

1629
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,320
Yes, Tray B

1630
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:11,118
Goodness.

1631
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,449
They met.

1632
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:23,158
I showed up at their funeral

1633
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,499
To dig up their bodies

1634
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,268
I can kill you if you look into my eyes

1635
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:27,868
Because I'm paranoid

1636
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:29,368
Wait, they're with them talking about drill

1637
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:31,169
Old and obsolete rappers, Soul my deep

1638
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,669
I'm EBK, don't give me no dead

1639
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,138
Like how many girls Ninjas have

1640
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,839
I heard they work in Baskin Robbins

1641
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,379
I find them and shoot like Zach LaVine

1642
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,149
I don't shoot from a distance, I take them out from close by

1643
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,678
I clean up the streets like a cleaner

1644
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:42,218
Feel like I'm Tay Keith, I did it again

1645
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:43,888
I'll put you in a coffin, Not Sam Okyere

1646
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:45,288
I helped you meet your friend

1647
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,848
You would have reached the clouds by now

1648
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,118
Tray, I see an opponent

1649
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,988
My fists say

1650
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:51,729
Big YEL, forever yelling

1651
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,630
Rappers all stop

1652
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:56,428
YEL

1653
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,229
- This is nice. - He's cool.

1654
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,030
- Yes. - That was awesome.

1655
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:02,570
This was a cool fight.

1656
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,869
A fight between friends.

1657
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:05,610
This is fun.

1658
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,009
They're like good friends.

1659
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,139
He nailed it.

1660
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:09,679
This is so difficult as well.

1661
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,949
What do I do with this? A battle between friends.

1662
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,420
Nice!

1663
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:17,919
I think Tray B will win.

1664
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,288
- Tray B. - Tray B.

1665
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:22,288
Fleeky Bang's suited the beat more.

1666
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:23,859
But Tray B's rap was more fun.

1667
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,230
What do I do? I'm sorry.

1668
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,400
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1669
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:31,769
I think he's going to win.

1670
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:33,769
He has to win.

1671
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:36,469
Let's go.

1672
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,809
- Gosh. - What the...

1673
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,380
- Yes! - Of course!

1674
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,579
(Block 1's Fleeky Bang wins.)

1675
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,348
It's okay.

1676
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:50,888
It's okay.

1677
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:53,618
The winning rapper, take off...

1678
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:56,219
That's our leader.

1679
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,360
Well done.

1680
01:00:58,159 --> 01:00:59,989
- It's me. - yes.

1681
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:02,999
How many did he eliminate?

1682
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,530
You did really well.

1683
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,738
- You cut it well. - You stopped the flow well.

1684
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,570
We have Chaboom and Polodared.

1685
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,839
- Double Down. - And Owen.

1686
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,808
We have some powerful ones left.

1687
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,980
We eliminated two so far, right?

1688
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,780
- It's 4 to 6. - It's 4 to 6.

1689
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,989
That's enough.

1690
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:27,420
Number 19. Let's go.

1691
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,920
Let's go, Fleeky Bang!

1692
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:41,268
Changmo played the piano when he was five

1693
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:42,839
I smacked heads before that

1694
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,209
I released an album when I was 23

1695
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,839
I was locked up at home and danced Jersey

1696
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,408
Everything Fleeky releases became a hit

1697
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:48,939
Did it again like Lil Tecca

1698
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,279
All people change so when I meet you

1699
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,078
- I ignore you, You better duck - Do "Who Wants to Fight."

1700
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:55,448
- Drop it like Shin Yeong Deok - Polodared will go next.

1701
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:58,049
I live only for myself, All haters should leave

1702
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,049
She calls me daddy, Feel like I'm PSY

1703
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,518
I'd rather die than live as a beggar

1704
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:03,058
Gather all the money and wealth, Let's go

1705
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,030
Soul my car

1706
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,329
- POLO. - It's a family battle.

1707
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,300
Darn, it's good.

1708
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,038
- My height is 191cm, I weigh 120kg - It's 120kg

1709
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:23,138
- My height is 191cm, I weigh 120kg - It's 120kg

1710
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,178
Come out, excluding women

1711
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:26,149
- The strongest out here - The strongest

1712
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,879
Like siren lyrics, I'll turn your white shirt red

1713
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,979
When we appear, all the Hongdae rappers

1714
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,149
- All lower their heads - It's really...

1715
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,689
It's like the two strongest guys in school are fighting.

1716
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,988
I have intermittent explosive disorder, watch out

1717
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:37,859
I start things without thinking about the consequence

1718
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,860
My body is fast

1719
01:02:38,861 --> 01:02:41,099
But do you see my pot belly?

1720
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,268
Seong Woo, I think I'm going crazy

1721
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:45,598
I can't stand the losers

1722
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,099
Running around everywhere

1723
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,069
You better be careful when you see my friends

1724
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,238
I don't even receive fight money

1725
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,038
The first thing I do in the morning

1726
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:54,379
Is to find someone to fight

1727
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,909
Someone to fight

1728
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,610
Someone to fight

1729
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,210
It's crazy.

1730
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,449
Smooth.

1731
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:04,920
Very nice.

1732
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,289
It was good.

1733
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,889
Who should I choose?

1734
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,928
I think it was the best of him.

1735
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:12,089
Nice.

1736
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,730
Both of them are so good.

1737
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:14,900
This is hard.

1738
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,829
It's a tough decision. No.

1739
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,929
(The voting is closed.)

1740
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:21,800
Well done. Polodared did a good job.

1741
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,239
Please win.

1742
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,279
I think our energy was much better.

1743
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,279
Fleeky Bang, please.

1744
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,380
It has to be Fleeky Bang.

1745
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,589
(Fleeky Bang loses with 15 votes. Polodared wins with 29 votes.)

1746
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:44,959
- Hold on. - Nice.

1747
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,089
(Block 7's Polodared wins.)

1748
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,828
- The winning rapper, take off... - Yes!

1749
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:50,828
- the losing rapper's block mark. - I'm not going to rap today!

1750
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:52,300
You should.

1751
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:53,429
(Block Breaker)

1752
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,538
(Fleeky Bang)

1753
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,539
Good job.

1754
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,869
Did I do a bad job?

1755
01:03:58,239 --> 01:03:59,868
- No. - Why did I lose then?

1756
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,710
- You did well. - We'll proceed with the match.

1757
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,780
It was almost Ralph Lauren Corporation.

1758
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,280
Oh, no. They only have three people left.

1759
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:12,949
It's 3 to 6.

1760
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:15,718
The good ones are left, though.

1761
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:16,759
Right.

1762
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,460
If they want to win against Polodared,

1763
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,658
Don Mills should come out...

1764
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:22,099
- and show a fun and chill rap. - Yes.

1765
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:24,328
I'll choose the sixth beat.

1766
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:26,030
- The sixth beat? - It's yours.

1767
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,369
Is it mine?

1768
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,768
He chose the beat I was thinking of.

1769
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:31,639
I thought I should go out no matter what.

1770
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,908
My girl is hotter than Korean rappers

1771
01:04:34,909 --> 01:04:36,979
I have it on my iPhone, a whole lot of dots

1772
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,879
Your man's lyrics are cheesy, full of lies

1773
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,820
You better run away, I pull up on your block

1774
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:44,789
I pull up on your block

1775
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,159
- We should break the flow. - Yes.

1776
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,888
I'm sorry, Seong Woo, I'm the real hoodstar

1777
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:52,960
I'm looking into which car to buy at 20

1778
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,799
I'm out of breath

1779
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,959
Because I hunted down the rappers all night

1780
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,768
Hide if you can, I'm going to find you

1781
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,769
And step on you until my footprints remain

1782
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,009
I stormed out the door after getting my hair cut

1783
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,948
I looked for the jeans I had thought of beforehand

1784
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:14,618
After applying ointment to my new tattoo

1785
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,078
I checked the time and wondered, "Why is it so fast?"

1786
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,018
I feel like I'm walking in the air, I don't like that so many hats

1787
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:22,960
See, I like that, we're going to get it all the diamonds

1788
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:25,129
Get Munch straight, punch 6Styles

1789
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,259
Don't think about making a fortune by the ounce

1790
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,459
I make money with rap money

1791
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,359
After I sweat, I style

1792
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,899
Starting brazenly

1793
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:32,928
You know she's better

1794
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,198
I'm going to tight it up and write it up and light it up

1795
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:37,339
And grind it up and smash it up, then I

1796
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,768
Will scrape money

1797
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,779
And make the Jeep mine

1798
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,179
Man, I do this for my life, and my life so fine

1799
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,110
Let's go.

1800
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,079
Nice.

1801
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,619
- Yes! - Oh, my gosh.

1802
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:53,090
It was a good match.

1803
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,488
(The voting begins.)

1804
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:55,489
It was hot.

1805
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,058
Mills is going to do it.

1806
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:58,059
He killed it.

1807
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,399
- Polo. - Polo.

1808
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,598
- Polo. - Polo.

1809
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:04,429
- He's so good. - He's so cool.

1810
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,630
This is so fun. I want to watch it again.

1811
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,269
It's a very tough decision to make.

1812
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:09,869
I'll vote based on how fun it was.

1813
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,170
- Vote. - He was amazing.

1814
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,510
Please let me win.

1815
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,980
Please.

1816
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:23,480
Please.

1817
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:25,590
(Please...)

1818
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,320
The two scariest-looking ones are doing that.

1819
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,989
They're the biggest but the cutest.

1820
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,000
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1821
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,159
- Come on. - Let's do a tug-of-war.

1822
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,299
We won.

1823
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,199
Come on.

1824
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:45,610
- Okay. - Yes!

1825
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,209
- Okay. - Mills is going to do it.

1826
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,808
- Mills is going to do it. - The winning rapper, take off...

1827
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:53,210
- the losing rapper's block mark. - Mills is going to do it.

1828
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,919
He did so well.

1829
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,920
It was the best.

1830
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:57,649
Mills is going to do it.

1831
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:00,190
- Mills is going to do it. - Mills is going to do it.

1832
01:07:01,289 --> 01:07:02,820
You did a good job.

1833
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,889
You did your best.

1834
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:07,699
- It was so fun. - Well done.

1835
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,099
You did a great job.

1836
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,630
(Block 1 has 3 survivors, and Block 7 has 5 survivors.)

1837
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,230
Five?

1838
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,599
There are a lot of people left on the other team.

1839
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:18,510
But it's our chance to turn the tables.

1840
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,239
We should keep the winning flow no matter what.

1841
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,980
Mills has awakened.

1842
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,610
I hope he can win.

1843
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,050
Hello. It's good to see you. I'm Don Mills.

1844
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,420
- What is he going to do? - I'm so...

1845
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,289
He's the MC.

1846
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,820
Okay. Create the mood.

1847
01:07:37,389 --> 01:07:39,630
I'm so happy that I'm having fun with you guys.

1848
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:41,800
I'm going to rap on the 18th beat right away. Let's go!

1849
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,429
Let's go!

1850
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:46,300
Let's go!

1851
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:51,369
Let's go!

1852
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,839
They might turn the tables.

1853
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,239
- Their energy is back. - Right.

1854
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,279
Riding on a red bus

1855
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,848
I only had enough money for the bus fare in my pocket

1856
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:02,379
I got so absorbed in writing

1857
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,948
That I missed the bus stop

1858
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:05,448
I didn't have to worry about offending others

1859
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,018
Because I didn't do anything wrong

1860
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:08,488
Everything became smooth sailing after that

1861
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:10,218
- It was tough back then - Who should go out?

1862
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,788
Party, let's now dance

1863
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:13,059
I'm in a trance

1864
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:14,859
- Don't worry about your future - Double Down first.

1865
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:16,358
You'll make it in the end

1866
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,969
You want new things every day, but the most precious thing

1867
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,499
Is in the drawer, covered in dust

1868
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,868
The memories of that time made me

1869
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:21,869
Pape chaser

1870
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,398
Rhyme days, I don't waste time no more

1871
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,568
All I want to do is go home, cover and turn over the blanket

1872
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:26,738
I'll go from rags to riches

1873
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:28,108
Like Marlon Brando

1874
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,408
There's no love in the city, trust nobody

1875
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,549
It's obvious, but I'll be more successful than you think

1876
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:34,779
So don't worry, punk

1877
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:37,890
Mills is going to do it. Let's go!

1878
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:40,350
Go, Double Down!

1879
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,089
Let's go!

1880
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,029
Do you speak Korean? Just a little

1881
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,069
Get it while it's hot, let's throw it away

1882
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:56,269
I can peel your back, your head

1883
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,408
And you cannot sit with the big brother

1884
01:08:58,409 --> 01:08:59,409
Go over there

1885
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:02,309
AR, boomshakalaka

1886
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,879
The helicopter is chasing

1887
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,579
Your Toyota is running away

1888
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,179
I'm busy every day

1889
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,779
No casper, no chopper

1890
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,249
Hit you like pinata

1891
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,089
No chopper

1892
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,590
South Korea

1893
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:16,619
South Korea

1894
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,899
- South Korea - South Korea

1895
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
Oh, my gosh.

1896
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,569
That was good.

1897
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:37,340
Boomshakalaka

1898
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,809
He's so darn good.

1899
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,779
It was like a concert.

1900
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,420
It was a legendary performance.

1901
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,390
I can't choose.

1902
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,189
I really want to win one last time.

1903
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:50,930
One last time.

1904
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,329
I should win. I should pray too.

1905
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,930
Let me win just once.

1906
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:01,699
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1907
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:03,600
Please let me win just once.

1908
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,909
Come on.

1909
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,640
It's a close match.

1910
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:12,079
What? It's a difference of one vote.

1911
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,550
It's almost over.

1912
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,020
I think Mills has lost.

1913
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,449
Double Down has lost.

1914
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,119
(What's the result of their match?)

1915
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:20,750
- What is it? - What?

1916
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,060
Is it a tie?

1917
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,560
A tie?

1918
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,899
As the voting result was a tie,

1919
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,629
we'll proceed with a rematch.

1920
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:30,859
(Don Mills and Double Down will have a rematch.)

1921
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:32,199
This is crazy.

1922
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,670
This is insane. Gosh, I'm drooling.

1923
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,170
But it's understandable.

1924
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:39,068
It was really good.

1925
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:41,079
It's like "The Avengers 2" came out after "The Avengers 1."

1926
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:45,550
A random beat will be played in the rematch.

1927
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,618
Yes. They should play a random beat.

1928
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:48,680
Come on.

1929
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,979
Let's go random.

1930
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:52,349
Play a random beat.

1931
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,750
Play it.

1932
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,618
You're good. You're going to get this.

1933
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:57,459
It's good, man.

1934
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,489
You have an advantage.

1935
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:01,159
You're more experienced.

1936
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,659
I'll do my best.

1937
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:04,930
A random beat.

1938
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:06,630
Ready.

1939
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:09,699
Start.

1940
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,380
This is difficult for both of them.

1941
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:18,909
- It's not easy. - It's not easy.

1942
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:32,890
- Come on! - Let's go.

1943
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:34,929
Throw away Hwangma K, I'm okay now

1944
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,459
I was crawling, but I'm flying okay

1945
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,129
I pay the price of a car in taxes

1946
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,769
And I'm still stacking my cash with K

1947
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,538
Everyone is frozen when they see me outside

1948
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,339
Then I reach out and hold their hands first

1949
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,038
- He also has a good personality - It's stable.

1950
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:46,568
I close my mouth to listen to the others

1951
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,209
Spitting my life, and it deals with the attitude

1952
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,009
I crawled back into the ant nest

1953
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,648
I don't have a label, I do it myself

1954
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:53,309
I step on it harder, Rubicon

1955
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,978
But I'm busier shooting and recording

1956
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,679
Album and drama dropping, racks on racks

1957
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,889
Even if I had five bodies, it wouldn't be enough

1958
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,090
Time is limited, and I only have one body

1959
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,459
- Let's go. - If he wins here, we'll win.

1960
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,560
Okay.

1961
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,159
- He tied his hair. - Yes.

1962
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,670
Same number, who this?

1963
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:15,969
You're bad

1964
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,669
Forty-five makes you hurt

1965
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,269
The younger one got the chopper

1966
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,938
Tell the truth, he got it

1967
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:22,339
Chopper grande

1968
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,408
- He's going to do it. - You can't make it

1969
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:25,648
You're too nice

1970
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:27,380
Smoke you like a cigarette

1971
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,179
I was hungry today

1972
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,750
I ate your food

1973
01:12:30,949 --> 01:12:32,688
Your girl in the bed

1974
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:33,750
Where are you?

1975
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:35,519
No safety on the chopper

1976
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,060
- I'm blitzing, flipping the bird - I like how raw it is.

1977
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,759
- I'm different, catching a body - He charms people.

1978
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,130
Scottie Pippen

1979
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,059
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm trapping

1980
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,799
- I'm sorry, Mom - I'm trapping

1981
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,429
- I'm sorry, Mom, I'm trapping - I'm sorry

1982
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,068
I'm sorry, Mom

1983
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:49,769
- I'm sorry, Mom, I'm trapping - I'm sorry, Mom

1984
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,368
- I'm sorry, Mom - I'm sorry, Mom

1985
01:12:51,369 --> 01:12:53,108
- I'm sorry, Mom, I'm trapping - I'm sorry, Mom

1986
01:12:53,109 --> 01:12:54,640
- I'm sorry, Mom - I'm sorry, Mom

1987
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,149
Gosh, this is difficult.

1988
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,310
That was a bomb.

1989
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:00,809
You... How?

1990
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,879
Why are you good now?

1991
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,180
I know, right?

1992
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,960
Rap-wise, Don Mills was better.

1993
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,559
Double Down has a character.

1994
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,028
Totally. That's a character.

1995
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:15,198
How can his rap feel raw and not made up on the spot?

1996
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,158
This Block Match is the hardest.

1997
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,000
- How is he that good? - Right?

1998
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:21,140
Everyone's amazing. This is bad.

1999
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:23,599
Beat Don Mills, and it'll be our win.

2000
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,039
Yes, you're right.

2001
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,710
It's tough.

2002
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,949
If it's another tie, I lose. Okay?

2003
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,380
Please. Let's win.

2004
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:41,050
If he wins, it's our victory.

2005
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:42,989
If he wins, it's our victory.

2006
01:13:44,659 --> 01:13:45,989
It's a close game.

2007
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,000
Gosh, again?

2008
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,529
- Again? No way. - No.

2009
01:13:49,699 --> 01:13:50,699
Again?

2010
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:52,369
Really?

2011
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,000
No. We won.

2012
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,510
- Yes! - Yes!

2013
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,139
- Yes! - Yes!

2014
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,479
- We won! - The winning rapper,

2015
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,179
take off the losing rapper's block mark.

2016
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,350
You take it off for me.

2017
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,049
- You take it off for me. - No, you take it off. Thank you.

2018
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,920
Thanks a lot. Good job.

2019
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:13,189
You're a tough opponent.

2020
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,259
You know, I won. You know?

2021
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,159
Sorry, Don Mills. I love you.

2022
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:19,529
Nobody in our block will be eliminated today.

2023
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:22,259
- I want to rest - Jack Daniel's

2024
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,359
I want to rest while drinking Jack Daniel's

2025
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,500
Only two rappers are left.

2026
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,868
Block One is in danger.

2027
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:30,770
That rapper was always the opposer.

2028
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:33,310
The starter is forgotten because he has a powerful energy.

2029
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:37,310
Let's choose the beat, and turn the tables as the opposer.

2030
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,250
I don't like this beat.

2031
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,350
Right.

2032
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,119
Please let it be mine. I'll turn the tide.

2033
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,189
Number 14, drop that beat.

2034
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:51,358
It's this one.

2035
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:52,989
Don't you have one, DAMINI?

2036
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,390
Do you?

2037
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:56,130
Will you rap?

2038
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,139
Listen well

2039
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:05,639
Push weight, I scrub off the dirt

2040
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,078
I beg, grab my 40, I hate "if I"

2041
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:11,949
Thirty stick, really sticky, a real porter

2042
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:15,350
Shashipoh make you a dancer, dance for real

2043
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:18,720
I'm a really better venom spitter, I spit

2044
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,219
Hole in your sweater

2045
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,220
Look like ketchup, I don't care

2046
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:25,430
I'm slow to anger, but when I get angry, man meets the heckler

2047
01:15:25,829 --> 01:15:29,000
I've got the answer, cig smoke, catch the cancer

2048
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,470
When I stepped in, did you greet me?

2049
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,840
If I really want it, I take it

2050
01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:37,908
- All of you fake rappers - Walking down!

2051
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:39,369
- Really got me boring - Walking down!

2052
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:43,009
I could be the devil or Mother Teresa

2053
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:46,310
I could be the devil or Mother Teresa

2054
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:49,519
I could be the devil or Mother Teresa

2055
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,550
I'm bad

2056
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,849
- Yes! - Yes!

2057
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,989
- That was the best. - I'm bad

2058
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:57,989
It's DAMINI.

2059
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,129
- Okay. - DAMINI is still alive.

2060
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,528
- Let's go! - Yes!

2061
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:02,629
- Let's go! - Yes!

2062
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,299
I'm excited.

2063
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,529
DAMINI.

2064
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:08,038
A white T-shirt, white sweatpants

2065
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:09,568
Dark skin tone with skin-toned underwear

2066
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:11,339
Rapping is venting out my anger and my toy

2067
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,209
In the blink of an eye, it has become my job

2068
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,908
If I get a tattoo, it'll be a dollar sign

2069
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,509
If I can't rap, I'll go to the red-light district

2070
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,309
Compared to the sick hype, the price is low

2071
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,108
I'm rising up, come and lay out the bottom

2072
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,749
If you want to become a rapper, at the place where people nag

2073
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,719
It's the manners in the old style of the best rapping

2074
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,648
It's a collage you've never heard of or seen

2075
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:28,719
The hostility towards my town

2076
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,488
And the bond with a stranger

2077
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:32,129
As the cost of choosing to be myself

2078
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,788
I become a fool from a diligent thinker

2079
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,529
I kill everything from plan B to Z

2080
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,969
- Yes! - Yes!

2081
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:41,399
- Good job. - Yes!

2082
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,300
- Yes. - Yes.

2083
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:44,499
Good job.

2084
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,169
What now?

2085
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,340
- What do I do? - I'm sorry, Mom.

2086
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,039
(The voting is closed.)

2087
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,148
The result will be revealed.

2088
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,108
DAMINI was slightly better.

2089
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,520
This was the best performance by Double Down yet.

2090
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,250
Goodness.

2091
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,528
(DAMINI loses with 14 votes. Double Down wins with 30 votes.)

2092
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:06,929
He won.

2093
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,198
- Beat it! - Double Down!

2094
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,359
Beat it!

2095
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,300
- Great work. - What a bummer.

2096
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,670
- Good. - Good job.

2097
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:16,100
Only ZENE THE ZILLA is left.

2098
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,670
Don't burden yourself.

2099
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,938
- I'm going to kill everyone. - Cool.

2100
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:21,379
- I'm serious. - Nice.

2101
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,478
ZENE THE ZILLA looks very prepared.

2102
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:24,679
He could turn the tables.

2103
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,749
But they have Owen and Chaboom left.

2104
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,779
End the match here if you can.

2105
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,349
Let's go, D.D.

2106
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,019
Finish it, brother! Finish it!

2107
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,520
What's the next beat?

2108
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,819
Drop the beat, number 13!

2109
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,989
Number 13? Is it number 13?

2110
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,828
- Double Down, let's get it on - Yes

2111
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:46,100
Double Down, let's get it on

2112
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,568
Me and my little sibling, we go 50-50

2113
01:17:49,569 --> 01:17:53,010
Korean people, we go 50-50, yes

2114
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:59,649
What the heck it is, How are you doing, brother?

2115
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:03,850
I'm just doing this, and I feel so flow, fly

2116
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:06,219
- To the sky - To the sky

2117
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,919
Fly to the sky

2118
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,159
- To the sky - This is a plane

2119
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:13,228
- You're trash - Trash

2120
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:16,059
I'm a plane, you're just trash

2121
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,500
Trash!

2122
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,139
- Trash - Hey

2123
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,039
- ZENE THE ZILLA! - Yes

2124
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:25,770
- Show them! - Yes

2125
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:28,039
- Let's go. - ZENE THE ZILLA!

2126
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:30,709
- Let's go - Hey

2127
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,749
I often wrap my body with swoosh

2128
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,049
I make do with sushi

2129
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,749
I pick my teeth, then eat cake for dessert

2130
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,749
Things that don't make money are good for nothing

2131
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,349
Fill my lungs up with smoky air

2132
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:42,618
My hand is too high for you to see

2133
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:44,590
- He's incredible. - He's killing it.

2134
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,158
ITX something, the punk ZENE THE ZILLA is cool

2135
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,328
Come here and look

2136
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:51,728
The color of money is still my signature color

2137
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:53,698
- On my right neck, deity of victory - He's good.

2138
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:55,368
When you hear I won

2139
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:57,038
- I would've gone much further up - That's a bomb.

2140
01:18:57,039 --> 01:18:58,839
Like Air Force One, yes

2141
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,509
- Yes! - Yes!

2142
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:03,709
- ZENE THE ZILLA! - ZENE THE ZILLA!

2143
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:05,979
Yes!

2144
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:08,919
- Yes, sir. - Beat him.

2145
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,779
- I hope Double Down wins. - Great job.

2146
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,890
ZENE THE ZILLA is relaxed.

2147
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,789
Double Down, let's go get them!

2148
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,259
Double Down needs a break.

2149
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:18,728
He needs a cough drop.

2150
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:20,829
The result will be revealed.

2151
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:23,528
I can win.

2152
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:25,228
We must win.

2153
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:26,769
I don't want us to get eliminated.

2154
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:29,300
Please.

2155
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,340
- What? - The vote gap is huge.

2156
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,339
- What? - What?

2157
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,738
- Seriously? - Let's see.

2158
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:36,739
Please win.

2159
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,039
What?

2160
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:41,649
- Yes! - ZENE THE ZILLA!

2161
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,318
Block One will take the lead now.

2162
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,988
Great job. You did a fantastic job.

2163
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:49,520
Nice. The match starts now.

2164
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:52,189
We have the lead now.

2165
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:55,529
It's an opportunity to turn...

2166
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:56,858
the tables around.

2167
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:00,270
It'll be legendary if ZENE THE ZILLA beats them 4 to 1.

2168
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:02,799
- Can he do it? - I bet he will.

2169
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,939
Will ZENE THE ZILLA turn the tables?

2170
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,839
- Our next rapper is... - MOON.

2171
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,209
Are we following the order?

2172
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,608
Yes. We need to be prepared...

2173
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:11,209
if there's no beat MOON can rap to.

2174
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,009
I choose beat number ten.

2175
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,250
- Let's go! - Nice.

2176
01:20:18,989 --> 01:20:20,549
Puffing gas in a row

2177
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,589
Gosh, darn

2178
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,288
I'm getting some O's, let's go

2179
01:20:24,289 --> 01:20:27,459
Puffing, he said, "Let's order some Papa John's"

2180
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,528
- This is it. - He's great.

2181
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:31,398
Puffing gas in a row

2182
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:33,099
They say birds of a feather flock together

2183
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,728
Likes hang around with likes

2184
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,669
Then we'll do this all day long

2185
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,239
Take off those dirty hands

2186
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:41,978
It's time for a new group to dominate, the cool spearhead

2187
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:43,778
When the fools are puzzled

2188
01:20:43,779 --> 01:20:45,578
- I'm dope all-day - One, two, three, let's go!

2189
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:47,408
Can feel it, high, I get

2190
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,118
- Mary Jane, my side chick - He's cool.

2191
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:50,978
Got me stoned, Versace

2192
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,618
- Nice. - Dolhareubang, the cool

2193
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:54,519
- He's fantastic. - You puff and sigh

2194
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,118
- He's too good. - Smiling is all that's left now

2195
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,988
I'm literally drunk

2196
01:20:57,989 --> 01:21:00,590
There's still some time left, let's go

2197
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,270
- He killed it. - Good job.

2198
01:21:06,369 --> 01:21:08,439
Are you ready for the show now?

2199
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,340
All right.

2200
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,409
Let's go.

2201
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,309
Don't be stubborn, I'll be hard on you

2202
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,608
I'll teach you with hip-hop, boom

2203
01:21:18,609 --> 01:21:22,219
I don't act tough without a tattoo, the door

2204
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:25,749
Obscene content is prohibited, but I'm going to make it holy

2205
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:29,419
Trying to be polite, but I know you want to get me

2206
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:32,288
- When Loopy or Central CEE asks me - Loopy?

2207
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:34,028
Of course, that's a yes

2208
01:21:34,029 --> 01:21:36,358
I'll answer in French too

2209
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:40,430
When I write, I make the money dance, your woman

2210
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:42,300
- Goodness. - What the heck.

2211
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,398
- Oh, no. - Too bad.

2212
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,510
Was that a mistake?

2213
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:48,210
It must've been freestyle.

2214
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,810
- ZENE THE ZILLA is good. - He's good.

2215
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,648
- Green Father. - Green Father.

2216
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:54,709
Green Father!

2217
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,420
- Green Father? - Green Father?

2218
01:21:57,619 --> 01:21:59,649
- Green Father association. - From Green Mother to Green Father.

2219
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:00,988
Green...

2220
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:03,358
Let's go. The green light is on, everyone.

2221
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:05,560
The green light is on!

2222
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,760
The result will be revealed.

2223
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:11,459
It's a unanimous vote.

2224
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,199
He got all the votes.

2225
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:14,868
(ZENE THE ZILLA wins with 44 votes. MOON loses with 0 votes.)

2226
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:16,939
ZENE THE ZILLA's performance was legendary.

2227
01:22:17,569 --> 01:22:19,209
(Block 1's ZENE THE ZILLA wins.)

2228
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:20,710
Cool. ZENE THE ZILLA is cool.

2229
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:22,509
He killed it from the start.

2230
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,238
The match starts now. The green light is on.

2231
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,909
But he's still got three opponents.

2232
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:27,809
Is it just me and you?

2233
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,249
- No, there's Owen too. - Owen.

2234
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,949
Foggyatthebottom's lyrics stop midway.

2235
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:35,158
Our block has the lead now.

2236
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,159
We do.

2237
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:38,430
We only need to win once with a wow.

2238
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:40,130
We just need to clip their wings.

2239
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,289
Then, it's our win.

2240
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:43,560
- I'll go with number 9. - Good. Number 9.

2241
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,960
Owen can take the stage.

2242
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,228
It's way too bad

2243
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,438
It's already 3am

2244
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:54,209
Since earlier, she's dancing like a long-headed grasshopper

2245
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,938
Twerking, she's shaking like crazy

2246
01:22:55,939 --> 01:22:57,938
When she winks, I pretend I didn't see her

2247
01:22:57,939 --> 01:22:59,509
She walks over and says she likes me

2248
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:02,350
I must've spilled too much cool, that's my bad

2249
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:04,278
- I take a shot of tequila - He's a veteran.

2250
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,849
The tiger moth sticks to my hot body

2251
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,589
But too bad, you're not my size

2252
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,818
I'm not interested in your love story

2253
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,688
- Can you do it? - After a toast,

2254
01:23:11,689 --> 01:23:12,689
I return right away

2255
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,629
She says, "You're too mean"

2256
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:17,359
- Yes, I'm too bad to play with you - Owen can't rap.

2257
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,399
All that's left is Chaboom.

2258
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:20,728
Can he do it?

2259
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:21,800
Who is it?

2260
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:25,310
- They both can't do it. - Seriously?

2261
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,938
- Go. - ZENE THE ZILLA!

2262
01:23:27,939 --> 01:23:29,909
Foggyatthebottom!

2263
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:33,250
Offend my brother, and you're dead. You hear it?

2264
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:35,180
- Yes! - Let's go!

2265
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,289
He doesn't have a verse.

2266
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,430
Nothing is coming to his mind.

2267
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:48,500
Mug, I lie down on my spot

2268
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:50,228
The punks with badges

2269
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:51,829
Their waist is full of them

2270
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,969
- We'll win. - A beat, my street tax

2271
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,869
My street tax is 3,000 dollars

2272
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:01,439
Now, please... Oh, no.

2273
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:04,478
Love, money

2274
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:06,309
- Love, money - Love, money, I said

2275
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,809
- Love, money - Love, money

2276
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,550
Love, money, I said

2277
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:13,149
I'm sorry.

2278
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:15,189
Goodness.

2279
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:17,789
- It was freestyle. - That was bad.

2280
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,890
ZENE THE ZILLA might beat everyone.

2281
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,329
This will be another unanimous vote.

2282
01:24:21,729 --> 01:24:23,630
The result will be revealed.

2283
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:27,569
We won.

2284
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,140
- Okay. - Yes.

2285
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,510
- Okay. - Good job.

2286
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:34,109
Like Foggyatthebottom.

2287
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:37,538
The winning rapper, take off...

2288
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,809
- the losing rapper's block mark. - ZENE THE ZILLA!

2289
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:40,948
Wait. It's not over yet.

2290
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:42,050
- Okay. - There are two left, right?

2291
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,750
- I'm sorry. - No, you did well.

2292
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:46,249
- I'm sorry. - The beat was...

2293
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,549
I'm sorry. The beat was different.

2294
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:48,688
How did this happen?

2295
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,858
It wasn't going to be easy.

2296
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:51,890
How tough.

2297
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,059
Owen's not in great condition.

2298
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,629
- And Chaboom... - He spat a lot of verses.

2299
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,869
You're right. There's a high possibility. For sure.

2300
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,270
ZENE THE ZILLA has awakened.

2301
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,939
He's last, and all the beats are his favorites.

2302
01:25:05,909 --> 01:25:07,738
I choose number 16.

2303
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:09,479
- Okay. - Okay. Nice.

2304
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:12,680
This will suit him well.

2305
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,188
I fly like a crane

2306
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:24,889
I hunt like a hawk

2307
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,429
I think like an owl

2308
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,828
And live the night

2309
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:29,658
I fly together three times a day in a V-shape

2310
01:25:29,659 --> 01:25:31,158
I spread my wings wide so you'd see

2311
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,228
- There's a rhyme. - Family love comes first

2312
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:34,769
Doing my best in my family's business

2313
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,068
I play for time

2314
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:37,639
- I fly above your head - He's even good with melodies.

2315
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,269
You can't catch me when I fly

2316
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,908
- You look like boogers - He's in tune.

2317
01:25:40,909 --> 01:25:42,639
- We save our spot, then save yours - He found his code.

2318
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,309
Picnic mat

2319
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,078
- Our Flocc, everyone is crazy - The tune is perfect.

2320
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:47,578
Son Dam Bi

2321
01:25:47,579 --> 01:25:48,849
But you're not anything special

2322
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:51,148
Then I don't mess with you like separation

2323
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:52,249
- I'm like no - I love it.

2324
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,519
We are we, and you are you

2325
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,188
Got bands in my pocket

2326
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:57,858
Feel like every day green day

2327
01:25:57,859 --> 01:25:59,288
My birdy, raise my income

2328
01:25:59,289 --> 01:26:01,560
It's your turn now, Greenbeige

2329
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,029
Here comes Owen.

2330
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:05,300
- Owen! - It's Owen.

2331
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:12,170
Please. You did well.

2332
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,478
My height is 5 feet 10 inches, when I rap, I don't cap

2333
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:18,139
I spent the night up, took an L, bounce back

2334
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:21,349
I hate that MSG, I go to a natural monument

2335
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,148
- One and only, I know - I know

2336
01:26:23,149 --> 01:26:24,818
The showbiz news is meaningless

2337
01:26:24,819 --> 01:26:26,488
Political color is unnecessary

2338
01:26:26,489 --> 01:26:28,148
But you've got to know what's happening

2339
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:29,719
Take what's yours to rightfully claim

2340
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,488
VV's on your plate, chains on your wrist

2341
01:26:31,489 --> 01:26:33,129
That's why you're cuffed to the system

2342
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,788
Walking everywhere freely

2343
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:36,459
Make it rain, make it wet, call it "Wet Season"

2344
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:38,158
Three, two, one, go, I don't need reasons

2345
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,769
I won't stop if I want to

2346
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,499
I always aim to win when I rap

2347
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,139
Medical major, that's my vision

2348
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,868
Forget about the unnecessary feelings

2349
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:46,408
Somebody tell me why everyone is lying

2350
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:48,139
I can't share with you, my big picture

2351
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,738
It's foggy after it rains, then morning comes

2352
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:51,438
Rapping is my job and leisure

2353
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,049
How dare a dog bark again?

2354
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:54,710
Street dog? You're not a retriever

2355
01:26:57,649 --> 01:26:58,819
That was a bomb.

2356
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,350
- Yes! - ZENE THE ZILLA!

2357
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,289
What do I do?

2358
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,359
- They're no joke. - Seriously.

2359
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,760
For sure.

2360
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:12,300
This is difficult.

2361
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:14,199
ZENE THE ZILLA will win.

2362
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:17,898
- ZENE THE ZILLA. - You never know.

2363
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,009
Yes!

2364
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,039
- Yes. - He did well.

2365
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:21,639
Finish him, brother.

2366
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,779
We need to see the result.

2367
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,108
The result will be revealed.

2368
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:26,209
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

2369
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:27,210
Come on.

2370
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,050
Come on, punk.

2371
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:31,880
- Please. - ZENE THE ZILLA.

2372
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,489
- Who will win? - Let's go.

2373
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:34,890
I have no idea.

2374
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,219
I can't make any guesses.

2375
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:37,489
Maybe it's another tie.

2376
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,859
A tie?

2377
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,130
(ZENE THE ZILLA loses with 17 votes. Owen wins with 27 votes.)

2378
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:48,470
(Block 7's Owen wins.)

2379
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,210
The end.

2380
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:56,279
- Owen finished them. - I'm sorry.

2381
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:57,839
(ZENE THE ZILLA)

2382
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,180
Great job.

2383
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:00,909
- Thank you. - Nice, guys.

2384
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,318
Our brother is back!

2385
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:05,949
This is what I'm talking about. Right here.

2386
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:08,289
For this one match, Owen got sick.

2387
01:28:08,619 --> 01:28:10,519
For this one match, he caught a cold...

2388
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,489
and laid face down.

2389
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,060
For this one match...

2390
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,100
Siu!

2391
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:20,898
Double Down contributed a lot.

2392
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:21,899
He eliminated lots.

2393
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:24,339
- Great job. - Good job. Really.

2394
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,609
Great job.

2395
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,908
- You were the best. - Great work.

2396
01:28:26,909 --> 01:28:29,079
It would've been nice...

2397
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,710
if I turned the tables.

2398
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,380
Maybe I wasn't capable enough.

2399
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:36,220
I feel bad.

2400
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,189
The winning block of the Block Match...

2401
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:40,689
is Block Seven.

2402
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:44,560
(Block 1 loses. Block 7 wins.)

2403
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,930
Though we lost, we fought well.

2404
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,429
- We lost but fought well. - You were smart.

2405
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:52,099
They did everything they could.

2406
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,130
They did.

2407
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,970
It was really entertaining.

2408
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,970
They were cool.

2409
01:28:57,739 --> 01:28:59,539
- It was so much fun. - They were amazing.

2410
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:02,279
Continuing on, Block 2 and Block 3...

2411
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:05,079
will proceed with a match.

2412
01:29:06,449 --> 01:29:07,510
Good luck.

2413
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,279
- Good luck. - The last match.

2414
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:12,288
- King Loopy. - Good luck!

2415
01:29:12,289 --> 01:29:14,389
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2416
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,559
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2417
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,029
The called blocks, please come up to the stage.

2418
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:20,760
It's the last match.

2419
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,529
It'll be a close match.

2420
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,060
The bloody war will begin.

2421
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:30,000
You're scaring me. Don't do it.

2422
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,439
- Go easy on us. - Come on.

2423
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:36,309
This match is really interesting as well.

2424
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,479
(Block Breaker: Block 2 versus Block 3)

2425
01:29:37,909 --> 01:29:39,779
(A few hours ago)

2426
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:53,929
I choose Block Three's Yang Kyle, James An, and Reddy...

2427
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,460
as elimination candidates.

2428
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,099
As our block's strongest rappers...

2429
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,699
are elimination candidates,

2430
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,029
we can't lose.

2431
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:06,938
I choose Block Two's Raf Sandou,

2432
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:09,108
yukon, and Kim Ga Yeon...

2433
01:30:09,109 --> 01:30:10,909
as elimination candidates.

2434
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,349
I will not let any of my teammates...

2435
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:15,209
go back home.

2436
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,619
Nor will I let them be in such a crisis.

2437
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:32,000
(What will happen to the members of the two blocks?)

2438
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:35,129
(The last Block Breaker match, Block 2 versus Block 3)

2439
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,099
(There are many to send home.)

2440
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,938
(Those who need to go home are in your block.)

2441
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:40,738
(It's a block with strong rappers.)

2442
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:41,869
(It'll be intense.)

2443
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:43,538
I still can't believe the bloodstained success

2444
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:44,539
Mission clear

2445
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,908
(The close match continues.)

2446
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:49,550
(Block 2 versus Block 3, which block will win?)

2447
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:51,318
Back up, shut it

2448
01:30:51,319 --> 01:30:52,319
(We did it.)

2449
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,948
(I won't lose no matter what.)

2450
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,349
(I'm so furious.)

2451
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,519
(This is bad.)

2452
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,858
(Please announce the eliminated rapper.)

2453
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:00,658
(I did a lot of thinking.)

2454
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:01,659
(The elimination candidate is...)

2455
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:02,659
(Are you kidding me?)

2456
01:31:03,229 --> 01:31:04,229
(What's this?)

2457
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:05,229
(It's over.)

2458
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:06,229
(I felt terrible.)

2459
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:07,669
(It wasn't our day.)

2460
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,139
(Meanwhile, the winning blocks are enjoying their victory.)

2461
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,670
(Give the money a sniff.)

2462
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:13,539
(It's ours.)

2463
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:14,539
(Our money.)

2464
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,408
(It officially starts.)

2465
01:31:16,409 --> 01:31:18,078
(Leader Replacement and Rapper Recruitment)

2466
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:19,648
(I want to become the leader.)

2467
01:31:19,649 --> 01:31:20,649
(Of course, I want it.)

2468
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:21,809
(Being a leader will do you good.)

2469
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,448
(Interesting things will happen today.)

2470
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:24,749
(Everyone is likely to go home.)

2471
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,948
(But not me.)

2472
01:31:25,949 --> 01:31:27,148
(Why? Because I'm the leader.)

2473
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,149
(Is that wrong?)

2474
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:29,158
(Then you can be the leader.)

2475
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:30,318
I think the same.

2476
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,319
What?

2477
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,930
(The block's leader has been replaced.)

2478
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:36,300
(What is it?)

2479
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:37,529
(It was thrilling.)

2480
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:39,869
(So, this is how you'll play?)
