00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,960
(RAP:PUBLIC)

2
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,259
(The first Block Match)

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,398
(Block Breaker)

4
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,428
(Block 8 versus Block 6)

5
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,468
(Block 4 versus Block 5)

6
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,669
(Block 1 versus Block 7, Block 2 versus Block 3)

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,569
I threw it out and stepped outside

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,368
(The winner of the first Block Match)

9
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,710
(Block 6 won.)

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,879
(After intense performances,)

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,678
(Block 4 won.)

12
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,749
(We admit defeat.)

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,618
(After an energetic match between the blocks,)

14
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,149
(Block 7 won.)

15
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:49,689
It was cool.

16
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,359
- This is so much fun. - They're so talented.

17
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,928
Block 2 and Block 3...

18
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,460
will proceed with a match.

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:00:59,829
Let's go.

20
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,368
- Yes. - Let's go.

21
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,728
- Let's go. - It's the last match.

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,238
- All right. - King Loopy.

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,468
- Let's go. - Loopy.

24
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,438
- Good luck. - Let's go.

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,609
It's the last match.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
All right.

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,480
You're scary. Stop it.

28
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:14,750
- Hey, go easy on us. - What?

29
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,620
A bloody fight will begin.

30
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,349
(Block Breaker: Block 2 versus Block 3)

31
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,549
(Block 2)

32
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,089
They didn't tell us how much time we had, right?

33
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,389
Do we need to pick the members who suits the beats the most...

34
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,390
and confirm the choices?

35
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,529
Firstly, everyone should think...

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,000
- of one verse per beat. - Let's see if it's doable.

37
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,499
(Block 2 members begin practicing under Loopy's command.)

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,040
Roger, got that stuff

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,669
Do you need to write something down?

40
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,238
- Guys, tell me... - Can I practice?

41
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,608
Okay. Tell me if you need a notebook and a pen.

42
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,310
Write the verses here if you want.

43
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,518
I think about the block more than myself.

44
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,280
The team is my responsibility.

45
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,049
(During the Block Formation,)

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,920
(Loopy mostly recruited the rookie rappers.)

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,889
As the leader, I want to support the members...

48
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,259
so that they can focus on their verses.

49
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,260
I think that's the role of a leader.

50
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,628
All right.

51
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,568
(Leader Loopy organizes the beats the block members will take on.)

52
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,969
The beats for this match are hard too.

53
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,180
Don't say that. Your verses will make them shine.

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,179
Guys, come over here.

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,418
- I circled the beats... - Okay.

56
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,448
Okay.

57
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,788
- you guys were confident in. - Okay.

58
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,589
So let's become familiar with these beats.

59
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,718
Since I'm the leader, I won't get eliminated.

60
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,258
I'll take on the beats...

61
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,359
- no one wants. - I see.

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,598
That was why I put my name at the end.

63
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,629
Okay.

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,869
(Sighing)

65
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,899
- What is it, Loopy? - What?

66
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,198
Your block members are talented.

67
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,299
- My block members? - Yes.

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,039
Your shoulders will be heavy whether your block loses or wins.

69
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,270
We're a bit of underdogs,

70
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,478
so I feel very responsible.

71
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,649
I'll give my everything to the block members...

72
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,110
and help them grow as I promised.

73
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,620
A punch?

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,689
- Ga Yeon, come here. - Okay.

75
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,819
How many beats are you fully confident in?

76
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,059
- What are they? - Three.

77
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,089
- Three? - Yes.

78
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,628
- Then once the performance begins, - Yes.

79
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:13,568
you should make use of the stage in a relaxed way...

80
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,329
and put on a show in addition...

81
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,968
- to give the team an edge. - Okay.

82
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,038
Bag it, I put it down and turn It's all behind me

83
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,839
(During the practice hour, Loopy helped the members.)

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,809
Good. I think it's much better than what I prepared...

85
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,478
for the second beat.

86
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,209
Other blocks will vote, right?

87
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,049
So you need to add something else to your performance.

88
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,059
But that's only if you're fully comfortable.

89
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,060
Otherwise, it's important to focus on not making a mistake.

90
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,829
I prepared some verses,

91
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,359
but I don't know how to divide them up.

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,329
Here's what I personally think.

93
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,568
No matter what happens tomorrow or the day after that,

94
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,638
winning today is important.

95
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,068
So I'll keep in mind the possibility of using as many verses as possible.

96
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,138
I'll use many verses of mine.

97
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,979
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

98
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,378
Loopy was dependable.

99
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,848
He gave me confidence.

100
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,448
He gave me various tips...

101
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,749
and practiced with me.

102
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,250
I was grateful for him.

103
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,229
Even if I go down, I'll take at least two people with me.

104
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,688
Two people?

105
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,829
- At least. - Six people!

106
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,060
For goodness' sake.

107
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,528
I won't make my block members go home.

108
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,139
I won't put them in a critical situation.

109
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,208
The leaders shined during the Infinite Cypher,

110
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,278
so it's time for the block members to show what they can do.

111
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,649
I'll do my absolute best.

112
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,949
I'll take this to the end.

113
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,480
No matter what, I'll do more than my share.

114
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,489
(Block 3)

115
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,018
I think I'll be able to do very well with the 13th beat.

116
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,318
- The 13th beat? - Yes.

117
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,328
- Can you work with this one? - Yes, let me try it. Sure.

118
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,489
But I might eat you up, possibly devour

119
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,499
Please, I'm not taking a shower

120
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
You should take it.

121
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,628
The ninth track is the house beat. Who can do it really well?

122
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,929
I can take it, but...

123
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,599
A mask with holes like Mommy Son

124
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,338
I hide my face so that people won't know

125
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,039
- I go in alone and bring it out - It's Reddy's.

126
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,708
Mission clear, run so that no one can catch me

127
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,679
One, two, three, the gear goes up quickly

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,448
When we chose the beats,

129
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,809
HAON supported the members well as the leader.

130
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,648
My sense of presence

131
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,479
- It's fire. - I say it again

132
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,649
I think you should step forward with confidence this time.

133
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,659
- Did someone take the 15th beat? - No.

134
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,789
- Then I'll take the 15th beat. - Okay.

135
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,990
I can do it. I can do it well.

136
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,128
I hope we can show a variety of cool performances today.

137
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,559
Let's make it a cool match.

138
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,470
(Throughout practice, HAON looked after the block members.)

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,599
HAON has a big sense of responsibility.

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,898
He always thinks about what he can do for the block...

141
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,268
and shows it through his actions.

142
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,938
He's a really cool man.

143
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,338
After the Infinite Cypher,

144
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,910
I felt very thankful for him once more.

145
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,648
My goodness.

146
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,980
(HAON was tormented upon hearing about the elimination candidates.)

147
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,850
I wish I could choose myself.

148
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,389
I wish I could participate in the deathmatch.

149
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,589
"Just whom should I pick?"

150
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,958
That thought filled my head.

151
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,128
I need to pick three elimination candidates...

152
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,929
who will have a deathmatch.

153
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,938
In 30 minutes,

154
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,239
I need to go to the Choice Block and turn in the names.

155
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,008
- Do you need to do it in advance? - Yes.

156
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,810
For pity's sake. In advance?

157
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,638
I sweated in there for the very first time.

158
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,709
This is nerve-racking.

159
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,819
HAON seemed very torn.

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,689
- Aren't we going to win anyway? - Yes.

161
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,790
I'll be a candidate.

162
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:33,329
(Reddy volunteers to be an elimination candidate.)

163
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,898
I was worried about HAON.

164
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,938
At that moment, I really wanted to be an elimination candidate.

165
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:41,939
We're going to win.

166
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,379
We need to win.

167
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,779
- No worries. - I'd like to join as well.

168
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,949
- Yes. - Yes.

169
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,818
Okay. I'll do it too.

170
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,648
Let's go. We'll win no matter what.

171
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,789
- All right. - We'll win no matter what.

172
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,749
- We'll win no matter what. - That's my wish.

173
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,919
We can win.

174
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,359
- Yes. Let's go. - We can do it.

175
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,990
I really don't think that we'll lose.

176
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,000
I was thankful. They were so trustworthy.

177
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,829
I was really thankful for Reddy.

178
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,328
The way he stepped forward...

179
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,500
and switched up the atmosphere made me respect him.

180
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,639
It couldn't have been easy.

181
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,670
I believe that we'll win.

182
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,379
We'll win no matter what.

183
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,078
James and Kyle did what I did because they believed in me.

184
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,378
I was very thankful for such choices.

185
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,180
I have no regret regarding my choice.

186
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,789
I'll submit the names with a light heart.

187
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,559
- Let's go and play. - And if we go to the deathmatch...

188
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,790
by any chance,

189
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,429
- the three of us will win. - Seriously.

190
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,588
I'm 100 percent sure.

191
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,660
I'm so worried.

192
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,528
It's okay.

193
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,698
- You got us. - There's so much pressure.

194
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,970
You got us. Don't worry.

195
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Okay.

196
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,969
For the block, I'll use my abilities and take down...

197
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,569
as many people as possible.

198
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,370
This is a matter of life and death.

199
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,040
So we can't lose.

200
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,779
Block Three must win.

201
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,610
We'll win.

202
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,879
It'll be fun.

203
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,519
There are so many people to send home.

204
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,279
This is so stressful.

205
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:02,990
What is he getting at?

206
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,518
People who will go home...

207
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,819
are in your block.

208
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,729
He has a way with words.

209
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,829
I like that.

210
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,969
The Block Match I'm looking forward to...

211
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,028
is between Block 2 and Block 3.

212
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,199
Block 2 versus Block 3.

213
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,439
Block 2 versus Block 3.

214
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,139
The most number of rappers wanted to join those blocks.

215
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,970
The two blocks with the competent members...

216
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,679
will go against each other.

217
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,838
Let's go. Let's do well.

218
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,949
- Let's have fun. - Yes, sir. Let's have fun.

219
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,009
- Let's have fun. - Let's enjoy it.

220
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,479
- Let's enjoy it. - Let's go.

221
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,519
Let's enjoy it.

222
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Ready.

223
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,419
I can't wait.

224
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,559
Start.

225
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,659
- Who will take this beat? - What is it?

226
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,969
(The starter who takes up the first beat is...)

227
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,909
(the leader of Block 2, Loopy.)

228
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,109
- Yes. - Did Loopy come out first?

229
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,340
King Loopy.

230
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,918
New wave, I put up a kingpin right here

231
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,689
I'm awake once again, I bring you troubles

232
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,359
Get your share because I'm merciful

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,989
- To the lost, I'm a navigator - I have fitting verses. Can I go?

234
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,689
- Now, Loopy is seriously greedy - I'll go.

235
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,359
I go to many places, soon comes the killing

236
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,028
I check out many things, soon comes the keeping

237
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,699
As soon as I open my eyes, I'm kicking it

238
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,398
I cut off many things, I beat the case

239
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,969
If it doesn't suit me, I lay low

240
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,739
I was dead in 2000 and 2022

241
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,439
It isn't enough, me like bum

242
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,138
You aren't enough, flick like bum

243
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,839
The undying white tiger, I'm a genius

244
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,408
I still need my medication

245
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,209
I go when it's time we go and get away

246
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,008
Go and get it, illegal in my whip

247
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,148
Until my team gets fat, we're on this boat together

248
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,048
Rabbit headband for you, ditto

249
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,689
I jump over your head

250
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,349
I earn and achieve easily

251
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,389
I do it two times more and add the sum

252
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,559
- Yang Kyle. - Here he comes.

253
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,629
- Yang Kyle. - Let's go.

254
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,969
- Yes. - Let's go.

255
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,600
- Let's go. - Yes.

256
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,939
Why do you keep asking where I'm at?

257
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,739
I'll be in my neighborhood or Nonhyeon-dong

258
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,339
Birds of a feather, Or I keep my distance

259
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,038
My routine and my surroundings are the same

260
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,749
Forget all that talking, let's see if you're with it

261
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,209
My recipe is a secret, pop another

262
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,749
Pop another 5,000-dollar bottle at the VVIP section

263
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,849
I'm busy, so take it, It's okay, sweep everything

264
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,489
Keep it a hunnid, keeping it fresher

265
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,490
- Don't go against me - He's good.

266
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,490
I get tools as if I work overtime

267
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,388
- Don't you question my bars - There's madness.

268
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,059
It's easy to read between the lines, so let them pretend all they want

269
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,070
- Yes. - This is hard.

270
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,269
He's a lunatic.

271
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,070
He's like a rabid dog.

272
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,269
It was okay. It was good.

273
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,369
Gosh, this is hard.

274
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,409
This is hard.

275
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm torn.

276
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
It's too hard from the start.

277
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,080
The match was intense from the start.

278
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,350
(The voting begins.)

279
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,349
To be honest, I think Loopy did better.

280
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,120
- Same here. - He was more stable.

281
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,519
I think Loopy did a better job of interpreting the song.

282
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,789
It's cool that Yang Kyle stepped forward.

283
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,719
Both of them did well. I'm sorry.

284
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,889
One of them, I'm sorry.

285
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,929
(Block Breaker)

286
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,190
I can't predict the result.

287
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,600
What will it be?

288
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,960
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

289
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,940
- What? - What?

290
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,169
- Four... - My goodness.

291
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,309
Which one is it?

292
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,178
Oh, yes.

293
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,839
(Loopy wins with 27 votes. Yang Kyle loses with 17 votes.)

294
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,008
- Yes. - King Loopy.

295
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,009
(Block 2's Loopy wins.)

296
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,179
- It's okay. You did well. - It's okay.

297
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,350
There isn't a big difference.

298
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,179
It's too bad. He did well.

299
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,090
(Block Breaker, Yang Kyle)

300
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,149
It's too bad.

301
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,820
Loopy was really cool.

302
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,990
He's relaxed.

303
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,159
He really is King Loopy.

304
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,898
I'll go with the 11th beat.

305
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,929
Let's go, Loopy.

306
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,470
- What was the 11th beat? - Wasn't it house?

307
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,370
Let's go.

308
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,100
Life is my bible

309
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,908
Success is my favorite idol

310
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,668
You can't have my darn title

311
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,339
See my woman, she's so nicer

312
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,878
You don't know what I've been through

313
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,648
Death is my rival

314
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,749
What do you know about me, homie? Good life is good money, dice, dice

315
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,288
I spend thousands on Off-White and make a hundred times more, yes

316
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:58,689
I grew up poor, but I freeze Korean beef at some now, I like that

317
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,418
I bring out my Gucci and my Louis Vuitton

318
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,158
The price isn't enough, so I pay more

319
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,499
Wanna "Wassup" me, it's no fake, Wear it since mine's new, bro

320
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
- How refreshing. - The punk who called me brother

321
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Stole everything from me

322
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,928
They shut the doors already because they went under

323
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,268
So broke all the time

324
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,138
Do that for money, bag, bag, It's stupid to fake that

325
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,308
- I feel like I'm alone these days - I guess Yun Ha will go next.

326
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:15,569
- You're right. - I have nobody by my side

327
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,839
- He's practicing. - I kill the awkward ones

328
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,538
You can't even sit next to me, You pass, you stay there

329
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,849
You can't have my darn title, Lufe is my bible of success

330
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,418
You don't know anything, so shut your trap

331
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,419
Because I'm back at it

332
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,018
- Walking dead, holes in the coffin - His engine is all started.

333
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,619
But no one's behind me

334
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,518
I'll change things up, I'm switching the lane

335
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,288
- Now, I make you beg for your life - Please let Yun Ha go next.

336
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,989
Beg with desperation, my magazine

337
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,658
Rappers put the fake tags back in

338
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,459
Or shut your trap because I'm back at it

339
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,959
Not okay, you say it to my face

340
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,969
I like that, come together, gang, I've always been for my people

341
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,768
- He's really good. - Got that, I like that

342
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,469
Like I said, I've been in a coupe, I've been getting paid

343
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,538
Many K, a whole lot of addicts

344
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,239
Hall of fame, like cake, Post Malone

345
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,969
Two, ay, fourteen, beat the case

346
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,309
Tomorrow is the day, go with them

347
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,409
He's good.

348
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,679
- Let's go. - Yes. Let's go.

349
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,919
Let's go.

350
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,350
- Let's go. Yes. Let's go. - Let's go.

351
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,288
Blazer, spit it out, Remember my role

352
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,028
Step over, come and go, no

353
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,729
This punk is getting ready again, get dough

354
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,398
Write all sorts of lies in the work experience

355
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,158
All the punks next to you are hopeless

356
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,869
All the boys next to you are hopeless

357
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,628
Look at the way he crosses his legs, pour a drink like a host

358
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,470
You're ruining the atmosphere of the club

359
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,768
If not, trap it, yes, I rap instead of smoking up, yes

360
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,469
He smokes cheap cigarettes and makes a fuss

361
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,178
I don't cough unless I catch a cold

362
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,808
- He isn't from our block. - Take paybacks for 23 days

363
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,479
- He isn't from our block. - My outfit changes like "Ben 10"

364
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,178
I get buried in money and tap out, yes

365
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,949
- Honestly, I'm not there yet - He's really good.

366
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,678
Not yet, say it, Who's in front of me?

367
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,288
There's no one, darn it

368
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,048
Stop playing, you can't say anything in front of me

369
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,018
- Spit it out, rap your reply - Let's go.

370
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,658
You can't do it right, stop right there

371
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,288
People here really aren't nice

372
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,888
- That was a good one. - I'm not nice among these jerks

373
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,759
I'm not nice among these jerks, let's go

374
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,899
Let's go.

375
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,600
- This one is hard too. - Nice.

376
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,539
Gosh, how am I supposed to choose one?

377
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,110
It suited the beat perfectly.

378
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,508
(The voting begins.)

379
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,639
I don't know what to do.

380
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,879
This is hard.

381
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,449
- He spat out the verses. - He grooved so well.

382
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,249
- The rap was tasteful. - It was perfect.

383
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,778
I think Loopy is the winner.

384
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,789
Do what you think is right.

385
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,620
Still, he's on a different level.

386
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,090
The result.

387
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,759
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

388
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,659
I'm curious.

389
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,898
- Nice. He won. - That's right.

390
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,899
- Yes. - Let's go.

391
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,569
Roh Yun Ha!

392
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,570
(Block 3's Roh Yun Ha wins.)

393
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:30,039
He took over with his spirit.

394
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,480
When it comes to the spirit...

395
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,039
It's okay.

396
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,209
You did well.

397
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,210
He took on two fresh rappers.

398
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,079
It wasn't easy to hold out.

399
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,919
Losing Loopy is too big of a loss for Block Two.

400
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,750
It was my choice to go.

401
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,720
"I'll go first and take out most of the members."

402
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,459
I stepped forward without a word.

403
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,028
I even fooled the younger members.

404
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,159
But my plan to take out many members failed.

405
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:55,629
I thought, "This is bad."

406
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,799
Yes, sir. I choose the 20th beat. Let's go.

407
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,138
- The 20th beat is XWALLY's. - It isn't mine.

408
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,539
The 20th beat is mine.

409
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,210
- Yes. - Let's jump with him.

410
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,509
- Yes. - Let's turn up together.

411
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,349
- Let's go. - Hey.

412
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,579
Put on my Ricky, spend it all

413
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,148
Go, rap money, I got you, Get that dough

414
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:14,589
I need to delete my face ID

415
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,189
It's for my safety, my bank account

416
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,788
I spend and earn more money, let's double up

417
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,158
I'm capable, baby, no problem

418
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,288
I grabbed the microphone and spat out the verses for 30 minutes

419
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,758
- I'm back in Seoul, back and forth - He's good.

420
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,128
My bank account is black and gold

421
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:27,058
It's a bad way of relieving stress, Having ADHD doesn't help

422
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,999
Let's just spit out the verses, You told an outright lie

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,469
Hey, move away, I get your racks on racks on racks

424
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,038
Get some rest, wake up, back to work

425
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,240
- I spend it all, I'll earn more - His rap is tasteful.

426
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,840
Yes, I'm gonna blow up

427
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,778
- They told me to do that - He just needs energy.

428
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,350
Why would I stop here? I'm going to be GOAT

429
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,750
Hey, don't touch my stuff, I'm back, 2024, now, take it plus and plus

430
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,049
- Hey. - This is fun.

431
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,649
How is he so good at rapping?

432
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes.

433
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,629
I'm excited about this. It's my first time hearing him rap.

434
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,799
I grip it, I clock it, boom

435
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,398
I grip it, I clock it, boom

436
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,970
I grip it, I clock it, boom

437
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,439
I grip it, I clock it, boom, Way out of patience

438
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
- They don't wanna mess with my mood - What?

439
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:08,908
My brothers, my goons, They ain't never say

440
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,209
The road we took We came from the bottom

441
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,339
Just look at my shoes

442
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,138
I'm stepping on a weak boy like you

443
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,678
One, two, throw my threes up

444
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,178
I'm going to ride for my brothers, my family, my goons

445
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,749
- He's good. - You've never seen a gun

446
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,219
But you talk about a gang

447
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,148
I listen to gunshots and my brothers disappear, bang, bang

448
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,559
That's why I can't give up, I'm taking an eye for an eye

449
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:28,758
Bagging him dead or alive, I got a shawty who ride til I die

450
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,928
I don't care about this mess

451
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,330
Money is coming in and stacking up like a mosh pit

452
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,758
I don't really mess with that potion

453
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,700
Money is stacking in, That's what all this motion is

454
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,699
Money is stacking in, That's what all this motion is

455
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,169
- I got goosebumps. - Yes.

456
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,940
What am I going to do? This is so hard.

457
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,879
Both of them did so well.

458
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,839
- It was insane. - This is...

459
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,480
- Nosun is good. - He's really good.

460
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,779
(The voting begins.)

461
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,648
Yun Ha did well too.

462
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,149
Nosun is really good.

463
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,519
- I didn't think he'd beat Yun Ha. - I know.

464
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,018
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

465
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,460
I think we won this round.

466
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,860
We won this round. I'm sure of it.

467
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,799
We need to win this round.

468
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,069
The votes are divided.

469
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,200
What will be the result?

470
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,140
(Nosun wins with 39 votes. Roh Yun Ha loses with 15 votes.)

471
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,009
All right.

472
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
What?

473
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,539
- Brother. - Thank you for your hard work.

474
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,880
Both of them deserved to win.

475
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,879
I don't know.

476
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,380
- Well done. - Well done.

477
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,849
You did your share.

478
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,150
- Nosun is really good. - Seriously.

479
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,149
Is Nosun English or Korean?

480
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,318
"No sun."

481
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,419
The 14th beat.

482
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,989
Please drop that.

483
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,229
- Yes. - Yes.

484
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,390
- Hey. - Yes.

485
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,730
- Hey. - Darn it. I have a verse for this.

486
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,528
Here for the money like

487
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,798
Never see the headlights zoom

488
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,199
Goons on the clock, and we slide at two

489
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,439
You're a weak boy, don't mess with my mood, come through

490
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,169
Slide with my goons, this is the basics

491
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,739
Back shots, shawty is telling me that I gotta pace it

492
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,338
Demons in my head all day, have to face it

493
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,179
Don't talk to me if you're basic

494
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,479
You're all spinning inside your block with the pain

495
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,449
For your weak clique know that we're gang, gang, gang

496
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,979
Here comes the demon, know that I can't pace it

497
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,479
Gotta hit a lick, know I really can't save it

498
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,048
- This is really nice. - Weak boys copy me, you ain't gang

499
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,588
- I'll go first. - Waiting for the drop

500
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,659
- HAON should wait. - Ride with my brothers

501
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,758
My slimes, my killers, my goons

502
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,288
We're on the demon time, there's no bail

503
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,459
We didn't know how to live, but we keep going up

504
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,690
Know we can't fail

505
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,230
- Yes. - He's really good.

506
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,769
Slide.

507
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,669
- My goodness. - Hey.

508
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,268
It's Nosun versus OSUN.

509
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,868
Let's go.

510
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,739
- All right. - Yes.

511
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,338
You blockheads

512
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,439
You have no respect, You live in your own world

513
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,449
If you spend money on private education for 12 years

514
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,048
And only get into schools in the countryside, just quit

515
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,649
Education won't help you

516
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,979
When I had a chance

517
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,518
I didn't play around in the academy

518
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,189
I made the same amount of effort as the top students

519
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,719
I'll go and pick you up when you graduate

520
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,558
With my foreign whip, Range Rover

521
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,058
Your rapper runs off because he can't rap live

522
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,288
Please show your spit

523
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,328
Not popular music you can't sing without Auto-Tune

524
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:49,629
I bet my wrist that half the haters of idols don't look in the mirror

525
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,199
Kids who realized their limits say that they were born with talent

526
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,868
Shut it, I won't listen to you

527
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,939
- Hey. - That was meant for Nosun.

528
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,539
Hey.

529
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,380
Well done.

530
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,078
- Yes. - He did well.

531
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,679
- Nice. - Nice.

532
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,049
It was charming.

533
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,680
- Did it make your blood boil? - Yes.

534
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,989
Why do people only attack him?

535
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,589
His facial expression was frigid just now.

536
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,589
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

537
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,089
Nosun versus OSUN.

538
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,959
- My goodness. - Nosun won.

539
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,629
- Yes. - For goodness' sake.

540
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,298
- Nosun did very well. - Yes, he did really well.

541
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:28,069
I have a feeling that Block Two will win.

542
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,368
Right? They have the spirit.

543
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,469
I think HAON will go next.

544
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,339
Wouldn't he come out to end the winning streak?

545
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,338
Give me the fourth beat, please.

546
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,079
- Drop that beat, please. - The fourth beat.

547
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,348
He's polite.

548
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,489
Bring out songs from the West Coast and the East Coast

549
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,088
I think he'll do really well.

550
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,589
- Yes. - Oh, no.

551
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,419
East Coast is where I be at

552
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,929
It'll be the quiet folks

553
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,429
- Trying to get at you - Is he insane?

554
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,459
Not trusting people, Baby, that's what I do

555
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,399
Put the medicine down, know I'm going to keep my cool, okay

556
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,868
- I see another case of OD - Will you be able to do it?

557
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,298
They're the same as the demons, Screw the police

558
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,308
The chatty ones don't know me

559
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,669
Fake phones, we take notes

560
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,108
Sounds like you're dead to me

561
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,379
All day long, I took this method

562
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,749
I made money and stepped on these thrones

563
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,018
I run, but reality doesn't change

564
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,348
Even if I run, these demons are chasing me, actually

565
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,419
One time for the real OGs

566
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,788
When I wake up in the morning, know that I pray to the Lord

567
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,889
Still, stacking and packing, I'll be the same old me

568
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,489
- Relax. It's okay. - If my lyrics are drugs

569
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,159
Probably going to overdose, okay

570
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,258
I don't make the same mistakes, Every day is a new day

571
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,729
Living is homework Baby, there ain't no due date

572
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,129
Chilling with my brothers on the block, Taco Tuesdays

573
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,699
There comes a time for everybody, baby, just wait

574
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,909
- For me - It's really nice.

575
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,808
- Baby, just wait for me - It's really nice.

576
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,239
- He's good. - It's really nice.

577
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,709
For me, for me

578
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,349
Baby, just wait for me

579
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,679
- Yes. - XWALLY.

580
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,150
He won this round as well.

581
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,348
Nosun is good.

582
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,189
- DOMMIU. - Hey.

583
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,389
- Hey. - Hey,

584
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,828
I set things on fire, Boys and girls, follow me

585
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:57,459
We don't call 119, we dance on fire

586
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,629
No matter the season, no matter where we go

587
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,598
We will make it hot like a volcano

588
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,868
There's no rest, groove to the rhythm, dance

589
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,939
Baby, we're so hot

590
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,068
- We turn the tables - She's good.

591
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,199
What's the point of following the rules?

592
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,838
- DOMMIU is good too. - Voices are enough to make us giddy

593
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,939
High kick through the roof

594
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,608
We make music

595
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,608
- If you have time to worry, do it - She's cute.

596
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,879
You got that dream, just shout it out

597
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,778
Or you can choose to be stupid

598
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,849
I wouldn't live that way because it isn't cool

599
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,419
Yes. You did well.

600
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,558
- DOMMIU. What? - I stuttered.

601
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,629
- I kept stuttering. - No, you did well.

602
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,159
- You did well. - What? You did very well.

603
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,629
- You did well. - I stuttered.

604
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,829
(The voting begins.)

605
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,028
Had she pulled it off properly...

606
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,098
- It would've been interesting. - Yes.

607
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,170
She did well.

608
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,999
- Nosun is really talented. - Is he a lunatic?

609
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,838
I just thought that he was a nice man.

610
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,539
- His talent is incredible. - He's insane.

611
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,048
- Three people are out. - Three people are gone.

612
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,750
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

613
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,249
(Block Breaker, Block 2 versus Block 3)

614
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,650
- My goodness. - What?

615
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,848
- What? - Yes.

616
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:58,459
- My goodness. - What on earth?

617
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,160
That was crazy.

618
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,160
- Polodared. - Polodared.

619
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,799
(Polodared)

620
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,930
- Polodared. - Polodared.

621
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,499
He's an ace.

622
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,538
- Seriously. - Nosun is talented.

623
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,140
What has suddenly gotten into him?

624
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,869
Nosun! He's a lunatic!

625
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,369
He rapped so well to a variety of beats.

626
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,680
I thought that it could be dangerous for Block Three.

627
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,479
This isn't easy.

628
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,879
I think HAON should go next.

629
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,719
Then that block will be using the last card.

630
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,049
- If they can't turn the tables... - It'll be game over.

631
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,759
Beat number two, please.

632
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,019
Let's go.

633
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,619
Hey.

634
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,459
- Oh, yes. - It's cool. The beat is cool.

635
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,429
Bugger off, you all, for real

636
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,229
My goodness.

637
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,069
- How is his voice like that? - Yes.

638
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,038
My first time on a mission

639
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,768
I woke up with my eyes shut

640
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,169
With my hands, Know I gripped that tight

641
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,068
- I became the red demon - How is he good at every beat?

642
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,680
They took 4, so we take 5, Every day became a war

643
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,608
I count my bags all day long, I get backstabbed every day

644
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,649
I'm just stacking, rotating, I keep it sticky, they're waiting

645
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,318
We live differently

646
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,818
When I make money, they hate on me

647
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,189
They say that they're a family

648
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,588
They only call when it's raining

649
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:07,919
I don't need such jerks, They drain me like leeches

650
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,588
Got my pain up on my sleeve, I have all these tats for my family

651
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,199
These days, I ain't get no sleep

652
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,929
When lil bro died, it ain't made sense

653
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,729
No matter how much I make, my pockets and heart are heavy

654
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,038
Hunnids on hunnids, but money doesn't fill the holes

655
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,170
I'm ruined, mate

656
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,568
- Yes. - Yes.

657
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,639
He's really cool.

658
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,039
- New York, J, you heard me - That's insane.

659
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,749
Timers start to bleed, I go move like a bumblebee

660
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,078
The beat didn't suit me.

661
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,219
So I looked at my teammates, but no one stepped forward.

662
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,288
So I was like, "What should I do? Is there a fitting verse?"

663
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,819
I went back to practice.

664
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:41,119
- I can do it. - I'll go next.

665
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,990
Who's coming?

666
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,329
It's Reddy.

667
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,329
Hey. Hey.

668
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,699
- He won't be able to beat Nosun. - Hey.

669
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,868
You guys gather around during my work hours

670
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,568
I can't join tomorrow either

671
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,508
- I have to go and work - I missed this stable rapping.

672
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,778
I have enough money in my wallet to keep myself from going hungry

673
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:05,048
Perhaps I should just quit and hang out with them

674
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,018
I barely make enough to pay for my meals

675
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,018
But since this is the only way I know how to make money, I can't

676
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:14,118
Had my family been well-off, I would've done it like them

677
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,028
Is this a sense of inferiority? Seeing them doesn't improve my mood

678
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,858
I keep becoming jealous, I keep hating them

679
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,629
It breaks and destroys my soul little by little

680
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,629
- He's really good. - I can't say, "Look after me"

681
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,999
I'm too proud for that

682
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,239
They enjoy life by themselves

683
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,139
- Gosh, he's good. - This isn't a family

684
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,778
Even when we were together, I felt alone

685
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:35,480
I couldn't stand it, so I walked out without a word

686
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,349
All right.

687
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,680
My brother.

688
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,249
- My man. - Thank you, brother.

689
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,759
- He's insanely good. - Reddy, thank you.

690
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,219
Seriously.

691
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,960
Reddy touched my heart.

692
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,959
Reddy is thorough.

693
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,399
I absolutely love Nosun's rhythm.

694
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,029
It's the rhythm I admire because I can't copy it.

695
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,528
I don't know who will win.

696
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,899
I'm so torn.

697
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,169
I'm so torn about this.

698
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,669
It's a matter of choosing between grooviness and neatness.

699
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,639
The result of the vote will be revealed.

700
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,740
There won't be a big difference in the votes.

701
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,309
It's neck-and-neck. Seriously.

702
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,819
Yes.

703
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,719
(Reddy wins with 27 votes. Nosun loses with 17 votes.)

704
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,058
(Block 3's Reddy wins.)

705
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,828
Thank you.

706
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,259
Thank you too.

707
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,660
Darn. You did insanely well.

708
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,568
Nosun did really well.

709
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,900
Block Two still has many members left.

710
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,169
I'll choose the ninth beat. Let's go.

711
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,069
- Let's go. - I'll go next.

712
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,640
It's game over then.

713
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,479
What? KHAN will go next.

714
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,680
It might be a bit dangerous.

715
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,618
A mask with holes like Mommy Son

716
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:52,389
I hide my face so that people won't know

717
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,088
I go in alone and bring it out

718
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,959
I still can't believe the bloody success in my hands

719
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,889
Mission clear, run so that no one can catch me

720
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,699
One, two, three, the gear goes up quickly

721
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,199
Where am I? Get the direction right, The wheel was a bit off

722
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,669
They don't know me, but all of my stories are real

723
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,669
Let's raise the stakes, narcos

724
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,499
Say adios to failure

725
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,909
I need a floor plan for the next spot

726
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,739
I can't quit because the bliss runs away

727
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,508
Wearing a mask, living in fear

728
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,379
I don't remember my face anymore

729
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,209
The nature of a killer, life is weird

730
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,880
I go to places and try my shots at success

731
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,990
- He did well. - That was good.

732
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,788
- Let's go, KHAN. - KHAN.

733
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,018
- Let's go. 1 more time. You ready? - Let's go.

734
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,359
It's a beat that suits KHAN well.

735
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,630
What? How's the sound coming out?

736
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,729
Look, bounce off, boys off the block

737
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,099
If you act out in front of me, I must knock you down

738
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,268
That's a man's life

739
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,838
Even if we hit the bottom We jump again and hit the peak

740
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,239
We started in the gutter, so there's no fear

741
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,278
We know how to get back up, so I enjoy this fight night

742
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,348
- It doesn't stick to the beat. - It isn't in sync.

743
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:50,149
Steel your heart, you punk, Don't you dare eye my position

744
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,879
I had a cocky attitude from birth

745
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,818
Lunatics who talk behind my back should lie down

746
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,348
It's no wonder I made them uneasy, They're losers

747
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,348
This comes naturally to me, but they deny it

748
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,189
Keep living like that because your turn won't come

749
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,018
Follow me and catch me, why are you so slow?

750
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,758
Even when I rap lightly, it's twice your speed

751
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,430
I have nothing to hide I show my attitude when I need to

752
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,369
- Yes. - Come on. Make some noise.

753
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,939
- I couldn't hear the words. - It was weak.

754
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,399
He couldn't beat Reddy.

755
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,339
The result of the vote will be revealed.

756
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:18,038
If Reddy loses, I'll scream in the middle of the night.

757
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,108
"Hey!"

758
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,278
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

759
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,380
Let's see.

760
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,249
My goodness.

761
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,380
- Big brother. Yes. - Thank you for your hard work.

762
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,319
- Thank you. - Let's go.

763
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,548
- Yes. - Nice.

764
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,919
KHAN is a good rapper, though.

765
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,490
I think he felt impatient.

766
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,829
This is fun. It's getting interesting.

767
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,130
It was just as I expected. Reddy carried the team.

768
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,930
I was relieved that he was able to stop the momentum.

769
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:49,509
Reddy who had once let go of everything was taken

770
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:51,568
I still got the spirit of a 20-something guy

771
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,680
I still feel the same way

772
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,609
The money from before spoiled my mood

773
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,979
I let out a deep breath that I held back late at night

774
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,048
I think I'm better

775
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:01,118
- He's good. - I'm feistier than before

776
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,288
My stuff is the killer, it wakes me up like the morning

777
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,389
My tone is well done, and my stuff is rare

778
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,219
My fans line up, and the album I cooked up

779
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,129
Puts empty-headed rappers to sleep

780
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,960
Hands up in the air, I'm ready to run for ten years

781
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,200
Let's go!

782
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,410
You can do this.

783
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,778
It looks like you're out of it

784
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,209
That's not my way

785
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,909
Do you think that's a better way?

786
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,078
I don't want to die, darn it

787
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,079
You're dressed like a high schooler, wearing a messy shirt

788
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,079
Goofing around and drinking

789
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,679
She's making it so easy for Reddy to win.

790
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,548
You better know, they've got to know

791
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,618
They must be an illusion

792
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:39,219
I'm going to die because I need to know

793
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,818
What the heck is wrong with you?

794
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,460
No one can see me, I already know

795
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,799
She's cute.

796
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,730
The result of the vote will be revealed.

797
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,470
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

798
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,608
- Let's go. - We're tied. We got this. Nice.

799
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,539
- Good job. Thank you. - Good job.

800
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,210
They're tied now.

801
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,650
I think Block Three will win in the end.

802
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,680
Our team lost consecutively.

803
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,190
When I looked at our opposing team,

804
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:11,150
they looked so happy.

805
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:13,758
So I felt impatient to win.

806
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,630
That made me nervous a bit.

807
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,490
Let's get it.

808
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,828
BCD drops the spicy bomb, and I put on CDG and kill it

809
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,199
I sign up to BBC and go to space

810
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,709
Don't get the wrong idea with our coughs

811
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,368
GB to the C, it's a boiling pot

812
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,879
I write lyrics every day, so I don't do repeats

813
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,578
My life is spelled H-A-P-P-Y, but yours is spelled S-A-Day

814
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,279
You might want to deny it, but our chemistry is rocking

815
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,078
We're busy, so just pay me

816
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,679
I'm a fashionista making dough with rap

817
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,979
You can take bonus points to level the playing field

818
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,919
The more disadvantages I face, I just pack more candy

819
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,989
B to the K, I get it

820
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,689
We wear shirts with our names on, lit it

821
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,318
Even if the path we're on isn't the right path

822
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,319
We'll still make money in the end, GBC, we killed it

823
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,629
We killed it

824
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,930
You killed it!

825
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,000
We killed it

826
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,268
- Let's go, man! - Hey.

827
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:01,039
- Tobii! - ShyboiiTobii.

828
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,269
Hey.

829
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,710
Shy

830
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,980
Hey.

831
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,479
I ain't playing no games

832
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,578
I've been so paranoid, every night when I go to sleep

833
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,778
An evil spirit shows up in my dream and chokes me

834
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,588
Because I'm smoking that pressure, I still keep my guard up

835
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,288
Keep one in the head, keep taking those risks

836
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,419
Like I'm playing Russian roulette

837
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,028
ShyboiiTobii is going to pop out with confetti

838
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,058
My debtors are getting sick, they're going to need me

839
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,258
I'm going far with my life

840
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,858
And my life goes up and down like a roller coaster

841
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,429
It was my childhood dream, but I do it every day

842
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,068
I showed you love, but why are you so petty?

843
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,598
I can never be a nuisance to anyone

844
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,239
Stay low, you can't act like a heatbag

845
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,939
Money which I didn't have before begins to pile up

846
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,969
My tears form out of sheer happiness

847
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,608
These guys are loud, but you're not making any noise

848
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,739
That serves you right, feel that karma

849
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,410
Those snake boys better keep their distance

850
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,289
Nice!

851
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,319
I lost my pitch in the middle.

852
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,690
No, you did well.

853
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,660
The result of the vote will be revealed.

854
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,529
I'm not sure about this one.

855
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,470
I hope ShyboiiTobii puts a stop to their streak.

856
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,539
I knew it.

857
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,880
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

858
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,279
What?

859
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,410
It's the momentum.

860
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,779
What a bummer. He did well.

861
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,619
- What a thrill! - Yes.

862
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,650
Reddy is on fire today.

863
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,288
Reddy is killing it.

864
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:25,258
- I could hear everything he said. - Right, everything is so clear.

865
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,419
(Sighing)

866
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,460
Darn it!

867
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,989
I'm sorry.

868
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,459
- No. - No.

869
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,859
- You did well. - You were great.

870
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,400
I wanted to help...

871
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,069
my team.

872
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,640
But I wasn't able to do that.

873
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:41,799
I was disappointed in myself.

874
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,710
Block Two is in trouble.

875
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,609
My gosh, did he beat all of them?

876
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,009
They turned the table around.

877
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,709
On top of that, HAON hasn't gone yet.

878
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,809
Block Three has a higher chance to win now.

879
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,250
I'll go with the third beat. Let's go.

880
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:56,920
He's so cool.

881
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,689
Bounce

882
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,889
- Bounce - Bounce

883
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,459
Every day is a crisis to me, who made this?

884
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,328
Say hello to those fools, and I'm a kitty

885
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,528
And they have the rodent-head, spit out the sashimi

886
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,199
Shimmy shimmy, your rooftop house is your limit

887
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,669
You want to look effortlessly cool, but you can't pull it off

888
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,239
I'll make more money, and get fame as a bonus

889
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,808
You spit out the words like a flame of a mythical creature

890
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:21,680
But I use the cheap pop filter and spit out my saliva

891
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,579
- He's really good. - He's on a roll right now.

892
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
He's so cool.

893
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,788
Don't tell me what to do, I just came to Stu

894
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,460
It's when I'm a different dude, don't pretend to be in the crew

895
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,799
Act like you're cool and come at me, then I'll do you cruel

896
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,499
Your biggest mistake

897
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,829
- Face your doom - They can't beat him.

898
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Nice.

899
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,410
That was cool.

900
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:51,869
But...

901
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:53,339
I think Reddy is going to beat all of them.

902
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,078
The result of the vote will be revealed.

903
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,150
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

904
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,750
(yukon loses with 5 votes. Reddy wins 39 votes.)

905
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,318
(Reddy of Block 3 wins.)

906
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,349
Oh, my!

907
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,959
If both of you like the beat,

908
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,118
Raf Sandou should go first.

909
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,259
- Okay. - Okay?

910
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,288
Raf Sandou was one of the rappers I chose...

911
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,730
as an elimination candidate.

912
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,799
I'll pick Raf Sandou from Block Two as an elimination candidate.

913
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,939
We were outnumbered.

914
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,068
It seemed we were going to lose.

915
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:22,639
The last thing I could do...

916
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,639
for Raf Sandou, given the circumstances,

917
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,979
was helping him secure...

918
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,778
more verses, so he could use them...

919
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,679
at the deathmatch.

920
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,880
I didn't want him...

921
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,818
to use up a lot of verses...

922
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,548
for this match.

923
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,420
I thought that was important for him.

924
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,089
(Raf Sandou, XWALLY)

925
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,160
How many rappers did he defeat?

926
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,288
- Five. - Five? My gosh.

927
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,359
So they only have two rappers left?

928
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,598
Give me the sixth beat. Let's go.

929
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,599
You got this.

930
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:51,368
My gosh, this one is tough.

931
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:52,700
You can take your time and crush him.

932
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,640
- Reddy! - Hey.

933
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,439
I'll be honest, things are good now

934
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,909
I don't want to go back to the old life, so I keep going

935
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,909
Every night in my studio, UGP

936
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,179
Meets up and makes beats that will light up our lives

937
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,548
- My mother told me - What should we do? Do you have it?

938
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:04,709
Nothing happens out of thin air

939
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,618
Even when things got bad, I kept walking quietly

940
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,949
Even if I fall, I'll go to the next stop

941
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,249
And empty your pockets

942
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,218
- Thousands of stones came at me - I can hear him so clearly.

943
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,018
They left me wounds, but I keep walking this earth.

944
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,189
I know my duty, and my life is in the hands of my deity

945
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,929
I realized that this was the only thing I had

946
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,299
It's Sandou.

947
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,670
Let's go, Sandou!

948
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,869
Hey, boy.

949
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:26,940
Let's watch.

950
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,238
Let that cross your head, what's popping?

951
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,138
Check my time, rewind it with my hand on her thigh

952
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,009
She pretends to know me like she already knows my name

953
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,939
I'm wondering why you are here

954
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,848
What can I do for you? A lot of things are on my head

955
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,979
I walk to the studio, and it's already 5am

956
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,149
All the stupid talk, let me keep on grinding

957
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,018
I talk about that cash, it's not going to hype me

958
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:44,919
I put it away for retirement

959
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,859
I just talk about it, she's entertaining

960
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,590
I'm counting the 100-dollar bills, baby, yes

961
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,230
Well done.

962
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
That was cool.

963
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,968
- Okay. - You got this.

964
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,238
Well done.

965
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,510
Both of them did well. But we'll be okay.

966
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,579
Gosh, he's very good.

967
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:08,809
That was nice.

968
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,408
But Reddy still has the momentum.

969
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,549
- He's on fire. - Right.

970
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,119
But I enjoyed listening to his rap.

971
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,349
Both of them did well.

972
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,550
The result of the vote will be revealed.

973
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,789
Let's see.

974
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,320
- Ta-da. What? - Let's see.

975
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,460
- Gos, it came this close? - Come on.

976
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,760
(Raf Sandou wins with 32 votes. Reddy loses with 12 votes.)

977
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:31,129
(Raf Sandou of Block 2 wins.)

978
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,369
That's fine.

979
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,199
Reddy, fantastic job.

980
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,138
- Reddy. - He did an amazing job.

981
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,039
- He defeated like 4 to 5 rappers. - Right.

982
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,448
You carried the whole thing. I mean it.

983
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:45,549
You're the MVP.

984
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,949
- Raf Sandou. Let's go. - Yes, sir.

985
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,948
I selected him as the elimination candidate.

986
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,320
But he saved my team.

987
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:54,058
I pulled my team down to the abyss.

988
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,529
But he climbed up...

989
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,788
all on his own, one step at a time.

990
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,098
He probably doesn't know that...

991
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,400
I chose him as one of the candidates.

992
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:03,869
I thought he did a great job.

993
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,570
Give me the 19th beat.

994
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,170
The 19th beat?

995
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,539
Yes, boy.

996
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,509
I've got a bigger plan, yes, I've been stacking it like Lego

997
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,009
My pocket is getting fat, I don't do anything illegal

998
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,448
When they beat each other down, I just stay in the middle

999
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:19,018
I get my act together, and I do no jiggle

1000
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,448
A big fit and a big whip, let me just dribble it

1001
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,018
If you're going to double it, I'm going to just do it

1002
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:23,388
You can't bring me down, I settled it in my head

1003
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,319
I'll be like Mr. Kim, get the missile ready

1004
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,919
You've never been a man, I met your favorite man

1005
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,388
Calm down, you fool, give me a minute, man

1006
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,988
I'm experienced like a veteran, keep it fresh clean, I need

1007
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,558
I never called you because you're my synonym

1008
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,099
I never told you the engine name

1009
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,928
Keep it like synonym, get puff, yes, I've been smoking on the pack

1010
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,428
Step back, little boy, I've been acting bad

1011
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,899
Please don't contact me, I'm still in my bed

1012
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,138
Bring that beat back, boy, run up a sack

1013
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:42,409
- Do you think you can go next? - Yes.

1014
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,010
- Boy, stay low, pants all sagged - BBULKUP has to go next.

1015
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,710
- Yes. - Nice.

1016
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,779
Give me your best shot, oldie

1017
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,618
- Hey! - Hey!

1018
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:55,149
- BBULKUP! - Yes!

1019
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,788
- People are happy to see him. - Hey.

1020
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:57,848
I've got a lot of opponents

1021
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,518
I'll push you to the side like the smoke

1022
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,058
- What's going on? - What?

1023
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:02,689
- I... - What's going on?

1024
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,058
- It's okay. - I risk my life

1025
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:05,659
- He forgot the lyrics. - Hey.

1026
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,259
- Start from the top again! - Hey!

1027
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,459
My friends disappear one at a time

1028
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,268
Sorry, I'm an express train straight to success

1029
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,328
Thanks to that, my lungs are getting stronger

1030
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,839
Of course, not, turn your head, Park Tae Hwan

1031
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,368
Their suspicions make me stronger

1032
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,569
- With my extraordinary DNA - Raf Sandou is confident now.

1033
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,038
I level up one more time, be honest with me

1034
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,339
I know you've been envious, some of them are my big fans

1035
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,409
- Gosh. - Oh, no!

1036
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,979
- Just diss him! - Gosh.

1037
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,309
What a bummer.

1038
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,420
Darn it!

1039
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,579
Gosh.

1040
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,488
You were doing well.

1041
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,658
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1042
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,558
- His intro was nice. - It ended with "Darn it."

1043
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,929
What a bummer. He was doing well.

1044
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,199
He was really doing well.

1045
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,399
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1046
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,469
Gosh.

1047
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,999
- Yes. - Yes.

1048
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,170
(Raf Sandou wins with 41 votes. BBULKUP loses with 3 votes.)

1049
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,670
(Raf Sandou of Block 2 wins.)

1050
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,308
Actually, Block 3 only has 2 rappers left.

1051
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,710
- They're tied now. - Yes. You're right.

1052
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,879
I think HAON is nervous.

1053
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,309
- Yes. - Look. He's pounding his chest.

1054
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,678
I'll go with the tenth beat.

1055
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,750
The tenth beat?

1056
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,750
Hey.

1057
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:04,349
Hit it.

1058
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,190
Hey.

1059
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,959
I'm going to go harder than bricks

1060
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,629
Let me just count all the chips

1061
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,499
A fist with a different-colored ring

1062
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,098
Kicks with a logo in a different color

1063
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,729
My time goes all the way back

1064
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,768
When I didn't have that, I couldn't fit in

1065
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:21,238
I came a long way with all of that, Xander Wang for my fit

1066
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,908
- Every step I do big - You can't take this one, right?

1067
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,669
- I don't have it. - I'll do it then.

1068
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,509
I never miss now

1069
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,308
Even if it gets tough, get a grip

1070
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,808
Even when I was young, I had to stick to that

1071
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,109
And I'm taking that, all the risks

1072
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,178
HAON will go next.

1073
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,479
Got no worries yet, brothers got my back

1074
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,249
I'm used to that, and you guys quit

1075
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,388
Let me just run through these streets, and on top of me,

1076
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:38,419
She rides it and speeds

1077
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,158
- A chatty boomer, never, please - HAON will go next.

1078
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,888
Never talk back, you know what I mean?

1079
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,828
- Gosh. - Yes.

1080
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,630
- Yes! - Hey.

1081
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,598
- Let's go. - Hey.

1082
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,599
It's HAON.

1083
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,929
- Hey. - Let's go!

1084
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,669
Hey.

1085
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,069
Hey, kids, how are you boys doing?

1086
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,968
I'm just sitting here, drinking my coffee, eating my muffin

1087
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,638
Everything changes, but the only thing that doesn't change

1088
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,439
Is the fact that everything changes, get it?

1089
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,509
Tripping in the importance of it

1090
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,578
- He's like a machine. - What's in it?

1091
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:03,379
The unopened briefcase?

1092
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,779
I just wanted to release a good album

1093
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,518
But money-seeking adults and this world tell me

1094
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,218
To live like this, or live like that

1095
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:09,919
My friends get more lines on their arms

1096
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,788
To live like this, or live like that

1097
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:14,159
My friends get more lines on their arms

1098
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,329
What?

1099
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,630
What? That was it?

1100
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,170
We might be able to win.

1101
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:26,800
My gosh, please.

1102
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,869
- Wasn't that really short? - Please.

1103
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,238
I have to think about this one.

1104
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,639
- This one is tough. - It's tough to choose one.

1105
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,610
Raf Sandou is really good too.

1106
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,010
This one won't be easy.

1107
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,480
- This is tight. - Let's see.

1108
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,250
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1109
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,859
What? This could go either way.

1110
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,988
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1111
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:48,760
- Let's see. - Oh, no.

1112
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,559
(Raf Sandou wins with 28 votes. HAON loses with 16 votes.)

1113
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,260
- Yes! - Hey!

1114
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,638
- Raf Sandou! - Yes!

1115
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,968
I didn't expect to see this.

1116
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,369
My gosh, what a bummer.

1117
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,779
- It's all good. - Well done.

1118
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,009
- It's okay. - I messed it up.

1119
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,848
- It's all good. - All good.

1120
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:10,979
It's all good. It's fine.

1121
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,050
To be honest, that's the beat I wanted to avoid.

1122
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,250
I was a bit disappointed.

1123
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,919
My gosh. There are so many talented rappers here.

1124
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,360
I have no idea which team is going to win.

1125
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,159
How could they lose the lead?

1126
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,730
Wasn't it 2 to 6 before?

1127
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,689
- It's just James An now. - James An.

1128
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,499
It's just James An now.

1129
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,559
Right. Raf Sandou beat three rappers.

1130
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,329
On top of that, Block Two got XWALLY.

1131
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,698
Then Block Two might win.

1132
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,469
- I'll go with the 18th beat. - Let's go.

1133
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,069
- My gosh. - We won.

1134
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,038
- Yes! - Oh, my.

1135
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,448
- Hey! - Hey!

1136
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,349
- It's over. - Okay.

1137
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,549
I'll just be riding around the city

1138
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,018
Everything's packed in, all new

1139
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,019
Run it until the end

1140
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,189
I've got to fill this in, I popped it sober

1141
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,190
Hotter than the sun

1142
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:56,328
When I sing a song, I don't care about your topic

1143
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,129
I'm going to bring the flame, call the fireman

1144
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,399
I needed that base, so I dropped it

1145
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,058
I needed that, so I capped it

1146
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,459
Don't come in, I never counted you in

1147
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,169
Don't talk trash, I'm just going to kick it in

1148
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,669
I roll it in after a cigarette

1149
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,768
These boys are on the same flow, in the same clothes

1150
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,738
Doing the same pose, then they post a lame pic

1151
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:11,308
I need that bass hard, I'll fire up the club

1152
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,178
When you listen to my music, make your body low

1153
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,908
Hey, worldwide, I need that, yen signs, dollar signs

1154
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,509
I've been on my grind since '99

1155
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,908
- Oh, yes, boy, I'm certified - This is good.

1156
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,678
- Hey, he's on fire. - Your style is wack

1157
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,178
I don't call back, I don't do clap, get it right

1158
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,888
Who's that pretty flesh?

1159
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:25,960
Yes, boy, I'm going to make them vibe

1160
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,590
Yes!

1161
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,759
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1162
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,788
- That was crazy. - Go!

1163
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,959
- We won. - Go!

1164
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,868
- Go! - Go!

1165
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,630
- Hey! - Hey!

1166
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,839
Hey, I've got a lot to say

1167
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,768
But the first thing I must tell you is shut your trap

1168
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,339
How dare those kids who have never practiced silence

1169
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,868
Talk to me?

1170
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,279
I'll just be like, "What the heck? Who are you, oldie?"

1171
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,579
Do you know where I went to school? How dare you act like a know-it-all?

1172
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,780
I do not put on a front, I'll use your prejudice

1173
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,549
This guy went to a fancy school

1174
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,249
There's no way he'd be a rapper

1175
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,819
I only do what I want

1176
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,288
My talents harmonize

1177
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:01,558
I got on a plane for "Show Me the Money"

1178
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,259
I said no to the commencement speech at Harvard University

1179
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,928
I said no to Barack Obama

1180
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,499
I said no to Michelle Obama

1181
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,058
I said no to Michelle Obama

1182
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,399
I had to study for an exam

1183
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,828
So I skipped performing in the White House

1184
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,428
- Why is he so good? - I took it easy in the military

1185
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,299
- Anything could happen now. - I didn't do the morning roll call

1186
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,268
As for the boomers who tell me what to do

1187
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:17,369
I mess their heads up

1188
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:20,539
I mess their heads up

1189
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,710
A grandpa walks past me, sees my shirt, and says, "Harvard"

1190
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,948
The restaurant owner brings her son

1191
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,949
She asks me to shake his hand and gives me soju for free

1192
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,059
- Harvard - Harvard

1193
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,859
- Hey. - Harvard

1194
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,889
Hey, have you seen anyone brag about their schools in Korea?

1195
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,328
- Has anyone ever done that? - No. Never.

1196
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,400
Darn it.

1197
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,869
Harvard

1198
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,968
- Mr. Harvard. - Harvard.

1199
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:49,038
- What was that? - He took it.

1200
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,509
- Gosh. This is fun. - It was nice.

1201
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,609
This one is tough.

1202
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,908
Big safe.

1203
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,309
- My gosh, he's really good. - Goodness.

1204
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,449
- He's good. - Raf Sandou went to Yonsei.

1205
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,178
But he went to Harvard.

1206
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,819
Harvard!

1207
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,959
- He went to Harvard? - For his master's degree.

1208
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,459
- What? - Really?

1209
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,459
Raf Sandou's rap was tight too.

1210
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,158
His last verse was my favorite so far.

1211
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,130
Raf Sandou? Yes. I think he's on fire.

1212
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,729
My gosh, their match is so intense.

1213
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,670
Block Three was hiding their secret weapon.

1214
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,940
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1215
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,439
(James An wins with 32 votes. Raf Sandou loses with 12 votes.)

1216
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,038
- Yes! - One more!

1217
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,980
- Oh, man! - Okay.

1218
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,749
Harvard!

1219
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,948
- Harvard! - Harvard!

1220
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,578
- Okay. - It's okay. You were great.

1221
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,849
- You were amazing. - Okay.

1222
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,360
I have no idea how this is going to turn out.

1223
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:43,530
(Each block only has one rapper remaining now.)

1224
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,559
If he chooses boom bap for his beat...

1225
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,429
Oh, no. Boom bap...

1226
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,029
No, you're good.

1227
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,368
Gosh, which one should I go with?

1228
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:52,968
Just give me the first beat. Drop it.

1229
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,169
- Yes. - What?

1230
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,039
- What was that? - Number one in the business.

1231
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,880
Let's do it. I'll kill this one.

1232
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,440
Let's go. Let's do it.

1233
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,949
He can't lower his guard down just yet.

1234
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,018
I don't care about your opinions

1235
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:12,718
If they aren't real facts

1236
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,419
It will remain as a rumor forever

1237
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,058
Filing a missing person report will be a waste of time

1238
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:18,488
You can't grasp the situation or make a judgment

1239
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,900
I'll smash it, fake face

1240
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,968
After making a lot of money and buying the truth, cash in

1241
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,569
All my relationships are missed

1242
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,399
I don't have time for you because my schedule is busy

1243
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,598
You're busy chasing a pipe dream

1244
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,839
Cloud-chasing fool, who do you think you are?

1245
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,339
I don't mix with those kids

1246
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,839
Who contribute to making the world a louder place

1247
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,779
Learn something and then come to me

1248
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,480
People these days are pretty stupid

1249
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:38,980
I don't need your concern

1250
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,118
- You want to turn me into a disease - Okay.

1251
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,749
- I beat people's expectations - Okay.

1252
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,219
No more disappointments

1253
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,089
- I went to Harvard, but I'm rapping - Okay.

1254
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,859
- Even I think I'm silly - Hey!

1255
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,388
Honestly, I don't know why I'm doing this

1256
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,089
If there's one person who shouldn't be a rapper, that's me

1257
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,598
But if I become a rapper, I'll have the fanciest diploma

1258
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,029
There are so many things I can do

1259
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,069
But the opportunity cost for me is high

1260
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,598
Maybe, that's why I'm miserable

1261
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,669
So I ask myself again

1262
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,468
Why am I doing this competition

1263
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,268
When I can easily make 100,000 dollars?

1264
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,768
- Yes! - What?

1265
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,808
- That was tight. - He's really good.

1266
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,308
- Oh, my! - Let's go!

1267
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:10,578
- This is the last one. - Let's go.

1268
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,250
- Let's go! - I already like his voice.

1269
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,718
Big drip is you, it's really going to slide for me

1270
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:17,448
You say you're not trying to be me

1271
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,249
I keep going like a D-O-G

1272
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,959
I may have a lot of enemies, but the real enemy is myself

1273
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,589
Put the blame on me, everybody is going to leave

1274
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,359
I don't pay attention to them, I just walk my own path

1275
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,058
I spend my time with the bro and the team

1276
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,799
I'll never lose as long as we're together

1277
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,069
Hold up, all of my brothers, we are in it for love

1278
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,868
Inhale that smoke, I need another puff

1279
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,538
I have to go after the money and the reputation

1280
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:34,698
I don't really go to clubs

1281
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,768
To the sky I ain't really got

1282
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:36,839
- No limits - Everyone is so good.

1283
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,169
The stars shine from the night sky

1284
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,808
I keep working hard today just like any other day

1285
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:42,238
Even in the darkness, I give my all every moment, no kizzy

1286
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,348
- Hey. - Look at the way you're behaving

1287
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,349
You Diddy

1288
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,848
- When I look at you, I pity - Hey!

1289
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:47,678
- Try to stop me, but I'm winning - Hey!

1290
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,319
Hop on a Benz, Yes, I'm about to go get it

1291
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,988
European vibes, I'm standing on business

1292
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:52,788
I spend the minutes I can never get back

1293
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,859
I try out everything before I regret

1294
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,189
Even when I have a show in my room

1295
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,328
Staring at the wall, I feel like a rockstar

1296
00:45:58,329 --> 00:45:59,759
Even if we might rap about the same thing

1297
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,629
You know that my vibe is different

1298
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,029
I ain't going to mess with you, either way

1299
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,129
I'm busy working on my own stuff

1300
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,669
I don't care what these fools say

1301
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,209
Because they all just sound like kittens to me

1302
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,440
That was nice.

1303
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,279
Get out of here.

1304
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,609
- Yes! - Gosh.

1305
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,509
My gosh, how am I going to vote for this one?

1306
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,879
- This is so hard. - Get out of here.

1307
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,719
My gosh, he's good.

1308
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:21,419
Everyone is so good.

1309
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,718
We got this.

1310
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,559
You killed that. That was too easy for you.

1311
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,119
Block Two is tough.

1312
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:31,158
- Gosh. - Goodness, this is so hard.

1313
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,529
Why are they both so good?

1314
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,199
My gosh, that was really cool.

1315
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,630
This is fun.

1316
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,829
- They're the last rappers! - I really have no idea.

1317
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,199
Please!

1318
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:43,510
Let's huddle up.

1319
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,510
All right, guys. Let's huddle up for the result.

1320
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,280
This is nerve-racking for me too.

1321
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,809
This final round is crazy.

1322
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,679
- I can't watch this. - Get us on the bus.

1323
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
This is so fun.

1324
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:54,380
My gosh, they must be so nervous.

1325
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,389
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1326
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,550
Hey.

1327
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:01,018
I can't wait to find out what's going to happen.

1328
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,820
- My heart is beating fast. - Seriously.

1329
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:05,030
(XWALLY wins with 32 votes. James An loses with 12 votes.)

1330
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,900
(XWALLY of Block 2 wins.)

1331
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:10,130
- XWALLY! - XWALLY!

1332
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:14,538
It's okay!

1333
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:16,210
- You were great. It's fine. - You did well.

1334
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,808
- This was crazy. - XWALLY.

1335
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:20,209
There was a twist after a twist.

1336
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,038
It was like watching a drama.

1337
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,949
This match was really fun to watch.

1338
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,618
- They went last for a reason. - Good job.

1339
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:28,619
Please take off...

1340
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,149
My gosh, this was the best.

1341
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,589
The last match was the best.

1342
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,359
The pressure must have been insane.

1343
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,389
- It's okay. - It's fine.

1344
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:35,959
- Oh, my. - The first...

1345
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,729
There are moments when the players...

1346
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,328
perform well and eventually lead their team to victory.

1347
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:44,070
We often see moments like this in movies, dramas, and sports games.

1348
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,630
It was quite a thrill.

1349
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Nice. Well done.

1350
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,670
I was disappointed in myself.

1351
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,880
It felt like the tower we worked on to build together...

1352
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:56,179
had crumbled down because of me.

1353
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:59,349
Block Two won the match.

1354
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,578
(Block 2 wins. Block 3 loses.)

1355
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:03,590
- Let's go. - That was an amazing match.

1356
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,649
But this one was really intense.

1357
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,690
It was really intense. My gosh.

1358
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,389
Blocks 2 and 3. Please return to your seats...

1359
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,959
- now that the match has ended. - That was crazy.

1360
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,198
- That's right. - It was fun.

1361
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,300
It was a great game.

1362
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,199
There were so many twists and turns.

1363
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,799
It was so fun.

1364
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,940
It was fun to watch and compete.

1365
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,839
There were rappers I had never seen before,

1366
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,679
but they came out and killed it.

1367
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,179
Each block had one of those fresh rappers.

1368
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,009
They're the same as the demons, Screw the police

1369
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,218
The chatty ones don't know me

1370
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:36,848
Nosun impressed me a lot. He was a fantastic rapper.

1371
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:38,889
No one expected that from Nosun.

1372
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,059
But he suddenly dropped such cool lines.

1373
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,819
Baby, there ain't no due date

1374
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,389
What?

1375
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,098
Raf Sandou... My gosh.

1376
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,828
"How is it possible that I didn't know about him?"

1377
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:50,869
It was crazy.

1378
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,840
Tray B was really good.

1379
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,169
I could feel that young rapper's energy...

1380
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,738
boiling with such passion.

1381
00:48:58,739 --> 00:48:59,879
I'm really busy every day

1382
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,678
I think Double Down is a one-of-a-kind rapper.

1383
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,679
He has this unique charm about him.

1384
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,948
My day-to-day life is killing me

1385
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:13,320
KP. I liked his eyes. He's got this raw energy about him.

1386
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,919
Check this out now

1387
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,888
Darn it. He can finish it then.

1388
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:20,360
There were so many good rappers I had no idea about.

1389
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,869
Personally, I loved that my existing views on them changed.

1390
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:27,968
This was our first mission together after forming...

1391
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:29,139
our block.

1392
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,039
It was another chance for us to bond more as a team.

1393
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,309
Our block deserves first place, no doubt about it.

1394
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:38,078
I believe we proved that to the other blocks...

1395
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,280
through our match.

1396
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,178
The final victory? You just wait.

1397
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,218
I hope Block Eight can stay strong as a team...

1398
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,750
and win the whole thing together.

1399
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,419
All the matches...

1400
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,559
of the Block Breaker, the first Block Match, have ended.

1401
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,760
Good work, everyone!

1402
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,760
Gosh, I'm tired.

1403
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,130
- I'm so drained. - Yes.

1404
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,239
The winning blocks from the Block Breaker are...

1405
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:05,610
Block 2, Block 4, Block 6, and Block 7.

1406
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,808
- Yes. - Let it go.

1407
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:11,709
The winning blocks will receive 10,000 dollars.

1408
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,710
That feels good.

1409
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,348
This was the thrill of being the winner.

1410
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,219
We'll enjoy the 10,000 dollars.

1411
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:21,619
I felt what it meant to feel small.

1412
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,360
It was depressing.

1413
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,359
However, the four losing blocks of the Block Match...

1414
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,070
will participate in the deathmatch and may face elimination.

1415
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,599
Oh, my gosh.

1416
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,369
I'm glad that doesn't concern us.

1417
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:38,610
Before we begin the deathmatch,

1418
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,840
we'll make an announcement.

1419
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,679
The leaders of the society...

1420
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,079
were given the authority to make one more decision.

1421
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:47,849
It's time.

1422
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:51,150
They were able to pick the elimination candidates.

1423
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,019
All of the leaders...

1424
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,319
had already chosen three rappers...

1425
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,529
- Oh, my gosh. - as the elimination candidates.

1426
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,829
You had that power?

1427
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:00,929
Yes.

1428
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,699
Did you really do that?

1429
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,300
If I have to go, I'll double my effort.

1430
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,699
That's so cruel.

1431
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,538
- So you did that too? - Yes, I'm sorry.

1432
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:11,369
- Gosh, really? - I'm sorry.

1433
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,179
(Before the start of the Block Match)

1434
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,320
Block Six.

1435
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:26,989
(The leaders chose three elimination candidates.)

1436
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,019
I'll pick this rapper as the elimination candidate.

1437
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:34,559
All of the elimination candidates chosen by the leaders...

1438
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:38,099
will participate in the deathmatch.

1439
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:42,239
I thought it could be me. I had a feeling it would be me.

1440
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:44,909
I thought that it could be me.

1441
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,739
The losing blocks of the Block Match,

1442
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:50,010
Block 1, Block 3,

1443
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:53,320
Block 5, and Block 8.

1444
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,178
The leaders of the called blocks are asked to come up to the stage.

1445
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,089
- Gosh, to call them out? - Oh, my gosh.

1446
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,250
Oh, my gosh.

1447
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,989
I guess they will have to call out the candidates.

1448
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,829
My gosh, this is so cruel.

1449
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,289
This is a scary place.

1450
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,529
The leaders of the losing blocks...

1451
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,800
will call out the elimination candidates.

1452
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,529
If your names are called,

1453
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,340
- I should brace myself. - come up to the stage.

1454
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,110
If your name gets called, you have to go up.

1455
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,639
Leader of Block One, Fleeky Bang.

1456
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,710
Name the rappers you chose as the elimination rappers.

1457
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,320
The first rapper is GOLDBUUDA.

1458
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:38,659
- It's iffy to clap. - Right.

1459
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,099
The second rapper is Kang Hyuk.

1460
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,199
- Okay. - Gosh, Kang Hyuk did well.

1461
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,239
The third rapper is... I gave it a lot of thought.

1462
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,070
It's JEFFERY WHITE.

1463
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:56,479
I didn't get resentful that he chose me.

1464
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,610
I was more overwhelmed at how cruel this system was.

1465
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,480
Leader of Block One, Fleeky Bang.

1466
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,250
Please return to your seat.

1467
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:05,989
I won't get eliminated.

1468
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:07,690
Don't.

1469
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:12,489
He must feel awful.

1470
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,329
Psychologically, I felt awful.

1471
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,769
But I had to pick three rappers.

1472
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,698
The first elimination candidate is Churry.

1473
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,199
(The 1st elimination candidate of Block 8, Churry)

1474
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,409
From Seoul National University.

1475
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,609
The second rapper is LEO.

1476
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,610
(The 2nd elimination candidate of Block 8, LEO)

1477
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:30,848
The third rapper is...

1478
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:34,948
(The 3rd elimination candidate of Block 8)

1479
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,449
It's Bizzy.

1480
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:37,989
What?

1481
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,619
- gamma chose Bizzy. - Right.

1482
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,190
This is hilarious.

1483
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,690
- What a crazy world this is. - Is this even okay?

1484
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,630
I had a feeling it could be me.

1485
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,900
I should have done better. That's a fact too.

1486
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,268
To be honest, the performance...

1487
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:58,469
Bizzy showed us so far was disappointing.

1488
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:00,639
(During the Block Breaker)

1489
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:01,710
I don't have it.

1490
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,348
I prepared a verse for this beat.

1491
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:06,150
But I'll take a breather for now.

1492
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:08,250
I'll step back.

1493
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,789
I chose rappers whom I thought wouldn't perform well...

1494
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,920
in the next mission.

1495
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:19,189
Leader of Block Three, HAON.

1496
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,499
Name the rappers you chose...

1497
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,860
as the elimination rappers.

1498
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,868
The first rapper is James An.

1499
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,269
- What? - It's James.

1500
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,768
(Surprised)

1501
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,710
Did HAON tell you about the three elimination candidates?

1502
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:33,909
I thought every block decided on that before the match.

1503
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,409
- I didn't tell my block. - Really?

1504
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:38,650
When I saw rappers from the other blocks,

1505
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,519
they were all surprised.

1506
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:44,719
I realized HAON was transparent with us and told us everything.

1507
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:46,760
And he gave us the chance to decide.

1508
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,489
He was a true leader.

1509
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,389
And Yang Kyle.

1510
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:52,929
Gosh, come on. Are you kidding me?

1511
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,260
What's going on?

1512
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,300
- He was smart. - That was clever.

1513
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,769
They can come back from this.

1514
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,368
And Reddy.

1515
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:03,098
(The 3rd elimination candidate of Block 3, Reddy)

1516
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,710
See?

1517
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:07,038
Leader of Block Three, HAON.

1518
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:08,879
- Please return to your seat. - It's going as planned.

1519
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,150
It's okay. Don't feel so bad.

1520
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,678
We have our own strategy.

1521
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,849
Leader of Block Five, JP.

1522
00:55:16,889 --> 00:55:18,650
I could never read JP.

1523
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,489
The first elimination candidate is...

1524
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,130
MASON HOME.

1525
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:27,029
Hash Swan. Mckdaddy.

1526
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,129
What? It's not what we talked about.

1527
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,469
It's not what we talked about.

1528
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:32,170
- He didn't tell them either. - I see.

1529
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:33,900
- He didn't tell them. - He didn't tell them.

1530
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,440
Why did he pick them?

1531
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,908
Why did you do this?

1532
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:40,308
You know what? If they were to go with that order,

1533
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:42,639
MASON HOME wouldn't stand a chance. You know that, right?

1534
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,908
He said he wanted to be eliminated.

1535
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,149
He told you he wanted to be eliminated?

1536
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,349
Right. So...

1537
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,750
That wasn't smart.

1538
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:51,649
- Why didn't you share that... - Right.

1539
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,119
with us?

1540
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:55,218
At first,

1541
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,729
I was going to send out...

1542
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,159
three strong rappers to be more strategic.

1543
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,629
The first thought I had was sending you three.

1544
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,669
(JP named Khundi Panda, Mckdaddy, and Luci Gang...)

1545
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,729
(as the elimination candidates.)

1546
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,340
Because I believe in you guys.

1547
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,939
But because of the risk of losing these strong rappers,

1548
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,840
MASON HOME said he would be the candidate.

1549
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,078
There's no guarantee in the deathmatch.

1550
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,449
All three of them could get eliminated.

1551
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,119
If someone has to get eliminated from our block,

1552
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,388
it should be me because I have the highest risk.

1553
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:27,460
And the two of them could survive. That's probably the best outcome.

1554
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,718
In the deathmatch,

1555
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,460
it will all come down to our rap skills.

1556
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,529
If that's the case...

1557
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,460
(MASON HOME volunteered for the sake of Block 5.)

1558
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,329
If you have to make a decision like this again, put me in.

1559
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,170
- I'd feel better that way. - Right.

1560
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,768
So Mckdaddy ended up...

1561
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:43,969
- on the list anyway. - Right.

1562
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,710
I get what you think.

1563
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,309
I'll unfollow you as soon as I get my phone.

1564
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,510
I'm joking.

1565
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,979
The rules of the deathmatch are as follows.

1566
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,948
I can't watch this.

1567
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,050
I can't watch this.

1568
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,159
The elimination candidates...

1569
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,459
will perform a rap without music.

1570
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,499
Without music?

1571
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,098
- That's too harsh. - Darn it.

1572
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:11,230
This is the worst.

1573
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,669
This is really the worst.

1574
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,268
- This is too much. - Darn.

1575
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:18,010
Our plan is ruined.

1576
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:22,909
Among the 12 that came to the deathmatch,

1577
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,280
the members who fail to survive as a result of the voting...

1578
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,249
will immediately leave this place.

1579
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,749
Really? Today?

1580
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,519
- This is cruel. - I know.

1581
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,189
The deathmatch will begin shortly.

1582
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,988
It would be really tough.

1583
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:40,300
All members of RAP:PUBLIC,

1584
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,670
please return to the Village.

1585
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,868
How will it go?

1586
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:49,399
Those three were for that.

1587
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,670
- These three were for this purpose. - Goodness.

1588
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,409
The names are written.

1589
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:58,349
(The names of the elimination candidates are hung in each block.)

1590
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,679
Here.

1591
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:02,419
This is crazy.

1592
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,018
- You did well. - You all did a great job.

1593
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,960
- Well done everyone. - You really did great.

1594
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,189
What is this?

1595
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,230
There's something weird.

1596
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
What is there?

1597
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,098
Hey. We have something here.

1598
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,630
There's something.

1599
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,569
No way. Is this for the three people who lost to go home?

1600
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,440
- No way. - What?

1601
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:26,469
I was so exhausted.

1602
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,139
I hoped they would come back.

1603
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,409
Please come back.

1604
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,388
We just need them to come back.

1605
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,449
(We just need the 3 elimination candidates to come back.)

1606
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,019
Staying here like this wouldn't help us do better.

1607
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,129
We'll handle this on our own.

1608
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,159
- We... - Trust us.

1609
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,529
You have to give us energy...

1610
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:48,899
so we do our best there.

1611
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,800
When we go there.

1612
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,469
It was really depressing.

1613
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:03,039
I had so many thoughts.

1614
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:06,280
I was anxious.

1615
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,519
Let's not make the sacrifice of our members to go in vain.

1616
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:11,988
It would be best if I don't get to leave,

1617
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:14,759
but let's have a drink when we leave this place.

1618
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,989
Sounds good.

1619
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,030
It will turn out well.

1620
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:19,729
- It should go well. - It should.

1621
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,299
- It should go well. - It will go well.

1622
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,329
Don't worry.

1623
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,599
What on earth?

1624
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,138
The deathmatch will begin in a moment.

1625
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:32,840
- What? - Goodness.

1626
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:34,078
Really?

1627
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,840
- Really? Right now? - Darn.

1628
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:37,380
We're doing it right away.

1629
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,880
This is better.

1630
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,949
The 12 elimination candidates...

1631
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,920
can get your luggage...

1632
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:48,259
and head to the arena now.

1633
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,420
With the luggage?

1634
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,928
We need to pack?

1635
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:53,828
Are we supposed to go to the arena after packing our bags?

1636
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:56,400
- Darn it. I won't lose. - Hurry.

1637
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:09,710
- See you later. - I'll come back, HAON.

1638
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,578
- Good luck. - You have to be here...

1639
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,549
so we'll be back as a team when we return.

1640
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,780
- Okay. - You know what I'm saying?

1641
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,988
- We won't die. - Of course, we won't.

1642
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,949
- Good luck. - Make sure to survive.

1643
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,788
- You're Kang Hyuk, not Weak Hyuk. - Right.

1644
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:23,689
- Come back alive. - I'll go rap again.

1645
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,690
That's right.

1646
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:26,690
- Come back alive, MASON. - Right.

1647
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,300
You should all come back and unpack your things in the cabinet.

1648
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:33,469
I'll do my best.

1649
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:35,299
- Good luck. - Put your life out there.

1650
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,670
- Okay. - It's a deathmatch.

1651
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,650
(The 12 elimination candidates are on the deathmatch stage.)

1652
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:48,578
We will now begin the deathmatch.

1653
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,919
(We will now begin the deathmatch.)

1654
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,749
If we can listen...

1655
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,589
We'd be able to listen if they use mics.

1656
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,059
Goodness.

1657
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:58,529
This is burdensome. It's so much burden.

1658
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,690
The deathmatch...

1659
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,260
will be evaluated by the rappers...

1660
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,429
in the blocks that won in the previous Block Match.

1661
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:08,139
My brain isn't working after seeing that.

1662
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,739
They even have their suitcases. My goodness.

1663
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,210
I felt bad.

1664
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,138
I would have to listen to them seriously.

1665
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:19,150
The number of members that can survive in this deathmatch...

1666
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:22,579
is six.

1667
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,518
- Survive? - Half of them.

1668
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:25,649
Six.

1669
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,158
It's doable.

1670
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:28,658
- Seriously. - It's not bad.

1671
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:33,328
The top six people who get the most number of votes...

1672
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:34,559
will survive.

1673
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,300
We will now begin the deathmatch.

1674
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:39,699
I'm so nervous.

1675
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,499
- Are you nervous? - My heart is beating so fast.

1676
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,738
It's okay. Be at ease.

1677
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:44,238
- Do it comfortably. - There are no beats as well.

1678
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:47,639
The elimination candidates will come forward one by one...

1679
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,849
and present the stage they prepared.

1680
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,948
(Block 3's James An comes forward.)

1681
01:01:53,949 --> 01:01:55,279
Let's go!

1682
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,920
Let's go!

1683
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:00,090
Yes. Let's go.

1684
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,729
After the first Block Match ended and we returned to the Village,

1685
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,029
the air was really depressing for us...

1686
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,500
as I imagine it would have for the other blocks as well.

1687
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,198
We said, "It's okay. We'll come back."

1688
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:15,538
But it was hard to bring our spirits back up.

1689
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:18,209
I respect that sadness.

1690
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,808
Please come back.

1691
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:23,510
I'll do my best so that we can go further up with that energy.

1692
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Yes.

1693
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:32,718
Rapper from Harvard, I flex my educational background

1694
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,259
I use my 25,000 dollar scholarship to buy my mom a designer bag

1695
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,859
Boom bap, I kill that, Then resuscitate

1696
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,488
Remix, I'm on that new trial period

1697
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,828
I wasn't asked to, I'm a donation angel state of mind

1698
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,658
Donating my talent all day, A yes-no question

1699
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,729
Rest in peace to ignorance, I'm on Instagram

1700
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,138
I better learn, Shut my mouth and learn

1701
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,670
Frontal lobe flex

1702
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:53,809
He reminds me of Tiger JK.

1703
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,639
(The voting begins.)

1704
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:58,409
They vote right away.

1705
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:01,018
(The blocks that won vote carefully as it will decide his survival.)

1706
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:03,279
I don't know, I have my mindset

1707
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,488
He lives in the past, But I move on without regret

1708
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:06,618
I don't leave Plan Bs

1709
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,819
I don't do things I've done before, I aim for the head

1710
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,959
Notorious in front of my name

1711
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,259
Reload and shoot in the time to hesitate and shoot again

1712
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,359
I'm the wildest person, I need to kill

1713
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,499
Reward for blood

1714
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,929
Go all-in, do or die

1715
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,469
- Goodness. - Thank you.

1716
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,638
Thank you.

1717
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:22,698
Daddy.

1718
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,670
- That was awesome. - He's really good.

1719
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,839
You'd be crazy to not vote for him after listening to that.

1720
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,879
That's right.

1721
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,848
Hit the one and another one, Feeling the money rain

1722
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,549
It makes no money and isn't even cool

1723
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,149
Why would I do that?

1724
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,848
Their release date overlaps with mine

1725
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:38,419
Why would I change mine?

1726
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,420
I cannot rest, man

1727
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:41,288
I'm trending more than your recent release, man

1728
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:43,690
I leave this game, man

1729
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:45,559
- Thank you. - He's good.

1730
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,199
Goodness.

1731
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:48,999
My bars are like drums

1732
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,669
My lines shoot in your ears

1733
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,098
I'm not doing too much, I just put in the life I lived

1734
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:54,099
I'm diving in

1735
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,509
You're a fake trend, I'm moving

1736
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,210
Stop moving like a rat

1737
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,638
Stop chewing like a rat

1738
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:04,879
He stumbled on many words. That was disappointing.

1739
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,408
He looked very nervous.

1740
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,880
Hello. I'm Reddy.

1741
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,550
Yes.

1742
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:14,119
I packed more things than other people.

1743
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,259
I packed so many things.

1744
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,829
I think it wouldn't be right to just leave after one day.

1745
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,029
So I should stay.

1746
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,658
I'll rap my best.

1747
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:23,659
Yes.

1748
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,999
RAP:PUBLIC wants something raw from me

1749
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,709
A lively fish like those in Noryangjin

1750
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,138
I want a cooler ride

1751
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:35,738
Something to wear on my wrist even if I don't look at the time

1752
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,078
I became soft after making a few love songs

1753
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,649
They keep asking me about The Cohort

1754
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,149
Why would I answer that to you?

1755
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:46,018
I would put that story in my full album releasing next year

1756
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:47,959
They all show off their diamond

1757
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,288
Their cars are 100,000 dollar leases or rentals

1758
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:53,529
Well done, How much is that Benz?

1759
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:56,659
But you don't have a house yet? Okay.

1760
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,808
I think Reddy is done.

1761
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:07,138
He's shown everything he should.

1762
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:08,808
I'm the Robin-est, ballin-est

1763
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:10,709
Ing-est, carpe diem on my own

1764
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,649
Mabiki live if without potential before it gets crowded

1765
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:16,618
Trying to copy me, Watch my weird smiling with Harley Quinn

1766
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:18,319
I'm tired of my 100,000-dollar Coupe now

1767
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,919
I don't believe in miracles, I worship my memo

1768
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,419
I gather and stab the success stories and laugh

1769
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,619
Who killed the freaky barbie-est?

1770
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,089
Yes.

1771
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,130
Great.

1772
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,730
Hello, I'm OKASHI's JEFFERY.

1773
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,030
JEFFERY WHITE?

1774
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,639
The reason I should survive...

1775
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:36,199
is because I hate losing.

1776
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,039
I think I'll feel bad if I lose this after losing the battle.

1777
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:40,369
Let's go.

1778
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:42,340
You got this.

1779
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,609
Your fit wack bars wack, I won't let it slide the third time

1780
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,819
Like traveling, You said it was famous

1781
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,279
Stop bragging to me if you haven't been in a magazine

1782
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,089
One, two, three, four, I can't understand

1783
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,919
Our ways are so different, You keep saying I'm wrong

1784
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,988
I don't think that's the right way

1785
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:58,029
My title is so ANTI, I won't wear your clothes

1786
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,799
One, two, three, four, Like a type beat

1787
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,799
Lay my bae with Weitzman thigh high

1788
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,768
The lyrics you said you were going to steal

1789
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:07,599
Just like "Supernova" by aespa

1790
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:13,908
That will leave an impression.

1791
01:06:13,909 --> 01:06:16,440
Yes, sir. GOLDBUUDA ready, you know?

1792
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,750
- That sounds like GOLDBUUDA. - I think so.

1793
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,018
Come back another version of me

1794
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,689
Something suspicious about them who tried to make a mess behind me

1795
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:27,459
Suspicious guys are clinging to me now that I've become famous

1796
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,519
- This is GOLDBUUDA, right? - Yes.

1797
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:32,489
Oh, this is how the winners shout

1798
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,570
(Kang Hyuk of Block 1 goes for it.)

1799
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:42,738
You crazy punk, You still don't know who I am

1800
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:44,368
This is a high-level trap mode

1801
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:46,939
Part-time money going through Line Two metro and bus

1802
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,138
Cup ramyeon eaten in tears, A call from my mom filled with worry

1803
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:54,079
I told you this won't be easy, It's a high-level trap mode

1804
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
Thank you.

1805
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:57,949
That was cool.

1806
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,919
He just started off with swearing.

1807
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,889
Hello, I'm Churry.

1808
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,829
I'm a Physics teacher,

1809
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:08,260
and I also rap in the meantime.

1810
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,999
I've been doing music for nine years.

1811
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,839
I wanted to emphasize that I've been doing it persistently...

1812
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,639
for a long time.

1813
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,469
His enunciation is clear because he's a teacher.

1814
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:21,710
He speaks well.

1815
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:22,940
Say less.

1816
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,479
All the rappers here brag about money

1817
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,718
How much do you make? It wasn't even that much

1818
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:30,889
Money

1819
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:32,690
He didn't write a new verse.

1820
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,388
Don't look at me that way

1821
01:07:36,389 --> 01:07:37,558
Ignorance is bliss

1822
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:39,129
It would be great to pay taxes

1823
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,360
I'm jealous you can do that

1824
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,629
That was cute.

1825
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:47,639
Hello.

1826
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:50,539
To the older rappers, friends, and younger rappers,

1827
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:52,238
congratulations on winning.

1828
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:53,710
I wanted to help you release some dopamine,

1829
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,440
so let me perform a song for you.

1830
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,010
Okay!

1831
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,019
I'm thirsty

1832
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,389
Pick up this because I win in this, You know who runs this

1833
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:06,888
My life is a movie based on a true story

1834
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:08,288
I just need money in my tummy

1835
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:10,119
I need to have everything that I wanted

1836
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:12,828
Scan what's on my brain with MRI

1837
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,400
Then you're going to see my money dancing

1838
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,959
What's in my heart

1839
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,299
Only ambition, not love, Heart won't be racing without it

1840
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,969
I'm scared I might become the king

1841
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,840
But still I want it, I'm thirsty

1842
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:24,109
Thank you.

1843
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,180
Bravo.

1844
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:30,578
That was crazy.

1845
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:32,578
I could feel that he was enjoying his performance...

1846
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:34,949
despite the current circumstances.

1847
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,380
You're going to make it.

1848
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:38,550
Hopefully.

1849
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:40,220
All our blockmates are done.

1850
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,260
They all did it, and they were all good...

1851
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,189
for now.

1852
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,159
I feel like they'll be in the top six.

1853
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,529
I think I started to feel relieved.

1854
01:08:49,729 --> 01:08:51,430
I felt hopeful.

1855
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,170
They might even come back.

1856
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,839
The next rapper will now come forward...

1857
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,010
and show us your performance.

1858
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,078
Hello, I'm Bizzy.

1859
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:05,279
- Bizzy. - It's Bizzy.

1860
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,849
It's been a long journey to get here

1861
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,679
Where am I going next?

1862
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,519
I can't afford to have these minor concerns

1863
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,519
But I'm not yet used to it

1864
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,259
Train to go, I'm all in

1865
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,488
In terms of golf, it's a hole-in-one

1866
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:20,429
Music makes me high

1867
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,329
That's my only reason

1868
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:23,559
Expectations are too high

1869
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,568
I've been struggling with nightmares every night

1870
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:27,299
I'm moving on to the next chapter

1871
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,969
Just leave me alone to do my own thing

1872
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,839
My music is my story and my energy

1873
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,039
I'm feeling good though

1874
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,210
Thank you.

1875
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,849
Two rappers have received the same score.

1876
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:43,850
(Two rappers have the same score.)

1877
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,090
They'll be doing another battle to decide the winner.

1878
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:47,989
This is cruel up to the end.

1879
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,960
This is too much.

1880
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,090
The rappers who will be doing another battle...

1881
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:53,829
Is it Hash Swan and GOLDBUUDA?

1882
01:09:57,829 --> 01:09:58,869
Bizzy?

1883
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,669
Hash Swan and...

1884
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:03,698
Bizzy.

1885
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,239
(Another battle by Hash Swan and Bizzy)

1886
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:06,609
Hash, please...

1887
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,779
I'm getting teary.

1888
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,579
We are requesting the two rappers to show us another performance.

1889
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:13,908
Let's go!

1890
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,779
- Come on. - Let's go!

1891
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,619
- Good luck. - Let's go.

1892
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,488
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1893
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:22,960
- Let's go! - Come on.

1894
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:27,629
Still living in Valhalla from 1llibition, Yeouido, and Asgard

1895
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,129
It's young here every night

1896
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,930
- He's good. - I paint the town purple

1897
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,669
Yes, that's our prime time, iPod made it a quiet night

1898
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:35,198
My dawn answers to your questions

1899
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,999
You can't become Hans Landa

1900
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,538
Getting on my carriage the dawn-colored Carrera

1901
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:40,309
I've been aiming for this with my laurel wreath

1902
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,009
I'm not interested in fantasies

1903
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,710
Only this can bring me to Valhalla

1904
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:45,479
Thank you.

1905
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:48,119
You're good.

1906
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:52,350
He'll win 100 percent.

1907
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,520
We should give Hash Swan a piggyback ride when he comes back.

1908
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:58,359
- Go, Bizzy! - Go, Bizzy!

1909
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,899
- This is making me tear up. - Amazing.

1910
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,960
(Block 8 sends their cheer for Bizzy.)

1911
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:07,739
What was that?

1912
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,199
They were listening.

1913
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,439
They must've known after hearing their voices.

1914
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:12,470
This is suddenly giving me the chills.

1915
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:14,979
Bizzy seems like he's tearing up.

1916
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:16,579
Why are you crying?

1917
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,210
Don't cry.

1918
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,720
Don't cry.

1919
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:24,119
Stop crying.

1920
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,219
Eight birthdays for a leap month

1921
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,158
Multiple crises in my life

1922
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,818
Walking with a tilted fate

1923
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,559
Walking over and over again

1924
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,188
I talked to the sky in a drunk voice

1925
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:34,959
Starting a fight with a higher being

1926
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,799
Back when I was immature

1927
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,499
Dreams were far from reach as they were only dreams

1928
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,438
Penniless, These were a luxury for me

1929
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:45,569
Then you came and reached out to me

1930
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:47,339
Like I was the sun

1931
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,009
Used to be a silly bum

1932
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,438
I was exhausted up to my limits

1933
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,778
Collapsing from weariness but you gave me wings to fly

1934
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:54,779
My angel

1935
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:02,390
The deathmatch has ended.

1936
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,630
His performance moved my heart.

1937
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,228
He spoke sincerely...

1938
01:12:07,229 --> 01:12:09,560
and performed his lyrics with sincerity.

1939
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,328
It made me tear up.

1940
01:12:11,329 --> 01:12:13,729
There were moments that really moved me.

1941
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,698
I made up my mind to do...

1942
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,470
even better in the next mission.

1943
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,539
Let me announce the six blockmates...

1944
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,909
who received another chance of survival.

1945
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,750
Are they going to announce it? They are.

1946
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,189
I feel like my heart's about to burst.

1947
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:33,319
Please.

1948
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,930
Here is the first member.

1949
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,060
Please...

1950
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,699
(Mckdaddy)

1951
01:12:48,939 --> 01:12:49,939
It's Mckdaddy.

1952
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:53,140
(The first rapper to survive the deathmatch is Mckdaddy.)

1953
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,779
Here is the second member.

1954
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,889
Please return to your block.

1955
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,359
(Which rappers survived the deathmatch?)

1956
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,630
I'm so curious.

1957
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:14,529
- Are you nervous? - Of course.

1958
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:16,560
I'm the one who caused this.

1959
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:19,869
Of course, I'm nervous.

1960
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:23,839
I hope another member joins us...

1961
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,109
in making these corny jokes.

1962
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:30,479
- I hope all of them come back. - Please.

1963
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,090
I told you I wasn't going to die. Darn.

1964
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:41,960
(The second rapper to survive the deathmatch is JEFFERY WHITE.)

1965
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,889
- Congratulations. - Congrats.

1966
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,130
I was planning...

1967
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:49,229
to wait on my own if you guys weren't here.

1968
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:51,898
- Thank you. - Good job.

1969
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:53,670
It must've been stressful.

1970
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:55,368
- It must've been hard on you. - I agree.

1971
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:57,670
- Seriously. - I'll win the next match...

1972
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,340
so this doesn't happen again.

1973
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,180
Kang Hyuk and GOLDBUUDA must've been eliminated.

1974
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,779
It may have been hard,

1975
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,279
but I'm proud.

1976
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,949
I feel...

1977
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:13,420
happy that he's back.

1978
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,819
(Block 3 is waiting for the survivor of the deathmatch.)

1979
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:17,020
Who is it?

1980
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,060
Did you get in?

1981
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:19,189
- Did you? - You did?

1982
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,988
- I'm the only one who made it. - Just you?

1983
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,129
Just me.

1984
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,359
(The third rapper who survived the deathmatch is James An.)

1985
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:24,430
Did the other two get eliminated?

1986
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,199
I'm the only one who made it.

1987
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:28,970
Good job.

1988
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,339
- You did well. - Good job.

1989
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,340
Reddy...

1990
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,908
This is incredible.

1991
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:34,309
We heard everything earlier.

1992
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,680
That was unexpected.

1993
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:38,680
- We all made it! - What?

1994
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:40,449
(All three members survived the deathmatch.)

1995
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,680
What's going on?

1996
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,350
- You made it. - Come on!

1997
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:46,890
I told you so!

1998
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,489
I told you, man!

1999
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,789
I told you we were going to make it.

2000
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:56,500
Oh, gosh.

2001
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,869
I was so surprised.

2002
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:05,510
I told you!

2003
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:07,939
Why are you so good at acting?

2004
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,739
Let's stay here.

2005
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:14,180
- Did you make it? - I was the only one who made it.

2006
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:16,119
- Just you? - Just me.

2007
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,449
(The 3 members prepared a surprise for their blockmates.)

2008
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:23,260
We all made it! Darn!

2009
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,800
All right.

2010
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,970
We told you.

2011
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,840
It's all going according to plan.

2012
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:43,340
We solved it.

2013
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:46,479
We just need to go forward.

2014
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:48,680
We made it.

2015
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,819
It couldn't get better than this.

2016
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:54,448
It felt like the world gave us a second chance.

2017
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:55,960
We told you we were coming back.

2018
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,719
We're back.

2019
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,328
We're all back.

2020
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:01,729
- It's like a movie. - I can see it now.

2021
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:03,930
I can see our end.

2022
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,328
I think it will be all right.

2023
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:10,300
(Block 5 and Block 8 are waiting for their deathmatch survivors.)

2024
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,169
It's either their Hash Swan or our Bizzy.

2025
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:17,009
Bizzy and Hash Swan are tied.

2026
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,279
I'm not sure.

2027
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,648
Let's check who's here.

2028
01:16:21,649 --> 01:16:23,119
I wonder what happened.

2029
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,260
This is the last member to continue competing in this society.

2030
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,358
Let's sit here where we can be seen.

2031
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:35,659
(Who will be the last survivor from the deathmatch?)

2032
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:36,899
The person is bringing the suitcase.

2033
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,139
What? They came back.

2034
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,310
(The last deathmatch survivor was Block 5's Hash Swan.)

2035
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:47,839
I trusted you.

2036
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,639
- You did a great job. - Seriously.

2037
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,349
- You did so well. - Really.

2038
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:53,809
Well done.

2039
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,419
- I'm sorry. - You did so well.

2040
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,119
Well done.

2041
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,249
I didn't think we'd get tied.

2042
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,219
- Goodness. - What?

2043
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,618
Did MASON HOME get eliminated?

2044
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:03,658
He did.

2045
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:05,158
But he did well.

2046
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,328
- He did well. - He did well.

2047
01:17:07,329 --> 01:17:10,560
So we thought all of you would come back.

2048
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,399
(No one came back to Block 8.)

2049
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:26,479
We're five now.

2050
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,989
This is the last member.

2051
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:42,930
(Hash Swan)

2052
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:57,010
My love for the hip-hop culture and music...

2053
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,809
is greater than anyone.

2054
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,778
So I felt alive while performing...

2055
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:06,749
with the artists I liked...

2056
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,559
who love hip-hop music.

2057
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,259
Hip-hop is really amazing,

2058
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,559
so I hope you can share the story and message...

2059
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,698
that hip-hop is awesome to others.

2060
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:20,569
It was a very precious time.

2061
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,339
- Thank you. - Well done.

2062
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,738
- Well done. - Well done.

2063
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:27,010
Well done.

2064
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:30,209
The six rappers who weren't chosen...

2065
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,549
will leave this place.

2066
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,309
- Let's go. - Well done.

2067
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,818
(Block 1's eliminated rapper Kang Hyuk)

2068
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:38,419
(Block 1's eliminated rapper GOLDBUDDA)

2069
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,420
We're going first.

2070
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,249
(Fleeky Bang, JTONG, DAMINI, ZENE THE ZILLA, Don Mills,)

2071
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,019
(JEFFERY WHITE)

2072
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,059
Well done. It's good that at least one person survived.

2073
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,988
(Block 5's eliminated rapper MASON HOME)

2074
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,198
(JP, Khundi Panda, Mckdaddy, Hash Swan,)

2075
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,919
(Lucy Gang)

2076
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:55,438
I almost teared up.

2077
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,669
It was all coming from your heart. I felt that.

2078
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,869
You did a good job.

2079
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:00,609
Right.

2080
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:02,709
- All the best. - All the best.

2081
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:03,710
Well done.

2082
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:04,778
(Block 8's eliminated rapper Churry)

2083
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:05,879
(gamma, Hippie Kunda, Drain K,)

2084
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,720
(Daniel Jikal, KP)

2085
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,880
Bye, Bizzy.

2086
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:11,149
- Bye. - Bye.

2087
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:12,949
- Bye. - Bye.

2088
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,649
- Go. - Bye.

2089
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:15,960
Peace out.

2090
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,859
(They return to their blocks after the deathmatch.)

2091
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,859
Hey.

2092
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:25,399
Look at this.

2093
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:27,369
Goodness.

2094
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,369
Gosh.

2095
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:36,579
(A special reward to the blocks that won)

2096
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:40,278
Goodness.

2097
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:42,618
We should have a party.

2098
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:45,288
Food was on the tables of the blocks that won.

2099
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:46,618
Various things to eat...

2100
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:49,618
and the most important, Jack Daniel's.

2101
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:52,489
Gosh! What is this?

2102
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:53,858
I came back,

2103
01:19:53,859 --> 01:19:56,528
and the first thing I saw was Jack Daniel's.

2104
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:57,929
I was so happy.

2105
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,600
It's nice to win.

2106
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:04,869
(Someone heads to the Choice Block right after victory.)

2107
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,140
(Exclaiming)

2108
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:14,109
Money.

2109
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:15,818
(The winning blocks were given 10,000 dollars of Block Money each.)

2110
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:17,350
Thank you.

2111
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,988
(Block 2)

2112
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:21,989
(Block 2's Block Money)

2113
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,619
(4,000 dollars to 14,000 dollars)

2114
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:25,390
Let me smell it once more.

2115
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,959
(Block 4's Block Money)

2116
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,459
(8,000 dollars to 18,000 dollars)

2117
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,930
- Fifteen thousand dollars. - Gosh.

2118
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,099
(Block 7's Block Money)

2119
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,729
(5,000 dollars to 15,000 dollars)

2120
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:35,339
(Block 6)

2121
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,069
We did one job for now.

2122
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,669
Professor Geegooin was the factor of our victory.

2123
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,038
It was so lovely.

2124
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:42,078
(Block 6's Block Money)

2125
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:43,778
(7,000 dollars to 17,000 dollars)

2126
01:20:43,779 --> 01:20:45,078
(Current Block Money Ranking)

2127
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,408
(1st Block 4, 2nd Block 6, 3rd Block 7, 4th Block 2)

2128
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:47,779
(5th Block 5, 6th Block 3, 7th Block 1, 8th Block 8)

2129
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,879
Aren't we in first place when it comes to Block Money?

2130
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,379
We're on a good flow.

2131
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,389
We'll win if we continue like this.

2132
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,419
It's right in front of us.

2133
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,358
I want to get 300,000 dollars.

2134
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:58,728
That means I want to win.

2135
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,459
Since we won today,

2136
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,099
let's make drinks of our style...

2137
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,430
and enjoy this.

2138
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,500
It's Jack Daniel's Honey.

2139
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:11,069
It's delicious to mix it in a ratio of 1 to 3.

2140
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,909
Jack and Coke.

2141
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,109
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2142
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:19,148
This is very sweet.

2143
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:21,550
- Gosh, Jack Daniel's. - Yes.

2144
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:22,978
Well done.

2145
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,020
We're friends!

2146
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,049
- Gosh. - It's really good.

2147
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,589
It's really good.

2148
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:32,429
Some of us have lost, and some of us have won.

2149
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,429
But we won as a block in the end.

2150
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:36,599
I think we had great teamwork today.

2151
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,799
Let's keep this up.

2152
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,000
Like today.

2153
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,840
- Like today. - Everyone, together.

2154
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:43,769
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

2155
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,639
Let's get it.

2156
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,869
Well done.

2157
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,680
Yes.

2158
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:53,579
You were really cool today.

2159
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:54,909
Well done.

2160
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,019
Seeing the flow today,

2161
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,719
- the other blocks were good too. - They are strong.

2162
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,419
You can't predict the result.

2163
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:06,459
All our predictions were wrong.

2164
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,129
- That's right. - The results as well.

2165
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,459
Can I make a suggestion?

2166
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,430
- Okay. - In the next mission,

2167
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,340
I think we'll be selecting three people again.

2168
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,068
I'll just decide the three.

2169
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:20,009
- I'll trust you. - I'll just decide.

2170
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,510
This is why I didn't say it in advance.

2171
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:24,379
I thought it was going to have an influence for sure.

2172
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,010
On our performance.

2173
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:29,818
Someone may have thought,

2174
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:31,078
"Is he trying to leave me out?"

2175
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,249
But that's not true.

2176
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,749
So I won't say it...

2177
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,359
in the next mission.

2178
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,089
- I'll just try to be smart. - Okay.

2179
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,728
Let's just focus on the mission.

2180
01:22:39,729 --> 01:22:42,000
- I'll trust you no matter what. - That's your authority.

2181
01:22:43,729 --> 01:22:45,898
Everyone trusted me.

2182
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:47,199
They buttered me up.

2183
01:22:47,899 --> 01:22:51,270
So I thought I shouldn't step down from the leader position.

2184
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,670
That's how my plan...

2185
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:55,439
will work out.

2186
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,079
Members of RAP:PUBLIC,

2187
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,148
I have an important announcement to make.

2188
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:07,119
- What? - What's important now?

2189
01:23:07,289 --> 01:23:08,489
Stop being important.

2190
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,689
What is it? What's there now?

2191
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,158
From now on,

2192
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,560
No way.

2193
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:18,630
all blocks can replace their leaders...

2194
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:20,799
and recruit rappers.

2195
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,800
Recruit rappers?

2196
01:23:21,801 --> 01:23:24,039
- What on earth? From now? - What?

2197
01:23:24,369 --> 01:23:27,709
In any case, we lost some members.

2198
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,339
Would it be right to continue as we are now?

2199
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,938
After the first Block Match,

2200
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,549
I realized how important teamwork was.

2201
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,549
Everyone will start making changes in their blocks.

2202
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:38,618
It would be quite interesting if people...

2203
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:39,850
get changed.

2204
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:42,059
But no one can come here.

2205
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,260
It's full.

2206
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,520
It's sold out.

2207
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:47,029
Our spirits are higher than the teams that won.

2208
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:48,959
Really.

2209
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,198
You're right.

2210
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:53,828
This happened because HAON told us.

2211
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,099
- Right. - We chose the strong people,

2212
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,169
and they came back.

2213
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,299
- That's right. - Really.

2214
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,309
- Nice. - It was a relief.

2215
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,908
Thanks to that decision,

2216
01:24:02,909 --> 01:24:06,049
the team spirit became really good.

2217
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:08,749
I think we'll really be together until the end.

2218
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,850
I love you, Block three.

2219
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:14,349
Goodness.

2220
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,189
(HAON seems to be having many thoughts.)

2221
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:18,189
The result would have been different if I had done better.

2222
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,060
I was thinking, "What kind of leader am I?"

2223
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,228
It will happen again.

2224
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:27,199
(Block 1 is revising the rules to recruiting rappers.)

2225
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:29,299
There are no conditions in recruiting.

2226
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,698
- They just come if they want to. - They just come if they want to.

2227
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:32,710
(Each block can recruit rappers from other blocks.)

2228
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,109
That means...

2229
01:24:34,409 --> 01:24:37,778
they could come and cause a mess and go back.

2230
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:39,249
Since there are no conditions.

2231
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,908
- The maximum number is eight, - The minimum number is gone.

2232
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,619
but the minimum number of 6 is gone.

2233
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:46,949
- The blocks will change a lot. - Leader replacement.

2234
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:50,089
We have five members in our block.

2235
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:53,729
I thought our priority was to recruit more members.

2236
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:57,599
If the majority of the members agree...

2237
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,368
Our block lost the most number of members...

2238
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:03,569
from the first deathmatch.

2239
01:25:03,939 --> 01:25:06,839
(Block 8 lost 3 members from the first deathmatch.)

2240
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,909
I wanted to recruit more people if possible.

2241
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:15,050
But we're still viewed as the weakest block.

2242
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,148
What? The lights turned off.

2243
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,220
The place has been darkened for us to sleep.

2244
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,689
The lights are turned off now.

2245
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:27,629
It feels like the evening.

2246
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,199
It's the night vibe now.

2247
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,959
The sun has set.

2248
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,029
The lights are off.

2249
01:25:32,329 --> 01:25:33,429
I'm suddenly sleepy.

2250
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,269
(Block 6)

2251
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:38,039
Geegooin. Let me tell you how I felt about today.

2252
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,470
Other than you,

2253
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,539
we're doomed.

2254
01:25:43,909 --> 01:25:44,939
We've reached the limit.

2255
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,809
I could clearly see it.

2256
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:49,478
The gap between each member's capability...

2257
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:50,578
was huge.

2258
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,350
With the current seven members,

2259
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,420
we'll get eliminated.

2260
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,589
Geegooin helped us win.

2261
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:58,528
We'll get destroyed in the next match.

2262
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,859
Our block needed...

2263
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,000
more fierce rappers.

2264
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,430
We need to recruit rappers.

2265
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,528
Our first choice is SINCE. Our second choice is Mckdaddy.

2266
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:08,868
- How will you recruit them? - I'll just give it a shot.

2267
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:10,398
Okay. With SINCE, it'll be the bomb.

2268
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:12,069
If SINCE refuses, we're fine with it.

2269
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:13,839
- We've got nothing to lose. - True.

2270
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,908
Recruiting Mckdaddy is easy.

2271
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:17,010
After all, he almost went home.

2272
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,309
I'll get moving.

2273
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:20,310
Okay.

2274
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,920
(Block 4)

2275
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,089
What is it?

2276
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:35,129
I want to have a serious talk with you.

2277
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:36,199
About what?

2278
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,629
(Lounge)

2279
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:42,840
Nobody's here.

2280
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,239
- Hurry. - What is it?

2281
01:26:48,109 --> 01:26:49,180
What's going on?

2282
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,948
I'll get straight to the point.

2283
01:26:51,949 --> 01:26:55,109
This is purely up to you, okay?

2284
01:26:55,949 --> 01:26:57,149
- My block has seven members. - Right.

2285
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:59,220
- We can recruit rappers. - Yes.

2286
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:01,689
Let's say I recruit you.

2287
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,989
We will strengthen our team...

2288
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:07,159
to reach the goal of winning all the missions...

2289
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:08,699
and not getting eliminated.

2290
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:11,499
But as the leader,

2291
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:14,130
I need to choose three elimination candidates.

2292
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:16,970
Geegooin, you, and me.

2293
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,439
The best is for us three to last until the very end.

2294
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:23,578
You're proposing...

2295
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:26,108
I will not get eliminated if I go to your block.

2296
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:28,250
No. Never.

2297
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,350
I kept thinking, "What should I do?"

2298
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,420
- Tomorrow morning, - Yes?

2299
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,789
hand me a note with either an "O" or an "X."

2300
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:40,188
Okay.

2301
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,158
I didn't want to put pressure on her.

2302
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,500
I told her to let me know through a memo...

2303
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,630
when we bump into each other.

2304
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,109
(Kaogaii heads to Block 5 to find Mckdaddy.)

2305
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:55,839
Kaogaii gave me a look like...

2306
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,939
he wanted to talk.

2307
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:00,779
Do you like your block?

2308
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:02,578
- No. - No?

2309
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:03,619
No.

2310
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,649
Honestly, my block disappointed me.

2311
01:28:06,819 --> 01:28:09,920
I was an elimination candidate.

2312
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:12,429
It felt like I wasn't needed...

2313
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,959
in Block Five.

2314
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,260
I felt miserable.

2315
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,729
But I still survived...

2316
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,270
and returned to Block Five, which didn't...

2317
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:22,100
really sit right with me.

2318
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,739
Okay. Here's the deal.

2319
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,710
Do you want to come?

2320
01:28:25,869 --> 01:28:27,340
- Isn't your block full? - We've got seven.

2321
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:29,840
- Why? - It was always seven.

2322
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:34,549
I'm simply giving you an offer.

2323
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:36,319
Tomorrow morning,

2324
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:39,049
hand me a note with either...

2325
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,350
an "O" or an "X."

2326
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:43,619
I had to settle it today.

2327
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:46,288
Tomorrow morning,

2328
01:28:46,289 --> 01:28:47,829
everyone will make a move.

2329
01:28:48,329 --> 01:28:49,500
I needed to move fast first.

2330
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:52,169
So, I talked to our second option, Mckdaddy.

2331
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:54,228
But I approached him...

2332
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:56,139
like he was our only choice...

2333
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,738
and first option. That was what I could do.

2334
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:02,078
And like SINCE, I asked him to give me a memo...

2335
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:03,680
with his answer on it.

2336
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:11,720
(After the intense Block Match, night has come to RAP:PUBLIC.)

2337
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:15,090
Either way, what's certain is...

2338
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:18,729
to recruit someone who can rap to trap.

2339
01:29:18,789 --> 01:29:21,028
I agree with him 100 percent.

2340
01:29:21,029 --> 01:29:23,260
It's different from the trap we used to rap to.

2341
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:24,459
- Totally different. - Right?

2342
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:26,800
Trap rappers these days are incredible.

2343
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:29,599
Even if we recruit one,

2344
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,969
they have to blend in with us.

2345
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:35,810
With that in mind, Owen is our best option.

2346
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,010
Because when Owen...

2347
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:40,648
sets his mind on something, he can rap to anything.

2348
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:42,778
Here's what I'm worried about.

2349
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:43,779
Can we control him?

2350
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,890
- We can't. - Right?

2351
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:48,119
That worries me.

2352
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:51,189
How about Reddy who writes a lot of verses?

2353
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:54,159
- Reddy might be a better choice. - I agree.

2354
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:57,658
Say something like, "Do your business here."

2355
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,069
What if we think bigger...

2356
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:02,500
and recruit a trap rapper like Roh Yun Ha?

2357
01:30:03,369 --> 01:30:04,738
From what I see,

2358
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:06,670
everything is fine,

2359
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:08,310
except that...

2360
01:30:08,609 --> 01:30:11,238
he's in Block Three.

2361
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,109
That block... You saw it earlier, right?

2362
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,310
- They have tight teamwork. - Right.

2363
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,749
That block is close-knit.

2364
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,219
They're really close.

2365
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:21,250
The only important position we can give him is the leader.

2366
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:24,119
Otherwise, we can't persuade him to come to our block.

2367
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,728
That's not a small enough merit for him...

2368
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:28,658
to turn it down.

2369
01:30:28,659 --> 01:30:29,828
He won't get eliminated.

2370
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:32,170
Replacing our leader? That...

2371
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,630
That was absurd.

2372
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,539
Either way, only when...

2373
01:30:37,869 --> 01:30:40,909
Block Five survives...

2374
01:30:41,409 --> 01:30:43,710
does it still have value.

2375
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:47,680
I don't mind a rapper joining our block.

2376
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,720
But I hope nobody leaves.

2377
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:51,619
I doubt anyone will leave.

2378
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,520
I can tell you this for sure.

2379
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,419
I won't leave our block...

2380
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,220
because someone wants me.

2381
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:02,398
- I need to use the restroom. - A rapper...

2382
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:05,130
- The restroom? Go ahead. - I wanted was...

2383
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,970
(Instead of going to the restroom, Mckdaddy meets up with Kaogaii!)

2384
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,439
(What did Mckdaddy decide to do?)

2385
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:23,050
(Morning has come to RAP:PUBLIC.)

2386
01:31:25,149 --> 01:31:28,050
(Block 6's Kohway starts the day with training.)

2387
01:31:28,289 --> 01:31:29,760
(Let's bring the spirit up.)

2388
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,629
The appointed place.

2389
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,789
(Everyone in Block 1 is up.)

2390
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:36,630
JTONG. What is that on your calves?

2391
01:31:39,529 --> 01:31:40,630
It's a yoga ring.

2392
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,439
- JTONG. May I borrow those? - Of course.

2393
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,369
(1 yoga mat, 1 foam roller)

2394
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:50,380
(Don Mills works out thanks to JTONG.)

2395
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:53,579
(Block 2 is also in training.)

2396
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:57,419
It might not be an actual track.

2397
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,719
Or we might work on a song.

2398
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,149
(Groaning)

2399
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,519
(Satisfied.)

2400
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,060
It's pumped up.

2401
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:09,399
I thought of something fun.

2402
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:10,630
Five each.

2403
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,500
Spread out both arms.

2404
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:14,969
Money lateral raise.

2405
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:16,000
(How RAP:PUBLIC works out)

2406
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:17,270
Let's go.

2407
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,409
This feels great.

2408
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,810
Your triceps?

2409
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,478
(Rappers' common morning routine)

2410
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:25,479
Thank you.

2411
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,249
How long did you get personal training?

2412
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,510
(While the two are working out)

2413
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,319
I'm setting it up now.

2414
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,689
- Should I set it up? - Barista.

2415
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,759
Each border should...

2416
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,859
(Reddy's small coffee shop has opened.)

2417
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,228
Mix it.

2418
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:44,259
(Drinking coffee thanks to Reddy)

2419
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,670
- Nice. - Good morning.

2420
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,299
(Amazed)

2421
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,368
- It's good. - It tastes different.

2422
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:50,470
Here.

2423
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,368
I'm sorry.

2424
01:32:52,369 --> 01:32:53,568
- It's a phone. - I never knew...

2425
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:54,770
there was a pen inside.

2426
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,039
You can draw with this pen.

2427
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:01,309
Let me draw a portrait of Don Mills.

2428
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,318
I'm in.

2429
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:04,618
- Slim me down in the drawing. - Slim you down?

2430
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:05,619
(Flustered)

2431
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:08,750
I used to draw with a mechanical pencil.

2432
01:33:08,789 --> 01:33:10,359
May I draw you?

2433
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,460
- JTONG. - Me?

2434
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:12,630
- Sure. - Draw each other.

2435
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,960
Go ahead.

2436
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:15,729
(Focused)

2437
01:33:16,229 --> 01:33:17,829
(Focused as well)

2438
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,228
- Don Mills. - I can't understand.

2439
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:20,599
- Oh, right. - Why don't I stand there?

2440
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,600
Here?

2441
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:25,539
(JTONG's passion toward arts has no borders.)

2442
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,010
I'm bad at drawing.

2443
01:33:27,539 --> 01:33:28,840
- I'm sorry. - Let me see.

2444
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,409
It's not you.

2445
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,850
Make my face slender and it's me.

2446
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:36,979
This is how I drew you.

2447
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:38,279
Thank you.

2448
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:39,920
Good job.

2449
01:33:44,489 --> 01:33:47,689
(Fleeky Bang checks the strategy board first thing in the morning.)

2450
01:33:48,859 --> 01:33:51,859
(Block 7's Tray B and Polodared's photos were moved to Block 1.)

2451
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,670
(Yesterday night in Block 1)

2452
01:33:58,069 --> 01:34:00,439
(Fleeky Bang couldn't sleep.)

2453
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,679
I couldn't sleep...

2454
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,739
in fear of losing my members.

2455
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:06,109
I felt restless.

2456
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,380
(Right then, 2 people visit Block 1.)

2457
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:16,460
(Shaking)

2458
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,319
Are you asleep? Come out.

2459
01:34:19,329 --> 01:34:20,430
Come out for a bit.

2460
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,930
Polodared and Tray B wanted to talk,

2461
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:26,970
and we had a long conversation.

2462
01:34:27,369 --> 01:34:29,939
I honestly don't want to get eliminated.

2463
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:31,869
Are you...

2464
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:33,970
fine with moving blocks?

2465
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,909
They wanted to be in Block One.

2466
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:39,949
The two were discontent about Block Seven.

2467
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:41,749
But I think...

2468
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:44,449
their bigger reason was wanting to team up with me.

2469
01:34:45,989 --> 01:34:47,419
The photos have been moved.

2470
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,619
- We're strong. - I have a good feeling.

2471
01:34:50,989 --> 01:34:53,630
If we recruit the duo who killed four rappers...

2472
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:55,359
I know.

2473
01:34:55,729 --> 01:34:57,858
We'll become stronger with good backups.

2474
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:58,898
Everyone wants Tray B...

2475
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:00,329
and Polodared to join, right?

2476
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:03,939
I wasn't going to recruit them if anyone disagreed.

2477
01:35:04,069 --> 01:35:07,109
But when I asked, everyone was happy about it.

2478
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:10,578
The winners of the other day are joining.

2479
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:12,749
And if they do, our block will be really strong.

2480
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,909
That's what crossed my mind.

2481
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:18,649
Will Owen or Chaboom of Block Seven let those two go...

2482
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:21,020
because they want to come?

2483
01:35:21,289 --> 01:35:23,589
- Because... - I don't think they can stop them.

2484
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:26,158
Only the opinions of the recruiting block's leader...

2485
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,228
and the rapper matter.

2486
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:29,460
That was the rule.

2487
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,500
I'm more than happy for them to join.

2488
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:34,000
The two here with us will be cute.

2489
01:35:38,369 --> 01:35:40,038
- What is it? - I'd like to talk to you.

2490
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:41,039
- Me? - Yes.

2491
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,069
Okay.

2492
01:35:43,539 --> 01:35:45,779
- It's quite a serious topic. - Really?

2493
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,420
- The bottom line is that... - Yes?

2494
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:54,750
- Polodared and I... - Yes.

2495
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,959
want to go to Block One.

2496
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,229
- Block One? - Because...

2497
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:02,029
I...

2498
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:06,328
(Day 1, Block 7 after entering the Village)

2499
01:36:06,329 --> 01:36:08,500
(Block 7 mainly communicated in English.)

2500
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:10,198
Everybody is grown.

2501
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:11,840
(Chaboom and Double Down spoke in English.)

2502
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,769
(Tray B and Polodared couldn't understand anything.)

2503
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,038
Yes, you can choose anything.

2504
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:18,310
Chaboom. Do you understand everything?

2505
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:20,709
- I attended a school in Canada. - For real?

2506
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:22,648
Everyone can speak English except you and me.

2507
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:24,379
Can't you translate for us?

2508
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,318
- I will. - We will.

2509
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:29,089
I couldn't understand a thing Double Down said earlier.

2510
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,189
Is that so?

2511
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:32,259
Whenever we spoke,

2512
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,328
the announcements were generally made in English.

2513
01:36:34,329 --> 01:36:37,158
Adjusting must've been tough for Tray B.

2514
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:39,329
It must've been the same for Polodared.

2515
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,500
(Block 7 during the Block Breaker practice)

2516
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:45,670
(The Block 7 members practiced alone without communicating.)

2517
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:48,470
(Reading the mood)

2518
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,119
- Tell us too. - Tell us.

2519
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:09,158
(Even after that, the two couldn't adjust in Block 7.)

2520
01:37:09,159 --> 01:37:11,560
I seriously don't want to do this.

2521
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,038
Because we didn't know each other before,

2522
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:17,099
I wanted to change blocks.

2523
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,270
I saw myself in a tough spot if I remained in Block Seven.

2524
01:37:21,409 --> 01:37:22,409
I...

2525
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,680
think the three of us rapping together will look good.

2526
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:30,818
Our block is full with eight members.

2527
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:33,448
- Recruiting Fleeky Bang is... - Besides that,

2528
01:37:33,449 --> 01:37:35,720
Fleeky Bang is close to JTONG.

2529
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:37,959
- Fleeky Bang and JTONG? - And they want us to come.

2530
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:40,060
- Yes. - I understand.

2531
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,600
Okay.

2532
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,669
Tray B didn't tell me everything.

2533
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,669
But our block...

2534
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:51,500
barely communicates in Korean.

2535
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:55,039
We don't work together as a team.

2536
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:57,509
Tray B must've thought it was risky.

2537
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:59,479
Although, that's only my speculation.

2538
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,978
Polodared and Tray B are going to leave.

2539
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:03,019
- Okay. - What?

2540
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:06,449
If that happens, we need a Plan B.

2541
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:09,689
Polodared and Tray B are leaving.

2542
01:38:09,789 --> 01:38:11,119
Our aces are leaving.

2543
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,059
They're going to their real friend.

2544
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:14,159
We shouldn't have become friends.

2545
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,269
(Tray B and Polodared...)

2546
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:22,739
(enter the Choice Block.)

2547
01:38:23,569 --> 01:38:25,270
I will recruit rappers.

2548
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,970
I will move to Block One.

2549
01:38:28,109 --> 01:38:29,939
I will move to Block One.

2550
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:35,779
(Block 7's Tray B and Polodared are recruited to Block 1.)

2551
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,920
- I'm in your care. - Same here, Sir Fleeky Bang.

2552
01:38:42,689 --> 01:38:43,720
Yes, bro.

2553
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,920
Yes, bro.

2554
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:49,129
(Block 7, Block 1)

2555
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:51,399
(Tray B and Polodared join Block 1.)

2556
01:38:53,899 --> 01:38:55,198
Something has changed.

2557
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:59,840
Polodared and Tray B were recruited to Block One.

2558
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:03,479
- Even you? - Rapper Polodared.

2559
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,738
- Pack your belongings... - How could you?

2560
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:07,749
- and move to Block One now. - For real?

2561
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,380
But why?

2562
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,449
Stop him.

2563
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,590
Such good news.

2564
01:39:18,789 --> 01:39:21,560
- To Block 1. - They were recruited to Block 1.

2565
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:23,329
Goodness.

2566
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,759
Oh, my gosh.

2567
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,198
Wait. Hold on.

2568
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:28,500
Block One has become almighty.

2569
01:39:28,699 --> 01:39:29,769
Block One is insane.

2570
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:31,568
- Block 1 has become powerful. - Block 1 is unbelievable.

2571
01:39:31,569 --> 01:39:33,140
Block 1 has gained power.

2572
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:35,340
- Right? Block One is strong now. - Really strong.

2573
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,938
I suddenly felt scared.

2574
01:39:36,939 --> 01:39:40,249
I know the great chemistry between the three.

2575
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:43,050
"An unbeatable block has been created." That went through my mind.

2576
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:46,249
Block One has the strongest male vibe now.

2577
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:47,720
It was what they were aiming for.

2578
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:48,919
We are happy.

2579
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,818
- Here we have our new members. - He's here.

2580
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:52,389
- Welcome. - Hi.

2581
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:55,788
- Welcome to Block One, Tray B. - Welcome.

2582
01:39:55,789 --> 01:39:58,228
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2583
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:59,470
Where do I leave these?

2584
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,039
On the left. We stuffed them there.

2585
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:04,699
Nice.

2586
01:40:05,369 --> 01:40:06,439
Polodared.

2587
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,108
- Great. - Congratulations, Polodared.

2588
01:40:09,109 --> 01:40:10,510
- Thank you. - Welcome.

2589
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:14,779
Fleeky Bang has yet to win on this show.

2590
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:18,279
I hope we can win together with me in the block now.

2591
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:22,249
Being able to rap with Fleeky Bang and Tray B filled me with joy.

2592
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,259
Please enjoy.

2593
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,788
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

2594
01:40:24,789 --> 01:40:26,789
- Please dig in. - It's good.

2595
01:40:27,029 --> 01:40:28,759
Are you happy? That's because you came here.

2596
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,930
You wouldn't be happy over there.

2597
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:32,229
You did an amazing job yesterday.

2598
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,069
But really.

2599
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,270
- What? - Come on.

2600
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:39,639
- It's true that you did... - Why...

2601
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:41,739
an incredible job in Block Seven.

2602
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:43,479
Blocking...

2603
01:40:43,939 --> 01:40:46,039
Blocking your ears won't change that fact.

2604
01:40:46,409 --> 01:40:47,578
(Laughing)

2605
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:48,649
What happened?

2606
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,550
- You did well. - Great job.

2607
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:52,949
Seriously.

2608
01:40:54,489 --> 01:40:55,520
Was it tough?

2609
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,090
What is it, Polodared?

2610
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:01,129
Did something happen yesterday?

2611
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:03,459
Gosh, this kid must've gone through a lot.

2612
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:05,829
Are you all right? What do I do?

2613
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,698
The two boys are very witty.

2614
01:41:09,699 --> 01:41:11,639
With them, we'll have a killer strategy.

2615
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,908
Fleeky Bang, Tray B, and Polodared's chemistry...

2616
01:41:13,909 --> 01:41:15,368
is great.

2617
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:18,238
Using their chemistry,

2618
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,609
we'll make Block One stronger.

2619
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:22,349
Yes.

2620
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:24,879
This is the strategic image of Block One.

2621
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,318
- Yes. - They have it set now.

2622
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:28,148
- Right. - They're complete.

2623
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:30,158
Block 1 and Block 3 are complete.

2624
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:33,858
JEFFERY WHITE and Raf Sandou are both in OKASHII.

2625
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:35,658
How about we recruit them together...

2626
01:41:35,659 --> 01:41:36,960
to be a crew in our block?

2627
01:41:38,729 --> 01:41:39,800
Are you a genius?

2628
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,939
- I'll get right to the point. - Okay.

2629
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:45,239
How about being a crew in our block?

2630
01:41:45,869 --> 01:41:47,539
- Are you recruiting me? - Yes.

2631
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:49,510
I see.

2632
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:52,538
We didn't want to be in the same block from the start.

2633
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:54,278
- "From the start?" - It's an individual play.

2634
01:41:54,279 --> 01:41:55,509
When we heard OKASHII...

2635
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:59,019
came on this show to rap individually,

2636
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,449
we couldn't recruit them.

2637
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:04,390
How about recruiting Loopy?

2638
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,760
I want to do that too.

2639
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:10,959
If it's possible, I'd like to give it a shot.

2640
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,060
Let's try.

2641
01:42:12,329 --> 01:42:13,368
(Loopy is their 2nd target.)

2642
01:42:13,369 --> 01:42:14,799
We were just talking about you.

2643
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,930
- Is that so? - Yes.

2644
01:42:16,369 --> 01:42:17,469
How's everything?

2645
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:19,198
Do you have five people left?

2646
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,170
- Yes. - We'll be complete if you come.

2647
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,879
I can't move blocks.

2648
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,310
I have no intention of moving.

2649
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:29,619
It would've been a big shocker if he had accepted the offer.

2650
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:34,318
Whoever we recruit,

2651
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:36,519
it won't do us any bad.

2652
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,159
- That's true. - Let's go recruit people.

2653
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:39,788
How are things?

2654
01:42:39,789 --> 01:42:42,460
I'm looking for people interested in moving blocks.

2655
01:42:45,329 --> 01:42:47,770
- I'm not sure. - You're not?

2656
01:42:49,569 --> 01:42:51,170
- What is it? - Come to my block.

2657
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:54,309
- I will. - How much will I have to pay you?

2658
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:55,810
Me? Maybe 200,000 dollars.

2659
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,909
But the prize is 300,000 dollars.

2660
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:00,479
Do you want to come?

2661
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:03,380
- No, I don't. - I see.

2662
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,249
I went around trying to recruit...

2663
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,719
- rappers. - Are you recruiting?

2664
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:08,720
- Us? - Yes.

2665
01:43:08,721 --> 01:43:11,619
We hoped for at least one rapper.

2666
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:13,028
How about Kohway?

2667
01:43:13,029 --> 01:43:14,559
- I'm okay with him. - From what I see,

2668
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,858
- Kohway is our best option. - I'd like that.

2669
01:43:15,859 --> 01:43:18,229
- Drain K will be happy too. - He's solid.

2670
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:20,169
Relatively speaking,

2671
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,829
we'll be able to beat many blocks if you come to our block.

2672
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:24,399
Can I be honest with you?

2673
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:28,009
From my point of view... Let's say I move...

2674
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:29,409
- to your block. - Okay.

2675
01:43:30,409 --> 01:43:32,680
- I need some sort of guarantee. - You'll be the leader.

2676
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:34,909
For real?

2677
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:36,779
Are you that desperate?

2678
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:39,478
- We can discuss it. - Of course, we can.

2679
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:40,750
Don't give me puppy eyes.

2680
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:43,390
- These are happy eyes. - Got it.

2681
01:43:43,659 --> 01:43:44,788
Come to our block if you're interested.

2682
01:43:44,789 --> 01:43:45,919
Okay. I'll be back.

2683
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,989
Okay.

2684
01:43:47,689 --> 01:43:50,259
(However,)

2685
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:54,528
(Block 8 failed to recruit even a single rapper.)

2686
01:43:54,529 --> 01:43:57,368
Darn. We, as a team of five, won't be that bad.

2687
01:43:57,369 --> 01:43:59,840
Are you confident in the deathmatch?

2688
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,739
- Yes. - Right?

2689
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,539
All of us in Block Eight are confident.

2690
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:05,879
We just need to win.

2691
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,909
- Our mindset is different. - Right?

2692
01:44:08,109 --> 01:44:09,449
How about we work as a block of five?

2693
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:13,788
It didn't make me angry or anything.

2694
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:14,890
(The recruitment failure)

2695
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,319
Honestly, I personally thought...

2696
01:44:17,859 --> 01:44:20,390
we didn't need to recruit rappers.

2697
01:44:20,529 --> 01:44:22,429
(Block 6)

2698
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:26,869
Rappers Polodared and Tray B were recruited to Block One.

2699
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,470
From that point on, I got scared.

2700
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,209
I was told SINCE...

2701
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:38,038
became very cozy in her block.

2702
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:40,379
I didn't expect her to move,

2703
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:41,749
but I still had a bit of hope.

2704
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,349
I didn't want to put pressure on her...

2705
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:46,250
by talking to her first or asking for her memo.

2706
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,130
Why isn't she giving it to me? She promised to write me one.

2707
01:44:53,729 --> 01:44:56,189
- SINCE is very warmhearted. - True.

2708
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,560
Really, she's too kind.

2709
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:07,368
(Moments later, Kaogaii runs into SINCE.)

2710
01:45:07,369 --> 01:45:10,180
(SINCE quickly gives Kaogaii her memo.)

2711
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:15,209
- SINCE gave me a memo. - What?

2712
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:17,049
- I got a memo from SINCE. - Did you read it?

2713
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:18,119
I haven't opened it yet.

2714
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,890
Please. Come to our block, SINCE.

2715
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:30,960
I see some writing. Is it "I'm sorry?"

2716
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,840
(A few hours ago)

2717
01:45:36,939 --> 01:45:39,840
(SINCE stood before the strategy board for a while.)

2718
01:45:44,739 --> 01:45:47,209
I was grateful for Kaogaii's offer.

2719
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,648
But it didn't really excite me.

2720
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:49,919
Why? Because my block won together.

2721
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,020
I had no intention of moving.

2722
01:45:51,649 --> 01:45:52,749
It's an "X."

2723
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:56,460
(He checks SINCE's rejection.)

2724
01:45:56,489 --> 01:45:58,159
I knew SINCE wasn't going to come.

2725
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:00,629
Personality-wise, SINCE is loyal.

2726
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:01,729
And she must've befriended them.

2727
01:46:01,829 --> 01:46:03,060
So I knew SINCE wasn't going to come.

2728
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,199
If nobody comes, we can battle with seven rappers.

2729
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:07,729
We're doomed.

2730
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:10,199
With this member, we won't get anywhere.

2731
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,939
I kept thinking we needed to...

2732
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,340
recruit Mckdaddy.

2733
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,539
(Block 5)

2734
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:22,649
(Mckdaddy quietly checks the rule book alone.)

2735
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:32,788
How about we use our brains...

2736
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:34,529
- Should we go around? - Let's think as we walk around.

2737
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:40,898
JP, Khundi Panda, and I...

2738
01:46:40,899 --> 01:46:43,140
kept going around.

2739
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:45,799
To recruit other rappers,

2740
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,010
we did some legwork.

2741
01:46:47,369 --> 01:46:48,939
- Yes? - Is this a serious topic?

2742
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:51,679
- No. We're just hanging out. - Are you hanging out?

2743
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:53,379
- Yes. - We're here to recruit.

2744
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,479
Who wants to come?

2745
01:46:56,819 --> 01:46:57,949
How about it, skyminhyuk?

2746
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:00,649
Fine. I hate you too.

2747
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,759
Why are you only beating me up?

2748
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,789
(Kaogaii came out to the Village.)

2749
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:05,960
Did you think about it?

2750
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:09,899
I...

2751
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,158
- am going. - You're coming?

2752
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,198
Yes.

2753
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:15,270
Stop being so serious. Come over here.

2754
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,170
What's this?

2755
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:21,908
Do you feel like the boss now that you've got an offer?

2756
01:47:21,909 --> 01:47:23,210
No. That's not what I meant.

2757
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,238
Honestly, I want to move.

2758
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:26,649
You have Geegooin.

2759
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:28,609
Are you feeling bad?

2760
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,149
That's the biggest reason.

2761
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:31,649
I know I'm being a fool.

2762
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:32,948
I wanted to move right away.

2763
01:47:32,949 --> 01:47:35,119
But I hesitated because of one reason.

2764
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:38,090
I felt bad. Was moving to another block...

2765
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:40,229
the right thing to do?

2766
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:42,389
(Block 5)

2767
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,929
So? Do you want to come to our block?

2768
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,630
- Come to our block. - But I'm the leader.

2769
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,569
You're right. Is there a transfer?

2770
01:47:48,069 --> 01:47:50,238
- Us? Transfer? - Yes.

2771
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,270
No. And no, even if there is one.

2772
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:54,169
People are free to move.

2773
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,909
With consultation... No, negotiation.

2774
01:47:56,539 --> 01:47:57,710
Are you going...

2775
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,380
I'm asking to know if there are any transfers.

2776
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:01,948
- No. - No?

2777
01:48:01,949 --> 01:48:04,550
No. We are... I don't know.

2778
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:08,020
Someone might take our rappers. But I...

2779
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:09,688
There is one.

2780
01:48:09,689 --> 01:48:10,858
- A transfer in our block? - Yes.

2781
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:11,920
There's none.

2782
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:14,159
- No one. We're all set. - Who are you bringing?

2783
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:16,029
No one. Our block is set.

2784
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,929
Mckdaddy is feeling bad...

2785
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,369
because he's a nice guy.

2786
01:48:20,930 --> 01:48:23,569
That's why it's easy for me to throw him away later.

2787
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:27,009
- Hey. - What?

2788
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:28,439
At the very least,

2789
01:48:28,939 --> 01:48:31,039
I want to go to the Choice Block when Khundi Panda isn't there.

2790
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:32,309
- Is he over there? - Yes.

2791
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,409
Just give it to me.

2792
01:48:33,579 --> 01:48:35,179
Because Boi B...

2793
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,818
- What do we do? - Let's sit down...

2794
01:48:36,819 --> 01:48:37,819
and go when he leaves.

2795
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:39,319
- Okay. - I just want to talk.

2796
01:48:39,579 --> 01:48:41,988
(Escaping from Block 5,)

2797
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:45,520
(Mckdaddy returns to the lounge.)

2798
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:53,699
Mckdaddy.

2799
01:48:55,569 --> 01:48:56,670
He's still there.

2800
01:48:57,869 --> 01:48:59,600
Do you want to act natural and go in?

2801
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:03,009
This is driving me nuts.

2802
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:04,408
Or let's do this.

2803
01:49:04,409 --> 01:49:05,839
I'll ask my block member...

2804
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,109
to buy us time by striking up a conversation.

2805
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:10,319
If you feel bad.

2806
01:49:10,949 --> 01:49:12,020
Wait here.

2807
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:23,060
He's gone. He left. Hurry.

2808
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,899
Whatever.

2809
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:28,470
You go in first.

2810
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:34,408
(After Block 5 has left the square,)

2811
01:49:34,409 --> 01:49:37,840
(Mckdaddy heads to the Choice Block.)

2812
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:49,089
- So this is how you're playing. - What?

2813
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:51,419
- This is how you're playing. - What are you talking about?

2814
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,688
- Why would he go in there? - What?

2815
01:49:52,689 --> 01:49:54,059
- Why would he go in there? - Where?

2816
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:56,129
You're walking to that room too.

2817
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:57,599
But seriously...

2818
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,630
I don't like you.

2819
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,430
- I hope you two are happy. - Okay.

2820
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,539
I will recruit a rapper.

2821
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:10,180
I will move to Block Six.

2822
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:13,778
It felt like I was needed more.

2823
01:50:13,779 --> 01:50:17,578
Of course, there are other block members.

2824
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:20,920
But Kaogaii said he needed someone more trustworthy.

2825
01:50:20,949 --> 01:50:23,960
That really touched my heart.

2826
01:50:24,819 --> 01:50:25,989
How do you feel, my right-hand man?

2827
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:31,799
- Mckdaddy went in. - Hey.

2828
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:34,068
- Mckdaddy went in? What? - Mckdaddy just went in.

2829
01:50:34,069 --> 01:50:35,629
- With who? - Alone.

2830
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:36,939
"Alone?" I see.

2831
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:43,170
(Drain K didn't see Kaogaii go into the Choice Block.)

2832
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,479
Mckdaddy went in alone.

2833
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,310
- What? In there? - What?

2834
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,079
This is...

2835
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,020
Is there something to do in there alone?

2836
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:56,149
- No. - No, right?

2837
01:51:01,859 --> 01:51:03,260
Did he really go in there?

2838
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,969
- It's okay. - I feel terrible.

2839
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:10,699
Did Block Five recruit no new rappers?

2840
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:12,538
- No. - Are there four left now?

2841
01:51:12,539 --> 01:51:13,569
Yes.

2842
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:18,810
Either way, you're not here to play a game of loyalty.

2843
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:20,710
Khundi Panda is right in front of the door.

2844
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,680
I think our eyes met.

2845
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,949
Come here for a second, Khundi Panda.

2846
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,949
I heard Mckdaddy went into that room.

2847
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:31,920
Is that true?

2848
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:33,489
Who knows?

2849
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:37,559
(After Block 5 goes back to their block,)

2850
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,930
(Mckdaddy leaves the Choice Block.)

2851
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:43,600
- Did you move? - I don't know.

2852
01:51:46,939 --> 01:51:48,369
Mckdaddy. You did.

2853
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:53,709
(Rapper Mckdaddy was recruited to Block 6.)

2854
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,250
Rapper Mckdaddy...

2855
01:51:55,979 --> 01:51:57,920
was recruited to Block 6.

2856
01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:01,319
Hey, bring me a lyrics book. Bring it.

2857
01:52:01,789 --> 01:52:04,689
Rapper Mckdaddy. Pack your belongings...

2858
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:07,590
and move to Block Six now.

2859
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:09,390
Good work.

2860
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,630
Great job.

2861
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:13,300
But I knew you would move.

2862
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:14,599
I wanted to leave too.

2863
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,100
But Block Six is a surprise.

2864
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:18,270
- It's to have fun. - You should've picked a better one.

2865
01:52:18,670 --> 01:52:25,579
(You were born to be loved)

2866
01:52:27,579 --> 01:52:31,049
(The other blocks hear of Mckdaddy's recruitment.)

2867
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:32,050
He really moved.

2868
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:34,920
But Mckdaddy suits Block Six more.

2869
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,489
- Gosh. - Where's Block Six?

2870
01:52:38,359 --> 01:52:39,459
Kaogaii.

2871
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:41,430
- Oh, goodness. - Darn.

2872
01:52:41,689 --> 01:52:43,529
- Block 5 is... - Now, Block 5 is...

2873
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,460
Block Five is in trouble now.

2874
01:52:50,869 --> 01:52:53,569
Mckdaddy. You made the right choice.

2875
01:52:53,909 --> 01:52:55,140
- You did. - Go.

2876
01:52:56,109 --> 01:52:58,640
I felt bad for the members of Block Five.

2877
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,210
Especially,

2878
01:53:00,579 --> 01:53:05,119
Khundi Panda. I was too ashamed to look at his face.

2879
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:07,919
If there's no problem, rappers don't leave.

2880
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,149
His leaving...

2881
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:12,318
means he doesn't feel safe...

2882
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:14,090
remaining in our block.

2883
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,398
(Block 6 welcomes the newly recruited Mckdaddy.)

2884
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:20,000
- Welcome. - Great job, Mckdaddy.

2885
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:21,569
Let's take it easy.

2886
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:24,099
- I feel terrible. - Khundi Panda looks upset.

2887
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:26,340
- I know, right? - Didn't you recruit me?

2888
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,770
How can you say, "Khundi Panda looks upset?"

2889
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:30,939
How am I supposed to feel about that?

2890
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:34,050
I'm telling you to become stronger.

2891
01:53:34,279 --> 01:53:35,379
Here's our motto.

2892
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:36,849
We create extreme energy in extreme situations.

2893
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:38,350
That's our motto.

2894
01:53:39,649 --> 01:53:40,720
Extreme energy, extreme situations.

2895
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,289
Mckdaddy.

2896
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:45,589
Did you move without telling them?

2897
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:46,590
Yes.

2898
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,699
(The rappers gather at Block 6 after hearing the recruitment news.)

2899
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:58,199
Everyone visits to take a look.

2900
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,210
What happened? The word has spread.

2901
01:54:02,069 --> 01:54:03,210
What word?

2902
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,310
- That I'm a piece of trash? - No.

2903
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:07,680
I was curious and wanted to say "Hi."

2904
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:12,278
Don Mills is literally nothing without loyalty.

2905
01:54:12,279 --> 01:54:15,590
Without loyalty, I might as well be dead.

2906
01:54:15,689 --> 01:54:16,720
Then what am I?

2907
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,328
With Mckdaddy in our block,

2908
01:54:20,329 --> 01:54:21,659
we now have eight members.

2909
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:23,489
I feel reassured.

2910
01:54:23,659 --> 01:54:26,559
We have a trustworthy rapper for the job.

2911
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,970
We might produce something. Something good.

2912
01:54:29,130 --> 01:54:30,669
(Block 5, Block 6)

2913
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:34,010
(Mckdaddy joins Block 6.)

2914
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:35,439
I hate this.

2915
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:39,779
- Honestly, it's really upsetting. - It is.

2916
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:42,509
- It's unpleasant. - I'm frustrated.

2917
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:43,550
I know.

2918
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:46,949
The item is about Leader Replacement.

2919
01:54:47,449 --> 01:54:49,420
Everyone. Feel free to say anything.

2920
01:54:56,729 --> 01:54:58,059
- Yes? - Yes. What?

2921
01:54:58,060 --> 01:54:59,460
Why so suddenly?

2922
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,869
You keep thinking about it.

2923
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:08,909
Do you want to change the leader?

2924
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:11,908
I'm the eldest anyway.

2925
01:55:11,909 --> 01:55:14,578
So I should give it up...

2926
01:55:14,579 --> 01:55:16,709
to participate in the deathmatch.

2927
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:18,948
Even if I lose, I want to fight in the deathmatch...

2928
01:55:18,949 --> 01:55:21,349
with what I have.

2929
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:23,419
It'd make me feel more comfortable than to make someone...

2930
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:25,089
who isn't confident participate in the deathmatch...

2931
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:27,858
and tell them to come back no matter what it takes.

2932
01:55:27,859 --> 01:55:30,760
Even if I'm eliminated there, I'm good.

2933
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:33,898
That's what I thought.

2934
01:55:33,899 --> 01:55:36,799
So it's more like I want to give up the benefit.

2935
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,840
But let's say...

2936
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:39,568
we chose you as the elimination candidate.

2937
01:55:39,569 --> 01:55:41,609
What if they make you leave without a deathmatch?

2938
01:55:42,369 --> 01:55:44,239
Then that'll be my destiny.

2939
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:47,478
- They might not have a deathmatch. - He's right.

2940
01:55:47,479 --> 01:55:48,609
I'm determined to accept it.

2941
01:55:48,979 --> 01:55:50,149
- Right. - Yes.

2942
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:54,288
It's to bring a better result for my team.

2943
01:55:54,289 --> 01:55:57,288
It's not to have a worse result.

2944
01:55:57,289 --> 01:55:59,659
I did my best to explain it.

2945
01:55:59,859 --> 01:56:01,459
Okay. You've heard...

2946
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:03,589
what I was thinking in my head so far.

2947
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:06,699
So please appeal to us if you want to be the leader.

2948
01:56:07,069 --> 01:56:09,430
- I want to be the leader. - Yes.

2949
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,969
There's something I want to show.

2950
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:14,770
- Right. - I think I haven't shown anything.

2951
01:56:15,539 --> 01:56:17,408
If I become the leader, I'll do a good job.

2952
01:56:17,409 --> 01:56:19,380
- That's what I thought. - Yes.

2953
01:56:20,039 --> 01:56:23,478
I wanted to make this team win.

2954
01:56:23,479 --> 01:56:26,879
I thought I could help my team a lot...

2955
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,619
if I became the leader.

2956
01:56:29,489 --> 01:56:33,318
I could see losing in the Block Breaker...

2957
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:36,789
hurt KHAN's pride a lot.

2958
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:39,858
I thought it was a big motivation for him.

2959
01:56:39,859 --> 01:56:43,600
Becoming the leader would motivate him even more.

2960
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,439
Let's go with KHAN.

2961
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:46,969
- KHAN? - Let's choose KHAN.

2962
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:48,139
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2963
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:50,809
If you choose me as the leader, I'll work really hard.

2964
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,810
Okay.

2965
01:56:52,279 --> 01:56:53,609
You should do well, KHAN.

2966
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:55,050
We should do well.

2967
01:56:56,449 --> 01:56:59,479
(Block 2 is going to the Choice Block to change the leader.)

2968
01:57:00,689 --> 01:57:02,189
We'd like to change our leader.

2969
01:57:02,689 --> 01:57:04,919
We can change the leader.

2970
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:07,529
What's important is five people should agree.

2971
01:57:07,689 --> 01:57:10,600
Our new leader is KHAN.

2972
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,930
(Loopy changes his nameplate to "Leader Replacement.")

2973
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:18,100
(Everyone in Block 2 changes their nameplate to "Leader Replacement.")

2974
01:57:23,539 --> 01:57:25,578
(KHAN)

2975
01:57:25,579 --> 01:57:29,350
(KHAN, Leader Replacement)

2976
01:57:32,149 --> 01:57:37,560
The leader of Block Two has changed from Loopy to KHAN.

2977
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:38,988
What did he say?

2978
01:57:38,989 --> 01:57:40,859
- Block Two's new leader is KHAN. - I see.

2979
01:57:41,789 --> 01:57:43,289
It has changed to KHAN?

2980
01:57:44,529 --> 01:57:45,999
- Let's go. - Yes!

2981
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,329
Thank you in advance.

2982
01:57:48,569 --> 01:57:50,169
Let me put it on you.

2983
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:52,669
- You have two chains now. - Two chains.

2984
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:53,909
- Two chains. - Two chains.

2985
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:56,408
- Yes. - Yes.

2986
01:57:56,409 --> 01:57:57,680
Let's go.

2987
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:00,509
- I'll do my best. - Yes.

2988
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:02,310
- All right. - You sit down here.

2989
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,720
- Two chains. - Okay.

2990
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:08,889
"Let's have fun and win the next mission."

2991
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:10,890
That's my mindset right now.

2992
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:13,289
He has young energy.

2993
01:58:13,829 --> 01:58:16,229
And he's motivated.

2994
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:19,028
I'm not the leader anymore. And I think I can help them...

2995
01:58:19,029 --> 01:58:21,568
with many things more comfortably.

2996
01:58:21,569 --> 01:58:25,698
Even if KHAN leads us, Loopy will keep playing his role.

2997
01:58:25,699 --> 01:58:28,669
We are considerate and try to take care and help one another.

2998
01:58:28,670 --> 01:58:32,680
I think we, Block Two, will continue to be friendly.

2999
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:35,550
I've been thinking about this since yesterday.

3000
01:58:36,010 --> 01:58:37,818
Based on what he did...

3001
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:39,578
and achieved so far,

3002
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:41,750
I want Reddy to become the leader.

3003
01:58:42,189 --> 01:58:44,889
Reddy showed the most leader-like qualities.

3004
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:46,358
(Leader HAON has been tormented...)

3005
01:58:46,359 --> 01:58:50,359
(since they lost in the Block Breaker.)

3006
01:58:51,229 --> 01:58:54,130
If I had done just a little bit better,

3007
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,500
we would've all smiled together.

3008
01:58:58,439 --> 01:59:01,770
I haven't despaired like this for a long time.

3009
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:05,710
In the midst of it, Reddy kept giving me hope.

3010
01:59:06,579 --> 01:59:08,949
HAON, forget about it. You don't have to feel that way.

3011
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:11,319
- Forget about it. It's over. - How can I forget?

3012
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:14,288
- It's really okay. - You were really cool.

3013
01:59:14,289 --> 01:59:15,349
We did our best.

3014
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:17,559
And we were the best anyway.

3015
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,020
- Yes. - We were really cool.

3016
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:22,028
- Don't do this. - Come back.

3017
01:59:22,029 --> 01:59:24,198
No, HAON. I will come back.

3018
01:59:24,199 --> 01:59:25,829
We'll be back.

3019
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,469
You should just discuss...

3020
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:29,899
more detailed plans for the next time.

3021
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:33,569
Even in that situation, he made sure to encourage everyone.

3022
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,670
I was very thankful to him.

3023
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:39,009
- You're the best. - You were the greatest of all time.

3024
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:40,550
You're the true leader.

3025
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:43,608
No. I don't want to be the leader.

3026
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:44,979
Let's switch tomorrow.

3027
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:47,749
You should be the leader.

3028
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:51,460
Reddy showed all the qualities of leadership.

3029
01:59:51,590 --> 01:59:53,560
Reddy should become the leader.

3030
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:57,188
I'm so thankful,

3031
01:59:57,189 --> 01:59:59,760
but at the same time...

3032
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:03,368
Honestly,

3033
02:00:03,369 --> 02:00:06,469
I can never do...

3034
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:07,938
what HAON did in the Infinite Cypher.

3035
02:00:07,939 --> 02:00:09,269
But you had five kills yesterday.

3036
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:11,609
- That's what I'm saying. - That's also true.

3037
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,879
Okay. I got it.

3038
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:15,778
I'll take the position with gratitude.

3039
02:00:15,779 --> 02:00:18,079
- Yes. - Okay.

3040
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:20,219
We all agree then.

3041
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:22,589
- We all agree. - It's so nice.

3042
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:25,060
Actually, I contemplated a lot.

3043
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:28,889
But I thought it must've been very hard...

3044
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,028
for HAON.

3045
02:00:30,029 --> 02:00:33,060
I could see he was having complicated feelings...

3046
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:35,999
from his eyes.

3047
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,500
So I said I would become the leader.

3048
02:00:40,039 --> 02:00:42,069
Block Three will change the leader.

3049
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:45,009
The new leader of Block Three is Reddy.

3050
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:46,478
- Reddy. - Reddy.

3051
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:47,549
Reddy.

3052
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:49,810
Reddy will be our new leader.

3053
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,250
I trust the eldest member.

3054
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:55,688
(Block 3 flips the nameplates to change their leader.)

3055
02:00:55,689 --> 02:00:59,659
(Lastly, Reddy put his nameplate to the leader's position.)

3056
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:03,029
The new leader is Reddy.

3057
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:04,899
Reddy, let's go.

3058
02:01:07,369 --> 02:01:11,539
(The leader of Block 3 has changed with a unanimous decision.)

3059
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:15,069
What?

3060
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:16,770
The leader of Block Three...

3061
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:21,379
has changed from HAON to Reddy.

3062
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:23,710
- Oh, my. - Yes.

3063
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:27,350
- My gosh. - It's changed to Reddy.

3064
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,919
- There's a drastic change. - This is interesting.

3065
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:34,289
Reddy has a lot of experience.

3066
02:01:34,489 --> 02:01:36,759
When I think about the person who can control the overall situation,

3067
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,129
- I can only think of Reddy. - Yes. He's experienced.

3068
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:41,429
Block Three might be the strongest.

3069
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:42,728
They became stronger.

3070
02:01:42,729 --> 02:01:44,568
They all survived the deathmatch.

3071
02:01:44,569 --> 02:01:46,300
Reddy became the leader after a failure.

3072
02:01:46,569 --> 02:01:48,509
The atmosphere in that team is at its best right now.

3073
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:50,879
I think it'll unleash HAON.

3074
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,278
HAON will become their special weapon.

3075
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:54,609
Because he's such an amazing rapper.

3076
02:01:54,949 --> 02:01:56,879
Our new leader is Reddy.

3077
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,149
- Give him a round of applause. - Thank you.

3078
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,618
Let's work together.

3079
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:01,749
- Yes. - Thank you in advance.

3080
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:03,089
- Yes. - Yes.

3081
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,789
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

3082
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,429
Gosh, this is good. Thank you.

3083
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:10,188
The necklace is very heavy.

3084
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:12,858
It also feels heavy in my heart and on my shoulders.

3085
02:02:12,859 --> 02:02:15,130
- Who feels heavy? - You worked hard.

3086
02:02:18,369 --> 02:02:19,569
Darn it.

3087
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:23,608
The leader of Block Four has changed from Boi B...

3088
02:02:23,609 --> 02:02:25,938
to PUNCHNELLO.

3089
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:28,009
- What? - Is Boi B going somewhere?

3090
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:29,979
I think he'll join Geegooin.

3091
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:31,679
- Geegooin? - I had no idea.

3092
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:33,220
- I had no idea. - Oh, you were sitting here.

3093
02:02:33,449 --> 02:02:35,889
- Yes. - Put it under your shirt.

3094
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,318
(The leader of Block 4 has changed from Boi B to PUNCHNELLO.)

3095
02:02:37,319 --> 02:02:39,658
- Let's go. - Congratulations.

3096
02:02:39,659 --> 02:02:42,858
The leader has a privilege.

3097
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:44,129
They survive no matter what.

3098
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:47,129
We need to utilize it strategically.

3099
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:49,999
If the leader plays a role like that, I think PUNCHNELLO...

3100
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,569
- is a good choice. - Yes.

3101
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:55,269
When PUNCHNELLO comes out as the leader,

3102
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:57,709
- it'll awaken them. - Yes.

3103
02:02:57,710 --> 02:02:58,710
Right.

3104
02:02:58,711 --> 02:02:59,809
And what he did...

3105
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:01,009
- in the Block Breaker too. - Right.

3106
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:03,148
If we give the leader position to PUNCHNELLO...

3107
02:03:03,149 --> 02:03:05,680
who is already confident, he'll show his full potential.

3108
02:03:05,779 --> 02:03:09,089
It feels like all of us are the leaders.

3109
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:10,420
So I don't think there'll be a change.

3110
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,159
There's more announcement.

3111
02:03:14,529 --> 02:03:18,329
The leader of Block Eight has changed from gamma...

3112
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:22,129
- to Hippie Kunda. - They chose Hippie Kunda.

3113
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:23,429
- We have a female leader. - Yes.

3114
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:26,399
It's to save Drain K.

3115
02:03:27,399 --> 02:03:29,269
(The leader of Block 8 has changed from gamma to Hippie Kunda.)

3116
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:30,340
Thank you.

3117
02:03:30,539 --> 02:03:33,439
- I'll be looking forward to it. - Thank you in advance.

3118
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:35,379
I feel lighter after giving the necklace to you.

3119
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,478
First of all, we...

3120
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:38,420
I think you're actually lighter. Why is this so heavy?

3121
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:41,189
We became stronger...

3122
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:43,489
- for the next mission. - It suits you.

3123
02:03:43,890 --> 02:03:44,890
If you think that way...

3124
02:03:44,891 --> 02:03:50,090
Hippe Kunda started Block Eight.

3125
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:53,629
I think she'll do a good job.

3126
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:57,970
I don't think we'll change our leader anymore.

3127
02:03:58,270 --> 02:04:00,568
If it's necessary to change it again,

3128
02:04:00,569 --> 02:04:02,809
I think I'll take the position.

3129
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:05,278
When I heard we could change our leader at first,

3130
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:07,549
I thought it was like a disposable position...

3131
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:09,978
that could be changed for every mission.

3132
02:04:09,979 --> 02:04:11,750
If I become the leader,

3133
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,188
I'll be the only one exempted from elimination.

3134
02:04:14,189 --> 02:04:16,089
So it's meaningless if he's eliminated.

3135
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:18,559
If we can decide on who will be eliminated,

3136
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,560
it changes the story.

3137
02:04:20,689 --> 02:04:22,759
If we change the leader to Hippie Kunda,

3138
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:27,259
the two of us are most likely to survive.

3139
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:30,328
That's what became obvious through the first deathmatch.

3140
02:04:30,329 --> 02:04:32,099
That was part of the reason.

3141
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:34,669
Anyway, it went as I planned.

3142
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:36,069
It eased my mind.

3143
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:44,380
"Gosh, this isn't how it should go."

3144
02:04:44,579 --> 02:04:46,880
Then there'll be four people left in our block.

3145
02:04:47,619 --> 02:04:49,550
Can four people do anything?

3146
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:52,520
- This is the current situation. - I received a recruitment offer.

3147
02:04:52,989 --> 02:04:54,429
- Really? - No.

3148
02:04:54,430 --> 02:04:55,828
- Did you get an offer? - Yes.

3149
02:04:55,829 --> 02:04:57,390
If you go there, there'll be 3 people left in Block 5.

3150
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,329
Which block gave you an offer?

3151
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:02,529
(Block 4)

3152
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:03,800
Block Four.

3153
02:05:05,939 --> 02:05:08,209
I think things happen here...

3154
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:09,770
so quickly.

3155
02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:11,979
They recruit someone in the blink of an eye.

3156
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,810
And they plot something behind you.

3157
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:17,719
The moment Mckdaddy went to Block Six,

3158
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:18,720
everyone had a mental breakdown.

3159
02:05:18,721 --> 02:05:19,750
- The people? - Yes.

3160
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:22,249
If you accept me, Block Four would be the best for me.

3161
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:23,289
- Really? - Yes.

3162
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,859
- Block Four would be the best. - What time is it? We should hurry.

3163
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,020
Okay. Let me talk to them first.

3164
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:29,289
- Did you talk with Block Four? - Yes, I did.

3165
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:31,099
If you're going to move, you should do it now.

3166
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,529
What do you guys think?

3167
02:05:32,729 --> 02:05:34,568
We're planning.

3168
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:36,069
- To decide where you go? - Yes.

3169
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:37,839
"Let's go separate ways."

3170
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:39,199
"It's to better to go separate ways now."

3171
02:05:39,239 --> 02:05:42,568
I thought there was nothing that could be done with four people.

3172
02:05:42,569 --> 02:05:44,170
So I thought it was better for me to join Block Four.

3173
02:05:44,739 --> 02:05:46,880
- Come to our block. - Come to our block.

3174
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:48,648
But if we go to Block Seven,

3175
02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:50,579
someone should go to Block Eight.

3176
02:05:51,079 --> 02:05:53,079
Are the other blocks full?

3177
02:05:53,779 --> 02:05:56,319
Or the three of you could remain.

3178
02:05:58,789 --> 02:06:01,529
I want to go.

3179
02:06:01,829 --> 02:06:03,960
- Do you want to go? - I want to go. But...

3180
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:06,430
I want to go with Khundi Panda.

3181
02:06:07,229 --> 02:06:08,630
- To Block Seven? - Yes.

3182
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:14,170
No. Luci Gang will go to Block Eight then.

3183
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:17,039
Let's talk among ourselves.

3184
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:22,509
I just wanted to do it with Khundi Panda.

3185
02:06:22,510 --> 02:06:23,880
I want to move with him.

3186
02:06:24,350 --> 02:06:26,350
I want to go now.

3187
02:06:26,649 --> 02:06:27,789
I want to join Block Seven.

3188
02:06:28,289 --> 02:06:30,850
How about you go to Block 8? We'll recruit you to Block 7 later.

3189
02:06:33,189 --> 02:06:35,488
- Is that okay? - I'll accept it.

3190
02:06:35,489 --> 02:06:37,698
I thought it was impossible to carry out the mission...

3191
02:06:37,699 --> 02:06:39,930
with just the three of us.

3192
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:42,899
So we decided to go to different blocks and reunite.

3193
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:46,439
Are you done recruiting?

3194
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:48,608
- We don't care who joins us. - You don't care?

3195
02:06:48,609 --> 02:06:50,368
- Anyone is welcome. - Are you willing...

3196
02:06:50,369 --> 02:06:51,939
to make Luci Gang your leader?

3197
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:53,839
We can't do that.

3198
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:56,949
Okay, then. Then...

3199
02:06:58,180 --> 02:06:59,380
Okay. I got it.

3200
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:03,119
- I should talk to Block 8 first. - Not yet. Yes.

3201
02:07:06,289 --> 02:07:08,688
Hippie Kunda, are you okay with me joining you for a moment?

3202
02:07:08,689 --> 02:07:10,228
- Sorry? - Can I join you for a moment?

3203
02:07:10,229 --> 02:07:11,859
Do you want to join us for a moment?

3204
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,398
Of course, I'll be working hard...

3205
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:15,898
- while I'm in your block. - Okay. It sounds good.

3206
02:07:15,899 --> 02:07:18,069
We're okay with any of you.

3207
02:07:18,539 --> 02:07:23,039
JP and Khundi Panda will join Block Seven first.

3208
02:07:23,409 --> 02:07:26,639
And I obtained understanding and permission...

3209
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,049
from Block Eight to join them.

3210
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:30,049
We decided...

3211
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:31,680
to come together again.

3212
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:34,119
This is so...

3213
02:07:35,949 --> 02:07:36,949
- miserable. - Yes.

3214
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:39,920
From now on,

3215
02:07:40,359 --> 02:07:41,858
we're closing the period...

3216
02:07:41,859 --> 02:07:43,829
for leader replacements and rapper recruitments.

3217
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:46,760
What?

3218
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,699
- We can't do it anymore? - This is not right.

3219
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:54,238
In the end, we couldn't join other blocks...

3220
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:55,640
as time was up.

3221
02:07:55,770 --> 02:07:58,409
Hash Swan couldn't join Block Four either.

3222
02:07:58,710 --> 02:08:00,938
So even though we decided to go separate ways,

3223
02:08:00,939 --> 02:08:02,880
we got back together.

3224
02:08:03,649 --> 02:08:05,979
As we got back together in that situation,

3225
02:08:06,380 --> 02:08:09,749
it wasn't a matter of having only a few people for a mission anymore.

3226
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:11,890
It just made us lose motivation.

3227
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,189
Everyone...

3228
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:18,828
kind of gave up.

3229
02:08:18,829 --> 02:08:20,060
I felt bad.

3230
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:28,340
Members of RAP:PUBLIC.

3231
02:08:28,609 --> 02:08:30,738
Please come to the arena.

3232
02:08:30,739 --> 02:08:31,810
Okay.

3233
02:08:32,279 --> 02:08:34,949
Coming.

3234
02:08:35,409 --> 02:08:36,479
Let's go.

3235
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:45,760
I'm already nervous.

3236
02:08:48,659 --> 02:08:49,889
Should I sit on the first step?

3237
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:51,960
- Yes. Because you're the leader. - Leaders sit on the first step.

3238
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:53,960
It'll be uncomfortable.

3239
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:55,770
- It's spacious. - I know.

3240
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:57,369
It's so spacious.

3241
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:01,810
- Block 5 only has 4 people. - Right.

3242
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:04,170
I feel bad.

3243
02:09:04,479 --> 02:09:08,578
We don't know what kind of matches we'll have.

3244
02:09:08,579 --> 02:09:11,118
Having only a small number of people...

3245
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:13,380
would be a big disadvantage.

3246
02:09:13,979 --> 02:09:15,420
It feels like I'm filled with emptiness.

3247
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:17,390
Where's Mckdaddy?

3248
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:18,619
- What? - Where's Mckdaddy?

3249
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:23,060
Who is Mckdaddy?

3250
02:09:23,229 --> 02:09:24,960
- Was there someone like that? - You know the betrayer.

3251
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:29,630
Members of RAP:PUBLIC.

3252
02:09:29,899 --> 02:09:32,899
Last night, there were changes...

3253
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:35,869
brought about by the rules of this society.

3254
02:09:36,569 --> 02:09:37,709
New members are coming.

3255
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:40,979
Three members moved to other blocks.

3256
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:43,779
And four leaders were replaced.

3257
02:09:44,210 --> 02:09:46,818
It changed the dynamics...

3258
02:09:46,819 --> 02:09:48,350
of each block.

3259
02:09:49,619 --> 02:09:50,619
- Stop dozing off. - What?

3260
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,960
We moved to another block. We should show them.

3261
02:09:54,689 --> 02:09:56,029
From now on,

3262
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:58,398
I'll reveal the second Block Match...

3263
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:01,600
that determines survival in this society.

3264
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,239
I'm excited about it now.

3265
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:07,439
- What kind of nonsense would it be? - I know.

3266
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:11,010
The second Block Match is...

3267
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:19,079
Block Tournament.

3268
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:22,050
- Right. - A tournament?

3269
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:25,419
RAP:PUBLIC had missions I'd never heard before...

3270
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:28,489
like the Infinite Cypher.

3271
02:10:28,729 --> 02:10:31,260
When I heard it, I was like, "What is it?"

3272
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:34,670
It's like the World Cup.

3273
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,969
- With different groups? - I guess so.

3274
02:10:36,970 --> 02:10:38,840
- It'd be quarterfinals. - It'd be quarterfinals.

3275
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:41,469
- Then... - It's over if we lose once...

3276
02:10:41,470 --> 02:10:43,869
because it's a tournament. If we win, we'll compete again.

3277
02:10:44,010 --> 02:10:45,810
Does it mean the entire block will be eliminated?

3278
02:10:46,579 --> 02:10:49,850
The rules of the Block Tournament are as follows.

3279
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,419
The eight blocks will be divided...

3280
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:58,389
into two leagues, and matches will be conducted within each league.

3281
02:10:58,390 --> 02:10:59,390
(Rules of the Block Tournament)

3282
02:10:59,391 --> 02:11:02,529
Each league will consist of a total of two rounds.

3283
02:11:03,489 --> 02:11:07,328
Only the blocks that win in the first round...

3284
02:11:07,329 --> 02:11:09,770
will advance to the second round.

3285
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:13,869
Only the two blocks that are the final winners of each league...

3286
02:11:14,069 --> 02:11:15,869
will ensure the survival of all their members.

3287
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:17,938
What did he say? I didn't hear it.

3288
02:11:17,939 --> 02:11:20,339
Only two teams will ensure the survival of all their members.

3289
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:21,609
Only two teams?

3290
02:11:22,279 --> 02:11:23,448
This is really tough.

3291
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:25,720
If we can't win, not all of us can survive.

3292
02:11:25,949 --> 02:11:28,249
Gosh, I'm breaking into a cold sweat.

3293
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:29,420
This is so tough.

3294
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:31,659
- We should win twice. - Yes.

3295
02:11:33,619 --> 02:11:35,228
I need nothing else.

3296
02:11:35,229 --> 02:11:36,760
All of us must survive.

3297
02:11:37,029 --> 02:11:39,800
And I should make it come true.

3298
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:44,970
The Block Money at stake for each round...

3299
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:50,970
is 10,000 dollars.

3300
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:52,180
(10,000 dollars)

3301
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:54,078
It's 10,000 dollars for each round?

3302
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:56,350
- Each round? - Each round? If we win...

3303
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:58,618
- Is it 20,000 dollars? - It's 20,000 dollars.

3304
02:11:58,619 --> 02:11:59,750
It's not bad.

3305
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:04,658
In the Block Tournament, each round will feature one beat.

3306
02:12:04,659 --> 02:12:06,688
And teams of four will have...

3307
02:12:06,689 --> 02:12:10,460
a 4-on-4 showdown against their opposing block.

3308
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,159
And we're four.

3309
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:15,569
How did this happen?

3310
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:18,670
Each team should pick four representative members.

3311
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:21,639
It's going to be interesting.

3312
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:24,140
I thought we'd see some interesting performances again.

3313
02:12:25,239 --> 02:12:27,640
This is fun. The rules themselves are interesting.

3314
02:12:27,739 --> 02:12:30,510
It definitely motivated us.

3315
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:35,390
All members of the block should participate.

3316
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:38,119
The members of a block with fewer people...

3317
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:43,828
might have to participate more than once.

3318
02:12:43,829 --> 02:12:44,930
Darn it.

3319
02:12:45,829 --> 02:12:47,060
The members of Khundi Panda's block should participate twice.

3320
02:12:47,329 --> 02:12:48,569
We should do it twice?

3321
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:50,130
My goodness.

3322
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,039
If the same members do it twice, it's going to be so boring.

3323
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:55,639
Our block has fewer people now.

3324
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:58,709
I think it's a big disadvantage for us.

3325
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:01,880
I'm sure everyone had the same thought.

3326
02:13:01,979 --> 02:13:05,520
Darn it. Two of us should do it twice.

3327
02:13:06,449 --> 02:13:07,988
So one of us should do it twice.

3328
02:13:07,989 --> 02:13:10,449
- Right. One of us should do that. - One of us should do that.

3329
02:13:11,289 --> 02:13:13,489
The winners and the losers of the Block Tournament...

3330
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:16,358
will be decided through voting...

3331
02:13:16,359 --> 02:13:17,858
conducted by the members of the blocks from the other league.

3332
02:13:17,859 --> 02:13:19,500
Yes. It's the same method.

3333
02:13:20,829 --> 02:13:23,000
The tournament brackets are...

3334
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:26,269
We might draw lots.

3335
02:13:26,270 --> 02:13:27,568
Like how they draw groups for the Champion League.

3336
02:13:27,569 --> 02:13:29,010
- I guess so. - It's going to be interesting.

3337
02:13:29,609 --> 02:13:31,140
They're decided by the block...

3338
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:35,079
with the fewest members out of eight blocks.

3339
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:38,249
They decide all the brackets?

3340
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,478
All of them?

3341
02:13:39,479 --> 02:13:41,519
- We're deciding the brackets? - We're deciding it?

3342
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:42,788
- The brackets? - This is awesome.

3343
02:13:42,789 --> 02:13:43,890
We decide all of them?

3344
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:47,289
We can shake them up for the last time.

3345
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,228
And this last chance...

3346
02:13:49,229 --> 02:13:51,429
will give us room to breathe.

3347
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:52,930
I think they're smiling for the first time today.

3348
02:13:53,329 --> 02:13:54,899
So they get to decide everything.

3349
02:13:56,670 --> 02:14:00,640
I feel like Khundi Panda...

3350
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:03,068
who looks like...

3351
02:14:03,069 --> 02:14:04,938
a kind and innocent boy...

3352
02:14:04,939 --> 02:14:08,009
will plot something huge.

3353
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:09,550
That's the aura he's exuding.

3354
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:12,049
They'll make it favorable to them.

3355
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:16,020
And they'll make it the worst for the other teams.

3356
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:18,489
This is huge.

3357
02:14:18,819 --> 02:14:20,288
I told you. It's an opportunity.

3358
02:14:20,289 --> 02:14:21,829
I'm so happy for you.

3359
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:23,130
Who do you want to go against?

3360
02:14:23,789 --> 02:14:24,859
Tell me.

3361
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:26,529
Tell me.

3362
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,859
Just kneel before him.

3363
02:14:28,199 --> 02:14:29,399
Tell me who you want to compete with.

3364
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:32,469
How will Khundi Panda...

3365
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:34,569
try to kill me?

3366
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,709
Block Five, please go...

3367
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:42,380
to the Village to decide the tournament brackets.

3368
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:44,779
Khundi Panda.

3369
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:49,050
Khundi Panda. Hash Swan.

3370
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:51,590
Seriously. What I said earlier.

3371
02:14:52,090 --> 02:14:54,519
- I think they'll take revenge. - No.

3372
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:56,259
- Please help us. - Please help us.

3373
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:58,199
- Please do it well. - Fantastic Four.

3374
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,859
It's because of you.

3375
02:15:01,869 --> 02:15:04,300
That's a great authority.

3376
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:07,738
- We're doomed. - They'll take revenge on us.

3377
02:15:07,739 --> 02:15:09,510
We got on their bad side.

3378
02:15:09,670 --> 02:15:11,839
- It won't be easy. - We're doomed.

3379
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,310
It won't be easy for us.

3380
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:16,009
But this is a good benefit.

3381
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:18,779
It is huge. It is fun.

3382
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:20,020
It was a relief.

3383
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:23,089
I finally had the picture I wanted.

3384
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:25,618
First of all, we have to win.

3385
02:15:25,619 --> 02:15:28,488
It's about who we go against first.

3386
02:15:28,489 --> 02:15:30,728
Shall we first send the block that we don't want to compete...

3387
02:15:30,729 --> 02:15:32,129
- To the other side? - to the other side.

3388
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:35,368
The A League blocks and B League blocks won't meet.

3389
02:15:35,369 --> 02:15:36,669
We'd benefit from that.

3390
02:15:36,670 --> 02:15:39,270
We should put the strong teams together and weaken them.

3391
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:42,568
Khundi Panda would put the strong blocks together.

3392
02:15:42,569 --> 02:15:46,738
They would put the strongest blocks together.

3393
02:15:46,739 --> 02:15:48,709
I think that would be Block 1 and Block 3.

3394
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:50,380
And they would compete with Block Eight.

3395
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:53,179
We can't have our guards down with Block Eight either.

3396
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:55,089
- They're very strong. - Right.

3397
02:15:55,090 --> 02:15:56,889
It's like a cypher. They don't rap verses.

3398
02:15:56,890 --> 02:15:58,219
They just mix theirs together.

3399
02:15:58,220 --> 02:15:59,559
I think so too.

3400
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,420
They're the strongest when they're together.

3401
02:16:01,729 --> 02:16:03,430
They might not choose Block Eight.

3402
02:16:03,689 --> 02:16:05,459
I don't think Khundi Panda will set it the way we think.

3403
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:08,129
I heard he's really smart.

3404
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:09,269
According to JP.

3405
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:11,600
I think he'd have made a really interesting list.

3406
02:16:11,939 --> 02:16:12,970
I'll announce it.

3407
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:15,069
You announce it. "Which block would it be?"

3408
02:16:15,470 --> 02:16:16,739
Drum rolls.

3409
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:19,510
They're just coming out casually.

3410
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:22,609
- You're cool. - You look handsome.

3411
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:25,279
Why are you calling him handsome? It's already over.

3412
02:16:25,579 --> 02:16:27,449
Hey. Get lost.

3413
02:16:28,619 --> 02:16:30,520
- It's already over. - Let's go.

3414
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,790
I'm getting lots of cheers.

3415
02:16:37,059 --> 02:16:38,158
Are you excited?

3416
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:39,658
- Yes. - Yes.

3417
02:16:39,659 --> 02:16:40,729
Why is he good at hosting?

3418
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:42,729
Are you excited, Mckdaddy?

3419
02:16:43,069 --> 02:16:47,439
(Are you excited, Mckdaddy?)

3420
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:49,808
I still have a pen.

3421
02:16:49,809 --> 02:16:51,170
I can still make changes.

3422
02:16:51,639 --> 02:16:52,709
I can change it.

3423
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:55,048
- Be nice. Don't laugh. - Are you excited?

3424
02:16:55,049 --> 02:16:56,079
Please be nice.

3425
02:16:57,879 --> 02:17:02,690
The blocks that will have Round One matches in A League...

3426
02:17:05,319 --> 02:17:07,290
are Block six...

3427
02:17:07,489 --> 02:17:09,689
I think he'll put us with the strongest block,

3428
02:17:09,690 --> 02:17:11,389
for example Block one.

3429
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:12,859
Block six...

3430
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,798
(Block Tournament: Block 6 versus...)

3431
02:17:14,799 --> 02:17:15,869
and Block seven.

3432
02:17:15,870 --> 02:17:17,099
(Block Tournament: Block 6 versus Block 7)

3433
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:18,939
That's nice.

3434
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:20,069
Nice.

3435
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:22,940
I think we'll win the first round.

3436
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:24,440
We won.

3437
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,238
I think Marv and Owen are strong.

3438
02:17:28,239 --> 02:17:29,708
They can pull off diverse genres.

3439
02:17:29,709 --> 02:17:30,849
- They can do everything. - Right.

3440
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:32,378
I think they'll go two times.

3441
02:17:32,379 --> 02:17:33,449
- Like that. - That's strong.

3442
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:35,749
- They'd have a golden balance. - Right.

3443
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:38,419
And strategically, we should make Block 6 and Block 7...

3444
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:40,860
tire each other out.

3445
02:17:41,090 --> 02:17:43,228
How do you want to decide who goes first here?

3446
02:17:43,229 --> 02:17:45,700
- Unfavorably for Block 6. - Block 6 should go first.

3447
02:17:46,329 --> 02:17:47,700
That means we're in Round One.

3448
02:17:47,899 --> 02:17:49,798
That means we're going first.

3449
02:17:49,799 --> 02:17:50,799
Right.

3450
02:17:51,399 --> 02:17:52,739
Block Seven? That was fine.

3451
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:54,739
Nice.

3452
02:17:55,139 --> 02:17:58,269
Block 6 has more members. They have 8 people.

3453
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,109
But we can easily win.

3454
02:18:00,110 --> 02:18:02,780
I thought we had better quality.

3455
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:06,020
Then, it's Block Eight...

3456
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:12,689
It's Block 8 and Block 5.

3457
02:18:12,690 --> 02:18:15,729
- They called us up? - Yes.

3458
02:18:16,829 --> 02:18:17,889
Okay.

3459
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:22,199
I think Block Eight is the easiest opponent.

3460
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,828
We could warm up with them...

3461
02:18:24,829 --> 02:18:27,100
and reach the final round.

3462
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:31,010
There was an image formed for Block Eight.

3463
02:18:31,139 --> 02:18:32,509
A block with weak members.

3464
02:18:32,510 --> 02:18:34,839
A block that you'd get an easy win in a match.

3465
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:37,909
I wanted to show them a performance that overcame that.

3466
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:41,789
(Block Tournament: A League)

3467
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:43,488
Block 8 versus Block 5.

3468
02:18:43,489 --> 02:18:45,119
Then...

3469
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,718
- One, two, three, four? - It's one, two, three, four.

3470
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:48,189
We'll be having it here.

3471
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:49,989
- It's all tough. - Darn.

3472
02:18:51,059 --> 02:18:52,759
Okay.

3473
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,298
- We already had a match once. - Right.

3474
02:18:55,299 --> 02:18:57,200
I think they set it in the same way.

3475
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,469
We're in the worst group.

3476
02:19:00,739 --> 02:19:01,770
It's horrible.

3477
02:19:02,139 --> 02:19:05,479
I didn't want to go against Block Two again.

3478
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:10,049
The blocks that will have Round One matches in B League...

3479
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:15,750
are Block Four...

3480
02:19:18,989 --> 02:19:20,488
I do want...

3481
02:19:20,489 --> 02:19:23,259
- to get revenge on them. - Me too.

3482
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:24,359
(Block Breaker)

3483
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:27,058
(Block 5 lost to Block 4 in the Block Breaker.)

3484
02:19:27,059 --> 02:19:28,930
(It's so petty.)

3485
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:31,328
Block Four...

3486
02:19:31,329 --> 02:19:33,298
(Block Tournament: Block 4 versus...)

3487
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:34,340
and Block One.

3488
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:40,808
- Then Block 3 and Block 2. - Wait a minute.

3489
02:19:40,809 --> 02:19:42,209
Good.

3490
02:19:42,649 --> 02:19:44,679
- This is awesome. - I love it.

3491
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:46,719
It's not cool.

3492
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:51,250
- You can handle that. - Right.

3493
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:53,919
Block 1 versus Block 4 and Block 2 versus Block 3...

3494
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,189
- Me too. - seem better.

3495
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:56,628
We could have Block 1 versus Block 4 and Block 2 versus Block 3...

3496
02:19:56,629 --> 02:19:57,889
to weaken them.

3497
02:19:58,059 --> 02:20:00,058
Didn't Block 2 and Block 3 compete before?

3498
02:20:00,059 --> 02:20:01,359
I want to give them a rematch.

3499
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:04,169
They would all understand. We have to survive.

3500
02:20:04,170 --> 02:20:05,870
What would they do even if they don't?

3501
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,170
It's none of our business.

3502
02:20:07,799 --> 02:20:11,209
(Block Tournament: B League)

3503
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:13,078
- This is a win for us. - Would we be able to do it?

3504
02:20:13,079 --> 02:20:15,149
It's a free win. We won 20,000 dollars.

3505
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:17,449
I thought...

3506
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:19,819
anyone could go and win against Block Four.

3507
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:23,749
We should prepare well this time.

3508
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:26,158
It doesn't matter who comes up.

3509
02:20:26,159 --> 02:20:27,260
I wasn't scared.

3510
02:20:27,690 --> 02:20:30,090
They're gangsters.

3511
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:32,159
- Enjoy. - Seriously.

3512
02:20:32,899 --> 02:20:34,959
But it could be fun.

3513
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:38,298
They all think Block Four is an easy opponent.

3514
02:20:38,299 --> 02:20:40,569
But don't put your guard down, Block One.

3515
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:44,010
We meet again.

3516
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:45,539
Please stay still this time.

3517
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:47,808
- A rematch. - A clean one.

3518
02:20:47,809 --> 02:20:51,279
I can't help but swear.

3519
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:53,579
I guess the first match was really fun.

3520
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:55,078
We could do it again?

3521
02:20:55,079 --> 02:20:56,919
Nice. It's mine.

3522
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,920
I should grab the chance.

3523
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:00,689
It was rather good.

3524
02:21:00,690 --> 02:21:03,229
We should get revenge for having lost before.

3525
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:06,459
Please make it fun.

3526
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,628
(The blocks are preparing for the second Block Match.)

3527
02:21:11,629 --> 02:21:13,869
Mr. Wally

3528
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:15,609
I'm giving you a free lesson

3529
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:17,040
My goodness. That scared me.

3530
02:21:17,409 --> 02:21:18,939
It's starting.

3531
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:20,479
It's like the end of this world.

3532
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:22,909
- Let's do it. - Yes, sir.

3533
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:24,549
Hey.

3534
02:21:25,149 --> 02:21:26,218
Okay.

3535
02:21:26,219 --> 02:21:27,779
- Your energy is going up now. - He woke up.

3536
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:30,149
Members of RAP:PUBLIC,

3537
02:21:30,450 --> 02:21:34,458
the second Block Match will begin shortly.

3538
02:21:34,459 --> 02:21:36,728
- Yes. - Let's go.

3539
02:21:36,729 --> 02:21:39,729
Please gather at the arena.

3540
02:21:39,899 --> 02:21:41,599
Let's go!

3541
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,769
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

3542
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,898
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3543
02:21:43,899 --> 02:21:45,639
We all have our best fighting spirit.

3544
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,939
Let's go. Come on.

3545
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:49,870
We should kill them.

3546
02:21:51,170 --> 02:21:52,340
I'm heating up.

3547
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:55,309
I feel like my health is dropping whenever I see these steps.

3548
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,548
- I will win. - I shouldn't get excited.

3549
02:21:58,549 --> 02:21:59,649
I will win.

3550
02:21:59,879 --> 02:22:01,620
Members of RAP:PUBLIC,

3551
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:04,718
each block will once again stand...

3552
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:07,059
at the crossroads of fate.

3553
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,628
Oh, my gosh.

3554
02:22:08,629 --> 02:22:10,459
The second Block Match,

3555
02:22:11,059 --> 02:22:13,898
Block Tournament will begin.

3556
02:22:13,899 --> 02:22:14,959
Yes.

3557
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:18,298
- Yes. - It's not hopeful thinking.

3558
02:22:18,299 --> 02:22:19,440
We'll win no matter what.

3559
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:22,010
We'll win first place and get the prize money.

3560
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:23,370
We should win first place, of course.

3561
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:26,340
Everyone who looked down on us is dead.

3562
02:22:26,639 --> 02:22:28,309
Round One of B League.

3563
02:22:28,709 --> 02:22:32,020
The match between Block 4 and Block 1 will begin.

3564
02:22:32,719 --> 02:22:35,318
- Yes! - Yes!

3565
02:22:35,319 --> 02:22:37,249
- Let's go! - I'm looking forward to it.

3566
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:38,859
This will be fun.

3567
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:41,590
Block Four will start first.

3568
02:22:41,989 --> 02:22:43,488
I wonder who will come first.

3569
02:22:43,489 --> 02:22:44,859
I was very curious.

3570
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:48,359
Boi B, SINCE, skyminhyuk,

3571
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:50,128
and PUNCHNELLO will participate.

3572
02:22:50,129 --> 02:22:51,769
- Let's go. - That's a strong formation.

3573
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:53,399
- Let's go. - What?

3574
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:55,908
They put all the strong members in Round One.

3575
02:22:55,909 --> 02:22:57,869
They wanted to start strong.

3576
02:22:57,870 --> 02:22:59,908
- They have their best people. - They'll win Round One.

3577
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:04,009
The opposers in Round One are JEFFERY WHITE, ZENE THE ZILLA,

3578
02:23:04,010 --> 02:23:06,318
DAMINI, and JTONG.

3579
02:23:06,319 --> 02:23:07,919
(Block Tournament: B League, Round 1)

3580
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,648
- JTONG. - It's strong.

3581
02:23:09,649 --> 02:23:11,289
It's a strong team.

3582
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:13,519
- Goodness. - They're strong too.

3583
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:15,260
I think they're stronger.

3584
02:23:15,329 --> 02:23:16,429
I think it will be really fun.

3585
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:17,759
When would we ever see this?

3586
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,500
They'll be rapping with the same beat.

3587
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:23,029
Block Four planned to win...

3588
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:25,228
only in Round One.

3589
02:23:25,229 --> 02:23:27,599
All the strong members are there now.

3590
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:29,068
We only have one strategy.

3591
02:23:29,069 --> 02:23:30,808
We'll get through Round One no matter what.

3592
02:23:30,809 --> 02:23:32,509
We planned it so that...

3593
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:35,548
the others could show what they have...

3594
02:23:35,549 --> 02:23:37,010
in a more relaxed way.

3595
02:23:37,209 --> 02:23:39,548
We're not interested in what Block Four's strategy is.

3596
02:23:39,549 --> 02:23:40,579
We will win no matter what.

3597
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:42,589
When preparing for this match,

3598
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:45,488
JTONG's verse was really cool.

3599
02:23:45,489 --> 02:23:47,559
It keeps dripping

3600
02:23:47,889 --> 02:23:50,530
- It's over. - It's just over.

3601
02:23:50,629 --> 02:23:53,930
We won't lose as long as we don't make a mistake.

3602
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:56,299
JTONG looks so cool.

3603
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:58,899
- Isn't he so cool? - He's like a model.

3604
02:23:59,170 --> 02:24:01,440
Have you all eaten?

3605
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:03,009
- Yes. - Yes.

3606
02:24:03,010 --> 02:24:05,270
I couldn't eat because I wasn't feeling so well.

3607
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:07,780
I'll have my late meal now.

3608
02:24:09,479 --> 02:24:10,510
Thank you.

3609
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:12,950
- Okay. - That's boring.

3610
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:16,619
But this will be fun.

3611
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:18,089
Watching this will be fun.

3612
02:24:18,090 --> 02:24:19,159
We will begin...

3613
02:24:19,389 --> 02:24:23,458
the Block Match between Block 4 and Block 1.

3614
02:24:23,459 --> 02:24:26,629
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3615
02:24:27,159 --> 02:24:29,669
Rappers going second, please return to your seats...

3616
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:31,229
and watch.

3617
02:24:32,069 --> 02:24:34,770
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3618
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:39,138
We can go to Round 2 only if we win Round 1.

3619
02:24:39,139 --> 02:24:40,839
So we have to win Round One no matter what.

3620
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:42,749
Ryul and VIIN haven't rapped...

3621
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,808
in front of us yet.

3622
02:24:44,809 --> 02:24:47,120
(During the last Block Match)

3623
02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:50,048
(Ryul and VIIN had no chance to rap after Mask Off.)

3624
02:24:50,049 --> 02:24:51,289
We have to win...

3625
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:53,290
so we can show our great members of Block Four.

3626
02:24:53,459 --> 02:24:54,459
Ready.

3627
02:24:58,590 --> 02:24:59,760
I should watch this while standing.

3628
02:25:01,629 --> 02:25:02,629
Start.

3629
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,339
I can never return to being normal again

3630
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,749
I hit the bottom

3631
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:17,179
I hit too hard

3632
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:19,048
I stitch the crushed head with drinks again

3633
02:25:19,049 --> 02:25:20,519
I keep falling down every day

3634
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,048
I'm used to it now, I call for it more

3635
02:25:22,049 --> 02:25:23,888
Someone is calling me, Ignoring doesn't help

3636
02:25:23,889 --> 02:25:25,519
I get pulled down continuously

3637
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:26,718
I've seen it all

3638
02:25:26,719 --> 02:25:28,519
It's game over if you try to fight me

3639
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,988
We're actions before words

3640
02:25:29,989 --> 02:25:31,628
I create a mess and swallow this place up

3641
02:25:31,629 --> 02:25:33,658
Who would make us their enemy?

3642
02:25:33,659 --> 02:25:35,029
You give all your money

3643
02:25:35,030 --> 02:25:36,628
Don't talk to me, get lost

3644
02:25:36,629 --> 02:25:38,499
The table turned red

3645
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:39,939
The dimming light, so dark

3646
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:41,499
My body gets scratched and bleed, but I'm all right

3647
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:43,208
You take it all, we don't make jokes

3648
02:25:43,209 --> 02:25:44,939
I need more bottles, bring them here

3649
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:46,408
The dimming light, so dark

3650
02:25:46,409 --> 02:25:48,179
My body gets scratched and bleed, but I'm all right

3651
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:49,808
You take it all, we don't make jokes

3652
02:25:49,809 --> 02:25:51,408
I need more bottles, bring them here

3653
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:53,279
I can't do complex calculations, I'm a straight type

3654
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,749
I'm CAPA who solves everything with rap

3655
02:25:54,750 --> 02:25:56,349
I run it with my mechanism

3656
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:57,949
I don't get an upset stomach because I poured out everything

3657
02:25:57,950 --> 02:25:59,619
I would have delivered if my faith was broken

3658
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:01,619
Only the weak ones lose their mind

3659
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:02,828
They only brag about their rental

3660
02:26:02,829 --> 02:26:04,690
They're busy showing off while reusing their verse

3661
02:26:04,829 --> 02:26:07,298
I want to listen, but I won't since it makes no sense

3662
02:26:07,299 --> 02:26:09,369
They believe they're not doing what they can't do

3663
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:10,529
All they do is complain

3664
02:26:10,530 --> 02:26:11,929
You should use your brain or your legs

3665
02:26:11,930 --> 02:26:13,798
Why do you just sit back and act like you're unhappy?

3666
02:26:13,799 --> 02:26:15,169
To those who can't even have opportunities

3667
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:17,308
My verses are too good for them

3668
02:26:17,309 --> 02:26:19,078
You can't hustle like me even if you want to

3669
02:26:19,079 --> 02:26:20,738
Money becomes my Aronamin whenever I'm tired

3670
02:26:20,739 --> 02:26:22,648
Living day to day until I become Abu Dhabi

3671
02:26:22,649 --> 02:26:23,978
It wasn't created in one morning

3672
02:26:23,979 --> 02:26:25,978
I've never not worked hard

3673
02:26:25,979 --> 02:26:27,318
My passion never grows old

3674
02:26:27,319 --> 02:26:29,048
I pour out everything no matter the chances

3675
02:26:29,049 --> 02:26:30,419
Luck follows me as I'm full of conviction

3676
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:32,919
- We have to hit rock bottom - Rock bottom

3677
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:36,228
- We have to hit rock bottom - Rock bottom

3678
02:26:36,229 --> 02:26:39,458
- We have to hit rock bottom - Rock bottom, let's go

3679
02:26:39,459 --> 02:26:43,399
- We have to hit rock bottom - Rock bottom

3680
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:45,699
Friend, you should quickly get lost too

3681
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:46,839
That's the best.

3682
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:49,109
Friend, you should get lost too

3683
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:51,208
- Get lost! - Why is that good?

3684
02:26:51,209 --> 02:26:52,539
- You should get lost too - It's crazy.

3685
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:55,708
- Get lost! - Friend, you should get lost too

3686
02:26:55,709 --> 02:26:56,709
Get lost!

3687
02:26:56,850 --> 02:27:00,179
It's a cliche for me to even explain where I'm from

3688
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:01,419
- Locker room speech - They organized this well.

3689
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:03,450
We need teamplay at this point

3690
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:06,658
A.k.a, new Gascoigne, Night vibe again

3691
02:27:06,659 --> 02:27:08,359
A blockcore look

3692
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:09,860
The timeline makes my eyes rot

3693
02:27:10,290 --> 02:27:12,728
I came back properly like Mugosa's header

3694
02:27:12,729 --> 02:27:13,999
Instinctive moves

3695
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,129
Views you can't see from video replays

3696
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:18,429
Rap phenomenal, I've become stronger

3697
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:19,940
Than at the audition

3698
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,669
Skills that require biometric authentication

3699
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:22,869
No matter the BPM

3700
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:25,679
- Go, go, gadget, what - It's refreshing

3701
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:26,839
Put a full stop

3702
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:28,238
- That's my friend. - I'm in the VVIP zone

3703
02:27:28,239 --> 02:27:29,279
When going to Incheon Football Stadium

3704
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,749
- Ball, kick it - Kick it

3705
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:32,578
- Guap, take it - Take it

3706
02:27:32,579 --> 02:27:35,548
- Running start, too easy - Too easy

3707
02:27:35,549 --> 02:27:37,849
Burning 3,000 dollars on Mom's Gucci bag with liberation money

3708
02:27:37,850 --> 02:27:39,388
The worst student in school beats K hip-hop

3709
02:27:39,389 --> 02:27:42,489
That's the best you have, slowpoke

3710
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:43,530
Enemies in the shadow

3711
02:27:43,531 --> 02:27:45,430
My attitude doesn't change even if I succeed

3712
02:27:45,530 --> 02:27:46,759
Contacted by Beautiful Nerd

3713
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:48,398
Get lost, comedians

3714
02:27:48,399 --> 02:27:49,999
They said this doesn't make money

3715
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,599
I guess I'm the only one making rap money

3716
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,138
- Concert seats getting sold out - They're good.

3717
02:27:53,139 --> 02:27:55,270
Start from Show Me The Money, TV, yes

3718
02:27:55,639 --> 02:27:57,238
Who will become the legend if not me?

3719
02:27:57,239 --> 02:27:59,509
We've played as much as we could, It's time to change places

Suggest something good if you want to cast me

3723

I'm performing next month, Dubai, Peace be upon you

3724
02:28:07,850 --> 02:28:10,749
Beautiful women make passes at me, But I just walk my way

3725
02:28:10,750 --> 02:28:13,558
Shooting all, pour it up Drink in the failure, mission clear

3726
02:28:13,559 --> 02:28:15,589
We have to hit rock bottom

3727
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:16,728
- Rock bottom - Rock bottom

3728
02:28:16,729 --> 02:28:18,529
We have to hit rock bottom

3729
02:28:18,530 --> 02:28:19,859
- Rock bottom - They're coming down the stage.

3730
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:21,930
- Let's go. - We have to hit rock bottom

3731
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:23,129
- Rock bottom - Rock bottom

3732
02:28:23,329 --> 02:28:25,328
We have to hit rock bottom

3733
02:28:25,329 --> 02:28:26,540
- Rock bottom - Rock bottom

3734
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:29,839
Friend, you should get lost too

3735
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:30,840
- Get lost! - Get lost!

3736
02:28:30,841 --> 02:28:32,408
- Friend, you should get lost too - Why are you saying it to us?

3737
02:28:32,409 --> 02:28:34,179
- Get lost! - Get lost!

3738
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:35,779
- Friend, you should get lost - Why are you saying it to us?

3739
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,578
- Get lost! - He's saying it to Loopy.

3740
02:28:37,579 --> 02:28:40,049
Friend, you should get lost too

3741
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:41,850
- Get lost. - Let's go home.

3742
02:28:42,219 --> 02:28:43,620
- Get lost. - Get lost!

3743
02:28:43,889 --> 02:28:45,520
They're not against each other, though.

3744
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:47,589
- They're not competing. - Right. It's not them.

3745
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:48,690
Why did they go there?

3746
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:50,429
They found the wrong opponent.

3747
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:51,529
Why are you picking a fight?

3748
02:28:51,530 --> 02:28:53,030
That's not your friend.

3749
02:28:53,329 --> 02:28:54,329
Why here?

3750
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:56,969
- What is this? - It's so funny.

3751
02:28:57,329 --> 02:28:59,239
You're ignoring us, right?

3752
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:00,840
I'm sorry.

3753
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:02,340
He's sorry.

3754
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:04,569
Let me apologize in his stead.

3755
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:07,209
I was wondering why they passed us.

3756
02:29:07,379 --> 02:29:08,940
SINCE is really good.

3757
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:10,709
They made a great impact.

3758
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:12,718
The members...

3759
02:29:12,719 --> 02:29:14,519
- Let's do this. - Let's go!

3760
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:16,750
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3761
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:20,889
The four of them are really scary.

3762
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,789
It would be hard to defeat them easily.

3763
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:24,959
We would have to do our best.

3764
02:29:25,129 --> 02:29:26,700
Or else, we wouldn't know what the result would be.

3765
02:29:27,159 --> 02:29:28,359
Yes.

3766
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:29,798
Go, opposers.

3767
02:29:29,799 --> 02:29:31,100
Be quiet, COCONA.

3768
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:33,738
No!

3769
02:29:33,739 --> 02:29:35,040
What's with the "No?"

3770
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:36,510
That's so funny.

3771
02:29:36,610 --> 02:29:38,510
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3772
02:29:38,569 --> 02:29:39,709
- Ready. - Get ready.

3773
02:29:43,379 --> 02:29:44,379
- Let's go. - You got this.

3774
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:52,520
Darn. Wait. I think this is going to be cool.

3775
02:29:53,489 --> 02:29:56,190
Never grow up, I'm still kind of different

3776
02:29:56,530 --> 02:29:59,298
You know I'm the best in your deep end

3777
02:29:59,299 --> 02:30:02,969
My sight so clean and straight over the decade

3778
02:30:03,329 --> 02:30:05,870
Never grow up, I'm still kind of different

3779
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:11,708
Jump out of the back seat, You're looking right at me

3780
02:30:11,709 --> 02:30:13,078
Only doing bad

3781
02:30:13,079 --> 02:30:15,138
- He's really good. - You're looking right at me

3782
02:30:15,139 --> 02:30:16,679
Jump out of the back seat

3783
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:18,749
You're looking right at me

3784
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:20,349
Put mustard on the salad

3785
02:30:20,350 --> 02:30:22,019
Acting cool every day

3786
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:23,619
Using money as my slave

3787
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:25,249
It's because I'm already made for it

3788
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:26,859
The young guy stealing from a convenience store

3789
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:28,519
Filling my account now

3790
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,128
Even though I have a lot, I have more ambition

3791
02:30:30,129 --> 02:30:31,689
So I take away what you have

3792
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:33,158
I act cool like a habit

3793
02:30:33,159 --> 02:30:34,929
My life is thrilling like Pikachu

3794
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:36,468
I wasn't the one who said it wrong

3795
02:30:36,469 --> 02:30:38,228
The forecast said my account was raining

3796
02:30:38,229 --> 02:30:39,869
- He's so good. - Cash my fashion

3797
02:30:39,870 --> 02:30:40,968
It's so clean and fresh

3798
02:30:40,969 --> 02:30:42,568
I can't feel my face

3799
02:30:42,569 --> 02:30:44,269
Labana coupe too fast

3800
02:30:44,270 --> 02:30:45,878
Money colored bird on my chest

3801
02:30:45,879 --> 02:30:46,908
Shout out to Dokgo

3802
02:30:46,909 --> 02:30:48,708
- My life so sweet like choco - He's really good.

3803
02:30:48,709 --> 02:30:50,179
That's why I'm singing like Coco

3804
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:51,849
I'm a tough cookie who does what he intends

3805
02:30:51,850 --> 02:30:53,349
The things I do become a scoop

3806
02:30:53,350 --> 02:30:54,779
If I don't do it, it disappears

3807
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:56,048
But don't worry

3808
02:30:56,049 --> 02:30:57,419
- Sambong is still okay - Nice.

3809
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:58,919
Suyu-ri kid, Ssangmun's girl

3810
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:00,519
A brief meme, a brief gimmick

3811
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:02,158
Weed on sand, the caviar of Han River

3812
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:04,029
The worst period to rap, On my worst behavior

3813
02:31:04,030 --> 02:31:05,359
They would have done it because I did it

3814
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:07,029
They would have done it like they always do

3815
02:31:07,030 --> 02:31:08,499
Money, my attitude is this city's responsibility

3816
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:10,298
I feel myself just as I was born and raised

3817
02:31:10,299 --> 02:31:11,628
People flock together, I go my own way

3818
02:31:11,629 --> 02:31:13,499
I don't put my hopes on tables other people ate from

3819
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:15,138
- Like a weekend in a holiday - I think we'd be able to win.

3820
02:31:15,139 --> 02:31:16,769
Take out the empty grains from my teeth

3821
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:18,169
I'm the miracle of the scene, the standard of this genre

3822
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:20,039
Life has no meaning

3823
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,509
This melody, message, the inside stories

3824
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:23,009
Lyrics that are half swear words are like prayer to me

3825
02:31:23,010 --> 02:31:24,408
Instead of adapting to that, I make my new matrix

3826
02:31:24,409 --> 02:31:26,279
Feel like I'm Gatsby, I still feel the class

3827
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,679
I'm the Kendrick of my town walking around

3828
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,488
I bet one and protect many

3829
02:31:29,489 --> 02:31:31,218
The future is in my hands now

3830
02:31:31,219 --> 02:31:33,119
- I love you DAMINI. - You're on the floor, I'm on rumors

3831
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,658
You can hear my words now

3832
02:31:34,659 --> 02:31:36,659
Better get familiar

3833
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:37,829
Go in.

3834
02:31:40,229 --> 02:31:43,398
Never grow up, I'm still kind of different

3835
02:31:43,399 --> 02:31:46,539
You know I'm the best in your deep end

3836
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:49,969
My sight so clean and straight, Over the decade

3837
02:31:50,409 --> 02:31:51,439
- It's so nice. - Never grow up

3838
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:52,879
I'm still kind of different

3839
02:31:56,409 --> 02:31:59,149
Jump out of the back seat, You're looking right at me

3840
02:31:59,319 --> 02:32:02,919
Only doing bad, You're looking right at me

3841
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:06,259
Jump out of the back seat, You're looking right at me

3842
02:32:06,260 --> 02:32:07,818
I suddenly came out into this world

3843
02:32:07,819 --> 02:32:09,729
There's a load of work to do

3844
02:32:09,829 --> 02:32:12,759
I work hard all the time I diligently increase my fortune

3845
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:14,298
- He's crazy. - I keep climbing up the stairs

3846
02:32:14,299 --> 02:32:16,200
I step on my pedal without resting

3847
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:19,440
A healthy lifestyle, Old habits die hard

3848
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:22,839
Aged awesomeness drips down, Flows down like nosebleed

3849
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:25,809
A superficial cover, Remove it like prepuce

3850
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:29,378
Every time I wake up in the morning, I feel good

3851
02:32:29,379 --> 02:32:32,648
Boil the thick broccoli instead of eating processed food

3852
02:32:32,649 --> 02:32:33,649
Yes!

3853
02:32:34,250 --> 02:32:35,888
I don't brag

3854
02:32:35,889 --> 02:32:37,519
I don't brag

3855
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:39,389
I just laugh

3856
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:42,388
He's still strong to the weak and weak to the strong

3857
02:32:42,389 --> 02:32:43,389
Strong to the weak, Weak to the strong

3858
02:32:43,459 --> 02:32:45,590
JTONG is strong, strong

3859
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,529
I'm ignorant

3860
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:49,729
I spread them in a mess and pick out anything

3861
02:32:50,030 --> 02:32:51,669
The sun bakes the chicken

3862
02:32:51,670 --> 02:32:52,769
A rockfish on my left thigh

3863
02:32:52,770 --> 02:32:54,398
I keep getting interesting plans

3864
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:56,040
Toss and turn, It's chaotic around me

3865
02:32:57,239 --> 02:33:00,478
Tong with capital J, Feel the instinctive attraction

3866
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:03,679
Digital garden, my pretty notes are like tulips

3867
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:06,818
Colors from the nature, Pine needles in my hand

3868
02:33:06,819 --> 02:33:10,218
Live a life widely used in the world, You can call me

3869
02:33:10,219 --> 02:33:13,519
Tong with capital J, Feel the instinctive attraction

3870
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:16,828
Digital garden, my pretty notes are like tulips

3871
02:33:16,829 --> 02:33:20,128
Colors from the nature, Pine needles in my hand

3872
02:33:20,129 --> 02:33:22,199
Live a life widely used in the world

3873
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:24,399
You can call me Tong

3874
02:33:29,709 --> 02:33:30,739
That was nice.

3875
02:33:32,239 --> 02:33:33,280
It's legendary.

3876
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,379
- JTONG. - It's amazing.

3877
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:36,708
Call me JTONG

3878
02:33:36,709 --> 02:33:37,879
That line with "strong."

3879
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:41,349
It was really nice.

3880
02:33:41,350 --> 02:33:42,648
Don't we have to pay?

3881
02:33:42,649 --> 02:33:44,290
You can't win this.

3882
02:33:44,489 --> 02:33:45,988
JTONG carried this.

3883
02:33:45,989 --> 02:33:47,620
B League, Round One.

3884
02:33:47,889 --> 02:33:51,360
The match between Block 4 and Block 1 ended.

3885
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:52,729
He's so good.

3886
02:33:53,629 --> 02:33:54,760
We don't know how this one will go.

3887
02:33:55,059 --> 02:33:56,329
We were totally winning before he stepped up.

3888
02:33:57,530 --> 02:34:00,239
We will now begin the vote.

3889
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:01,840
(The voting begins.)

3890
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:03,370
I'm really torn.

3891
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:04,969
It's so hard.

3892
02:34:05,610 --> 02:34:06,878
B League is amazing.

3893
02:34:06,879 --> 02:34:08,339
It was the same beat,

3894
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:10,408
- but it felt so different. - Right.

3895
02:34:10,409 --> 02:34:11,679
But I think the votes will be split.

3896
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:12,878
I think so too.

3897
02:34:12,879 --> 02:34:14,379
I don't know which block to vote.

3898
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:17,290
That was the most difficult vote.

3899
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:20,260
(The voting is closed.)

3900
02:34:20,489 --> 02:34:22,930
The result of the vote is revealed.

3901
02:34:23,229 --> 02:34:24,329
I'm curious.

3902
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:25,690
What will it be?

3903
02:34:25,691 --> 02:34:27,100
(Block Tournament: B League, Round 1)

3904
02:34:27,559 --> 02:34:30,170
This is really difficult.

3905
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:31,729
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

3906
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:34,440
- My gosh. - Okay.

3907
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:39,270
(Block Tournament: B League, Round 1)

3908
02:34:39,739 --> 02:34:41,010
- Yes. - Yes.

3909
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:42,578
(Block 1 wins Round 1 of B League.)

3910
02:34:42,579 --> 02:34:44,450
- Good. - Good.

3911
02:34:45,079 --> 02:34:46,180
Only a three-vote difference.

3912
02:34:46,750 --> 02:34:48,849
The gap was so narrow.

3913
02:34:48,850 --> 02:34:50,920
Only three votes apart.

3914
02:34:51,090 --> 02:34:54,159
- They were also very good. - They did a good job.

3915
02:34:54,420 --> 02:34:56,388
- It can't be helped. - It can't be helped.

3916
02:34:56,389 --> 02:34:58,729
I'm Boi B's friend, but it can't be helped.

3917
02:34:59,229 --> 02:35:03,298
Block Four had high-ranked members.

3918
02:35:03,299 --> 02:35:05,468
They looked stronger than Block One.

3919
02:35:05,469 --> 02:35:08,769
Block One also had amazing energy.

3920
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:13,238
I was impressed by JEFFERY WHITE's energetic hook.

3921
02:35:13,239 --> 02:35:16,249
Everyone did a good job, but I voted for JTONG.

3922
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:18,079
Not that many people can...

3923
02:35:18,350 --> 02:35:19,619
pull it off like him in this country.

3924
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:21,648
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw them was...

3925
02:35:21,649 --> 02:35:23,120
I wanted to pay for it.

3926
02:35:23,549 --> 02:35:25,048
I was willing to pay for this performance.

3927
02:35:25,049 --> 02:35:27,158
- Hey! - Hey.

3928
02:35:27,159 --> 02:35:28,690
- Good job. - Block One is the winner.

3929
02:35:28,959 --> 02:35:30,359
- That was close. - Good job.

3930
02:35:30,360 --> 02:35:31,859
- You were possessed. - I was possessed.

3931
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,228
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

3932
02:35:33,229 --> 02:35:34,359
- It's fine. - I'm sorry.

3933
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:35,930
It's never a problem.

3934
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:38,030
Block One was amazing.

3935
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:41,199
- Gosh. - I felt so bad.

3936
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,439
Because of us, they can't show...

3937
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:45,068
what they prepared for Round Two.

3938
02:35:45,069 --> 02:35:46,839
It's our fault...

3939
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:49,749
that we couldn't get them a chance.

3940
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:51,679
I was ashamed.

3941
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:54,719
Next is Round One of B League.

3942
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:58,749
It's a match between Block 3 and Block 2.

3943
02:35:58,750 --> 02:36:00,719
(Block 3 versus Block 2)

3944
02:36:00,860 --> 02:36:01,959
Get lost.

3945
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,458
This is going to be darn good.

3946
02:36:04,459 --> 02:36:06,359
The second Block Match.

3947
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:09,799
It's a match between Block 6 and Block 7.

3948
02:36:10,299 --> 02:36:14,639
(Two blocks dominate the stage fiercely.)

3949
02:36:16,069 --> 02:36:19,209
(What's the result of their intense match?)

3950
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:20,909
(The next match is...)

3951
02:36:21,079 --> 02:36:23,179
(about smashing Block 5.)

3952
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:25,109
(We'll send you to the inferno.)

3953
02:36:25,110 --> 02:36:26,419
(They're ready for it.)

3954
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:27,719
(So scary.)

3955
02:36:28,219 --> 02:36:29,419
(We don't get along.)

3956
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:30,719
(Our vibes don't match.)

3957
02:36:31,790 --> 02:36:33,318
(Two blocks put on...)

3958
02:36:33,319 --> 02:36:35,819
(perfect teamwork during the match.)

3959
02:36:36,389 --> 02:36:38,729
(Block 8 versus Block 5)

3960
02:36:39,159 --> 02:36:41,559
(Followed by a big match)

3961
02:36:42,159 --> 02:36:44,669
(A rematch between Block 3 and Block 2)

3962
02:36:44,670 --> 02:36:47,200
(This is tough. They were both amazing.)

3963
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:49,398
What's this?

3964
02:36:49,399 --> 02:36:50,468
(We will announce the elimination candidates.)

3965
02:36:50,469 --> 02:36:51,539
(We're doomed.)

3966
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:52,610
Oh, no.

3967
02:36:53,239 --> 02:36:55,578
(Shoot, that is wrong.)

3968
02:36:55,579 --> 02:36:57,609
(She must think it's unfair.)

3969
02:36:57,610 --> 02:36:59,249
(This deathmatch...)

3970
02:36:59,250 --> 02:37:01,949
(will be this battle.)

3971
02:37:01,950 --> 02:37:03,289
(What is that?)

3972
02:37:03,290 --> 02:37:05,718
(Seriously... That is insane.)

3973
02:37:05,719 --> 02:37:08,718
(We could be eliminated even if we were good.)

3974
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:12,030
(This rule is torturing me.)

3975
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:15,628
(If we do a good job, we'll know who tried to eliminate us.)

3976
02:37:15,629 --> 02:37:16,869
(Don't tell other blocks.)

3977
02:37:16,870 --> 02:37:19,870
(Only we should know about how to find a spy.)
