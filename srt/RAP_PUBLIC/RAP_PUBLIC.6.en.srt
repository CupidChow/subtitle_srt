00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,599
(The second Block Match is...)

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,159
(I'm excited about it now. What kind of nonsense would it be?)

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,029
(Block Tournament.)

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,828
(My gosh...)

6
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,169
(It's like the World Cup.)

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,509
(If we can't win, not all of us can survive.)

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,810

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,178
(I'm breaking into a cold sweat.)

10
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,239
(This is so tough.)

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,450
(The tournament brackets will be decided by...)

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,008
(Block 5.)

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,379
(We're doomed.)

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,090

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,858

00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,798
(The match between Block 4 and Block 1 will begin.)

20
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,468
- Rock bottom - Rock bottom

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,070
Round One of B League...

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,370
(The result for Round 1 of B League between Block 4 and Block 1)

23
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,039
(The block to advance to Round 2...)

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,578
(is Block 1.)

25
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,140
- Hey. - Yes!

26
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,218

Luci Gang

32
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,828
- I bet you heard that a lot. - Luci Gang

33
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,568
- I heard it like a thousand times. - Luci Gang

34
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,329
A lot of foreigners sang that at songwriting camps.

35
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,738
It feels like we're at a songwriting camp.

36
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,299
- Totally. Yes. - This is fun.

37
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,408
My gosh, having this chance...

38
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,708
(The chance to decide all the matches...)

39
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,479
We were so lucky.

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,309
We were lucky to have decided the matches for the other blocks.

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,219
I'm more motivated to work harder now.

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,048
When we had to remain as a team after deciding to split up,

43
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,089
it was really iffy for us.

44
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,488
If you accept me, Block Four would be the best for me.

45
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:58,959
I want to go.

46
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,458
Hippie Kunda, are you okay...

47
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,890
- with me joining you for a moment? - Sorry?

48
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,530
- This is so miserable. - Yes.

49
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,200
From now on,

50
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,399
we're closing the period...

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,240
for leader replacements and rapper recruitments.

52
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,908
To be honest, I thought about dropping out of the show too.

53
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,780
Seriously. I was having a mental breakdown.

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,709
I was worried that we might not be motivated to keep trying.

55
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,120
But when we were practicing together,

56
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,150
it went well.

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,490
It actually did us a favor. It put us in a better mood.

58
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,819
What about the chorus?

59
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,459
You want it

60
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,888
Gamma ray treatment

61
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,300
gamma needs a treatment

62
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,369
- Should we tease all of them? - This is so funny.

63
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,499
- They're in Nasty Kidz. - That?

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,039
Nasty? We can just go with...

65
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,139
- Like they stink. - I see. With that sense of nasty?

66
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,769
I'm sorry to ask,

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,780
but can you guys see if he resembles anyone?

68
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,508
He looks like the character for Sanwa Money.

69
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,579
It goes like this. Sanwa Money

70
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,878
I'm sorry. That wasn't my idea.

71
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,819
We had so much fun practicing for it.

72
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,649
And coming up with the hook was really easy and smooth for us.

73
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,258
They come after my class

74
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,918
- I'm living the best of my life - That's good.

75
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,829
- When we show them, they'll be like - When we show them, they'll be like

76
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,029
- When we show them, they'll be like - When we show them, they'll be like

77
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,669
I think we worked well like a well-oiled machine.

78
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,069
I suddenly got this idea.

79
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,538
I think it's an advantage to be in a smaller group.

80
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,809
It's just the four of us, but all of us are good.

81
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,279
Then our performance will look good compared to other groups.

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,508
- Right. - Let's say we have a lot of people.

83
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,378
And there are a couple of bad rappers here and there.

84
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,818
Then the performance might look subpar...

85
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,079
- because of them. - Right.

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,989
In a way, your group is like an all-star team.

87
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,959
- This might give us an edge. - Totally.

88
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,288
Right. We can rap twice too.

89
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,719
- We're so lucky. - We're lucky.

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,158
For there to be another time, we must kill it with the first one.

91
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,059
Our block has only four rappers.

92
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,959
So we must rap twice.

93
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,029
But that's better for me.

94
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,269
It's an amazing chance to rap twice.

95
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,938
If we win both rounds with cool performances,

96
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,599
that would be even better.

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,210
If we end up...

98
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,669
winning the tournament,

99
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,979
we'll open our doors. We'll bring Mckdaddy back.

100
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,210
Come back, Mckdaddy.

101
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,348
I think the four of us tackled it...

102
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,189
as if there was no tomorrow without this tournament.

103
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,388
We lost once. So I want us to win this time.

104
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,590
Besides, I want all of us to survive.

105
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,959
(Meanwhile, Block 8 will be going up against Block 5.)

106
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,458
Hippie Kunda and I worked together countless times.

107
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,429
I was hoping they would follow our lead...

108
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,100
as we took the key role.

109
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,039
Why don't we go all out for Round One?

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,869
The two of us will perform for both rounds.

111
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,169
And the three of you can rotate.

112
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,539
I'm so excited.

113
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,739
We'll get to show them...

114
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,709
a taste of Nasty Kidz for the first time.

115
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,078
(Block 8 looks for a suitable beat.)

116
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,479
What? What's going on?

117
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,388
- Are you stuck? - I want to write.

118
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,088
I'm the happiest when I write new verses.

119
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:46,220
And I'm confident that I can do well too.

120
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,659
gamma, you want to write new verses for this?

121
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,689
Yes.

122
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,259
But can you memorize them by tomorrow?

123
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,768
Before we talk about that,

124
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,969
shouldn't we get started on our hook...

125
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,169
- and decide on our structure? - Right.

126
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,199
So I mean...

127
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,198
- You'll write one for Round 2 too? - No, I'm good for Round 2.

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,068
- You have one for Round 2? - I see. Round 2...

129
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,069
Okay.

130
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:06,540
It seemed gamma wanted to perform for both rounds.

131
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,648
Well, it usually takes 20 minutes.

132
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,679
- Gosh, that's really fast. - He's super fast.

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,619
If I can't finish in 20 minutes, I won't write it.

134
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,089
- Okay. - Okay.

135
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,789
Okay. Let's hear it in 20 minutes.

136
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,889
We can see if it works or not. Then we can decide on what to do.

137
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,929
Writing a new verse is a huge risk.

138
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,958
So I said we would listen to his rap,

139
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,170
but I was going to exclude him from Round One.

140
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,800
You guys have to win Round One.

141
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm performing for Round Two.

142
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,170
- But if we lose when I haven't... - No, listen.

143
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,810
- There's no way we'll lose. - Right. Exactly.

144
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,149
If I don't even get to perform...

145
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,018
With this match, I really want to be acknowledged...

146
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,479
by the rappers on this show.

147
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,589
If my block loses Round One,

148
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,120
I won't have a chance to perform in Round Two.

149
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,659
My goal is to win Round One no matter what,

150
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,129
so the members of my block get to perform in Round Two.

151
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,699
What did you and Khundi Panda talk about?

152
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,370
- Did you get an offer? - An offer?

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,639
Are you interested in coming over?

154
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,110
I haven't given any thought about this at all.

155
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,879
Do you like your block?

156
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,410
- Will you stay with them? - Yes.

157
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,579
I believe in my block for now.

158
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,619
I thought, "Okay. Let's do it."

159
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,778
"We can do this."

160
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,518
I thought we had a good chance to win...

161
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,989
and the ability to make this work.

162
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,489
I've got an idea.

163
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,188
There are four bars in the intro.

164
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,459
No one is going to rap for that part.

165
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,698
So he and I can pretend to go first. And we can stand like this.

166
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,560
- The two of you can lean back. - Yes.

167
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,969
But when we start, we can turn.

168
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,898
Then you guys can turn and start.

169
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,039
- Gosh, I like this. - We can switch places.

170
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,338
"This is going well. Great."

171
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,568
"It's going smoothly." That's what I thought.

172
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,578
What about this?

173
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,138
We can use the word, "ring."

174
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,679
- Like a phone is ringing. - Ring?

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,749
(Daniel Jikal suggests an idea for the hook first.)

176
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,389
The last part will be the highlight. It should be about eight bars.

177
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,289
And we can totally go with the a capella style.

178
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,359
I love it.

179
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,419
- It's great. - I...

180
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,559
- Daniel! - Daniel!

181
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,729
I think our teamwork is great.

182
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,930
The four of us are working well...

183
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,470
as a team to handle our roles.

184
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,699
It's amazing.

185
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,638
When I thought about how we were going to perform...

186
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,299
what we were practicing for the match,

187
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,609
I didn't think that we would lose.

188
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,769
"Let's just win Round One."

189
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,610
"Then we'll win Round Two no matter what."

190
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,579
It will be tough to beat us this time.

191
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,749
The rebellion of the underdogs.

192
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,579
That's what we're going to show you.

193
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,189
Round One of A League.

194
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,419
The match between Block 8 and Block 5 will begin.

195
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,490
(Round 1 of A League: Block 8 versus Block 5)

196
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,459
Every block here would have taken Block Eight.

197
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,229
Root for us.

198
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,258
- Yes. - We'll root for you.

199
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,528
- Please cheer for us. - Let's go.

200
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,529
- Good luck. - Thank you.

201
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,839
For Round One,

202
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,310
Hippie Kunda, Drain K,

203
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,609
KP, and Daniel Jikal of Block Eight will perform first.

204
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,278
- I bet this is going to be fun. - Yes!

205
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,279
- Good luck. - Let's go.

206
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,708
- Let's go. - Let's go.

207
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,180
Gosh, no gamma?

208
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,250
gamma is all alone.

209
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,388
- Yes, sir. - Come up to the stage.

210
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,790
I can't wait to see you two perform.

211
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,060
I'm sure they're going to exchange some verses.

212
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,360
(Block 8: Hippie Kunda, Drain K, KP, Daniel Jikal)

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360
Going up against Block 8 in Round 1...

214
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,929
are JP, Hash Swan,

215
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,828
Luci Gang, and Khundi Panda of Block Five.

216
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,870
Yes.

217
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,869
- Good luck. - They have to perform twice.

218
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,898
- The Fantastic Four. - Yes.

219
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,768
- This is going to be fun. - If your names are called,

220
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,040
please come up to the stage.

221
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,750
I can't wait to watch them perform.

222
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,449
There will be a duo performance between Drain K and Hippie Kunda.

223
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,589
And that will create some synergy for sure.

224
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,249
But Block Five has amazing rappers.

225
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,489
All of them are good.

226
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,259
This one will be a hard one to call.

227
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,690
Give a message to your opposing block.

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,898
Welcome to RAP:PUBLIC,

229
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,100
Block Five.

230
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,399
What was that? He caught me off guard.

231
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,370
He does sound like the host.

232
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
The next match is called...

233
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,210
Break Block Five.

234
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,408
- Gosh. - Nice.

235
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,778
Oh, my.

236
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,179
They prepared this in advance.

237
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,409
Gosh, what am I feeling?

238
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,419
Now,

239
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,219
we will guide you to purgatory.

240
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,249
Gosh, I got the chills.

241
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,518
(Devil)

242
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,659
They're dressed as devils.

243
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,460
This is weird. Their vibe isn't mixing well with mine.

244
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,899
I want the devil hoodie.

245
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm really looking forward to this.

246
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:23,570
Cringe.

247
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,370
- What? - What did you say?

248
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,440
I think he should say that in Korea.

249
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,769
My cringe tolerance just went up.

250
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,269
(His cringe tolerance goes up.)

251
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,610
It made him cringe.

252
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,048
The match between Block 8 and Block 5...

253
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,120
will begin now.

254
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,990
- I think it will be different. - We can't lower our guard.

255
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,419
I think they came up with a routine or some sort.

256
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,019
Yes, there's a formation.

257
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,759
I guess they prepared a lot for this.

258
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,200
They will show us 99' Nasty Kidz's teamwork.

259
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,269
We will be tough to beat.

260
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,898
Other blocks will just rap.

261
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,200
But we'll give them a performance too.

262
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,669
We're like a group of artists with a lot to show.

263
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,210
I bet this will be one of the best performances.

264
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,039
Ready.

265
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Let's go.

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,610
(Block 8 begins their performance for Round 1.)

267
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,278
Start.

268
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,149
Okay. DJ, drop the beat.

269
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,220
Shoot.

270
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,990
- KP, what are you up to now? - What?

271
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,329
I'm just here to have fun today.

272
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,659
Do you want to go and watch a concert?

273
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,369
Well, can't we just have fun here?

274
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,569
Okay. Nasty.

275
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,798
- One, two, three. Let's go. - One, two, three. Let's go.

276
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,038
Nasty dribble, we feel like Sonic

277
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,638
Spot the weak point, go in fast, and jump on it

278
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,138
They're knocked down after a match

279
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,168
- Here's our banter - Then my feet are on fire

280
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,038
I'm a barefoot Lakers, when I jump, I defy gravity

281
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,209
- I make buckets like Kobe - Shoot

282
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,538
I'm the sixth woman in the hip-hop scene

283
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,209
I'll be the one guarding our hoop, box out

284
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,479
Box out, and knock them down, then the audience is in a hot box

285
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,079
- Jump for a layup, pay up double - Layup, pay up

286
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,278
- Double nine - Stay up all night

287
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,849
I'm swimming on stage all year round

288
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,388
Oh, my, you'd better pray, there's a rush hour in the stadium

289
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,888
Me showing up is cheating, so even the gate is congested

290
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,119
Fans, put your hands up and sign

291
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,058
- N-A-S-T-Y, we rule the stadium - N-A-S-T-Y

292
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,558
- I take the whistle from a referee - Their teamwork is good.

293
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,158
I engrave Nasty in platinum on our team uniforms

294
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,628
My jersey number is 99, I don't take any warning

295
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,268
If anyone stands in our way, I'll smash him with my head

296
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,768
Yes, smash him with your head, we'll fly like butterflies

297
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,369
Don't even talk about the fire, you're just all talk

298
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,869
- Check out my dollars, I'm busy - One, two.

299
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,668
- I'm fair and square, they dig me - One, two, three. Let's go!

300
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm like "Oh, hey"

301
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,939
I got people going, hitting up my phone, yes

302
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,079
They'll be calling, but my tongue is busy, hey

303
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,449
- Who are you? - He's good.

304
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,049
Man, I don't know

305
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,580
- They'll be calling - He's the most energetic one.

306
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,749
- Ring - Ring, Jikal

307
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,819
- Ring - Ring, Hippie, answer the phone

308
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,928
- Ring - Ring, Daniel, put him on the phone

309
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,830
- They're using this here. - Ring, KP on the block, let's go

310
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,268
When I can't breathe, I drag myself out on purpose

311
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,638
I drink up a few bottles

312
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,038
Then I won't be miserable for a few minutes

313
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,039
He sounds so relaxed.

314
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,308
When it's over, what will I have left?

315
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,138
A street with flowers? No, the white dust that surrounds me

316
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,408
- This stupid loud noise wakes me up - He's good.

317
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:50,450
- Right. - Seoul, don't torture me like this

318
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,319
Did you get that? I'm in danger now, If I keep this up, I'll be dead soon

319
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,449
I'm all good now

320
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,450
- I haven't taken off yet - He's really good.

321
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,459
- But the sun's about to go down - He's good.

322
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
That's right

323
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:01,359
Another space, I'm all alone here

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,499
Another space, I'm all alone here

325
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,569
Walk alone

326
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,329
- Walk - Walk alone

327
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,538
- Finished - Too fly for you, okay?

328
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,499
- Okay - Two passports, blue and green

329
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,008
Check 1 and 82, In Korea now, but next stop, LA

330
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,038
Going airplane mode

331
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,479
I look at the time, but I still don't know the time zone

332
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,878
Count it up, won, yen, dollar, how confusing

333
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,909
No need to translate it, hold on

334
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,278
- I keep it coming, - I think we can beat them.

335
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,279
no wonder I've done it because

336
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,378
Everyone got me switching my tools

337
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,589
- Hey - I'm going never needing a clue

338
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,058
Better not mention my name with that mood

339
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,619
You're all acting like that, looking cool

340
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,990
A different vibe, I'm on my way up, Run with the team, and you know it

341
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,258
This is my time

342
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,758
- That's my 1, 2, 3, go - Go

343
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,058
- I'm like "Oh, hey" - Hey!

344
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,298
I got people going, hitting up my phone, yes

345
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,239
They'll be calling, but my tongue is busy, hey

346
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,869
- Because who are you? - Who are you?

347
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,470
- Man, I don't know, hey - Hey

348
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,908
They'll be calling, saying

349
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:55,048
- Ring - Ring, put KP on the phone

350
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:58,178
- Ring - Ring, answer the phone, Hippie

351
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,319
- Ring - Ring, put Daniel on the phone

352
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,788
- Ring - Ring, Jikal is a plus too

353
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,258
- Scoreboard, get in - I won't look at it, half time

354
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,859
- Designated, already - Tickets, sold out

355
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,329
- Those fools, in drama - Wrapped, for underperforming

356
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,989
- Our team, Our director - "Tenet," Nolan

357
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,128
A second before the ring

358
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,298
- Buzzer beater, still a pregame - Buzzer beater, still a pregame

359
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,329
- Grab the ball high and throw - Grab the ball high and throw

360
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,869
- Buzzer beater, still a pregame - Buzzer beater, still a pregame

361
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,128
- Grab the ball high and throw - Grab the ball high and throw

362
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,369
- The cheer gives us a shiver - The cheer gives us a shiver

363
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,370
- No looking back at the ball - No looking back at the ball

364
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:19,440
- Once it leaves my hands - Once it leaves my hands

365
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,869
- Let's go! - Let's go!

366
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,710
- Hey! - What? He's dancing too.

367
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,009
- Hey! - Shake!

368
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,278
- Hey! - Shake!

369
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,979
- Come on, let's go! - Shake!

370
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
- Shake. - Shake.

371
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,149
Well done.

372
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,048
(Block 8's performance for Round 1 is over.)

373
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,288
- Their chemistry is good. - He did twerking.

374
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,419
Great job.

375
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,429
- I saw his twerking rather late. - That was great.

376
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,990
They totally got me hyped up at the end.

377
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,759
That was way too provocative.

378
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,230
The twerking move?

379
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,240
I didn't know that he could put on a sexy move like that.

380
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:56,808
Personally, I dig KP's rap style. So I enjoyed it.

381
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,278
What Hippie Kunda and Drain K did was pretty cool.

382
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,849
But it wasn't my style.

383
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,279
But it was still pretty cool.

384
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,379
- You... - Gosh.

385
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,649
Is it because you couldn't sleep well?

386
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,990
I skipped the entire verse.

387
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,860
It made me think that I may have overestimated ourselves.

388
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,230
I messed up the lyrics. So because of my mistake,

389
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,569
we weren't able to show them...

390
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,370
the perfect performance we did during practice.

391
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,470
Gosh, for this performance,

392
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,980
we had to execute our performance perfectly.

393
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,509
I thought I wouldn't be able to watch them perform, worry-free.

394
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,850
You guys will do a little banter, right?

395
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,249
You came up with some dance moves, right?

396
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,579
Let this play

397
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Something like this.

398
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,989
We would've come up with some moves if we wanted.

399
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,418
But it would have backfired if they could tell that...

400
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,990
they came up with the moves at the last minute, so we didn't.

401
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,159
Rappers of Block Five, come up to the stage and perform.

402
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,689
I wonder what they'll do. How will they do this?

403
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,929
- Good luck. - Yes!

404
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,059
- I can't wait. - Start.

405
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,330
Are you ready?

406
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,799
Yes, sir.

407
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,139
I wonder how they'll begin.

408
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,168
Everyone knows we're good.

409
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,940
Let's have fun with it, no pressure.

410
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,809
There's a 149 percent chance that we'll win.

411
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,980
- Ready when you are. - Ready.

412
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,149
Let's not get scared. Let's just kill it.

413
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,518
(Block 5 begins performing for Round 1.)

414
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,148
Team Five, let's go. Drop it.

415
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,149
Let's go.

416
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,619
I'm glowing, I guess I'm back on my own business

417
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,119
Pictures are still the same how many times I look

418
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,258
People I barely know secretly stir up drama

419
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,298
It is what it is, you're all going to take off

420
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,798
Check it out, they're switching sides

421
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,329
Let's forget about it, just slip and slide

422
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,768
Still lonely at heart

423
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,469
We'll be bouncing one more time, my brothers

424
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,439
Where would we be at in five years? Always ask me

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,268
My price is going up all night, yes

426
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,378
I postpone my plan, sadly, I must be alone tonight

427
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,808
My small room is making me dizzy, I wish I had a little more time

428
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,079
But I'm out on this field now, I'll take you down like John Cena

429
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,048
Maybe, the knee-drop guru only told me lies

430
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,278
Mom, I'm still young, but I might be rotting away

431
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,319
That might be a lie, but I don't lie

432
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,258
Whether I'm nice or cool, don't get the wrong idea

433
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,859
I'm moving forward on my clock

434
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,388
I can just make my own Audemar too

435
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,928
It's okay, we can just make a Part Two

436
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,489
- Don't waste it, use up your energy - He's rapping nonstop.

437
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,099
March up forward, shut your torso, and go

438
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,729
I ain't got all day, I ain't playing, you fools

439
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,069
You got a long way to go, you got no chance

440
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,638
I won't even talk to you, just get lost

441
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,969
I wasn't made for this, but I'm just making it

442
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,840
- To get back home - New LV on neck

443
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,138
I collect my guards, then I run more

444
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,439
And far, my shoes will wear down again, where's insulin?

445
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,209
I put my name on it and sell, be careful, this is Venice,

446
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,849
- Gosh, this is crazy. - I know nothing, but here it goes

447
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,378
I would just laugh

448
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,918
I'd shoot down politics and skin them like Buffalo Bill

449
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,589
I'm a ballad singer when it's about love

450
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,288
Hash Swan!

451
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:28,888
Hey, forget that, who are you? Hey, there, loser

452
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,729
- I guess Reindeer, Rudolph - Reindeer, Wait

453
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,999
I need more how I Billie, I thought, "Am I Billie?"

454
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
- What is this? - I'm training for the cold winter

455
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,370
- There goes the whistle - There it goes

456
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,969
Yes, I'm in this stupid city, those cowards stick together again

457
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,508
I freeze them out on my own with my cool bosses

458
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,479
I'm still hot even with a new car, still from a million

459
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,209
I'm dozing off because it's boring, their entire lives are Photoshopped

460
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,408
There's the chroma key behind you, but hold on, I'm on TV too

461
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,849
- This is nice. - Still a snowman when ice melts

462
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,850
- Payback - Payback

463
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,548
I'm still hot, but it's my eskimo friend's mayday

464
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,058
- When we show them what's up - When we show them what's up

465
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,459
- They'll be like, 55 - They'll be like, 55

466
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,258
- When you show us what you've got - When you show us what you've got

467
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,028
- They'll be like, 55 - They'll be like, 55

468
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,499
- One, two, three, knock it - One, two, three, knock it

469
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,929
- We'll crush all 5 - We'll crush all 5

470
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,699
- Write it big on my chest, 55 - Write it big on my chest, 55

471
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,268
A penalty for a man on a pedestal, and there's no need for a run-up

472
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:16,439
You're glaring at me, But I see my boot mark clearly

473
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,578
Even when you make it up, you want something of mine

474
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,679
I can't let those hyenas take my charisma

475
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,848
With one outcome, your mind is all messed up

476
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,419
You're tunnel-visioned with eyes on the road

477
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,989
Your vision goes dark

478
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,189
Yes, I'm going to play Raps Nintendo

479
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,758
- I didn't see you there - He's solid.

480
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,288
Take this free lesson from me

481
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,659
Let your furnace blaze up, you need to ventilate when it smells

482
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,298
The reality is a mess, you look for a chance

483
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,899
But you're so lost you can't tell the ground from the sky

484
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,229
- He's crushing these beats. - You pretend to be too good for it

485
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,828
When your self-esteem goes down, you do a livestream

486
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,739
- Gosh, he's killing it. - You talk nonsense, shadow boxing

487
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,768
Throwing punches at rappers like me, that's stupid

488
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,368
- I see they hate all my sides - Sides

489
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,479
The vibe of an Internet persona, They come after my class, what?

490
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,078
I'm living the best of my life

491
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,608
- Make an effort, you already know - He's good.

492
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,179
- He's really good. - Turn off the screen, you'll see

493
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,348
Take your nonsense somewhere else

494
00:17:58,349 --> 00:17:59,949
- Fool, I'm just too big of a stud - I'm ain't playing games

495
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,118
No tricks, just treat you right

496
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,518
- I don't even start a losing game - A losing game

497
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,219
I'm from a different origin, check out my slick moves

498
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,618
Even for a street fight

499
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,358
I'm bound to be a leader like Genghis Khan

500
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,788
I get blood on my hands

501
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,558
You just talk, give excuses, and blame other people

502
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,528
- How dare you lie, it won't work - Won't work

503
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,098
You show off your money, but you're still a fraud

504
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,629
Easy come and easy go, but I stop there

505
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,199
That's it, I draw the line here

506
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,768
They say I'm like family, but go and sell me out

507
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,409
Hold on, let me talk about it

508
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,038
Having ten mouths won't be enough  for you

509
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,680
But I just need one because I'm tough

510
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,608
My time runs on my grit

511
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,278
If you can't kill it out here, just make my bed

512
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,118
My rule is, be a killer rapper, do you want to beef it up?

513
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,848
Okay, I'm eating this beat up before the blood dries away

514
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,518
- I move up, and you take pictures - She's so good.

515
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,848
Stop bothering me, and get lost to the back alley

516
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,358
- When we show them what's up - When we show them what's up

517
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,919
- That was so cool. - They'll be like, 55

518
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,558
- When you show us what you've got - When you show us what you've got

519
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,160
- They'll be like, 55 - They'll be like, 55

520
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,758
- One, two, three, knock it - One, two, three, knock it

521
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,129
- We'll crush all 5 - We'll crush all 5

522
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,298
- Write it big on my chest, 55 - Write it big on my chest, 55

523
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,999
- When we show them what's up - When we show them what's up

524
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,499
- They'll be like, 55 - They'll be like, 55

525
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,298
- When you show us what you've got - When you show us what you've got

526
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,108
- They'll be like, 55 - They'll be like, 55

527
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,368
- One, two, three, knock it - One, two, three, knock it

528
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,008
- We'll crush all 5 - All 5

529
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,479
- Write it big on my chest, 55 - Write it big on my chest, 55

530
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,979
Make some noise.

531
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,680
(Block 5's performance for Round 1 is over.)

532
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,190
- Luci Gang is good. - That was good.

533
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,349
It was new.

534
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,818
- They made a good hook. - They made a good hook.

535
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,358
I have a lot of respect for Luci Gang.

536
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,059
Her performance was great.

537
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:19,459
I think Luci Gang had a great impact.

538
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,400
As for Hash Swan,

539
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,598
whenever he comes back from the extended match,

540
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,298
he improves so much.

541
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,769
His eyes are different.

542
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:29,108
I knew Khundi raps neatly.

543
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:31,109
The collaboration with JP was great too.

544
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,179
I kept thinking, "This is it."

545
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,249
It satisfied my personal taste.

546
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,379
It was clearly a group of rap masters.

547
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,719
The monsters of rap had gathered.

548
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,889
I could also see...

549
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,190
that they were very prepared.

550
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,519
- Great job. - It was cool.

551
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,689
- It was really fun. - Great job.

552
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,559
You prepared a lot.

553
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,499
You prepared too much.

554
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,828
- We didn't show enough. - A League, Round One.

555
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:58,299
The match between Block 8 and Block 5 ended.

556
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,410
We will now begin the vote.

557
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,108
(The voting begins.)

558
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,379
Who do I vote for?

559
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,509
The two teams were so different.

560
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,380
I made up my mind.

561
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,980
Vote, everyone

562
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,220
- Vote - Vote

563
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,789
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

564
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,559
What?

565
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,930
Goodness.

566
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,629
Their individual abilities...

567
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,630
It is amazing.

568
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,268
They really did well.

569
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,469
From the moment Hash Swan entered the beat...

570
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,339
- It was over. - Right.

571
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,980
I think they performed a better show.

572
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,578
But I thought Luci Gang was cooler.

573
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,319
She had a big impact.

574
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,518
Block Five left the strongest impression.

575
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,259
I think the four of them were really great.

576
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:54,660
How...

577
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:57,828
There were only four people in Block Five.

578
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,528
I think they really prepared themselves well.

579
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:04,369
It seemed like they trusted each other very much.

580
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:09,410
So I had the confidence that they would do really well.

581
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,739
The stage was delicious since the main dishes kept coming.

582
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,879
They showed us their raps.

583
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,508
Block Five's rap sticks in my memory.

584
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,920
The reason Block Eight lost...

585
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,249
was because they didn't seem...

586
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,449
like one group.

587
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,359
The two were in one group before.

588
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,759
The two and the other two seemed to be separate.

589
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,859
KP and Daniel Jikal were featured.

590
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,730
It felt like they were there to help.

591
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,298
I think the block couldn't catch up with the two people's teamwork.

592
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,969
- Well done. - Well done.

593
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,038
- Thank you. - Good job.

594
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,470
- Well done. - Great job.

595
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,339
It's a bit sad.

596
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,179
They really did well.

597
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,680
- Thank you. - Let's go.

598
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,079
Well done. Good job.

599
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,348
I think Block Five was on point.

600
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,289
They were smart, and they pulled it off well.

601
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,920
- Did it have to be like this? - We slipped on the words a lot.

602
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,259
We were the main performers, but we slipped on the words a lot.

603
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,660
The verses were good.

604
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,929
We should have been perfect.

605
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,098
It was a stage where these small mistakes...

606
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,230
worked in great dynamics.

607
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,399
I felt a mixture of sadness, disappointment,

608
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
regret, and everything. It was weird.

609
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,180
Honestly, it was very disappointing.

610
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,309
Our block couldn't perform as well as we did in our practice.

611
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,719
It's the happiness from a victory we've not tasted before.

612
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,078
That's right. It's really annoying.

613
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,119
You did well.

614
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,490
Did I?

615
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:32,859
Actually, when the time comes,

616
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,229
even if I think we're going to win,

617
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,160
I also think, "I don't know about this."

618
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,529
But when the results came up, I thought, "That's a relief."

619
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,999
- We won't stop. - We won't stop.

620
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,369
- We shouldn't be satisfied here. - I'll crush them all.

621
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,380
(Block Tournament: A League)

622
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,579
A League, Round One.

623
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,308
The match between Block 6 and Block 7 begins.

624
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,318
(Block Tournament: A League, Round 1)

625
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,949
- Let's go. - This will be interesting.

626
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,650
The starter of Round One...

627
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,389
are Block Six's Mckdaddy, Kaogaii,

628
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,588
Jo Gwang Il, and Kohway.

629
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,529
- Yes. - Let's go!

630
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,459
That's strong.

631
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,499
That's really strong.

632
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,969
- Let's go. - Let's go.

633
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,469
There is no Round 2 if we lose in Round 1.

634
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,269
So our strategy was to go strong...

635
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,569
in Round One.

636
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,979
Feel like I'm boss, dumok in Korean

637
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,739
What's the use of feeling it, You don't know it

638
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,809
I'm not going home today either, It might be my last time

639
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,078
It's good.

640
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,518
This verse is really good.

641
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,848
Mckdaddy raps really well.

642
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,689
I was happy that he came.

643
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,689
I think Mcdaddy, Gwang Il,

644
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,858
Kohway, and I should go on Round One.

645
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:46,298
The importance of the result of Round 1 was about 80 percent.

646
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,669
So honestly, we tried to start strong.

647
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,499
It's the first match after I switched teams.

648
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,868
So I want to do much better.

649
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,969
We should win against Block Five that we'd meet next and win.

650
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,838
That would be our goal.

651
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,839
What BPM are they strong in?

652
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,078
We can't do boom bap with them.

653
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,779
We can't do boom bap.

654
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,149
But the BPM range of 120 to 150 isn't their strong area.

655
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,019
- Really? That's great. - But...

656
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,818
the only person who's good at that with many verses is Hash Swan.

657
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,459
I wanted to show them...

658
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,200
that adding me to their team wasn't the wrong choice.

659
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,230
Hey.

660
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,028
How is it being here compared to being there? What's better?

661
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,200
The energy is different.

662
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,508
Block Five is calm...

663
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,809
and quiet.

664
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:34,210
It's like a graduate school of rap.

665
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,049
And Block Six was like a kindergarten.

666
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,048
I show them

667
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,219
Do you like this rhythm? Don't leave your shoulders still

668
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,588
With you like birthday

669
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:44,890
- Itaewon or Hongdae - The camera is turning.

670
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,489
- Rap... - It turned away.

671
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,490
Do it again.

672
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,029
Boy feeling like Ji Sung Park

673
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,568
I'll blend in well like I was always there...

674
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,269
and do my part.

675
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,439
Block Six, we top, Go home if you got it

676
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,169
Block Six on top

677
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,240
But this...

678
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,308
I think we need an easier word...

679
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,278
- that could make the crowd chant. - Is it a bit difficult?

680
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,949
I think it's this.

681
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,679
Block Six, we pop that thing

682
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,088
Block Six, we pop that thing

683
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,849
Pop that, pop that thing

684
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,858
Block Six, we pop that thing, We pop, pop

685
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,159
What about that?

686
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,788
This is better.

687
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,729
- We'll each go. - Pop that thing, we pop, pop

688
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,868
- Welcome back - It's done.

689
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,798
Darn. It's done.

690
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,839
It works.

691
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,239
What I've learned while doing the missions...

692
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,869
is that rapping well has become a basic thing now.

693
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:40,308
We need to show something more to that...

694
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,779
to make people vote for us.

695
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:43,079
Hey.

696
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,579
We'll win. I think we'll win.

697
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,750
When you reach the hook,

698
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,989
you have to pour in everything.

699
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,518
Block six, we pop that thing

700
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,189
Block, we pop that thing, let's go

701
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,528
Pop that thing

702
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:57,390
In the process of practicing,

703
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,230
I'm getting more satisfied that I came to this team.

704
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,900
The atmosphere is really great.

705
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,798
- Block Six, we pop that thing - Okay!

706
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,499
Block Six, we pop that thing

707
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,298
- Pop, pop - Pop, pop

708
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,109
The concept of our stage today is just to smash.

709
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,578
We're performing on stage,

710
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,049
but it's not our stage, it's yours.

711
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,949
I have no worries before starting the stage.

712
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,049
Let's go.

713
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,880
Down.

714
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,419
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

715
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,519
- Let's go. - Let's go.

716
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,288
- Let's just perform. - Okay.

717
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,319
Let's get it.

718
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,588
We definitely can win Round One.

719
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,889
I can bet all my money on that.

720
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,328
We'll definitely win Round One.

721
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,930
I'm done adapting.

722
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,569
I'll show them for sure.

723
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,439
It's Mckdaddy's debut stage in Block Six.

724
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,500
Go slay them.

725
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,409
- Slay them. - We'll slay them. Don't worry.

726
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,710
We'll crush them.

727
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,579
The opposers of Round One...

728
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,848
are Block Seven's Owen, Double Down,

729
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:52,979
Marv, and Foggyatthebottom.

730
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Let's go.

731
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,019
- It's a good one. - I know.

732
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,788
They all chose the best rappers.

733
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,660
That's crazy.

734
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,630
Overall,

735
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,799
all our team members are very confident.

736
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,259
We'll definitely win.

737
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,828
I don't know who'll win here.

738
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:11,839
Seriously.

739
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,700
Honestly,

740
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:17,210
I thought the blocks with the worst compatibility met.

741
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,778
The team with the worst compatibility...

742
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:23,250
and the team with the strongest compatibility.

743
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,319
They're the worst match for us.

744
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,318
And that could be seen...

745
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,489
when we started practicing.

746
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,548
(Block 7 during the practice for Block Tournament)

747
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,018
Did it go well?

748
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,420
(The members of Block 7 practice on their own.)

749
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,858
I'm Nash Kot, when I get up

750
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,730
I prepared well.

751
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,399
So I told everyone...

752
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,768
that I want to be on both rounds.

753
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:47,140
I want to go both times if the situation allows.

754
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,909
I'll make us win.

755
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,269
Okay?

756
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,608
It'll be fun. I'm so excited.

757
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,679
This is more interesting.

758
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,509
I think stage manners will be important since it's a performance.

759
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,979
Rapping while lifting one person.

760
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,278
Rapping on top if possible.

761
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,518
- Lifting one person? - Lifting one person.

762
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,619
- Here... Dance time. - Who?

763
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,259
- Dance? - Yes. Introduction.

764
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,690
I think we could put "Rap like this" at the end. That would be great.

765
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,389
I can do them both. I can do well in both.

766
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,930
I'm smart, indeed.

767
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,269
(Meanwhile, Chaboom is deep in thought.)

768
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,740
I had been forgetting about the deathmatch.

769
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,939
I won't choose MOON and Foggyatthebottom this time...

770
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,509
even if we go to a deathmatch.

771
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,239
I already did it. So...

772
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,048
But we will win.

773
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,910
- We should win. - Actually, Chaboom...

774
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,980
said he wouldn't choose...

775
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,019
those he chose last time as elimination candidates.

776
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,690
He last chose Owen, MOON, and Foggyatthebottom.

777
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,959
Those he didn't choose in the team...

778
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,460
were Double Down and me.

779
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,969
But Double Down and I didn't do so bad...

780
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,200
in the previous match to be eliminated.

781
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,670
I had lots of thoughts after hearing that.

782
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,740
I clenched on the bottle I was holding.

783
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,779
I felt angry.

784
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,108
I thought I should talk with him.

785
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,508
Could we talk?

786
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,778
I had something in my mind.

787
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,119
I wanted to clear it.

788
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,919
You said you wouldn't choose the people you chose before.

789
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,990
Actually, I don't understand.

790
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,588
I think it's something different...

791
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,729
- from what you understand. - Right. That's true.

792
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,058
I think this was the worst decision...

793
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,200
I made after I became the leader.

794
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,970
I was sure we would win in the new competition.

795
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,900
I was a fool. A leader shouldn't have done that.

796
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,569
I'll set a clear rule.

797
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,338
At first, we didn't know each other, and we didn't know our raps.

798
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,480
So I couldn't make a decision. But I can now.

799
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:37,209
That was because we had the previous result.

800
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,219
And I want to keep it up.

801
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,250
Whether I'm the leader or not.

802
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,190
I think this is most fair.

803
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:46,089
This was right. And Chaboom...

804
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,119
wasn't a headstrong person.

805
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,858
He had changed his decision after listening to us.

806
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,970
And the changed rule was plenty understandable.

807
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,739
If I stumbled on a lot of words,

808
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,339
and there was even a little bit of reasoning,

809
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,108
I'm ready to go for the deathmatch.

810
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,039
I was confident.

811
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,439
I think we will win if it goes as planned.

812
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,910
The important thing is that we should win.

813
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,719
Winning is important.

814
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Let's do that.

815
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,719
(Block 7 gets back to their practice after hearing Chaboom's decision.)

816
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,848
That, we can just...

817
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,959
I'll do this next to you.

818
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,719
Shark, shark

819
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,429
Hey, we got it!

820
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,629
- This is nice. - Good.

821
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,629
This is nice. Is it 20,000 dollars?

822
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,400
I don't think it's impossible.

823
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,298
- Everybody say shark, shark - Shark, shark

824
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,640
The remaining three could do that together.

825
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,240
So, everybody say it first time.

826
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,480
I thought we would definitely win if it went as we practiced.

827
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,210
We're going to beat you.

828
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,309
Block number six.

829
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,079
Bring whoever. Let's run it.

830
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,650
(Block 6 versus Block 7)

831
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,849
The two teams have different styles.

832
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,660
We aren't interested, and we don't care...

833
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,759
who our opponents are.

834
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,828
We just came to perform today.

835
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:03,170
We prepared with that mindset.

836
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,299
They're saying that because they're scared.

837
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,639
You're very stressed...

838
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,839
and very tired.

839
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,139
We'll crush all of that.

840
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,250
Thank you.

841
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,750
- Crush that. Good. - Crush that.

842
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,119
Did Kaogaii say that?

843
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,720
Beep.

844
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,289
Now,

845
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:31,190
the match between Block 6 and Block 7 will begin.

846
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,298
- Yes. - Let's go.

847
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,528
Let's go.

848
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:35,529
It will be fun.

849
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,569
(Block 6 versus Block 7)

850
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,339
They're separated into pairs.

851
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,808
They split into two pairs.

852
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:44,809
I guess they'll come one by one.

853
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,940
Not bad.

854
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,609
Let's do what we always did.

855
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,609
- Okay. - Let's go.

856
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,119
It's cool.

857
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,159
- Yes. - Mckdaddy!

858
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,430
I'm on a new way, everyone.

859
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,229
- Yes. - Let's go!

860
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,230
Yes.

861
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:08,798
You're not a savage, though

862
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,499
Very busy, I have to go again

863
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,068
I have to reward myself

864
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,739
I have a reward, you have a punishment, that's different

865
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,368
I go ahead, so I'm anxious every day

866
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,068
Look, my future is evident to the maximum

867
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,709
Look, my future is evident to the maximum

868
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,880
If you want to compare, I'm the opposite of you

869
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,449
I want and do as I want

870
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,209
It becomes as I want, What are you doing and where?

871
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,078
I have to wear Gucci underwear under Gucci belts

872
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,479
I'll be buried with it

873
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,249
Just die if you'll just roam around

874
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,818
Trust me, you can't go to church

875
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,019
I'm too arrogant, I ignore the messages of women

876
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,959
My career improves, I suffocate, my work multiplies

877
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,189
No gun in my hands, shooter

878
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,598
Feel like I'm a boss, Dumok in Korean

879
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,598
I do it again if I feel it, You don't know it

880
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,129
She doesn't want to go home

881
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,368
Is she not going home again?

882
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,368
She might be able to see my last

883
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,969
Block Six, we pop that thing

884
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,639
Block Six, we pop that thing

885
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,278
Block Six, we pop that thing

886
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,939
Pop, pop

887
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,508
Block Six, we pop that thing

888
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,249
Block Six, we pop that thing

889
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,879
Block Six, we pop that thing

890
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,318
Pop, pop

891
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,088
Welcome, I hear money when Baek Han Sol comes

892
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,919
My voice gets heard in 15 minutes

893
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,758
The one who sold cigarettes in the streets

894
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,088
Is taking care of his young ones

895
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,758
- They have a character. - Earn and don't act like it

896
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,489
Just spend it on drinks with my people

897
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,129
Old men who want to be respected

898
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,230
They should shut it and open their wallets

899
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,130
- It's done. - It's over

900
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,139
BLASE went peace out, Kaogaii came in

901
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,108
My life is too expensive to shut my mouth

902
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:24,038
- Mixing down on the beat like that - It's good.

903
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,739
I don't eat if it's not my meal, if it's worth my pay

904
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,979
I don't give in

905
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,578
But I do if I want

906
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,048
- He's good. - He's good.

907
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:33,549
Swinging the national flag as always

908
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,548
The dampings are crazy here.

909
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,549
- I know. - The flag coolness covers it all

910
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,919
You're like a hero in porno, The rappers become fools

911
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,489
They back out if you meet them in real life

912
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,229
My front and back are the same, 1577

913
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,889
Block Six, we pop that thing

914
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,528
Block Six, we pop that thing

915
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:48,229
Block Six, we pop that thing

916
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,798
Pop, pop

917
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,568
Block Six, we pop that thing

918
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,139
Block Six, we pop that thing

919
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,798
Block Six, we pop that thing

920
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,969
Pop, pop

921
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,308
I grow back after so many failures

922
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,508
I just do it as I feel and lose the rotten things

923
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:01,338
After time, what they did was

924
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,778
- Changing their names than rap - He's amazing.

925
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:04,379
Check this out, underground king

926
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,018
Why do you force it in, It's dry

927
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,649
If you hold it upside down they all fall

928
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,218
They're just yarn called skin and smoke

929
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,988
Come here all, I'll give you the mic

930
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,459
Just speak without anything

931
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,859
More, kah grrr bang

932
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,189
Talk here and there and spit it all out in rap

933
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,788
Those who learned for fun all leave and fall on our faces

934
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,428
The things that poured out, the effort

935
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,629
Hold their hands up in defeat

936
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,058
It's too clear to be set

937
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,999
It's on my tongue, Living away is still not comfortable

938
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,169
I work hard to make money

939
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,999
- Sinkhole in my lungs - How does he do that?

940
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,198
Make the rappers who cause trouble to live only a day

941
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,609
So that they won't ever return

942
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,638
Half the day is complaint

943
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,808
- Your show - Only Gwang Il can do this.

944
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:36,280
I don't know what you'll teach, I point to the top above the clouds

945
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,150
- Yes - Oh, my.

946
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,948
Late night studio, party on the weekend

947
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,749
It's not even half done, It's to the world

948
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,589
Write the history like Skull

949
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,518
I know it's time for me to get what's mine

950
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,819
Give and take

951
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,360
I don't care how long it takes, I do it in the end

952
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,029
Block Six, we pop that thing

953
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,799
Block Six, we pop that thing

954
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,428
Block Six, we pop that thing

955
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,098
Pop, pop

956
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,729
Block Six, we pop that thing

957
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,399
Block Six, we pop that thing

958
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,968
Block Six, we pop that thing

959
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,808
- Pop, pop - Pop, pop

960
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,439
Block Six, we pop that thing

961
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,178
Block Six, we pop that thing

962
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,908
Block Six, we pop that thing

963
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,678
- Pop, pop - Pop, pop

964
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,348
Block Six, we pop that thing

965
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,149
Block Six, we pop that thing

966
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,919
Block Six, we pop that thing

967
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,518
- Pop, pop - Pop, pop

968
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,789
Make some noise!

969
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,459
Block Six, we pop that thing

970
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,659
- What? - Pop, pop

971
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,989
(Make some noise!)

972
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Good job.

973
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:30,300
Yes!

974
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:33,840
Great.

975
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,840
That was great. It was a solid performance.

976
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,109
It was good.

977
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,738
- It was really good. - It was great.

978
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,779
It was great.

979
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,849
It was crazy.

980
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,308
It's a music piece.

981
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,819
It was energetic.

982
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,149
It was a refreshing rap...

983
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,448
- I know. - that shook the ears.

984
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,289
It was powerful.

985
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,689
- It was manly. - Totally.

986
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,129
The boldness of Kohway...

987
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,530
doesn't make sense.

988
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,229
Kohway's energy is no joke.

989
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,058
It turns everyone up.

990
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,529
I loved that energy.

991
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,098
The stage woke me up.

992
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,969
It was so much fun.

993
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:10,308
I thought I was in a show.

994
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,038
They clarified the "pop, pop."

995
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,079
They brought a hook that was simple but also hyped us.

996
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,879
They created a cool performance...

997
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,449
in a short time with good teamwork.

998
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,320
- You did so well. - You nailed it.

999
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,260
It was incredible. It was so good.

1000
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:27,820
We can make it more fun.

1001
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,590
We felt intimidated after watching the performance.

1002
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,328
It was very well planned.

1003
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,599
The movements were very thorough.

1004
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,029
The hook was very easy to sing along to.

1005
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,069
Everyone sang along.

1006
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,569
Pop, pop

1007
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,570
They did better than we thought.

1008
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,908
The opposing rappers, please come up to the stage.

1009
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:47,980
Let's go.

1010
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,908
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1011
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:50,980
Finally.

1012
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,619
I'm really looking forward to this.

1013
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,118
- We don't know about this. - But Double Down and Foggy...

1014
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,719
It was their beat.

1015
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,460
I feel blood in the water.

1016
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,690
Let's go.

1017
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:05,699
I'm curious.

1018
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,099
We're not behind in rap and the verses.

1019
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,869
The only thing I paid attention to was the hook.

1020
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,269
The hook will blow everything.

1021
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:16,940
Let's go.

1022
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,980
Start.

1023
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,389
How will they do this?

1024
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:33,959
Did what you asked for, so what?

1025
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,629
What's it that you don't understand?

1026
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,828
Why do you find the problem from far? The ending is the same

1027
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,098
- Scapegoat, someone to blame - He's good.

1028
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,598
Seeking respect, doesn't work that way

1029
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,428
- Unless we got mutual respect - He's really good.

1030
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,928
Before you're quick to judge and assume

1031
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,800
My attitude, I suggest I look for your weakness first

1032
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,638
I don't spit on smiling faces

1033
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,439
I'm clear in separating my enemies with my team

1034
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,069
- Social misfits, screw that - Screw that

1035
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,738
Cut that tongue, bring that back

1036
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,408
Spitting goated flow, go top that

1037
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,879
European clothes, I don't cap that

1038
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
- Right in front of Block Six. - Tracksuit, head to toe

1039
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Call me pothead

1040
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:00,218
Guys who pretend, I smoke them

1041
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,749
It's troublesome, a brazen attitude

1042
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,750
A brazen attitude

1043
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,049
- Dong Hyun on these like a stun gun - Come down and rap.

1044
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,089
Burn

1045
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,518
Turnt up, work up a pound

1046
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,189
It's litty, eye lows, but my head doing great

1047
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,729
I don't worry, loud, no kizzy

1048
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,999
It's still burning, my passion isn't dead

1049
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,328
- I'm a shark - I'm a shark

1050
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:16,428
- Everybody is seafood - Seafood

1051
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,698
- I'm a shark - I'm a shark

1052
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,669
- Everybody is sushi - Sushi

1053
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,299
- I'm the real rapper - Rapper

1054
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,968
- You're a groupie - Groupie

1055
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,368
- Shark - Shark

1056
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,779
- Everybody, say... - Shark

1057
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,078
- Shark - Shark

1058
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,249
- Shark - Shark

1059
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,249
- Shark - Shark

1060
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,518
- Shark - Shark

1061
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,558
Shark

1062
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,718
Feel like I'm a deity, almighty

1063
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,788
Drowsy eyes and drooping pupil

1064
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:43,828
I'm on the NASCAR

1065
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,058
- To overtake I risk my life - I love this tone.

1066
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,899
Who is finessing me? My days are packed

1067
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,328
Point out the rat, I keep eyeing

1068
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,129
He has that thing on now, the silver bracelet

1069
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,368
See that? I was right

1070
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:54,169
The table is full of money, goodness

1071
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,369
Divide it fair as if bewitched, I'm busy doing ball

1072
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,340
Just learn your work

1073
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,340
Deal with the evil being

1074
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,178
- I'm about to die - He made a mistake.

1075
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,249
Everything I do hits a home run, and I'll build it

1076
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,348
YB bears instead of OB

1077
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,979
The score gap is too wide, it's cruel, and it won't get called

1078
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,089
Owen did so well earlier.

1079
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,319
I abandon first then get abandoned

1080
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,959
I need nobody but the All Mighty

1081
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,689
I was a BEAST like Yoon Du Jun

1082
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,260
But I'm in the highlight

1083
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:19,299
Watch my prime time, boomsharkalaka

1084
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,359
- I'm a shark - Shark

1085
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,598
- Everybody is seafood - Seafood

1086
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,828
I'm a shark

1087
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,340
- Everybody is sushi - Sushi

1088
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,109
- You're a groupie - Groupie

1089
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,408
- Shark - Shark

1090
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,848
- Shark - Shark

1091
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,149
- Shark - Shark

1092
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,319
- Shark - Shark

1093
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,149
- Shark - Foggyatthebottom!

1094
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,718
- Shark - Shark

1095
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,760
Everybody who's here...

1096
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,388
Before I tell you my intention

1097
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,229
- Take that guy to the doctor's - He got it wrong.

1098
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,928
The trial is in July

1099
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:55,530
- I can't sleep the night before - Before

1100
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:58,968
The bigger the bet, the easier I get released, and it's obvious

1101
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:02,268
Don't stop, I'm going to take an Uber to the hoovers

1102
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:06,138
Stood out, my friends are not spiders, and that trooper

1103
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,009
The kiddo's neck becomes stiff when they see me

1104
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,979
You pointed at the wrong person

1105
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,408
- You're dead now - Dead now

1106
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,518
- Shark - Shark

1107
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,819
- Shark - Shark

1108
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,058
- Shark - Shark

1109
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:25,159
- Shark - Shark

1110
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:32,469
Cheers, my homies.

1111
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:37,069
- Did Double Down only do the hook? - He only did the hook.

1112
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,569
It's addicting.

1113
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,880
The ignorance is funny.

1114
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,879
- Owen's first verse was intense. - Yes, it was.

1115
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,549
- He should've gone last. - I know, right?

1116
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,819
Owen always kills it.

1117
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,388
You can't discuss his skills taste-wise.

1118
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:54,389
He's just someone who's good.

1119
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,689
The second half was disappointing.

1120
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,030
They were unstable in the second half.

1121
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,428
- We won. - We did.

1122
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,499
- We won. - Get ready.

1123
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,860
We won.

1124
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,529
Block Seven's stage? Honestly, it was good.

1125
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,569
But personally, I felt...

1126
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,769
it was dull.

1127
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,599
And I could spot their mistakes.

1128
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,738
(Starting with Marv,)

1129
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:16,480
(even Foggyatthebottom made a mistake.)

1130
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,079
I thought, "Wait. We won."

1131
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,349
We will now begin the vote.

1132
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,119
What did you think, Don Mills?

1133
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,518
Well...

1134
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,690
Both were fun but in different senses.

1135
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
They have good teamwork.

1136
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:32,388
- I agree. - Block Six has good teamwork.

1137
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,629
- Block Six, we pop that thing - Block Six, we pop that thing

1138
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,468
- Block Six, we pop that - We pop that

1139
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:38,170
- Isn't their order great? - You're right.

1140
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:39,969
They gave the highlight part to Jo Gwang Il.

1141
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,198
It was systematic and solid.

1142
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,368
No parts were boring.

1143
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,880
All they did was change their past names, not rap

1144
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,408
Which Block do you like more?

1145
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:49,509
Considering the mistakes, Block Six did better.

1146
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,449
You're right. They were well made.

1147
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,319
Block Seven had better rap.

1148
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,888
- But they made too many mistakes. - They made mistakes.

1149
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,449
Choosing them isn't right.

1150
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,848
We messed up a couple of times.

1151
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,388
So I feel like it's going to apply to the result.

1152
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,460
We can't lose.

1153
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,659
The result of the vote will be revealed.

1154
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,130
Come to us.

1155
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,900
Victory, come to us.

1156
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,670
- I become a nervous wreck. - Me too.

1157
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,239
My hands are shaking.

1158
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:22,709
If the rappers voted fairly, it's us who will win.

1159
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,179
We will win, period.

1160
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:28,250
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

1161
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:33,289
(Block 6 wins with 21 votes. Block 7 loses with 10 votes.)

1162
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,489
Yes!

1163
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:37,558
- Great work. - Yes!

1164
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,659
Okay!

1165
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,828
Good job.

1166
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,069
How about a hug?

1167
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,669
- Here's the result of Round 1... - Block 6 is the best!

1168
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,669
of A League's match between Block 6 and Block 7.

1169
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,109
The block to advance to Round Two...

1170
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,339
is Block Six.

1171
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,079
Block Six is the best!

1172
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,109
It felt great.

1173
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,018
After I calmed myself down from the excitement,

1174
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:04,189
I was confident we could win in Round Two.

1175
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,788
"We can do it."

1176
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,158
"It's not a big deal."

1177
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,730
That's what we told each other.

1178
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,360
Rap as you did earlier.

1179
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,598
High five, JOONIE. You can do it.

1180
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,598
I knew we were going to win Round One.

1181
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,000
As expected from them, they were reliable.

1182
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,199
It was my turn.

1183
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,570
I needed to do my share.

1184
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:25,710
(Break time after the result announcement)

1185
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,448
I thought we would win.

1186
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:31,750
But we lost by a lot of votes. It annoyed me.

1187
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,989
We should accept the result.

1188
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:42,558
I simply wanted Marv to accept the result.

1189
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,789
I wanted him to want to do better next time.

1190
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,428
Our rap was better.

1191
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:49,158
But what we lacked...

1192
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,399
was the impact.

1193
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,968
- That's it. - And the formation.

1194
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,799
It felt more like...

1195
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,808
a cypher than a performance.

1196
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:00,078
I watched you guys from down here.

1197
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,479
Let me tell you clearly.

1198
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,809
First, there were many mistakes.

1199
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,349
In the first hook, everyone went wild.

1200
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:07,880
It was like we won.

1201
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,189
But when it was Marv's turn...

1202
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,118
and he made a mistake, our block became unstable.

1203
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,788
Foggyatthebottom's mistake killed it.

1204
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:17,529
But even in the hook right before him, no one was in sync...

1205
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,190
when they should've been.

1206
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,159
Our energy died right then and there.

1207
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,129
There's only one cause.

1208
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,499
And it was our mistake.

1209
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,730
Other than that, everything was fine.

1210
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,169
Here's what I couldn't understand.

1211
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,669
If he made a mistake, Marv should've just accepted it.

1212
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,308
But he kept going on about other things...

1213
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:33,808
like the stage formation.

1214
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,610
He didn't stop.

1215
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,750
We'll prove it.

1216
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:41,449
We can prove it. Don't be emotional.

1217
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,320
I'm not being emotional.

1218
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,690
Rather than talking about how things were,

1219
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,090
let's talk about what we can do from now on.

1220
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,389
Just focus on that.

1221
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,630
Guys. If we get asked to do Round Two...

1222
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:55,959
Out of our performances,

1223
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,768
is there anything we can improve right now?

1224
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:00,070
Did you not hear what I just said?

1225
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,069
- But what I meant was... - Did you not hear me?

1226
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,468
I did. I heard everything.

1227
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,379
What did I say we should focus on?

1228
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,538
On what we can do from now on.

1229
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,409
That was why I asked the question.

1230
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,949
I said that was all we had to focus on.

1231
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,488
- Why are you being so aggressive? - If you're confident.

1232
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,349
- Why are you being so aggressive? - If you're confident.

1233
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,860
You're coming across as mean to me right now.

1234
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:23,658
Are you listening to me?

1235
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:25,329
I am, Owen.

1236
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,559
Are you?

1237
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,599
I have high expectations of you.

1238
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,929
Are you really listening to me?

1239
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,500
When I'm still willing to listen to you,

1240
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,440
know your limit and stop.

1241
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:38,969
Got it?

1242
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:44,679
Am I saying this out of ill feelings?

1243
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,780
Am I?

1244
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,380
Am I saying this because I hate you and I find you annoying?

1245
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:53,420
I'm saying this for your good image.

1246
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm sorry.

1247
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,300
Let's stop.

1248
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:03,900
I need to use the restroom.

1249
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,440
Seriously, this is so dumb.

1250
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,138
What's wrong, Owen?

1251
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,940
I can see my past self in him.

1252
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,110
- In who? Marv? - Yes, my little brother.

1253
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:22,049
The message I want to convey changes when put into words.

1254
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,050
I wonder what my problem is.

1255
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:27,019
I don't want to behave like this either.

1256
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,259
I thought we'd win, but we lost.

1257
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,760
It's really...

1258
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,860
I can't...

1259
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,929
communicate with the block members.

1260
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,939
I memorized a lot of verses.

1261
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,380
- You did. - I was willing to sacrifice myself.

1262
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,409
Doing that, preparing two stages, made me make mistakes.

1263
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,018
That caused us to lose, turning me into the bad guy.

1264
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,019
I...

1265
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,619
It's a vicious cycle.

1266
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,690
I'm doing my best.

1267
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,460
But the results show the opposite.

1268
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:09,800
(Block Tournament: A League)

1269
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:13,198
The Blocks that advanced to Round Two in A League...

1270
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,439
are Block 6 and Block 5.

1271
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,969
- Yes! - Let's go!

1272
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:21,110
The starter of Round 2 is Block 6.

1273
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,279
- JOONIE, O'Domar, - Good luck.

1274
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,848
and Geegooin.

1275
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:26,550
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1276
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:28,150
Last but not least. It's Geegooin.

1277
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,750
He might do the hook.

1278
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,518
The opposers of Round Two are...

1279
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,959
JP, Hash Swan,

1280
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,690
Luci Gang, and Khundi Panda.

1281
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:37,829
Good luck!

1282
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,389
- Let's go! - Let's go one more time!

1283
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,530
Because our block killed the stage earlier,

1284
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:44,570
we'll light it on fire this time.

1285
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,440
As expected from Professor Gee.

1286
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:48,670
- Professor! - Neat.

1287
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,308
He even prepared something to say.

1288
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,440
No. I made it on the spot. It was freestyle.

1289
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,109
We didn't prepare anything.

1290
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,239
(Laughing)

1291
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,509
Yes!

1292
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,118
The Block Match between...

1293
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,519
Block 6 and Block 5 will begin.

1294
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:04,849
Please.

1295
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:06,960
I'm dead nervous.

1296
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:11,360
(Block 6 during the Block Formation)

1297
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,760
JOONIE?

1298
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:15,328
There will be a time...

1299
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:17,369
when we'll need maximum members.

1300
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,769
Someone has to get eliminated.

1301
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,309
Little did I want her on my team.

1302
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,039
We can ditch her later.

1303
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:27,840
JOONIE.

1304
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,079
Our ditching card.

1305
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,009
- Did she agree to it? - JOONIE?

1306
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,510
She does whatever I tell her to do.

1307
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,849
A rapper who can do better is JOONIE.

1308
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:36,619
JOONIE.

1309
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:38,288
(During the Block Breaker)

1310
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,059
She got the verses wrong.

1311
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,260
Was that a mistake?

1312
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,690
I think it was.

1313
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,629
What we're worried about is...

1314
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,158
how we use JOONIE will determine...

1315
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,429
whether we win or lose.

1316
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,269
Let's use that strategy. The JOONIE strategy.

1317
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,900
What is it?

1318
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,610
Starting the performance without a beat. She'll rap with no music.

1319
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:59,440
I'm sorry, but your voice is weak.

1320
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:03,210
- She won't make it. - No.

1321
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,109
Either way, improving on...

1322
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,848
JOONIE's vocals...

1323
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:09,178
so we can hear her verses with the beat...

1324
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,349
is almost impossible right now.

1325
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
Here's the thing.

1326
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:14,559
Even if three do well, we'll gain...

1327
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,558
the biggest disadvantage...

1328
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,189
if one messes it up as it's a team mission.

1329
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,299
- JOONIE. - Yes?

1330
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,629
Here's what you should think about from now on.

1331
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,169
Think about what would look the coolest...

1332
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,670
- The coolest... - without any music.

1333
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,038
Consider this too.

1334
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,369
If you make a mistake,

1335
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,908
hand it over like, "It's okay. My guys will kill it."

1336
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,368
"Okay, let's go!"

1337
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,380
That'll be awesome.

1338
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,078
I felt a lot of pressure.

1339
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,510
It's the opening. But say that I mess it up.

1340
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:42,719
I'll feel terrible and won't be able to face my block members.

1341
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,149
If we're not careful with the no music rap,

1342
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,319
JOONIE's part will be cringey.

1343
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Are you against it?

1344
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,018
- I'm not too sure about it. - I see.

1345
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,988
JOONIE feels the pressure too.

1346
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:52,328
In the worst case scenario,

1347
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:55,129
a -music rap can be a disaster.

1348
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,900
The high spirit is the key.

1349
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:58,269
I'll try without music.

1350
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,069
The beginning, this is my time

1351
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,609
Don't you dare put me in your limits

1352
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,609
Do I look easy because I'm an idol?

1353
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,940
That's funny, who are you to judge me?

1354
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:10,709
"Do I look easy because I'm an idol?"

1355
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,348
Can you start from there again?

1356
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:14,618
The energy goes up right then and there.

1357
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,848
If you know it won't be cringey, go for it.

1358
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,549
If not,

1359
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,988
it will look neater if you rap with the beat...

1360
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,260
- after the light hits you. - He's right.

1361
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,488
- If it flops, it'll flop bad. - Right.

1362
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:26,030
How is it? How's the preparation?

1363
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:27,459
JOONIE.

1364
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,698
We'll use her in the introduction.

1365
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:29,699
- Are you okay with that? - Yes.

1366
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,599
- We have no other choice. - No.

1367
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,769
We have to use her. Let's give it a shot.

1368
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,769
My block members are very worried about me.

1369
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,880
I feel bad for them.

1370
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,979
I want to be of help,

1371
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,480
but I'm doing the block damage.

1372
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,380
I'll prove that I'm a useful member.

1373
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:51,849
I'm going to sleep.

1374
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,719
- Did you eat? - Oh, dinner?

1375
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:56,119
Sleep comfortably, JOONIE.

1376
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,289
I want to listen to it one more time.

1377
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,058
It's your condition. Are you okay?

1378
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,328
Just one more time...

1379
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:02,730
- Do you want to listen to it? - Yes.

1380
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,928
Do I look easy because I'm an idol?

1381
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,340
That's funny, who are you to judge me?

1382
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,909
Because I bring out a different vibe

1383
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:12,469
I kept practicing.

1384
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,679
In the shower, while walking around,

1385
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,679
while brushing my teeth,

1386
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,078
and in my sleep.

1387
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,249
I didn't stop practicing.

1388
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,820
Let's get it popping, little popping, Block Six

1389
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,150
Can you give us a demo?

1390
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,159
Hey, listen up

1391
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,459
Do I look easy because I'm an idol?

1392
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,889
That's funny, who are you to judge me?

1393
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:35,598
Because I bring out a different vibe

1394
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,129
Unlike you guys who can't describe

1395
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:41,039
Because there's no beat, you can clearly hear the lyrics.

1396
00:51:41,739 --> 00:51:45,369
I wanted to deliver my message.

1397
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,739
I prepared for the performance like it was my last chance.

1398
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,880
The beat

1399
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,880
Yes! It was good.

1400
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:53,178
- JOONIE. - That was more than enough.

1401
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:55,479
- Good job, JOONIE. - Nice energy. Keep it up.

1402
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,419
I like your mentality, JOONIE.

1403
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,090
Starting the performance with you is the key.

1404
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:01,460
We're gaining the upper hand.

1405
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,860
What you did just now was more than enough.

1406
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:06,699
Great job.

1407
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:08,428
JOONIE is our first rapper.

1408
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:12,030
My expectations for her, and "Please, rap as you did earlier."

1409
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,869
That was all I could think of.

1410
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:17,369
Ready.

1411
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:21,409
Start.

1412
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,780
Hey, listen up

1413
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,750
Do I look easy because I'm an idol?

1414
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:32,920
That's funny, who are you to judge me?

1415
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,689
Because I bring out a different vibe

1416
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,030
Unlike you guys who can't describe

1417
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,599
Just once glance into my eye

1418
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,269
The truth has been described

1419
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:47,439
Saying you're all better than a K-pop idol yet

1420
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,069
You all can't make it to the finals

1421
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,609
I feel it in survival

1422
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,178
I need to survive for my team to go viral

1423
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:57,848
Everyone tells me I can do it because I'm unique

1424
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:00,178
Out here stealing like a thief

1425
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:02,150
- Oh, gosh. - Yes.

1426
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,089
DJ, drop the beat.

1427
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,518
- Yes! - Yes!

1428
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,419
- Put your hands up! - Put your hands up!

1429
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,429
- Hey, mothers! - Make some noise!

1430
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,928
- Block Six! We're out here! - That's it!

1431
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,599
- Hey - Hey, listen up

1432
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:18,669
My paycheck is the minimum, buy a designer label

1433
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,368
I'm broke in the earliest 15 days, my opponent is the minimum

1434
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,738
I earned millions before I knew it, I bought a house in Seoul Forest

1435
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:26,709
I camp in Seoul Forest, it's much easier there

1436
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,979
The world is like a tow truck

1437
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,448
Even with so many problems, people earn money

1438
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:33,979
They earn my yearly salary with a single monthly rent

1439
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,949
I work part-time, I'm a part-time lover

1440
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,348
The house bought by the bank or the house left by my mom

1441
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,988
Which is better is decided when I'm born

1442
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,428
Inheritance is a legacy, a parasite's narrative

1443
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:46,698
It isn't just a cinema

1444
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,328
I photosynthesized through the light from the basement

1445
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:51,899
My wit has decency, I turn cold feet to those with money

1446
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,399
Go big or go home, a bulldozer also known as the landlord

1447
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,069
Their origin is the tax I pay

1448
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,569
Let's get it popping, little stopping

1449
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,109
Block Six, who can stop us? You can't stop it

1450
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,678
Let's get it popping, little stopping

1451
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,280
Block Six, who can stop us? You can't stop it

1452
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:09,718
Voice storyteller, microphone checker

1453
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,149
Rapper... Even if I...

1454
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,718
To the fish with only bones left

1455
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,259
I don't lose, let's get it

1456
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,629
Different to this ecosystem with a fast turnover rate

1457
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,098
It's how I walk, I treaded sincerely, A pro's principle

1458
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:23,368
- Get them low - Get them low

1459
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:24,768
If you feel it, one more time

1460
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:25,928
- Say ho - Say ho

1461
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,569
- Let me hear you say you like solo - Like solo

1462
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:31,109
If you feel it, one more time, Block Six

1463
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,868
- I'm pumped up. - Sorry?

1464
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,078
I'm pumped up.

1465
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,879
Stay calm.

1466
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,348
JOONIE starting the performance was a smart move.

1467
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:40,150
Yes, for sure.

1468
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:41,550
Great job.

1469
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,178
- JOONIE. - Okay.

1470
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,288
Was it all right?

1471
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:48,059
I barely have any information about JOONIE.

1472
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,230
But I felt proud of her. I was really proud of her.

1473
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,959
She rapped well.

1474
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,029
She rapped rhythmically even without music.

1475
00:54:58,054 --> 00:54:59,824
She was really cool.

1476
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,539
JOONIE looked very cool yet lonely.

1477
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,340
It was touching.

1478
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,239
Take the lead.

1479
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,610
- Hey! - Hey!

1480
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:14,380
They've already performed once.

1481
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,320
- They're relaxed. - Yes, they are.

1482
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,189
Just because Block Six made a mistake...

1483
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,360
doesn't mean it'll affect the result.

1484
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,429
I tried to stay as calm as possible.

1485
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,730
With the order we made,

1486
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,900
we must win.

1487
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:30,130
We'll gladly accept the Block Money.

1488
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,039
Ready.

1489
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,670
We miss you, Mckdaddy. Let's go.

1490
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,618
I don't remember since when, I'm the most myself on the mic

1491
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,388
We must be ready for this battle, the boss can come up first

1492
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,419
My root is the south side of Seoul

1493
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,759
- Feel the base bumping, south side - It'll be hard to beat them.

1494
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,058
I'm the new rep of the gun sign

1495
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:56,359
You bounce with your hand above your head

1496
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,158
It's hot, all my things from head to toe

1497
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,759
I know you want to act like a thug

1498
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,760
But you're just a son

1499
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:02,158
- She's good. - Of someone from another country

1500
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,299
- She's crazy. - I turn the tables

1501
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,669
I get up again without fail

1502
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,868
I give up on giving up like So Hyun Seong

1503
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,399
Too many opps I beat, too many words I held back

1504
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,908
It's the time to move when those saying hip-hop is dead is leaving

1505
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:14,308
I jump quickly like OQUEEN because I'm not fit as the weakest

1506
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:16,779
I'm keeping it key player, I was born hot

1507
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,249
My flag is blue, remember I don't lift up a white flag

1508
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,678
Even with a truck full of similar guys, my flow is extra

1509
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,389
My grandma made me a tough man, I work harder without a break

1510
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:27,219
Running like "Running Man," I keep going and plunge again

1511
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,359
- Move right now, move - Move right now, move

1512
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,959
- Move right now, move - Move right now, move

1513
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,428
- Move right now, move - Move right now, move

1514
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,698
- Move right now - Move right now

1515
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:40,698
Was just about to spend some dollars and get busted, but forget it

1516
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:42,499
I'd rather rob a bank than negotiate with you, but what?

1517
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,308
Everyone is too kind to say a word, One, two, three

1518
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:47,409
Counting all the bills from the locker, yes

1519
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:49,709
Bouncing on that fool, price up, thick

1520
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,009
- Pounding hard like Dwayne's hair - Dwayne's hair

1521
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,879
I'm outside waiting for something priceless

1522
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,848
And I've gone too far at this moment

1523
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:57,718
I breathe, I dance until the morning

1524
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,459
With your dirty fat butt, who knows what's going to happen next?

1525
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,788
I don't know either, I piss on everyone

1526
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,959
All the talkative and action-taking idiots

1527
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,959
I'll keep sending this vibe without stopping

1528
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,759
- You all know what I mean - You all know what I mean

1529
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,029
I should feed everyone, I'm going to put you in a casket

1530
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,268
- Or stretcher, you call it - He's good.

1531
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:13,399
What does it feel like to hit rock bottom?

1532
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,768
- I'm loving my girl - I'm loving my girl

1533
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,299
My self-esteem

1534
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,209
- My restless baby - My restless baby

1535
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,738
It came from nothing, that's useless

1536
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:23,578
I was going to stop the flow, she said don't stop

1537
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:26,149
Ice in my soul, pretending they don't know until the next day

1538
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,479
No one acknowledges my achievement

1539
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,178
I guess they're different from us, how do you feel?

1540
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,488
They're all saying different things, I don't care

1541
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,348
- It's over. - They're all going to be shattered

1542
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:33,618
My days have been passing quickly since I was 22

1543
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:34,888
They're all observing my busy days

1544
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,388
- He's good. - We sit together now

1545
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:37,488
That wooden floor is now marble

1546
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,328
It's okay, I forgot all the stupid things you said

1547
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:40,499
Just me, casa es su casa

1548
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,129
Have a drink if you want, that one is from Bratislava

1549
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,669
Now you believe about the cliche, I believed it when I was younger

1550
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,839
I miss those days in IKEA, my life is more comfortable now

1551
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,638
This is just my journey for 28 years

1552
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,610
I used to wear frogs and walk through the Gimpo intersection

1553
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,908
The long flights weren't uncomfortable

1554
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:58,849
I should get going again now, please excuse me then

1555
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:01,749
- Move right now, move - Move right now, move

1556
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,189
- Move right now, move - Move right now, move

1557
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,718
- Move right now, move - Move right now, move

1558
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,959
Move right now

1559
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,960
Call me whatever

1560
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,960
If reputation is determined by how much money they made

1561
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:13,529
I don't use honorifics, no respect

1562
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,859
The weak ones just raised their voices and trash-talked

1563
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,368
This place is full of people

1564
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,828
Pretending to be tough and criticize others

1565
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,069
But no one dares to provoke them

1566
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,439
If I ever leave here, I'll make it clear

1567
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,109
Even if I lose honor, that's not the souvenir I'll take

1568
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,569
Even if my position changes, this game is where I'd stay

1569
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,779
You got on the bus, so leave on time

1570
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,578
Your captain is calling, sorry, I'm the leader of myself

1571
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:33,979
I'm a pioneer who will exist in the history by myself

1572
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,749
I'm going to write an epic poem, memories like deja vu

1573
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,249
My blueprint lacks explanations like IKEA

1574
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,919
The king is right here, rising above the wasteland

1575
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,658
I smile with dust on, see my dust shining

1576
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:45,659
Yes!

1577
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,058
The iron wire on the rough sand

1578
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:49,759
Presents a light that can't be touched when it's heated

1579
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,399
Time for payback, I always make sure to pay back

1580
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,069
Bad luck inspired my masterpiece

1581
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,169
- Yes! - Yes!

1582
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,480
Khundi Panda is so darn good.

1583
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,679
He's so darn good.

1584
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,309
He's really good.

1585
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:07,279
Khundi Panda's rap was good as expected.

1586
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,379
The members of Block Five are like ran vending machines.

1587
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,518
I think Block Five was the best.

1588
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,889
Round Two of A League's match has ended.

1589
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:18,789
Start voting from now on.

1590
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:21,699
I'm suddenly so stressed out.

1591
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:23,868
I was very nervous.

1592
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:26,869
I wasn't sure we'd win 100 percent.

1593
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,739
We made an obvious mistake anyway. So I had no expectations.

1594
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,308
Please.

1595
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:34,739
What do we do?

1596
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,249
(Block 6 loses with 5 votes. Block 5 wins with 26 votes)

1597
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,110
You did well.

1598
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,780
Good job.

1599
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:45,319
Block Five advances to the next round.

1600
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,920
They're legends. There were just four of them.

1601
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,920
They're amazing. They did an amazing job.

1602
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:51,558
They're unbelievable.

1603
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:55,098
They memorized two verses and came up with a new hook.

1604
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:57,868
It felt like they changed what others thought was a risk...

1605
00:59:57,869 --> 00:59:59,828
into an advantage.

1606
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,439
Or they might've had an advantage from the beginning.

1607
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,369
Here's the result of Round 2 of A League's match...

1608
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:07,509
between Block 6 and Block 5.

1609
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,239
The winning block with all its members survived...

1610
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,550
is Block Five.

1611
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,319
(Block Tournament: A League)

1612
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,650
(All the members of Block 5 have survived.)

1613
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,820
- You worked hard. - Okay.

1614
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,889
Yes, sir.

1615
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:25,589
We all worked hard together anyway.

1616
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,658
Even though I knew it,

1617
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:29,800
anger was boiling over beyond all of it.

1618
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,130
We deserved to lose.

1619
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,300
I was so annoyed by the mistake.

1620
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,610
But I can't blame anyone.

1621
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,908
Because I made a mistake.

1622
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:41,379
My old home.

1623
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,138
(Block 5)

1624
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,609
No matter how amazing your rap is,

1625
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,780
I think Block Six is my home.

1626
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:49,519
I'm having fun here. So you guys have fun yourselves.

1627
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:52,419
- Good job. - Well done.

1628
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,619
Great work.

1629
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:57,429
I knew we would win.

1630
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,960
We decided on the tournament brackets to win like this.

1631
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,459
I knew we would win.

1632
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,999
We picked brackets favorable to us and had unrivaled skills.

1633
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,400
It's easier to negotiate as we're a small group. We're so lucky.

1634
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,500
I'll be able to drink and sleep comfortably tonight.

1635
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,280
(The blocks that will face off in Round 1 of B League...)

1636
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,650
(are Block 3 and Block 2.)

1637
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,078
(But Block 2 and 3 had a match last time, didn't they?)

1638
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:22,349
(I want a rematch.)

1639
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:25,518
Come on.

1640
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,760
- Timeout. - Nice.

1641
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:30,459
- This is unbelievable. - I love it.

1642
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,760
The first episode was so interesting.

1643
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,399
We can compete against them one more time?

1644
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,299
What? That's good. I'm going to own it.

1645
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,198
We'll see something interesting again.

1646
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,899
I don't need anything else. I want everyone to survive.

1647
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,339
I want all the members to survive no matter what.

1648
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,939
It turned out better.

1649
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,038
We're going to take revenge for our previous loss.

1650
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,980
Thinking we're competing again excites me more.

1651
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,509
We're going to win this time.

1652
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,250
We're just as good overall.

1653
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,319
I think it's definitely possible to win.

1654
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:00,789
(Block Tournament: B League)

1655
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,719
Now, Round One of B League.

1656
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:07,260
The match between Block 3 and Block 2 will begin.

1657
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:09,629
- Let's go, you all. - Let's go.

1658
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,269
- Go. - Let's just enjoy it.

1659
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:13,070
- Yes. - Just have fun.

1660
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:19,109
The starter of Round 1 is Block 3.

1661
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,979
James An, DOMMIU,

1662
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,079
OSUN, and Roh Yun Ha.

1663
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,779
- Yes. - Oh, yes.

1664
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,079
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1665
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,879
James An is wearing a Harvard windbreaker.

1666
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,420
It's not a good combination, is it?

1667
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,320
I agree. Is it a poor strategy?

1668
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,089
The opposer of Round 1 is Block 2.

1669
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:41,698
Loopy, KHAN, yukon, and Nosun.

1670
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:42,859
How can they win?

1671
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,530
Block Three's plan won't work.

1672
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:48,869
- This is unexpected. - I didn't expect this at all.

1673
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:52,038
The lineup doesn't make sense.

1674
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:54,538
Block Two already played their aces.

1675
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:56,280
I was like, "What is Block Three thinking?"

1676
01:02:57,409 --> 01:02:59,979
I was thinking about a joke before coming up.

1677
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,218
I'm going to take clean revenge on Block Two...

1678
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:03,279
with my rap and come back.

1679
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,320
- Yes! - Yes, sir.

1680
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,689
That was so cool.

1681
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,288
Yun Ha is cool.

1682
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:13,689
We'll also have a clean sweep.

1683
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,059
- Yes, sir. - Let's go.

1684
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,599
- Yes! - That was clean.

1685
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:24,369
The match between Block 3 and Block 2 will begin.

1686
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,069
I think I'm going crazy. My heart is about to explode right now.

1687
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,440
I get so nervous when my blockmates are on the stage.

1688
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,510
You can do it.

1689
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,079
- You're our weapon. - Yes.

1690
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,319
Okay. Let's go.

1691
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,650
We had a bitter loss last time.

1692
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,519
This time, we're going to win no matter what.

1693
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:42,988
If we win like that,

1694
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:45,288
we're not going to miss the opportunity.

1695
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,030
I trust them.

1696
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,929
- Let's focus on our performance. - Yes, sir.

1697
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:55,098
We must win Round One.

1698
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:56,099
Yes.

1699
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,670
We faced them in the Block Breaker and lost.

1700
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,280
I want to win this time.

1701
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,210
It means we need a proper lineup...

1702
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:07,820
for Round Two anyway.

1703
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:09,049
I think we should listen to all their raps.

1704
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,118
- Yes. - Let's listen to them all.

1705
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,090
Every verse needs a highlight.

1706
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:13,389
It's not easy.

1707
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:17,359
We must select the music with the right BPM...

1708
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,959
that suits our blockmates.

1709
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,658
The BPM for a perfect performance.

1710
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,129
I can't even count

1711
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,969
(Block 3 practices rapping with Round 1's beat.)

1712
01:04:30,469 --> 01:04:31,808
Let's go to the top and win

1713
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:33,308
It's all or nothing, I will be the law

1714
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:35,138
I'm feeling it and having fun

1715
01:04:35,139 --> 01:04:36,638
You losers are nothing

1716
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,779
You're disrespecting me with your stupid rap

1717
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,049
Nobody reacts to it, I trust myself

1718
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,280
- Gosh, that was amazing. - Nice.

1719
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:45,218
Now that I've done it, I think number one is the best for me.

1720
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:47,149
Number one is my best too.

1721
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,558
I want to do number one.

1722
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,658
I think we must have OSUN on track number one.

1723
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:52,488
I think we need his heavy rap.

1724
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,529
Okay.

1725
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,960
We'll win Round One.

1726
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,369
This is crazy. We're 100 percent going to win.

1727
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:02,368
(Block 3 practices with Round 2's beat next.)

1728
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:04,038
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

1729
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:06,109
He must do this. You should do this.

1730
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,879
- Oh, my. - I'm going to bed.

1731
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,009
Hurry up and go to bed.

1732
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:11,149
Once you're crossing the line I'm crossing you out like

1733
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,408
- Do it by all means - Okay

1734
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,280
But I'm packing, so move out of my way right now

1735
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,178
- Yes! - Oh, gosh!

1736
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,689
You should be confident.

1737
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:20,249
- You're good. - This is my favorite.

1738
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,388
Turn back and smile, hold out, bring it on

1739
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:23,919
It doesn't make sense, what?

1740
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,229
I personally think DOMMIU would sound better in Round One.

1741
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,529
Yes. She sounds more stable on the boom bap beat.

1742
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,730
- Should we go like this then? - Sounds like a plan.

1743
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,768
I saw the combinations for each round and thought it wasn't bad.

1744
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,799
We might be able to take 20,000 dollars if it goes well.

1745
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,968
In the Block Tournament,

1746
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:42,038
we can win if our team is better overall.

1747
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,650
So I thought we definitely had an advantage.

1748
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:46,749
It's the golden balance.

1749
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,049
I was like, "The time has come."

1750
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,089
Okay. I feel great.

1751
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:53,590
Honestly speaking,

1752
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:55,658
there have been so many hip-hop shows...

1753
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:57,118
- in Korea, - Right.

1754
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,959
but no one filled the entire thing like this on purpose.

1755
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,799
- You're right. - Oh, that's nice.

1756
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,130
- I got it. - It's good, right?

1757
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,099
I wanted to do something impactful. So I came up with the idea.

1758
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:08,868
I'm sure no one else will do it.

1759
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:11,808
- It'll be so cool at the end. - I know.

1760
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:14,238
- We're going to end it. - Let's do this.

1761
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:15,879
- Just like that. - Yes.

1762
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,780
This is going to be so cool.

1763
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:21,348
- He's excited. - Hey.

1764
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,420
- I'm excited too. - I'm going to double it.

1765
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,489
Everyone seemed to have the same thought.

1766
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,019
"Isn't it just so cool?"

1767
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,218
"Look at that."

1768
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,829
We'll definitely win.

1769
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:33,388
Was it delicious? It was, right?

1770
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,730
You're a genius.

1771
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:35,929
It's delicious.

1772
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,499
I felt proud.

1773
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,570
I was very happy.

1774
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,468
Then,

1775
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:43,098
after taking the mic away, don't do any doubling.

1776
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,209
Let's say, "Hey."

1777
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,468
And as I told you earlier,

1778
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,238
we need to breathe in. We'll be out of breath on stage.

1779
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:51,448
I'll gesture like this at "Follow me." Then, let's gather.

1780
01:06:51,449 --> 01:06:52,880
Follow me, wow

1781
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,149
We gather when you say, "Follow me."

1782
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,150
Oh, at "Wow."

1783
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:56,379
Look on your right when I say, "Flexing."

1784
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,590
Then, on your left at "Darn."

1785
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,388
- Flexing. Darn. - Okay, good.

1786
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:00,420
Okay, good.

1787
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:01,760
We can't lose.

1788
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:03,659
We all have roles.

1789
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,030
The synergy was great.

1790
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:10,158
Yun Ha has a lot of experience and he's great,

1791
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,468
so we led the team together and practiced well.

1792
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:14,598
We're well prepared.

1793
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,598
- Unless you're at the top level, - My goodness.

1794
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,340
Having a manager is a luxury Before worrying about costs...

1795
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:22,480
I have my own unique skills.

1796
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,650
I'm excited to show everyone.

1797
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,578
We'll win 20,000 dollars...

1798
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:28,949
and get to the top rank.

1799
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,250
Let's do this!

1800
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:32,289
(Block Tournament: B League Round 1)

1801
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:33,289
Ready.

1802
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,988
(Round 1 starter, Block 3 starts performing.)

1803
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:36,059
Start.

1804
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,260
Drop the beat.

1805
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:46,829
It's James An's style.

1806
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:50,598
Donnie Brasco, rapper undercover

1807
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,439
Intruding the system like a parasite, Call Cesco

1808
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,138
My presence in this corrupt place is the K-antidote spray

1809
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:58,509
No pain no gain, but no flex in front of me

1810
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:01,549
My academic background is impressive I wrote lyrics in Harvard lectures

1811
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,049
I can't help but choose hip-hop over a high salary

1812
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,589
You got hit with a reality check, and my poetic bullet

1813
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:06,988
- Hit the mark and make you dread - He's good.

1814
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,319
Other Korean rappers are all dead after showing off

1815
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,719
From dreaming to the funeral

1816
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:12,828
Everyone is too busy climbing to the top

1817
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,629
Rest in peace next to the Almighty

1818
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:16,028
Pistol play ricochet

1819
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:19,129
No pickpocket could take anything from my pocket right now

1820
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:21,198
I get it popping, scholarships 25,000 dollars

1821
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,839
- Yes, I'm flexing - Flexing

1822
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,368
Tuition itself is 50,000 dollars

1823
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:25,509
- Darn - Darn

1824
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,269
Please stop the microphone check

1825
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,709
Stop the useless flex

1826
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,509
I'll give you money so go and read a book

1827
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,278
I want to be a rap star or just sing songs

1828
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,919
Call me whatever you want, rapper or singer

1829
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,488
My height is 153cm, you call me cute

1830
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,158
But you're surprised at my age and ask me where I'm from

1831
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,988
- I'm sorry I'm not a Barbie doll - She's good.

1832
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:46,459
I probably have more things that I want to do than you

1833
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,228
I'm someone who went abroad to fulfill my ambitions

1834
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:51,898
We're different, If you've noticed, please hurry up

1835
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:53,169
Gather it all up, let's start from now

1836
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,769
Look carefully at what I do, I don't need a car

1837
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,198
I ran with two legs even without an engine

1838
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,969
It's all or nothing, I will be the pop.

1839
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,568
If you act cool, you'll eventually get found out, it's not cool

1840
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,738
Quietly make a big picture, that's what I do

1841
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:05,209
I'm busy every day, Don't even call me

1842
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,849
I don't have many friends, I don't drink much

1843
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:10,519
It's nothing yet but the path that I walk

1844
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,648
It's cooler than you all who waste time without a goal

1845
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,158
Unless you're at the top level, having a manager is a luxury

1846
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,929
Why do they lay down the rebar before figuring the land prices?

1847
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:21,559
I don't put on a facade, even if it would benefit me

1848
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,999
A tower that has been built up

1849
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,228
- Go sabotage - What?

1850
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:25,499
- He's so cool. - A pile of enemies around

1851
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,769
Eliminate them

1852
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,139
- He's so good. - Acting like there's nothing

1853
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,339
While having ulterior motives

1854
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,169
You're not good-looking so the writer doesn't want you

1855
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,978
Don't do plastic surgery, Accept the reality

1856
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,438
I'll block the comments, I'm not a Michelin star

1857
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,179
The view is so open, if I'm a lion, this place is Narnia

1858
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,919
I'm the younger generation with a mindset from the 1980s

1859
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,389
I need to elevate the family's status

1860
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,219
Like the term of office I keep it up

1861
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,158
Just for the sake of being at the top through my image

1862
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,688
- I don't like the formalities - His voice is very cool.

1863
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:50,959
Most get arrested for corruption

1864
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,429
Even if I get into a dispute while strolling down the street

1865
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:56,099
It's just a temporary malfunction of a projector, Fix it up

1866
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,528
Yes, microphone checker, 1, 2, 3, If you call me blah blah

1867
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:01,139
A nobody has suddenly appeared, if that's how it's going to be, come

1868
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,799
I just went all in, Apgujeong, Hongdae, Itaewon, grab the mic

1869
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,538
Didn't even touch the free drinks, I only thought about winning

1870
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:09,108
When you're nervous I'm lala, Look at me on stage

1871
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:11,809
I rap a lot of words in full, I know sick verses

1872
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,419
Thank you, Almighty, Praise mixed with a bit of swearing

1873
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,688
I won't miss, I'm proud of myself It's not too late, follow me

1874
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:20,889
Wow, you haven't found it Of course, I'm going to drown soon

1875
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,488
I don't like your style, I don't feel anything

1876
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:26,429
Wow, you haven't found it Of course, I'm going to drown soon

1877
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,259
I don't like your style, I don't feel anything

1878
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,169
Just look for another occupation, We have different DNAs

1879
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:34,538
Hey, stop, shut it next, It can't be helped, only the Almighty knows

1880
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:36,669
The chain in your lyrics and whips something great, rollie

1881
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:39,669
Where did all the cool kids in the Korean hip-hop scene go?

1882
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,809
You say you'll never give up, but you can't trust the lyrics

1883
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:46,050
Once you rise to fame, it's goodbye immediately

1884
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,078
What's up!

1885
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:49,880
Gosh, that was so cool.

1886
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:54,590
(Round 1 starter, Block 3's performance is over.)

1887
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,328
Everyone liked it so much.

1888
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:00,430
They were awesome. My goodness.

1889
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:01,699
Why are they so cool?

1890
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,460
It's amazing.

1891
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:06,329
The beatbox arrangement is awesome.

1892
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:08,170
The end was so cool.

1893
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,369
They nailed it.

1894
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,970
It was very impressive.

1895
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:12,108
The beatbox.

1896
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:13,209
The beatbox was seriously...

1897
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:15,209
They made great use of...

1898
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,009
the beatboxing skills.

1899
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,249
Everyone loved it.

1900
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,978
The beatbox was their secret weapon.

1901
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:21,478
What others can't do.

1902
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:24,118
Trendy people rapped on the boom bap beat.

1903
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:26,989
It was such a fresh and entertaining performance.

1904
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,220
It was the best.

1905
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:30,989
He was a reliable member.

1906
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,529
No one can predict the result now.

1907
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:38,800
- Let's go. - The starting rapper is...

1908
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,769
I enjoyed the performance.

1909
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,539
But is it really necessary to say anything about it?

1910
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,609
I think we'll win again.

1911
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,670
Without a doubt.

1912
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,679
- Good job. - We did so well.

1913
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,750
I could've done better.

1914
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,380
We were cool. I'm sure.

1915
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,479
- DOMMIU, you did so well. - No, stop.

1916
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:58,549
- Please move. - Great work.

1917
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,948
Seriously, I was about to cry.

1918
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:01,959
The opposer rapper...

1919
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,630
- Great job. - should speak before starting.

1920
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:06,930
You were so cool.

1921
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:10,398
- Nice. - Great job.

1922
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,100
OSUN, your tone was crazy man.

1923
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,439
- I told you. You could do it. - Dang.

1924
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,868
I trusted them.

1925
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:18,769
The vibe was different right from the practice.

1926
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:19,938
We had good energy.

1927
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:23,608
Everyone did better than I expected.

1928
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:27,148
I want to reward my team members...

1929
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:28,180
in the second round.

1930
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:29,979
- Let's show them. - Yes, let's go.

1931
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:31,819
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

1932
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,349
- We can do it! - Let's go!

1933
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,688
- We can do this! - Let's go.

1934
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:36,159
They're strong opponents.

1935
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:37,859
Hey.

1936
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,959
They're so cool.

1937
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,529
You'll compete with us after this.

1938
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,069
I wonder how they'll fight back.

1939
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,510
Our strategy is to first group the people with similar styles.

1940
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:54,039
It'll be important to win Round One.

1941
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,078
I thought we should take the initiative.

1942
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:58,778
We put reliable people for Round One.

1943
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:03,049
I knew that only if we won the first round would we get...

1944
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,519
the opportunity to perform on stage in the second round.

1945
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,019
I also took into account the necessity of winning...

1946
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,659
the first round at all costs.

1947
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,889
I'll make sure to win you all the opportunity to perform.

1948
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,288
Yes, we will.

1949
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,759
You should hurry and create the hook.

1950
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,099
We need the hook concept and effectively use Ga Yeon's voice.

1951
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,100
- Yes, seriously. - Yes.

1952
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:23,300
How to make it addictive.

1953
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,569
When you have affection for your team members,

1954
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:28,908
you naturally want to give them more.

1955
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:31,379
I had things I wanted to share...

1956
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:33,778
with the new younger friends I met,

1957
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:35,819
rather than shining myself.

1958
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:37,819
Your team doesn't have any new recruits, right?

1959
01:13:38,489 --> 01:13:39,519
Yes.

1960
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,289
We also gathered together with people who share the same vibe.

1961
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,729
Yesterday, Owen came to recruit me.

1962
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,899
I think we'll be the strongest team if we collaborate.

1963
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:51,328
For me to move freely,

1964
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:54,328
there's a process that I need to overcome.

1965
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,499
- I want to be proud to them... - Because...

1966
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,938
- and to Block Seven. - Of course.

1967
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,640
- I got your point. - Yes.

1968
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,710
It's disappointing when things don't go as planned.

1969
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,050
- I know. - Yes.

1970
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,749
My goal was to protect the seven...

1971
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:11,389
who came to me, and I thought...

1972
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:13,350
it was important.

1973
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,659
I thought I should share...

1974
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,130
as much of my know-how as possible in order to accomplish this well.

1975
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:24,528
(Loopy gives detailed advice for the block members.)

1976
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:26,430
I think that would look better.

1977
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,639
Yes, make sure of those moves.

1978
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,170
Yes, that's a crazy tip.

1979
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,469
- It's not good to show your back. - I see.

1980
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,680
- Okay. - Especially, if you're the main.

1981
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:36,079
For example, look.

1982
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:41,050
- Do it again. - Like that verse.

1983
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,520
Do you get it? Yes, that.

1984
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:46,050
- One person has to do it right. - Right.

1985
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:48,959
This was good, Loopy.

1986
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,659
This was seriously good.

1987
01:14:50,989 --> 01:14:53,889
I must provide them with an opportunity.

1988
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,960
We had the same thought.

1989
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:03,270
(The block members going for Round 1 start to practice too.)

1990
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:08,078
KHAN should incorporate groove and speed.

1991
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:09,738
Your on-and-off rap is nice.

1992
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:12,648
Yukon and I will be like this.

1993
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:15,549
Consider these to draw...

1994
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,050
a track for this song.

1995
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:19,890
I have one idea.

1996
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:22,719
Both have the same lyrics.

1997
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,559
You say it slower.

1998
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,559
It would be nice if you could improvise.

1999
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,259
I feel like it'll sound cool.

2000
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,899
- I see. - Let's try during the practice.

2001
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:34,099
- Hey. - Hey.

2002
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,840
- I don't think I can do this round. - Are you worried?

2003
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,269
- This beat is too fast. - Let me help you.

2004
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,938
Never dead but I'm still here

2005
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:41,108
I didn't know hip-hop

2006
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:42,908
One shouldn't struggle alone.

2007
01:15:42,909 --> 01:15:45,179
There are some parts that can bring out our chemistry.

2008
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,318
I have some experience that can be helpful to others.

2009
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,680
I think I'll be able to help a lot.

2010
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,390
- It's good. - It's good.

2011
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,618
It's tighter than my boom bap verse.

2012
01:15:54,619 --> 01:15:57,789
Your verse is that charming.

2013
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,358
You can be confident about it...

2014
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:01,930
- if you choose to do this. - Yes.

2015
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:05,198
Even though Loopy handed over his leading role,

2016
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,769
he's very responsible.

2017
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,399
I feel thankful. He supports me.

2018
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:13,409
Ga Yeon, give it a go.

2019
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,139
Yes, be sound tight or beat some knives

2020
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,778
Beat some chunk and peace of mind

2021
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:19,278
Looking at Loopy,

2022
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:22,179
I thought about how I could make our block...

2023
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:23,350
to have a higher chance of winning.

2024
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,118
Be in the middle when we finish.

2025
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:26,148
- Yes. - Okay?

2026
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,988
- Then say, "Skeet. - Skeet.

2027
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:29,059
- Yes. - Yes.

2028
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:32,028
Don't stay still. Constantly move around.

2029
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:33,959
This is a wow point. They'll scream.

2030
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,698
- You should scream together. - Then stop.

2031
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:36,929
When you rap in front,

2032
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,929
one person should say, "Let's go."

2033
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:41,399
- It'll be nice if you can do that. - Yes.

2034
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,738
We were all thinking, "Let's win this round."

2035
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:46,408
We put a lot of effort to be ready.

2036
01:16:46,409 --> 01:16:48,238
Our synergy is great.

2037
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,938
I enjoyed the practice.

2038
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,349
We created a bond and got closer...

2039
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:54,680
by spending time together.

2040
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,978
We already won once. Twice is easy.

2041
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,648
I'm just thinking of drinking Jack Daniel's...

2042
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:01,119
after winning this round.

2043
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:04,089
I think our block is the best.

2044
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,389
Let's show them what we've got.

2045
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,060
We came here to do this.

2046
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:09,960
We are the champions

2047
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,328
I don't need anything, we must ensure everyone survives.

2048
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:15,340
We'll win without a doubt.

2049
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,969
We're confident.

2050
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,109
We'll definitely win.

2051
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:20,970
Ready.

2052
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,238
(Round 1 opposer, Block 2 starts performing.)

2053
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,239
Start.

2054
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:25,978
DJ, drop the beat.

2055
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:27,849
- Oh, my. - My goodness.

2056
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:28,850
Okay!

2057
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,379
I feel like they'll nail it.

2058
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,420
Don't bring that West Coast to the East! Warning!

2059
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,759
- Okay! - Yes, sir!

2060
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,619
- Two, one to two eight. - He's so cool.

2061
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,460
- TTF, shoot. - They don't seem easy already.

2062
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:41,500
- He's cool. It's annoying. - Yes!

2063
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:45,130
Yes, Loopy. You got me?

2064
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,769
Hey, wait, look

2065
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:50,469
Let me hop on it, what the heck? Everybody, where did it go?

2066
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:53,108
They ask if I'm scared then I answer no

2067
01:17:53,109 --> 01:17:55,839
He's looking for me every hour, I'll be raining more

2068
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,880
Because every time, I told you

2069
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:00,179
Have fun with me, ride with me

2070
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,919
It's a crisis here because of the fools

2071
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,589
There's no interest, I'll be out after earning money

2072
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:08,219
An irreplaceable position, the castle will be empty

2073
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,858
King, I'm Louis V Loopy, I'm not dead but living

2074
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,129
- It's neat. - The closet that I filled

2075
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,658
It's worth millions, what you thought

2076
01:18:13,659 --> 01:18:16,158
I rule the world, small Cali, bring to me, kick your clique

2077
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,228
- He's so cool - Open party

2078
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:18,828
Pop popping out until the middle of the day

2079
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:20,169
Most of them are left

2080
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,469
- Why is he so prepared? - So I'm going to do it right

2081
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,898
You crossed the line, my area up in this

2082
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,970
There aren't many reals, others are cap

2083
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:28,908
- What's up - Yes.

2084
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:30,278
Shut it and count the cash

2085
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:31,648
My mom asked me what I'm saying in these tracks

2086
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:32,978
So I'm going straight into it

2087
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:35,578
Never told her to buy my songs too much, don't do it

2088
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:38,249
I cared about the people on the net

2089
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,448
I dream but I don't need two homes

2090
01:18:39,449 --> 01:18:41,219
- He made a mistake - So I know I need to prove it

2091
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,589
I see what my team would say

2092
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,358
They'll probably feel uncomfortable like a tongue twister

2093
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:46,429
But I need to do it

2094
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,528
Never thought I'd get attached

2095
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:49,358
- But team is team so I got no hate - I think that's his style.

2096
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:51,568
I don't care about these listeners no more, they ain't like this deep

2097
01:18:51,569 --> 01:18:54,129
Kick them all

2098
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,769
I know they left the 80s behind, they sell laughter while I sell art

2099
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,538
I've changed the drinks, but still in the same place, it's the rhythm

2100
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,809
Never said, I'm on the grind everyday, but I'm still here

2101
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,379
Hip-hop, modern rhymes

2102
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,948
I don't need to be criticized by those who don't understand

2103
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,278
Don't you talk about none of my ways

2104
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:07,549
Free me, there's a determination before I speak

2105
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,978
Fight me, square up horizontal building in my stu type

2106
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:11,349
The bed that you're lying

2107
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,749
Stay there you're going to see

2108
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,988
Spotlight shines, it never goes down

2109
01:19:14,989 --> 01:19:17,959
I want to eat 3 meals a day at least for a day, move pounds

2110
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,858
Exclude those who lack ambition, I'm taking my crown back

2111
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:24,100
Maybe you didn't learn but you should know that I bounce back

2112
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,269
- Again today, all in my business - Darn it!

2113
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,599
- I'm not good at giving up - He's so cool.

2114
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,099
- I've been addicted. - Nosun, my goodness.

2115
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,538
I smoke at night again, I know I'm a sick kid

2116
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:34,309
My phone is always do not disturb, on a mission

2117
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,339
My goodness.

2118
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,839
Tied up because of my past

2119
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,448
I rise up like a dough

2120
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:40,549
Three, one, four

2121
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,818
- I keep my eyes on the prize - Oh, my goodness.

2122
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,219
- You talk a lot - Nosun is so good.

2123
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,890
But you don't act, all lies

2124
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,349
I earned money without a plan

2125
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,858
I withdraw, count, and spend immediately, all these gutters

2126
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:51,188
We're different, different dollars

2127
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:52,828
In my city with my partners

2128
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,459
We'll be riding until the sun goes down

2129
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,898
Nobody taught us

2130
01:19:55,899 --> 01:19:58,429
I chase quickly, I feel like I'm 50

2131
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,469
If you run into me

2132
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,198
- It's an accident for you - What's going on?

2133
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,639
A game of kill or be killed, survival

2134
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,510
Let me ask you one question, how can you be my rival?

2135
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:10,108
My empty balance even if I do something

2136
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:11,750
It doesn't change anything, even my life

2137
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,318
- Okay. - You don't even know half of me

2138
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:16,648
This is just the start, no problem

2139
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:19,049
Whether facing a crisis or seizing an opportunity, I'm always flying

2140
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,818
You know I changed my crisis to opportunity

2141
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:21,858
- That's my life - It's difficult.

2142
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,259
The days of holding my breath and shedding tears are in the past

2143
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,559
- Yes! - But I still have determination

2144
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,759
In my heart since she left me

2145
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,759
Even now, my will has never been broken

2146
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,158
I am steadfast forever

2147
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,259
Trials and pain

2148
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,868
- Always linger by my side - Why are they all good?

2149
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,228
Even that painful suffering

2150
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:35,499
Has dulled over time like love

2151
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,539
But the smell of the cold wind still brings back memories

2152
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,538
I can't forget, my goals

2153
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:43,710
Not only me but for my family's life

2154
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:47,049
It's time to shake off the anxiety that surrounded me

2155
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,850
Win it, but I haven't gone halfway

2156
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,148
Since I haven't been there, I should go

2157
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,989
Moving further away, I'm the only rival for myself

2158
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:56,159
I'm from the jungle

2159
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,090
Survival until my life ends

2160
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:01,429
- My goodness. - Word!

2161
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,500
That was cool.

2162
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,859
Darn it. They're good.

2163
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:07,369
If you enjoyed it, that's what matters. It's okay.

2164
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,969
- It was cool. - They're good.

2165
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,068
- I got goosebumps. - Me too.

2166
01:21:12,093 --> 01:21:13,563
I got goosebumps!

2167
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,840
When KHAN rapped without any background music,

2168
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,478
it was compelling and had a strong impact.

2169
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:22,420
It made my heart beat.

2170
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:24,179
No country for Nosun.

2171
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,090
Every time I see his performance,

2172
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,118
he touches me.

2173
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:30,158
Nosun. Even his name is so cool.

2174
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,359
Nosun...

2175
01:21:32,729 --> 01:21:33,959
I got a crush on him.

2176
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,728
His performance is like a music video.

2177
01:21:36,729 --> 01:21:39,898
He makes me get immersed in his performance.

2178
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:42,938
I didn't even realize that yukon forgot the lyrics.

2179
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:43,970
It was the best performance for me.

2180
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,139
Honestly, looking at Block Two's performance,

2181
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,439
I was furious.

2182
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,209
They were so good.

2183
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:53,779
They were too good that it was scary.

2184
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:55,778
After looking at their performance,

2185
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:57,249
I think our block members...

2186
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:00,948
performed with various styles.

2187
01:22:00,973 --> 01:22:02,683
I became more confident.

2188
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,960
The voting begins.

2189
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,158
My goodness. This is hard.

2190
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:10,728
I don't know what to do.

2191
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:11,770
I can't choose.

2192
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,300
It's so difficult.

2193
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:16,869
- I think Block 2 will win. - Press 1 if you choose the starter.

2194
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:19,670
- Loopy. He was crazy. - For me, it was Nosun.

2195
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:21,538
I think Nosun did the best.

2196
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:23,209
It was a new style.

2197
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,608
We haven't seen him.

2198
01:22:24,609 --> 01:22:26,210
Darn it. I should've been born as Nosun.

2199
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,479
It's a bummer for yukon.

2200
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,249
I feel like he never tried boom bap before.

2201
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,719
I think Block Three was perfect.

2202
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,890
The team on the left did better.

2203
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:36,419
The beatbox was crazy.

2204
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,960
I think they prepared more things.

2205
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:45,169
The result of the vote is revealed.

2206
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:47,670
- Let's go. - Oh, my goodness.

2207
01:22:47,899 --> 01:22:48,969
I'm nervous.

2208
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:50,999
No, we have a higher chance.

2209
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,770
Yes, I think we did better.

2210
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:54,840
Please.

2211
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:57,579
- My gosh! - He scared me.

2212
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,909
- Okay. - Wait.

2213
01:23:01,579 --> 01:23:03,449
- It's quite even. - It is.

2214
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,089
- My goodness. - It's a one-vote difference!

2215
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,390
What? A one-vote difference?

2216
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:15,799
- Oh, my. - My goodness!

2217
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,600
(Block 3 wins with 12 votes. Block 2 loses with 11 votes.)

2218
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:18,769
- Oh, my. - My goodness!

2219
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:19,969
(Block 3 wins Round 1 of B League.)

2220
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,429
- Shoot. - We made it!

2221
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:23,639
- It's a one-vote difference - A one-vote difference?

2222
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,899
It's a one-vote difference!

2223
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,670
My goodness.

2224
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,710
Darn.

2225
01:23:31,109 --> 01:23:33,379
My goodness. It's a one-vote difference!

2226
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,909
- Seriously? - It's amazing.

2227
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:36,778
It's amazing.

2228
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,819
Gosh, they lost by one vote.

2229
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:41,589
That means it was a close call.

2230
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,519
Honestly, both blocks performed well.

2231
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,059
I think Block Three won by a narrow margin.

2232
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,229
They were both amazing.

2233
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,500
It's a one-vote difference.

2234
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:52,528
But I thought a lot about it.

2235
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:54,130
I chose Block Three...

2236
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,398
- because of that person's mistake. - I see.

2237
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,169
- You all did well. - We nailed it.

2238
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,738
- We were the best. - We nailed it.

2239
01:24:00,739 --> 01:24:02,380
It was the best performance.

2240
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,438
- But I think... - The block to enter Round Two...

2241
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,349
- KHAN will be very disappointed. - is Block Three.

2242
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,879
Good job. You were cool.

2243
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,550
The result doesn't matter.

2244
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,778
That's not the issue.

2245
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,350
We didn't get to Round Two.

2246
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,358
It was the first battle after I became the leader.

2247
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:18,930
"I must win this."

2248
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,089
That's what I thought.

2249
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,600
Since we lost,

2250
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,500
it means I lack as a leader.

2251
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:29,438
I think we lost by one or two votes.

2252
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,439
We can't do anything about it.

2253
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,609
I was a bit confused about the result.

2254
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,709
I think Round Two...

2255
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,879
for our block would've been better.

2256
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,478
So I was disappointed that we didn't get to show that performance.

2257
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:44,648
I made them to be dependent on me.

2258
01:24:44,649 --> 01:24:46,519
But I felt like I wasn't being responsible enough.

2259
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,789
I felt like I wasn't helpful.

2260
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:52,788
- Yes, man. - Darn!

2261
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:53,858
We won!

2262
01:24:53,859 --> 01:24:55,398
Yes!

2263
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:57,659
BBULKUP, go!

2264
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:59,799
There was a sense of pressure.

2265
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:00,929
We achieved a dramatic victory.

2266
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,368
I saw all of their faces...

2267
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:06,409
and thought we'd get to show their performance.

2268
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:08,478
I'm happy that we earned a chance for you to perform.

2269
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,609
Me too. I want to see your performance.

2270
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:11,879
Even we didn't see it well.

2271
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,880
Yes, I want to see your performance.

2272
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,619
- Block Three had a good strategy. - Yes.

2273
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:19,118
Round Two would be so fun.

2274
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:24,688
(Block Tournament: B League)

2275
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:28,329
Now, Round Two of B League begins.

2276
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:29,898
(Block Tournament: B League, Round 2)

2277
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:31,429
- Round Two pressures me. - Right.

2278
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,769
It's all right.

2279
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:33,930
I need to win. I can win.

2280
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:35,568
I can win today.

2281
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:38,238
The starter of Round 2 is Block 1.

2282
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,339
Tray B, Don Mills,

2283
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:43,239
Fleeky Bang, and Polodared.

2284
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,309
- They're strong. - You can do it!

2285
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,449
- Go for it! - Go!

2286
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,779
- Look at the members. - They're so strong.

2287
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,448
They're like a crew.

2288
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:51,948
- It must be fun. - It should be.

2289
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:54,849
The opposers of Round Two are from Block 3.

2290
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,658
HAON, Reddy,

2291
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:59,090
BBULKUP, and Yang Kyle.

2292
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,630
- Let's go! - Round Two is so intense.

2293
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,300
They're the strong ones.

2294
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,460
It will be so fun.

2295
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,770
This is a very interesting match.

2296
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,430
They're gangsters.

2297
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,500
It turns out I'm against Block One, which I didn't want to do.

2298
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:14,270
They obviously look fierce.

2299
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:17,010
So we put in a lot of effort.

2300
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,879
(Block 3's practice for Round 2)

2301
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,448
We came up with a strategy.

2302
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:23,350
Block Three has all the strong ones.

2303
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:27,118
We tried to immediately show...

2304
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:29,159
the verses with our unique colors.

2305
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,158
I liked that very much.

2306
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:32,189
We're done.

2307
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,130
This is so nice.

2308
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:36,029
Things went smoothly that way.

2309
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:37,960
Are we going to create a hook? No?

2310
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:39,329
I don't think we need to.

2311
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,670
We don't.

2312
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:42,568
We didn't think about a hook.

2313
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:44,399
I think we can win Round Two definitely.

2314
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:46,139
The secret weapon is...

2315
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,670
my hook which I worked hard on.

2316
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:49,840
Among Korean rappers, Don Mills...

2317
01:26:49,909 --> 01:26:52,148
has a lot of hooks.

2318
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:54,408
I thought people would find it very funny and interesting...

2319
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:55,778
when they listen to it.

2320
01:26:55,779 --> 01:26:57,979
My team has a lot of ideas.

2321
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:02,059
We prepared a dancing section,

2322
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,319
and we had great chemistry.

2323
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,430
I think we will be at the top for sure.

2324
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,560
Hello, I'm Polodared, a keeper.

2325
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:13,899
Today, I'll teach these punks a lesson.

2326
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:15,069
Swish.

2327
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,399
(Whipping)

2328
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:18,609
How rude! They're older than you.

2329
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,239
We're all about love and peace. We can do it.

2330
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,510
You can do it!

2331
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:24,979
We can do it.

2332
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,519
Now, the Block Match...

2333
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,819
between Block 1 and Block 3 will begin.

2334
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,350
This is going to be fun.

2335
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:35,689
I wonder how good they are.

2336
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,420
- I'm so excited. - I'm so excited.

2337
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,590
- I'm curious. - I'm so curious.

2338
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,359
I feel so nervous, more nervous than when I did it.

2339
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,959
We need to win, no matter what.

2340
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,960
Let's go!

2341
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:46,970
I look forward to Tray B's performance.

2342
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,969
I'm going to bring money to my block again.

2343
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,969
I've prepared so much, and I'm going to show them.

2344
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,470
Okay. Everyone, get ready to be surprised.

2345
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:55,109
Ready.

2346
01:27:57,279 --> 01:27:58,380
I hope they show a good performance.

2347
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,579
Start.

2348
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,579
Dirty play, Don Mills.

2349
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,079
Turn it on.

2350
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:06,720
Oh, gosh.

2351
01:28:06,789 --> 01:28:09,158
Boys we don't miss, Pretty girl wants my body and lips

2352
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,919
Got too many horse no P.I.M.P.

2353
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,459
Do you want my money? I'll give you some tips, My whole bros set off

2354
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,959
Hope out the whip, Spot the enemy

01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:17,499
I missing my brodie, YO will be free

2357
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,329
Rapper punks here want to be me

My enemies' songs all make me puke

2359
01:28:20,869 --> 01:28:22,669
I do balling just like Mbappe

2360
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,368
EXO and YEL are the same

2361
01:28:24,369 --> 01:28:25,938
I growl when I see enemies

2362
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:29,278

You're so losers

01:28:55,069 --> 01:28:56,698
And you don't make money

2378
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:57,938
At the age of 20, I earned your pay for 3 months

2379
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:00,839
I gave it to my mom as pocket money, I'm going to have a steak again

- Please don't go home, baby - Baby

2386

Unhook their underwear

2388
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,059
But even if I die and come back to life again

01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,858
I won't give you my money and my love

2390
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:21,429
Ask me, "Sang Hyun, do you love me?"

2391
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:24,028

Okay, that's it. Wire.

2423
01:30:25,829 --> 01:30:29,198
(Whipping)

2424
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,460
It hurts.

2425
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,930
He's doing that with such a big build. How cute.

2426
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:35,698
Good job.

2427

- Hey! Go! - Swish.

2428
01:30:37,869 --> 01:30:38,869
Swish.

2429
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,340
It was darn good.

2430
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:45,750
This is intense.

2431
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:47,949
That guy is so funny.

2432
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,050
Don Mills played an indispensable part. He was darn good.

2433
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,550
I think he used all the killer moves he could use.

2434
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:56,390
- It was so fresh. - This is crazy.

2435
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,759
I felt sorry that I was watching it for free.

2436
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,460
It was a free concert.

2437
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,059
Polodared, Tray B, Fleeky Bang,

2438
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,269
all of them had so much energy.

2439
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:08,130
I thought, "You're good. Okay."

2440
01:31:08,369 --> 01:31:11,100
"I knew you were good."

2441
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,470
Still, I wondered, "What if they performed once again with us?"

2442
01:31:13,909 --> 01:31:16,809
Don Mills was like a gem among them.

2443
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,648
As Don Mills sang a hook at the center,

2444
01:31:19,649 --> 01:31:20,649
I had so much fun.

2445
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:21,649
It felt like a concert.

2446
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:24,419
Before I knew it, I was enjoying their performance.

2447
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:25,520
I enjoyed it.

2448
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,589
The hook was kind of a cheat key.

2449
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,318
I couldn't help singing along.

2450
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:31,359
I shouldn't have sung along.

2451
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,760
We sang along, so obviously, it was good.

2452
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,930
Don Mills, using that hook was unfair.

2453
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:37,260
They're good.

2454
01:31:37,899 --> 01:31:38,969
They're good.

2455
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:40,368
We need to go slow.

2456
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:43,068
We'll go with the groove.

2457
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:45,238
Please come up to the stage.

2458
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:47,669
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2459
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:48,670
You can do it!

2460
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:50,140
I don't know. They're good too.

2461
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:51,439
They're good.

2462
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:53,010
Are you ready?

2463
01:31:53,409 --> 01:31:55,249
- Ready. - Do as we practiced.

2464
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:56,618
Yes, as we practiced.

2465
01:31:56,619 --> 01:31:58,579
- Yes, let's go. - Let's go.

2466
01:32:00,489 --> 01:32:01,489
Start.

2467
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,760
DJ, drop it.

2468
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,528
23, back to the street

2469
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:13,329
I'm ready to fight, I'm ready to kill

2470
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,169
No flick when I hit, I beat it up fast

2471
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,538
They call me tank, money, pacq, So I take money fast

2472
01:32:17,539 --> 01:32:19,908
You can't take my hand, See if you go against me

2473
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:21,908
You're forced into a corner and give up, I like to see that

2474
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:23,879
Your coach feels sorry for you, He throws in a white towel

2475
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,278
I never work with no bozo, brokie, I put the champagne in my trophy

2476
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:28,849
Rappers use their voices hard

2477
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:30,679
- But my unearned income is bigger - Good.

2478
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,589
Bumpkins talk, They have no courage, I ignore all

2479
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,988
Sneak dissers are polite when met in person

2480
01:32:34,989 --> 01:32:36,789
K-drillers, where did you come from?

2481
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:39,959
New king, who's at the seat? Still me, Jump, fleas

2482
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,358
What touches your head isn't finish line but my two feet

2483
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:44,658
- Shout out my label, KC - KC

2484
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:46,068
He's so good.

2485
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:47,929
- I'm the youngest, the first to go - He's stable.

2486
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,398
The elite on the top, Boss baby, you name it

2487
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:52,969
Ion need a tag, Ion need a cupcake

2488
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:54,209
I want something big

2489
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:56,379
- I'll get it, maybe size ten - He's so sexy.

2490
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:59,648
I breathe in the air on top, I'm officially unofficial

2491
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:01,179
I keep showing you visually

2492
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,778
If my drip is over, kill me like "Misery"

2493
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:06,318
Possessed by Reddy to the punks who want to be good dressers

2494
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:09,618
In front of the mirror BGM, GBC, Crazy fit and crazy taste

2495
01:33:09,619 --> 01:33:11,759
Even if you go to Round Two, I'm not there, I'm not for sale

2496
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,429
Ion care except for my team

2497
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:16,899
When I look at the time going down from a small ring, It's Round Ten

2498
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,898
What you say, I'm here, I'll bring my calculator

2499
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:24,198
I start from a million, Korean won and US dollars

2500
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:25,909
I don't worry about the delivery charge

2501
01:33:26,739 --> 01:33:30,109
Like having an aspirated engine, Say what

2502
01:33:30,409 --> 01:33:31,978
You're talking too much, I'm the only one ready

2503
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:34,108
Who wants to fight with me? I always walk with confidence

2504
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,318
Come out, bumbling punks How dare you get on the same boat?

2505
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,118
You think you're big now, pretending to be close with me

2506
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:39,318
- You sit when you're tired - Look at this guy.

2507
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:40,550
- I devour any opponent - He's good.

2508
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:41,590
My neck shines

2509
01:33:41,591 --> 01:33:42,959
It shines at night too. different from you, right

2510
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,389
When I open my eyes in the morning

2511
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:46,288
I start with music and I say goodbye with music

2512
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:47,559
If you're looking for an oasis in the desert

2513
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,028
That's me, here, It feels far away Dubai

2514
01:33:50,029 --> 01:33:52,429
Homie by my side, Don't pretend you don't know, You know me

2515
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,629
Every night is critical for you,

2516
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,799
But I overcome every time, My second name

2517
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,738
Live in a different color, Kobe exhaling deeply

2518
01:33:56,739 --> 01:33:58,269
- Darn - Darn, let's go

2519
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,068
Heartbeat is increasing, tempo

2520
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:01,509
My flow gets sharp every night

2521
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,438
I want the Almighty of victory, Take my hand

2522
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:05,009
I break the rules

2523
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,608
I need to increase my wealth in the meantime

2524
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:08,349
Get lost, Ex and Don't sell my name in the back

2525
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,949
So move out of my sight now

2526
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:13,419
Shardie wants a fly out Trying to act boujee like Dubai

2527
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,288
Once you're crossing the line I'm crossing you out like, goodbye

2528
01:34:16,289 --> 01:34:19,589
Step by step, One by one 10,000 dollars didn't look much

2529
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:23,358
The eyes are already arrogant, I said cheers with my family

2530
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:25,398
I just landed in London, We hop out the plane and

2531
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:26,868
I'm already looking for

2532
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:28,728
- He's so good. - My be singing and blowing

2533
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:30,599
Feeling like Bryson, I don't care

2534
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,068
Who ride or who hot, I respond when money calls me

2535
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:34,738
Remember the days in the army, like hooah

2536
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:36,639
My money rises faster than the price That's why I became rich

2537
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,379
You idiots

2538
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:40,049
I'm on a roll, I'm on a streak

2539
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:43,049
I don't give a thing I know which street you're from

2540
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:44,379
Don't give a thing who you is

2541
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,648
- Why? Money calls me again - He's good, I admit it.

2542
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:48,688
Then money presses you, applying the pressure

2543
01:34:48,689 --> 01:34:50,920
Can't you also see that my every day is precious?

2544
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,729
- Baam! - Yes.

2545
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,560
Gosh.

2546
01:34:54,561 --> 01:34:56,459
- Block Three! - Thank you.

2547
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,698
My mind keeps changing. What shall I do?

2548
01:34:58,699 --> 01:34:59,728
Great.

2549
01:34:59,729 --> 01:35:02,068
- They definitely are good rappers. - Their performance was perfect.

2550
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:03,868
Their rap was all great.

2551
01:35:03,869 --> 01:35:05,669
They're not easy opponents.

2552
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,769
- What do you think? - What?

2553
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,340
- What do you think? - We can win.

2554
01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:10,209
BBULKUP didn't make any mistake, so that contributed a lot.

2555
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:11,680
Let's see how it turns out.

2556
01:35:11,909 --> 01:35:13,209
(The voting begins.)

2557
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:14,278
Which one should I choose?

2558
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:15,350
- It's a tough decision. - It's so hard.

2559
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:16,979
- It's tough for me too. - Is this difficult to decide?

2560
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,920
I think they won.

2561
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:21,948
I think this is what matters. What Don Mills did.

2562
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,419
His hook was surely intense.

2563
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,060
I hope we win.

2564
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:28,989
The result of the vote is revealed.

2565
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,959
I can't see it.

2566
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:31,960
I'll tell you.

2567
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,770
All right. We can do it.

2568
01:35:34,899 --> 01:35:36,069
Please.

2569
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,369
What will be the result?

2570
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:44,139
- What? - Darn.

2571
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,239
That's crazy.

2572
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:49,948
Is it a clean sweep?

2573
01:35:49,949 --> 01:35:51,078
Darn.

2574
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,379
(Block 1 wins Round 2 of B League.)

2575
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,818
Good job. We won.

2576
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:55,720
- Don Mills was so good. - Right.

2577
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:58,020
- JTONG. - We won.

2578
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,560
It can't be helped.

2579
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,430
Did you think hard about the vote?

2580
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,929
I didn't, but I thought there would be one.

2581
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:08,499
- We all thought hard. - I thought so hard too.

2582
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,398
I almost voted for Block Three.

2583
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:12,509
They were good, but...

2584
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:15,239
They all have different standards to judge.

2585
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:17,139
If all of those were put together,

2586
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,778
it could have led to a dynamic result.

2587
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:23,719
It's not that Block 3 wasn't good. Block 1 gave a great performance.

2588
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,148
Don Mills used a cheat key.

2589
01:36:25,149 --> 01:36:27,489
They were watching the performance as participants,

2590
01:36:27,689 --> 01:36:29,188
and then they all became an audience.

2591
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:30,889
I witnessed that moment.

2592
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:32,760
I wanted to pay for it. I mean it.

2593
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,689
They planned a great strategy.

2594
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:38,130
I felt so bad for those who performed for Round One.

2595
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:42,368
Maybe I should have suggested to create a hook.

2596
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:44,199
I feel very guilty.

2597
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:47,609
The winning block whose members all survived...

2598
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:49,880
is Block One.

2599
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,779
Yes!

2600
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,380
It's okay.

2601
01:36:55,079 --> 01:36:58,049
(Block Tournament: B League)

2602
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:59,850
(All the members of Block 1 have survived.)

2603
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:01,549
- You're all sweating. - Yes.

2604
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,020
They put in so much passion.

2605
01:37:03,619 --> 01:37:06,090
- You worked hard. - It's a landslide vote.

2606
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,459
Right. It's a landslide vote.

2607
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:09,629
- Darn it. - You did a good job.

2608
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:11,199
You were really awesome.

2609
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,970
I can't do anything...

2610
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:15,068
- about the result. - I'm sorry.

2611
01:37:15,069 --> 01:37:16,069
Never mind.

2612
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,600
It can happen.

2613
01:37:17,899 --> 01:37:19,369
- It was close. - Right.

2614
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,609
Members of RAP:PUBLIC.

2615
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:27,079
The second Block Match, Block Tournament has ended.

2616
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:33,220
All the members in Block Five that won League A...

2617
01:37:33,619 --> 01:37:36,090
and Block One that won League B...

2618
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:38,259
have survived.

2619
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,590
(All the members have survived.)

2620
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:41,059
Yes!

2621
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,059
We're always at the top or the bottom.

2622
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,359
I know. We keep going up and down.

2623
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:46,799
It's our first win.

2624
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,898
(It's our first win at the Block Match.)

2625
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:50,069
- We won for the first time. - It's our first win.

2626
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:53,770
I think these two members' competence contributed.

2627
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:56,938
I feel thankful that Polodared and Tray B joined our team.

2628
01:37:56,939 --> 01:37:59,778
The reason they moved to a different team...

2629
01:37:59,779 --> 01:38:01,948
will be understood by everyone.

2630
01:38:01,949 --> 01:38:03,779
I was satisfied with that.

2631
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:09,288
Block Money, 20,000 dollars, will be given as a reward.

2632
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:10,819
It's 20,000 dollars?

2633
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,159
We have 30,000 dollars in total.

2634
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:16,599
In addition, to the block that won only Round One...

2635
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,669
will be given 10,000 dollars of Block Money.

2636
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:21,270
- Nice. - Okay.

2637
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,069
- That's a lot. - We have 27,000 dollars.

2638
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:24,769
(The current Block Money ranking)

2639
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:25,868
(Block 4: 18,000 dollars, Block 6: 17,000 dollars,)

2640
01:38:25,869 --> 01:38:26,869
(Block 7: 15,000 dollars, Block 2: 14,000 dollars)

2641
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:28,169
(Block 5: 30,000 dollars, Block 6: 27,000 dollars,)

2642
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,709
(Block 1: 23,000 dollars, Block 4: 18,000 dollars,)

2643
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:30,978
(Block 3: 16,000 dollars, Block 7: 15,000 dollars)

2644
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:34,310
Blocks that lost Block Tournament...

2645
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,478
will have a deathmatch...

2646
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:41,119
to get a chance to survive in this society.

2647
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:45,219
The deathmatch will begin soon.

2648
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,288
Right away?

2649
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:50,299
All the members except for the leaders of the losing blocks...

2650
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,500
should return to Village.

2651
01:38:52,869 --> 01:38:54,429
I think we'll decide whom to eliminate.

2652
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,969
(A special digital copy of RAP:PUBLIC will be released.)

2653
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:57,499
(You can listen to the song on various music streaming sites.)

2654
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,409
I feel so happy.

2655
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:02,979
- What's the taste of victory like? - I love it.

2656
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,379
I want to keep intoxicated by the victory.

2657
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,908
Since no team feels relaxed, we're the only ones here.

2658
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:08,350
It feels like robbing a vacant house.

2659
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:10,078
Good for us.

2660
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:12,448
It was the first time I felt relaxed...

2661
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:13,819
and enjoyed happiness talking to my block members.

2662
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,589
I do feel happy.

2663
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:19,159
I think Block One is the richest.

2664
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:21,729
They have 23,000 dollars, and we have 30,000 dollars.

2665
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,999
- We're on top. - We're the richest.

2666
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,960
You know, we can do that now.

2667
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,169
We have so much money to pile up.

2668
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,199
Let's pile up the money like this.

2669
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:33,969
Everything was perfect.

2670
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:35,269
You sang a hook,

2671
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:36,709
and you danced.

2672
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:38,380
Bring some Jack Daniel's.

2673
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,249
The atmosphere was great. It was a party.

2674
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,449
It was our first win.

2675
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,978
Everyone was excited.

2676
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,389
"We don't have to go home tonight."

2677
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:49,219
"We won money tonight. Let's keep the flow."

2678
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:52,520
Most people outside don't look good.

2679
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:54,429
I think we should keep quiet.

2680
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,759
No wonder. They wouldn't feel good except for two winning teams.

2681
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,800
- I know. - Other teams looked so depressed...

2682
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:02,670
that it felt that we shouldn't be too excited.

2683
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:04,869
- Thank you for your work. - Thank you for your work.

2684
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,368
I feel so sorry. You should've shown your performance.

2685
01:40:07,369 --> 01:40:09,339
It's disappointing.

2686
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:13,809
I saw VIIN, Kim Ryul, and COCONA on my way,

2687
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:14,880
and I felt so sorry.

2688
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,118
Then a block that had at least one win...

2689
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:18,379
won't get their members eliminated?

2690
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,249
No, it's the same.

2691
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:22,688
- Except for yours and the other. - All the rest of them?

2692
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:24,090
I guess a lot will be eliminated today.

2693
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:26,788
- But leaders haven't decided yet. - Right.

2694
01:40:26,789 --> 01:40:28,528
Then the number can be different.

2695
01:40:28,529 --> 01:40:30,460
- Only the leaders are there. - Oh, right.

2696
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,828
It feels like we can't predict anything...

2697
01:40:32,829 --> 01:40:36,239
about the deathmatch this time.

2698
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,800
What will happen? Is everyone going to the deathmatch now?

2699
01:40:39,369 --> 01:40:41,109
This is what Yang Kyle says.

2700
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:45,810
"Let the members in a block go against each other and leave one."

2701
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:48,609
- This isn't easy. - No, it isn't.

2702
01:40:51,319 --> 01:40:52,420
I'll do it.

2703
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:54,890
- What? Do you want to try it? - The deathmatch.

2704
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:56,288
If it's three members...

2705
01:40:56,289 --> 01:40:59,590
If it's selecting three members as elimination candidates as before.

2706
01:40:59,859 --> 01:41:01,358
I felt very sad...

2707
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:05,429
that Ga Yeon said with a smile that she'd do it.

2708
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:07,569
She said, "Send me."

2709
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:09,669
Why did Ga Yeon say that?

2710
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:12,299
I feel so sad.

2711
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:14,769
She said it like she was going to leave,

2712
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,880
and it broke my heart.

2713
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:19,108
It could be without music,

2714
01:41:19,109 --> 01:41:21,180
or it could be with a beat.

2715
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,578
It's nice to practice in advance.

2716
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:27,449
I need to prepare both Plan A and Plan B.

2717
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,959
I'm not your brother, I'm not your friend

2718
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,988
Coward get in line

2719
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:38,129
I'll give you a drug called effort, Take it

2720
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:39,898
They're going to take it all

2721
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:41,699
I want a spotlight, It always feels different

2722
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,340
Darn it.

2723
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,579
The atmosphere felt heavy.

2724
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:52,278
It suddenly turned tense.

2725
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:54,448
They didn't tell us what kind of deathmatch it would be.

2726
01:41:54,449 --> 01:41:56,219
And only the leaders were left.

2727
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,619
Will there be another match?

2728
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,349
Are we going to go against each other? I see two mics.

2729
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:01,520
I have a bad feeling about this.

2730
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:02,989
(Look over there.)

2731
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:04,359
Look over there.

2732
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:07,789
(In this deathmatch, the leaders of the losing blocks...)

2733
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:08,789
(will decide the fate of the elimination candidates.)

2734
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:09,829
Look at that.

2735
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:13,029
What does that mean?

2736
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,569
It's a bolt from the blue.

2737
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:17,699
I was a bit confused.

2738
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:19,770
I felt anxious.

2739
01:42:20,609 --> 01:42:22,139
(The leaders will decide the fate of the elimination candidates.)

2740
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,140
(Leaders will have a 1-on-1 battle...)

2741
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,140
(with the elimination candidate they picked on the line.)

2742
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,140
What?

2743
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,380
Gosh. Darn.

2744
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,849
It's a bolt from the blue.

2745
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:38,560
It was a rule I didn't expect at all.

2746
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:40,659
Goodness.

2747
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:42,688
Seriously.

2748
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:45,300
My gosh.

2749
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:48,269
(The leaders will decide the fate of the elimination candidates.)

2750
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:51,438
(If you win, the candidate you chose will survive.)

2751
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:52,769
(If you lose, the candidate you chose...)

2752
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:54,109
(will need to leave immediately.)

2753
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,609
What's going on? It's driving me crazy.

2754
01:42:58,909 --> 01:43:02,409
I suddenly felt so much responsibility and pressure.

2755
01:43:02,979 --> 01:43:04,379
It pressed me.

2756
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:07,389
It made me realize...

2757
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,619
why they gave leaders benefits.

2758
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:15,859
This is so hard.

2759
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:19,099
(In this deathmatch, losing teams' leaders...)

2760
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:20,728
(will have battles themselves.)

2761
01:43:20,729 --> 01:43:21,929
(Are the leaders having a battle?)

2762
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:22,938
(The leaders?)

2763
01:43:22,939 --> 01:43:23,999
(The leaders will have a deathmatch.)

2764
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,038
(Darn it!)

2765
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:26,739
(This is really horrible.)

2766
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:30,510
(Leaders' deathmatch with elimination candidates on the line)

2767
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,209
(My family is sitting over there.)

2768
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:33,249
(They're all dead.)

2769
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,310
(I need to help them survive.)

2770
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:38,649
(They all just looked desperate.)

2771
01:43:41,649 --> 01:43:43,259
(This is too brutal.)

2772
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,759
(The rapper I chose...)

2773
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:46,829
(is this one.)

2774
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,188
(Did I misjudge?)

2775
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:50,158
("What kind of a leader are you?" I blamed myself.)

2776
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,259
(I'm so angry because of the mistake.)

2777
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,398
(I think I have to quit voluntarily.)

2778
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:54,429
(I feel so angry.)

2779
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:56,639
(I can't understand why he has to take responsibility.)

2780
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,198
(This is what I heard.)

2781
01:43:58,199 --> 01:43:59,639
(He's going to quit.)

2782
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,509
(A while ago, one rapper...)

2783
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:03,038
(quit this show.)

2784
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:04,179
(I guess he left.)

2785
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:07,148
(A new Block Match begins.)

2786
01:44:07,149 --> 01:44:09,049
(I have not much to say to the opposing block.)

2787
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,318
(You were collecting garbage,)

2788
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:11,619
(and you have a lot on your team.)

2789
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:14,220
(He slayed it.)

2790
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,359
(Even in the third match, intense battles continue.)

2791
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,689
(It was a rare performance that we couldn't have had.)
