1
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:22,161
(RAP:PUBLIC)

2
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:25,501
The winning rapper, 35.

3
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,742
So darn cool. He's darn tall.

4
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,672
He's the rapper of rappers.

5
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,011
Take off your mask.

6
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,041
This is awesome.

7
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,882
He's probably...

8
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,982
a hero to my generation.

9
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:45,522
He's like a dragon.

10
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:49,062
This person is someone I'd never get to meet in person.

11
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:52,092
He's out of this world.

12
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,702
You don't see him on hip-hop shows.

13
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,732
Take off your mask.

14
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,132
This is unbelievable.

15
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,401
- Hey. - Yes.

16
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:03,401
It's JTONG.

17
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,271
JTONG is here.

18
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:07,512
(He is an irreplaceable character...)

19
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:11,081
(with unique music and experience.)

20
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,312
(JTONG received respect from his early days of rapping...)

21
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,422
(and was called "the rapper of rappers.")

22
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:18,152
(You know JTONG, right?)

23
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:22,021
(His tone and style were things no one could imitate.)

24
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,521
(It was something only he could do.)

25
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,831
I watched JTONG's music video about three days before coming here.

26
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:30,062
I thought if such a person came to this contest or survival program,

27
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:32,102
it would be amazing.

28
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:34,702
I think he's excellent in all areas.

29
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:37,172
He raps well, he writes good lyrics,

30
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,842
he's unique, and he's fun.

31
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:42,482
It was an honor to meet him here...

32
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,911
as the same contestant.

33
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:47,521
JTONG. Gosh.

34
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:49,952
How did you cast him?

35
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,751
He eats clams in Busan...

36
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,822
and dives.

37
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,031
(JTONG posted a recruitment post for young farmers.)

38
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,331
(JTONG keeps becoming an ascetic. Just come, JTONG.)

39
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,631
(Min Hee Jin would just lose if JTONG comes.)

40
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,831
(He knows true style and art. He'd make lots of legendary stages.)

41
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:04,771
I've been locked up in Busan.

42
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,932
So I lack social skills.

43
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:11,271
I wanted to see myself in an unstable state...

44
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:13,641
amid these social rules.

45
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,681
I saw some possibilities,

46
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:19,452
and I was curious.

47
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,452
I feel energized.

48
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,192
That was like the commercial in the 1970s.

49
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,222
(Welcome to the society.)

50
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,391
Goodness.

51
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,702
It's JTONG.

52
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,831
- Unbelievable. - Seriously.

53
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:38,401
- Is it really him? - Yes.

54
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,542
- Where is he from? - From Busan.

55
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,641
That's crazy.

56
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,641
- This makes no sense. - This really makes no sense.

57
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,141
- This scene makes no sense too. - Is this even possible?

58
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,542
- All right! - Let's go!

59
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,151
- Let's go! - Let's go.

60
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,811
Look over here too.

61
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:57,322
Goodness.

62
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:01,021
(All Mask Off battles ended.)

63
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:04,792
Okay. This was it.

64
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,461
This should be the lineup.

65
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:10,632
I shouldn't do this half-heartedly.

66
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,172
The lineup is strong.

67
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,572
You checked all your weapons...

68
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:20,072
through Mask Off.

69
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:23,111
We all wore masks and the same clothes.

70
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,752
It seemed like a rap battle from a fair ground.

71
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:28,382
I thought it was fair.

72
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,722
Rap became a weapon.

73
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:32,692
I could enjoy and fight.

74
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,722
I understood the level of RAP:PUBLIC.

75
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,692
And it wasn't easy.

76
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:42,861
We haven't even started yet.

77
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,831
Please move to the next place.

78
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,572
It's starting now.

79
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,442
What would be waiting for us next?

80
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,711
I can't imagine what it would be.

81
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:56,741
I'm scared.

82
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,792
I think it will become much more competitive.

83
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:06,692
I don't think it's easy.

84
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:07,991
I should try hard now.

85
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,491
I checked their abilities.

86
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,061
I thought I should prepare myself more.

87
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:13,091
I should brace myself.

88
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,032
They're all dead.

89
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,772
I'll show them what I really have.

90
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,542
I want to be more overwhelming.

91
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,371
I'll finish this after overpowering them.

92
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,741
I was getting more and more excited.

93
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,311
Come on. Come all.

94
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,011
I'll end them all.

95
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,571
Let's go.

96
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,342
It'll be fun.

97
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:02,982
Oh, my gosh.

98
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:06,751
It looks more like a fighting arena.

99
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:10,422
It's cool.

100
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,272
What's going on, bro?

101
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:31,371
Come on, man.

102
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,321
Members of RAP:PUBLIC.

103
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,782
This is a society in which...

104
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:46,691
you will make order...

105
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,422
through competition.

106
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,761
Before going into the battles,

107
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:53,902
there's something you should do first.

108
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,532
That's...

109
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,631
forming blocks.

110
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,172
We're going to make teams here.

111
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:04,172
The teams will be formed today.

112
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:07,511
Depending on the rappers you form blocks with,

113
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:10,412
the strategy toward victory differs.

114
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,451
So the process of forming the first block is very important.

115
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:17,222
I wonder how we'll form teams.

116
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,722
Who would want to become a team with me?

117
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:20,761
This isn't easy.

118
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:24,261
I couldn't imagine how we'd form blocks. I had no clue.

119
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,962
The number of blocks you will form in RAP:PUBLIC...

120
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,561
How many are there?

121
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,042
Eight?

122
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:41,611
is eight.

123
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,142
Eight.

124
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,152
How will we divide into those? Our numbers don't fit.

125
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,181
That's true.

126
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:49,152
If you divide 60 people into 8 blocks, how many will be in a block?

127
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,491
Why are there eight blocks?

128
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,751
We're 60 people.

129
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:55,662
If eight people form one block, we would need more people.

130
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:58,431
Will we make blocks of 7, and the remaining 4 drops out?

131
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,491
Will we be eliminated?

132
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:01,061
Four people will be left.

133
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,332
Each block can have...

134
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,232
a minimum of six people...

135
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,301
and a maximum of eight people.

136
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,642
The numbers are different.

137
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:14,142
There may be more or fewer people.

138
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,412
You can freely decide the number...

139
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,951
of the people...

140
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:21,852
depending on your strategy.

141
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:24,352
This is so hard.

142
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:27,022
Why did they let us choose the number of people in a block?

143
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,962
Will it be better to have more people?

144
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:32,361
Or will it be better to have a minimum of six people?

145
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,402
Forming blocks...

146
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,902
is a process that requires a strategy...

147
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,732
to survive as the final block.

148
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,941
We don't know what games are there.

149
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,102
I think we'll have to fill in the numbers.

150
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,811
I'll go with eight people, no matter what.

151
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:46,472
It applies to money, and people.

152
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:47,642
The more, the merrier.

153
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:51,212
I'll go with the middle of 6 and 8, which is 7.

154
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:54,022
Wouldn't it be better to choose a middle number...

155
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,152
where you can observe the situation?

156
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,652
If 1 block takes the 300,000 dollars,

157
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:59,051
having fewer members would be better.

158
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:02,922
You will form blocks in the following way.

159
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,501
First, decide the first member of each block.

160
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,772
Then, the other rappers will decide which block they want to join...

161
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,032
and move to that block.

162
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:14,772
Then, the first members...

163
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:16,772
can recruit the rappers they want...

164
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:19,311
among those who came to the block.

165
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:22,741
Those who receive the recruitment badge...

166
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:24,511
will join the block.

167
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,482
The first members of each block...

168
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,482
will be the eight rappers...

169
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:33,792
who received the most points...

170
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,221
in the preference vote conducted earlier.

171
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:36,522
It was a popularity vote.

172
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:38,061
- It's fair. - It makes sense.

173
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:41,301
Now, I'll reveal the first members...

174
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,831
who will start forming the blocks.

175
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,172
I will call out the names of the rappers...

176
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,701
who received the most number of votes.

177
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,941
I stood out in the first round because I was excited.

178
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,412
So I think some people would have written my name.

179
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:58,851
I've accomplished many things, so I'd feel bad if I didn't get voted.

180
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,221
Eight people? It's doable.

181
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,282
I had some hopes.

182
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:07,091
The member who received the most number of votes...

183
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,892
was JTONG.

184
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:14,931
(The 1st member of Block 1 is JTONG.)

185
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,561
I knew it would be JTONG.

186
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:18,931
I knew it.

187
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:20,742
First place is JTONG.

188
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:22,542
- JTONG. - JTONG.

189
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,642
He made me fall in love with him.

190
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:28,481
One, two, three, what the heck is going to happen?

191
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:32,551
He's really good at rapping. No, his performance was so good.

192
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,382
I was shocked by his stage.

193
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,752
So I chose JTONG.

194
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,221
He's like the king.

195
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:42,091
I want the team to be filled with energy.

196
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,262
I want it to be hot and wild.

197
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:47,061
I'll be looking for the people who would work well with me.

198
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,331
He'd be popular.

199
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,471
Second place, Loopy.

200
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,502
It's him.

201
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:55,542
(The 1st member of Block 2 is Loopy.)

202
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,571
That's right. Loopy.

203
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:01,341
I don't feel anything, I've been full of anger recently

204
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,412
Loopy is very talented.

205
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:07,152
He has many weapons.

206
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:09,882
So having him in the same team would make it a strong team.

207
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:14,051
I want those who think they can do things...

208
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:18,061
they can't do on their own...

209
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,132
when we're together.

210
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,662
Third place,

211
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,331
HAON.

212
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,331
(The 1st member of Block 3 is HAON.)

213
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,331
Right. HAON is good.

214
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,542
My name was called sooner than I thought.

215
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,801
I was happy. It looked good.

216
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,612
JTONG, Loopy, HAON?

217
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:35,142
Okay.

218
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:38,652
I came here to make awesome stages.

219
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:41,252
Those who have that vision can come to me.

220
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:43,752
People will divide into groups.

221
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,951
JTONG, Loopy, HAON.

222
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,662
From that moment,

223
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:50,892
all the people I liked were in each block.

224
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,362
Which block should I choose?

225
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,331
Fourth place, SINCE.

226
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:56,961
(The 1st member of Block 4 is SINCE.)

227
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:58,132
Amazing.

228
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:03,101
I want to work with SINCE.

229
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:05,471
She has a great rapping skill.

230
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:08,112
I'd win if I was in the same team with her.

231
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,081
I want those who are energetic...

232
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,711
and produce synergy when we work together...

233
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:15,282
to come to this block.

234
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,081
Where should I go?

235
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,422
Fifth place, Khundi Panda.

236
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,091
Khundi Panda.

237
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:25,132
He's good.

238
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:28,561
There's an excitement you feel when you listen to him.

239
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,601
I was relieved to be chosen.

240
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:34,441
Then I could try to make the picture I had in my mind.

241
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,441
We're musicians, so we'll be making music.

242
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,742
I want those who share the same thoughts with me...

243
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,112
to come to this block.

244
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,181
Thank you.

245
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,242
They're all not bad.

246
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,451
It's time my name gets called.

247
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:50,652
Sixth place, Kaogaii.

248
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,292
(The 1st member of Block 6 is Kaogaii.)

249
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,922
- He's happy. - Congratulations.

250
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:57,392
Kaogaii. Why?

251
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,691
He was on "Money Game" too.

252
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:02,061
He has lots of experience in surviving.

253
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,532
He has a great network.

254
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:05,701
It would be nice to play the information warfare with him.

255
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,772
He loves it too much.

256
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,512
I'm sure you're all great musicians.

257
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,282
But I hope you won't come here...

258
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,912
if you think you're not good at live performances.

259
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:19,782
I think those who want lots of screentime...

260
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,581
could come to this block. Thank you.

261
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:24,591
Seventh place, Owen.

262
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,762
(The 1st member of Block 7 is Owen.)

263
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,731
Owen is my own, and he's very talented.

264
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,301
He raps well, and I thought I could learn some things from him.

265
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,561
I thought I could grow if I was in the same team as him.

266
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,902
We either came to earn money, get famous,

267
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:41,301
or let the team known by people. We all have the same goal.

268
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,902
So I don't mind whoever comes.

269
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:45,311
Finally, in eighth place,

270
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:47,742
Roh Yun Ha.

271
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,081
Chaboom.

272
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,681
It's like Boi B, maybe?

273
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:52,951
Double Down?

274
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:55,152
Hippie Kunda.

275
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,481
(The 1st member of Block 8 is Hippie Kunda.)

276
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:03,262
Hippie Kunda was a bit unexpected.

277
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,091
I didn't expect that Hippie Kunda...

278
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:07,091
got so many votes.

279
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:11,772
(Hippie Kunda put the rappers in a craze with a fresh rapping style.)

280
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,801
My name was called last.

281
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,242
I think they voted for me...

282
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,311
because I performed well.

283
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:25,681
I want a block that lasts long and in which members are close.

284
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:27,951
I want such people to come.

285
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:33,622
The first members of all blocks were set.

286
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,091
This got more fun.

287
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,662
Where should I go?

288
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,492
It really felt like a society.

289
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:43,032
They went on top of that block...

290
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,931
and looked down at us.

291
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,841
It felt like the society that RAP:PUBLIC talked about.

292
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:50,502
I wanted to go to all the eight blocks.

293
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:53,142
I wished I had eight bodies.

294
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:56,912
Powerful rappers who were popular among people...

295
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,951
were in different groups.

296
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,481
I wondered how I should choose.

297
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,451
We'll begin forming the blocks.

298
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,351
(The 1st recruitment begins.)

299
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:09,321
We'll begin the first recruitment.

300
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,392
- Right away? - Right away?

301
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:11,992
Did you decide on a block?

302
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,931
There are so many blocks I want to go to.

303
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,002
It's difficult.

304
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,132
It was nice to be chosen,

305
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:20,301
but now I had to be chosen again. I got nervous.

306
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,002
I thought I would feel a bit lonely...

307
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:25,612
if no one wanted to be in the same team with me.

308
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,341
The rappers can move...

309
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:30,912
to the block they want.

310
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,181
I can't watch this.

311
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:35,551
I can't watch this.

312
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,522
I'm the boss.

313
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:39,851
Just come. Let me choose.

314
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:47,132
(The rappers move to the block they want.)

315
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,032
There are so many people there.

316
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,471
(Many rappers chose...)

317
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:54,172
(Block 1,)

318
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,902
(Block 2,)

319
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,912
(and Block 3.)

320
00:14:57,912 --> 00:15:00,272
HAON is really popular.

321
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,211
He's the president.

322
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,811
What's going on here?

323
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:07,211
(HAON was chosen by the most number of rappers.)

324
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,221
This is the most popular block. Darn!

325
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:10,752
Jackpot.

326
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,752
It felt really good.

327
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,162
HAON is popular.

328
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:19,931
(Meanwhile, no one chose Block 8.)

329
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:22,701
It was very sad.

330
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:29,101
(One rapper comes to Block 8.)

331
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,711
Pick me.

332
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,211
(During the first meeting after Mask Off)

333
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,652
Hello, we're...

334
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:45,321
- Korean hip-hop's... - One and only mixed group.

335
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,522
- We're '99... - Nasty Kidz.

336
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:49,492
- They work well together. - That's cool.

337
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:52,231
That was why they were together.

338
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:56,331
I want to tell you in advance to those who will be in our block.

339
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,231
We came here to get people to know our team more.

340
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,971
So if one of us gets eliminated,

341
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:04,301
the other person will leave the show as well.

342
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,412
The other person will leave the show as well.

343
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,481
Goodness.

344
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,181
If they want to let others know about their team,

345
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:12,252
- shouldn't at least one stay? - I know, right?

346
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:14,721
- That's a dangerous statement. - Two of them will leave.

347
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,922
Then that block loses power.

348
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,821
If one person loses, the other one will leave as well.

349
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:21,762
That's a wrong mindset.

350
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,691
They should have gone to a dating show.

351
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,762
They're on the wrong show.

352
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:25,992
(What will happen to these two?)

353
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:27,431
Like...

354
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:32,032
Block One will start recruiting the rappers.

355
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:33,701
I'll pick DAMINI.

356
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,142
(I'll pick DAMINI.)

357
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,311
(The 1st recruit of Block 1, DAMINI)

358
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:39,642
I'll pick yukon.

359
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,242
(I'll pick yukon.)

360
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:42,542
Gosh.

361
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,042
Nice.

362
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,612
Who is he? I don't know him.

363
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,351
That's an unexpected choice.

364
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:48,551
(The 1st recruit of Block 2, yukon)

365
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:51,351
I'll choose Rapper Yang Kyle.

366
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,721
(The 1st recruit of Block 3, Yang Kyle)

367
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,231
I'll choose PUNCHNELLO.

368
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:02,362
(The 1st recruit of Block 4, PUNCHNELLO)

369
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:03,931
Geegooin.

370
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,031
(The 1st recruit of Block 6)

371
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:07,372
(Geegooin)

372
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,902
I'll pick Double Down.

373
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,172
(The 1st recruit of Block 7, Double Down)

374
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:13,211
I'll recruit Drain K.

375
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,711
(The 1st recruit of Block 8, Drain K)

376
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:17,441
- They met. - They won't have to be separated.

377
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:19,582
Member.

378
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,211
As expected.

379
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:24,052
- Not picking him would've been fun. - Right.

380
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,451
Block Five.

381
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:28,092
I'll give up recruiting this time.

382
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,791
(I'll give up.)

383
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,862
What?

384
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,332
That's difficult.

385
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,102
I thought, "What is this guy doing?"

386
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,832
Rather than having people with mixed styles in the block,

387
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:42,802
I could just leave it empty and recruit good artists.

388
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,511
The first recruitment ended.

389
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,412
We'll begin the second recruitment.

390
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:53,852
(Many rappers gathered in Block 1, Block 2, and Block 3.)

391
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:57,021
Blocks 1, 2, and 3 are surely popular.

392
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,052
We're really not popular.

393
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:01,862
We're like the nonmainstream, unpopular block.

394
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,092
(Sighing)

395
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:04,521
It's not working out well.

396
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:07,291
We'll begin the third recruitment.

397
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:10,931
(No rapper came to Block 6.)

398
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,372
No one came.

399
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,471
(No one chose us.)

400
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,001
No one?

401
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:17,602
Do they hate us so much?

402
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:24,011
(One rapper heads to Block 6.)

403
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:27,912
JOONIE.

404
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:32,122
Just a second.

405
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,491
What do we do? Do we pick her?

406
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,062
What should we do?

407
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:39,461
This is crazy.

408
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:43,201
I preferred rappers who rap well in live performances, but...

409
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:47,602
(During Mask Off)

410
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:50,501
(JOONIE's live rapping wasn't so good.)

411
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:54,112
(She didn't perform well on stage.)

412
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:57,342
It felt like her rap was for show.

413
00:18:57,342 --> 00:19:01,281
We'd have to leave only a certain number of people later.

414
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:03,751
Someone has to be eliminated then.

415
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:06,021
It would be best to use her like that.

416
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:09,991
There will be a time when we will have to let some people go.

417
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,092
We'll use her as that card?

418
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:17,501
Block Six, please pick the rapper you will recruit.

419
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,072
Welcome, JOONIE.

420
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:24,102
(The 1st recruit of Block 6, JOONIE)

421
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:25,971
I should use her as a discarding card later.

422
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:29,142
Think about this. What if you stumble on the lyrics?

423
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,342
I really...

424
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:32,951
It's okay. We'll nail it.

425
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,481
"Okay, let's go." Let's do it like that.

426
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,481
That would be so cool.

427
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:39,691
- That's right. - Just go like that.

428
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:40,751
- Just go like that. - You're good.

429
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,392
- What rap... - Drop the darn beat, y'all.

430
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:45,332
She got it right away.

431
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,592
- I love you. - This is messed up.

432
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,731
We'll begin the fourth recruitment.

433
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,902
No one came to Block Six.

434
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,302
What? Oh, you're right.

435
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,642
No one came here. What do we do?

436
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,572
- Why is no one coming? - I know.

437
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,812
Then they shouldn't have picked me in the vote.

438
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,951
They voted for me half-heartedly and humiliated me.

439
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,011
We'll begin the fifth recruitment.

440
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:09,981
Will they come this time?

441
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:15,662
(But no one is coming again.)

442
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,961
How can it be this bad?

443
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:20,991
We're low class, and they're high class.

444
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,862
They can ask the rappers to appeal to them.

445
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:23,931
But for us...

446
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:27,132
They're Loopy's dogs. HAON's dogs.

447
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:29,471
We'll give up recruitment.

448
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,541
We won't recruit this time.

449
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,312
Goodness.

450
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,372
Is it so easy for them to give up?

451
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:35,711
This is annoying.

452
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:38,882
We'll begin the seventh recruitment.

453
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:42,052
(No rapper came to Block 6 again.)

454
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,582
Don't come. We don't need them.

455
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:46,691
We do need them.

456
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,592
Darn. Let them go. Don't beg.

457
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:53,092
It's making me annoyed again.

458
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,062
Okay. Let's wait and see, those jerks.

459
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:00,001
Are we not that good?

460
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:01,872
Yes.

461
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,741
We'll end up with the remaining people.

462
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:07,172
That's what I thought.

463
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,741
You weren't even looking at us.

464
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,312
I wanted you to remember...

465
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,011
that we're also here.

466
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:13,352
And what's shocking...

467
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:15,122
is that at least two people have to come here.

468
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:20,251
- Two people will be with us. - They're so funny.

469
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,162
(It's time to choose again.)

470
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:27,231
(The rappers move to the block they want.)

471
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:31,632
Hello.

472
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:33,372
- Goodness. - You're precious.

473
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:36,971
Darn. Forget pride. Let's go.

474
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,471
(The 8th recruit of Block 6, Kohway)

475
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,681
I thought I wanted to make...

476
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:46,981
the rappers who didn't come to me all regret their decisions.

477
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:50,481
(And there was another block that didn't get chosen.)

478
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:53,221
No rapper chose Block Eight,

479
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:54,691
so the recruitment ends here.

480
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:58,632
No one came to us for several rounds.

481
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:03,102
(Block 8 couldn't recruit enough members because no one chose them.)

482
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,562
Honestly,

483
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:07,602
it doesn't matter as long as 99' Nasty Kidz members are together.

484
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:10,041
- I didn't have any thoughts. - Right. I didn't have any thoughts.

485
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,271
Anyone. Just come.

486
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,441
(The recruitment continued,)

487
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:16,541
(and the number of remaining rappers reduced.)

488
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,612
- I'll choose JEFFERY. - I'll choose OSUN.

489
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,751
- COCONA. - MASON HOME.

490
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:21,822
Marv.

491
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:24,221
Block 1, Block 2,

492
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,451
Block 3, and Block 7...

493
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:31,632
have eight members in their blocks.

494
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:35,302
The block was completed as they reached the maximum number.

495
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:37,802
We have three people left.

496
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,102
They would go to either Block 4, Block 2, or Block 8.

497
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:41,172
Block Five said they're closed.

498
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,572
Can we close our block?

499
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,441
You can reject whoever that comes.

500
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,642
That's not nice. I'll just close the block.

501
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,981
We're the only block with six members.

502
00:22:50,312 --> 00:22:52,652
We'll begin the tenth recruitment.

503
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,451
Welcome, O'Domar.

504
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,122
(The 10th recruit of Block 6, O'Domar)

505
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:57,751
We'll recruit KP.

506
00:22:58,021 --> 00:22:59,691
Thank you.

507
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:03,761
(Only one rapper is left to be recruited.)

508
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:06,961
We won't recruit this time.

509
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:08,501
(We won't recruit this time.)

510
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,761
Oh, no.

511
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,332
They'll do that? What then?

512
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,771
We won't recruit this time.

513
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:15,541
Okay.

514
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:17,701
Why aren't they recruiting him?

515
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:19,941
I feel so bad.

516
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:23,082
We decided to have seven members.

517
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:24,612
(During the 9th recruitment)

518
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,382
Let's pick COCONA and end it there.

519
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:28,052
I think that would be nice and clean.

520
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,221
He's really...

521
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:33,852
He must be disappointed.

522
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,461
He must be shocked.

523
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:39,392
But even if I want to have an open mind about him,

524
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:42,562
I don't remember his rap.

525
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:47,672
(During Mask Off)

526
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:49,372
He stumbled.

527
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,612
I know my stage wasn't great,

528
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:54,672
but there really wasn't any block...

529
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,241
that wanted me.

530
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:00,681
Okay.

531
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:05,122
I'll go to the block that speaks to me.

532
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:15,062
I feel bad.

533
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,531
I can't watch this.

534
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,771
It would be so painful.

535
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,112
Oh, dear.

536
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,741
- Come here. - Come here.

537
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,642
Come here.

538
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,511
- Let's go together. - Thank you.

539
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:36,281
Nice.

540
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:39,291
- Do well. - Nice.

541
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,852
Goodness.

542
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:42,461
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

543
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,922
- Welcome. - Please provide your support.

544
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:45,191
- Thank you. - Please provide your support.

545
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,062
(Block 8 recruits LEO, the last rapper.)

546
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,191
- Good job. - Gosh.

547
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:53,431
Although the majority agreed to accept LEO,

548
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:56,701
there was an opinion that we're taking too much risk.

549
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:59,572
Choosing seven people...

550
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:00,612
is having the least risk.

551
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,412
But no risk means no merit.

552
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:03,781
- Right. - What if we bring him...

553
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:05,412
and make the underdog vibe?

554
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:08,052
Every block is formed.

555
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:10,281
It's amazing that every block has a balance.

556
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:12,652
Every block has its color.

557
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,592
Block One is really scary.

558
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,622
It looks like an armed frontline.

559
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,892
We, Block One, are very intense and wild.

560
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:22,001
We're just like beasts.

561
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:23,562
(During the recruitment)

562
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:24,862
(Starting with DAMINI,)

563
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:26,431
(ZENE THE ZILLA,)

564
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,172
(and Fleeky Bang were recruited.)

565
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:30,271
(Don Mills was recruited after that.)

566
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,372
- They're strong. - They're total beasts.

567
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:33,612
(Kang Hyuk,)

568
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:35,511
(GOLDBUUDA,)

569
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,342
(and JEFFERY WHITE were recruited.)

570
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:39,281
They're intense.

571
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,521
They're good rappers by instinct.

572
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:44,521
Each of them has a distinctive character,

573
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:48,662
and they can show it powerfully as a completed team.

574
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:51,491
(JTONG, DAMINI, ZENE THE ZILLA, Fleeky Bang,)

575
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,332
(Don Mills, Kang Hyuk, GOLDBUUDA, JEFFERY WHITE)

576
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:54,662
We built a good team.

577
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,402
I know. This is awesome.

578
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,802
Of course, it's nice to be with people...

579
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:01,572
well-known and good. But...

580
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,041
(I'll pick Rapper 60, yukon.)

581
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:05,672
Who is he? I don't know him.

582
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,441
(He recruits Kim Ga Yeon after yukon.)

583
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,241
Interesting choice.

584
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:13,082
Loopy's choices catch me off balance.

585
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:14,681
(ShyboiiTobii,)

586
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:15,681
(KHAN,)

587
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,882
(XWALLY,)

588
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:18,181
(Nosun,)

589
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:19,622
(and Raf Sandou were recruited.)

590
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:22,392
I guess he's taking underdogs.

591
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:24,961
Fresh feelings, spirit, potential.

592
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:28,132
It's the team with those feels.

593
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:31,501
I'd like to write a story of growing together.

594
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:33,902
(Loopy, yukon, ShyboiiTobii, Kim Ga Yeon,)

595
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:35,902
(KHAN, XWALLY, Nosun, Raf Sandou)

596
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:39,342
Block Three has the perfect balance.

597
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:40,642
That's how we made it.

598
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:42,382
(During the recruitment)

599
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:44,882
(Yang Kyle,)

600
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:47,152
(James An,)

601
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,181
(DOMMIU,)

602
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:49,521
(Roh Yun Ha,)

603
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,822
(BBULKUP,)

604
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,652
(Reddy,)

605
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,191
(and OSUN were recruited.)

606
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,062
Our block is great.

607
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:58,562
We're like hip-hip idols.

608
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,491
We have diverse people.

609
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:03,662
We have a brain, rap tanker, a big brother,

610
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:06,771
young blood, someone with an interesting character.

611
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:08,842
We have every kind. We lack nothing.

612
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:10,741
Our objective is to win, no matter what.

613
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,941
(HAON, Yang Kyle, James An, DOMMIU,)

614
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:14,642
(Roh Yun Ha, BBULKUP, Reddy, OSUN)

615
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:18,112
In Block Four, you can expect the harmony...

616
00:27:18,112 --> 00:27:20,412
of veteran rappers and new faces.

617
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:24,582
(PUNCHNELLO,)

618
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,021
(Kim Ryul,)

619
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,052
(VIIN,)

620
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:30,261
(Boi B,)

621
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,961
(skyminhyuk,)

622
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:35,362
(and COCONA were recruited.)

623
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,132
The members seemed...

624
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:40,731
reliable to me.

625
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:43,471
I think each member has a distinctive color.

626
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:46,372
I look forward to see Block Four's synergy from now on.

627
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,642
(SINCE, PUNCHNELLO, Kim Ryul, VIIN,)

628
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,781
(Boi B, skyminhyuk, COCONA)

629
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:53,181
Our block has a great color.

630
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:54,951
I'm sure that a lot of people...

631
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:56,582
have high expectations for this team.

632
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:58,951
(I will give up recruiting this time.)

633
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:01,892
(Khundi Panda gave up recruiting for many rounds.)

634
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:03,991
I think he has a clear picture in his mind.

635
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:05,562
(Starting with Mckdaddy,)

636
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:06,961
(Hash Swan,)

637
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,062
(and Luci Gang were recruited.)

638
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:12,332
(JP and MASON HOME completed the block.)

639
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,072
We're the only block with six members.

640
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:19,112
They all look like good rappers.

641
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:22,541
They all have their own color.

642
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:23,912
I think that's nice.

643
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:25,711
We completed an ideal team.

644
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:28,082
I thought, "It's my turn now."

645
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:30,882
I'll do my best without regret.

646
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:33,521
(Khundi Panda, Mckdaddy, Hash Swan,)

647
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:35,461
(Luci Gang, JP, MASON HOME)

648
00:28:36,191 --> 00:28:39,731
After our team was completed, as I looked at other blocks,

649
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:42,461
I thought, "It seems that we can beat any of them."

650
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,431
(By the way, we're so not popular.)

651
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,501
(Block 6 failed recruiting for a while as rappers didn't come.)

652
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,172
(Starting with Geegooin,)

653
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,501
(Jo Gwang Il,)

654
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:51,842
(JOONIE,)

655
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:55,741
(KOALA,)

656
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,181
(Kohway, and O'Domar were recruited.)

657
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,812
Block Six is a team of diversity.

658
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:01,981
I think they're great rappers.

659
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:05,521
I think the team has quite a nice balance.

660
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:07,622
(Kaogaii, Geegooin, Jo Gwang Il, JOONIE,)

661
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,491
(KOALA, Kohway, O'Domar)

662
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,761
Block Seven has such an intense look.

663
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:14,162
(I like people who are like a gorilla.)

664
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:17,231
(Announcing a unique standard of recruiting,)

665
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:19,172
(he recruited Foggyatthebottom,)

666
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:20,332
(Tray B,)

667
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:21,672
(and Polodared.)

668
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,041
(Chaboom completes the block's color.)

669
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,812
(MOON...)

670
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:27,441
(and Marv were recruited too.)

671
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:29,142
We're the most interesting ones.

672
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,681
Other blocks are so cliche.

673
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,552
They do look like a team of gorillas.

674
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:37,382
People who are not shy, people who have rap skills,

675
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:39,691
and who are not afraid of rap.

676
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,491
When we think of hip-hop,

677
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:43,961
our team is the best, I think.

678
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:46,491
(Owen, Double Down, Foggyatthebottom, Tray B,)

679
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,332
(Polodared, Chaboom, MOON, Marv)

680
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:51,102
They're a bit weak, aren't they?

681
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:53,402
Block Eight is just right to be beaten.

682
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:57,872
If you thought we were weak, that's a big miscalculation.

683
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:00,812
Every hero has a history of hardships and sufferings.

684
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:05,382
(Block 8 couldn't recruit as no rapper chose it.)

685
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:06,981
I'm getting a bit riled up.

686
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:09,552
(After recruiting Daniel Jikal...)

687
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:12,122
(and Bizzy,)

688
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:13,652
(gamma joins in the 8th recruitment.)

689
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:15,791
(Churry joins in the 9th recruitment.)

690
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,062
(KP is recruited in the 10th recruitment.)

691
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:20,231
(LEO, the last rapper is recruited too.)

692
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:22,602
I can't figure out Block Eight.

693
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:23,961
I think she's utterly determined.

694
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:28,402
I think if we build up step by step, we can be one team.

695
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:30,072
The team consists of different colors and underdogs.

696
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:31,802
I'm satisfied.

697
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,211
(Hippie Kunda, Drain K, Daniel Jikal, Bizzy,)

698
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,181
(gamma, Churry, KP, LEO)

699
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:40,382
All eight blocks...

700
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,882
are completed now.

701
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:44,852
To lead your block to victory,

702
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:48,191
the power to unite the members as one...

703
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:50,162
and elaborate strategies are needed.

704
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:53,461
Therefore, each block...

705
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,862
has a leader's position.

706
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:06,412
It's the first sign of having the authority.

707
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:07,711
That's so nice.

708
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:09,882
There's one important point.

709
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,342
It's this.

710
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:12,681
A leader...

711
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:15,822
survives, no matter what.

712
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:19,392
- That's a huge benefit. - That's awesome.

713
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:21,021
That's intense.

714
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,322
- That's intense. - Gosh.

715
00:31:22,322 --> 00:31:24,162
- The benefit is so strong. - That's true.

716
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:25,892
I kind of wanted it.

717
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,431
This is a survival game, after all.

718
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,931
I want it. I don't want to get eliminated.

719
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:33,902
Shall I persuade the members...

720
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,201
and become a leader?

721
00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:38,771
Now, leaders will be selected.

722
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,912
If no one wants it, I can do it.

723
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:42,842
You and I shouldn't be a leader.

724
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:44,342
I know. Then who shall be?

725
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:46,552
- I have confidence. - I'm sure I can do a good job.

726
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:47,582
But I think...

727
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,681
I'm good as a leader.

728
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:52,422
- I hope you become a leader. - I don't like that idea.

729
00:31:52,422 --> 00:31:53,892
I think I'll cause big trouble.

730
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:55,822
Then no one should do it.

731
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:59,031
(Leaders are chosen.)

732
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:02,802
Now, a leader from each block will be announced.

733
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:07,001
The leaders should put on the leader's mark.

734
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:08,731
Block One's leader is...

735
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,172
I think Block One's leader is JTONG.

736
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:14,541
It's definitely JTONG.

737
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,382
Fleeky Bang.

738
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:18,382
I didn't expect it.

739
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,552
Gang, gang, gang.

740
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:22,181
He's almost the youngest one, and he became the leader.

741
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:28,721
I was the youngest, but I was confident.

742
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:30,491
The person who wants to be the leader should be it.

743
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,332
You want to, right?

744
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:34,691
I don't want to be a leader.

745
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:35,832
You don't?

746
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:38,461
If someone other than JTONG is to be a leader,

747
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:39,672
I'd rather be one.

748
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:43,102
The position looks fun, and it needs leadership.

749
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:45,201
I think I can do a good job.

750
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:48,011
If any of you has a different opinion,

751
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:50,511
please let me know.

752
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,681
So I will volunteer for the position.

753
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,082
In the last battle, I was ridiculously...

754
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:59,251
(GOLDBUUDA repeated mistakes during Mask Off.)

755
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:00,521
Oh, shoot.

756
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:01,721
Goodness.

757
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,562
I'm a bit worried about getting eliminated.

758
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,191
I want the position.

759
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,791
It helps me, in any case.

760
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:10,162
Those who think Fleeky Bang will do it well.

761
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:12,031
(They cast a vote to decide on the leader.)

762
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,572
(Fleeky Bang gets 6 votes.)

763
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:15,231
Those who think GOLDBUUDA will do it well.

764
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:17,001
Maybe like...

765
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:19,941
JTONG, Don Mills...

766
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:24,181
(GOLDBUUDA gets 0 votes.)

767
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:26,011
Okay.

768
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:27,211
You'll have another chance.

769
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,221
No, I don't really have...

770
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,322
ambition this time.

771
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:34,892
Block Two's leader is Loopy.

772
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:38,721
I could feel that every member trusted me.

773
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:41,491
I'll teach them everything I know.

774
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,201
I'll help them grow as I promised.

775
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:48,402
Block Three's leader is HAON.

776
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,642
(Block 3's leader HAON)

777
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:51,971
He's awesome.

778
00:33:55,412 --> 00:33:57,312
I became the leader of Block Three.

779
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,652
I could feel everyone trusted me.

780
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:01,211
You can do it!

781
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:03,221
That motivated me even more.

782
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:05,251
Block Four's leader is...

783
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,092
Boi B.

784
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:16,532
(Laughing)

785
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:23,941
Block Five's leader is...

786
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,182
- Khundi Panda? - I think Khundi Panda will do it.

787
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:31,081
- JP. - What?

788
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,112
- What? - What's going on?

789
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,452
Does anyone want to do it?

790
00:34:36,452 --> 00:34:38,682
- I want to, but... - I want to too.

791
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:41,322
- What? - Shall I try just for today?

792
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:47,661
Actually, deciding on the leader now...

793
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:50,132
- It might not be permanent. - I guess so.

794
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:55,101
Depending on the future situation, you can change the leader as well.

795
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:56,941
JP can be the leader.

796
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:58,842
All right, you go first.

797
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:00,172
You want it so desperately.

798
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:01,541
I'm happy.

799
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,041
If he's not good, I can take it later.

800
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:07,182
Block Six's leader is Kaogaii.

801
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:09,481
(Block 6's leader Kaogaii)

802
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:12,251
It doesn't go beyond my expectations at all.

803
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:17,291
This block will be ruined without me.

804
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:22,762
Block Seven's leader is Chaboom.

805
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:25,331
(Block 7's leader Chaboom)

806
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,731
I thought it'd be Chaboom.

807
00:35:28,632 --> 00:35:30,742
Is there anyone who wants to volunteer?

808
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,581
I think I'll cause big trouble.

809
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,682
Is there anyone who wants to?

810
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:42,182
In Block Seven,

811
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,552
no one was eager to be a leader.

812
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:46,452
I'll vote for Chaboom.

813
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:47,521
- Gosh. - What?

814
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,592
- Are you all right with it? - About what?

815
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:51,992
Owen cast a vote for you.

816
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:53,191
- Really? - Yes.

817
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:54,762
Then what should I do?

818
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:55,902
It means you're our leader.

819
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:57,532
- Do I have to be? - Yes.

820
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,172
Did something go wrong already?

821
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:03,302
How come I became a leader in an instant?

822
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,041
Here's the leader of Block Eight.

823
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:07,941
I can't figure it out.

824
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:10,282
No one caught my eye.

825
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,182
I think Bizzy might do it.

826
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:14,311
It's gamma.

827
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:15,722
What?

828
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,382
- This is a bit strange. - It's not what I expected.

829
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,092
- Anyone wants it? - I do.

830
00:36:21,822 --> 00:36:22,922
I want to.

831
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:25,191
You said that the two of you...

832
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:27,362
will leave the show if one of you gets eliminated.

833
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,331
(If one of us gets eliminated,)

834
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:32,702
(the other person will leave the show as well.)

835
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,902
- You and I can't be a leader. - I know. Then who shall be?

836
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,242
Does anyone want it? You said you wanted it, gamma.

837
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,911
- Yes. - Then gamma can do it.

838
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,112
Is there anyone else?

839
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,382
I was very upset then.

840
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:48,481
Shall we choose gamma?

841
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:50,121
Let's say it's fixed.

842
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:51,152
Oh, my.

843
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:52,922
I'll do my best.

844
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,922
As there was no one...

845
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,492
who supported me to be the leader,

846
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:00,731
I realized how my block members...

847
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:04,161
thought about me.

848
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,072
Now, depending on the results of the battle,

849
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:10,371
the winning blocks are guaranteed survival...

850
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:14,771
and Block Money, which will be given as a prize.

851
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:16,711
- Gosh. - Block Money?

852
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,311
It's a capitalist society.

853
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:20,851
The first match with Block Money on the line...

854
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:22,922
starts now.

855
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,081
Now?

856
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:26,121
Just like this?

857
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:28,452
Gosh, that scared me.

858
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,592
What's going on?

859
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:39,472
What is this?

860
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:41,871
- Wait a minute! - Oh, my!

861
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,541
What is this?

862
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,501
- Wait a minute! - Oh, my!

863
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:46,941
No!

864
00:37:46,941 --> 00:37:49,941
Darn it.

865
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:53,581
They wouldn't have known that this would go up.

866
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,351
It was my first time to see a stage like that.

867
00:37:56,351 --> 00:37:58,182
The scale of this show...

868
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:00,492
I thought wonderful performances would be put on.

869
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:03,561
The first match with Block Money on the line...

870
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:06,862
is Infinite Cypher.

871
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:08,461
- Infinite Cypher. - Infinite Cypher.

872
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:09,561
Infinite Cypher.

873
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,762
- Darn. - Infinite Cypher?

874
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:12,432
- What does that mean? - Infinite Cypher.

875
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:13,672
What?

876
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:15,331
- Infinite Cypher? - Infinite Cypher.

877
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:16,541
Infinite Cypher?

878
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:19,572
- You can't stop? - I feel dizzy.

879
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:23,141
- Infinite Cypher. - Infinite Cypher.

880
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:24,182
They must be crazy.

881
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:27,782
Can you use the words "infinite" and "cypher" together?

882
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:29,851
It's an infinite rap race.

883
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,891
For this match, each block's...

884
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:40,032
- No way. - I guess everyone will be in it.

885
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:43,302
Only the leaders participate.

886
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,501
- Only the leaders participate. - My goodness!

887
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:48,202
Oh, my goodness.

888
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:50,902
I'm darn relieved.

889
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:53,311
I could have been done for.

890
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,911
I might have gotten eliminated in two minutes.

891
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:58,711
We made a wrong choice.

892
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:01,552
I won't get eliminated today.

893
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:04,182
No elimination, darn it.

894
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:05,652
Let's go!

895
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,592
Does this make sense? It felt kind of surreal.

896
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,791
- Yes! - HAON!

897
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,561
It's a rap show, so a good rapper should participate in the match.

898
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:17,331
It's something like this.

899
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:19,632
The one who wants to wear the crown, bears the weight.

900
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:21,702
- JP, let's go! - You can do it!

901
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:22,842
JP, you can do it!

902
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:25,941
I decided to shine in front of the people I respect.

903
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:29,441
- Boi B! - Boi B!

904
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:32,112
- Boi B! - Boi B!

905
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,182
I'm going to slay everyone.

906
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:36,452
- I have only one verse. - You can do it!

907
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,682
- Go for it! - You can do it!

908
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:40,152
Go for it!

909
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:43,492
We're all doomed.

910
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:45,322
Kaogaii, you can do it!

911
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:46,791
- Kaogaii, let's go! - Kaogaii, let's go!

912
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:49,702
- You can do it! - Let's go!

913
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:53,472
I need to build their trust today for the future.

914
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,242
- Fleeky Bang! - Gang, gang, gang.

915
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:57,902
It didn't feel real.

916
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:00,472
Can I really do a cypher infinitely?

917
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,182
Show me what you got!

918
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:04,842
Yes!

919
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:06,282
I should do a good job.

920
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,782
I must be a leader who can pull strings...

921
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,052
so that what I say affects them.

922
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:12,891
- Goodness. - We're ruined.

923
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:13,922
Oh, my.

924
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:16,822
Now, the rules will be explained.

925
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:21,362
Until only 1 leader remains among 8 leaders,

926
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:24,101
they'll continue to rap infinitely in this match.

927
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:26,532
- Darn it, man. - Darn.

928
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,742
Then you need a lot of verses.

929
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:32,441
Then you need at least eight verses.

930
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:34,112
Do you need at least 7 or 8 verses?

931
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,911
When the beat starts,

932
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,112
the leader who wants to go will grab the mic...

933
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:39,711
(With a random beat, a starter begins rapping first.)

934
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:41,782
and begin to rap first.

935
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,382
The leader who's done with the rap...

936
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:49,052
can select a leader who will rap next.

937
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:53,731
You can do this.

938
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:56,132
They can keep calling one to push into a corner.

939
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:58,532
The leader who's selected...

940
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:00,932
has to rap no matter what.

941
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:05,441
If the leader fails, they must leave the stage immediately.

942
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:06,512
Goodness.

943
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:08,811
In Infinite Cypher, voting...

944
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:10,811
- Voting? - Voting?

945
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:12,512
won't happen.

946
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:14,251
- That makes sense. - Then what?

947
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,882
- Then how do we decide? - Then who decides it?

948
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,722
According to the standard of failure...

949
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:22,722
the eight leaders decide on,

950
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:25,262
they have to leave the stage voluntarily.

951
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,891
They carry the burden of a leader.

952
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:29,762
- The standard of failure. - They decide on it together.

953
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:31,302
The idea sounded very new.

954
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:33,672
I thought it was fair and neat.

955
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:35,932
I think it matches the show's concept.

956
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,641
I think, for the verse,

957
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:40,811
- the standard should be eight. - Eight verses.

958
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:42,541
- I think that's good. - All right.

959
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,282
You can't use the same verse again after you use it once, of course.

960
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:46,981
Of course, you can't.

961
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:48,152
It means the verse you used here.

962
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:51,422
When it's unclear, other leaders...

963
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:54,552
can vote by raising hands to decide it.

964
00:41:54,922 --> 00:41:55,922
Okay.

965
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:57,561
First,

966
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:00,661
you're out if you don't rap over eight verses.

967
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:03,932
Second, if you reuse the verse...

968
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:06,601
you already used, you're out.

969
00:42:07,072 --> 00:42:09,842
Third, during a cypher,

970
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:12,271
if the standard of failure seems unclear,

971
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:14,242
the leaders raise their hands to vote.

972
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,112
If the majority of leaders agree, the beat will stop,

973
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:18,481
and the rapping leader will be eliminated.

974
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:21,081
They're so strict.

975
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:23,922
- This is terrible. - I know. It's cruel.

976
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:27,521
The leader of each block, please come up to the stage.

977
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:31,161
- Let's go! - Let's go!

978
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,222
Let's go!

979
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:33,632
Let's go! You can do it! Let's go!

980
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:34,731
Slay them all!

981
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:37,731
- JP! - Slay it!

982
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:40,331
- Boi B! - Boi B!

983
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:42,132
It feels like a fight club here.

984
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:43,242
Everyone is yelling.

985
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:45,271
Go wreck them!

986
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,941
Mess them up!

987
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,172
Now, the leaders...

988
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:51,641
will begin Infinite Cypher.

989
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:52,882
Are they starting it right away?

990
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:54,211
Darn it, I feel so nervous.

991
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:55,552
I can't watch it.

992
00:42:55,552 --> 00:42:58,322
I felt pressured as everyone seemed to trust me.

993
00:42:58,322 --> 00:42:59,992
I will hold out as long as I can.

994
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:01,992
I have 1,300 verses in my memo.

995
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:03,262
- I felt confident. - Ready.

996
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:06,262
I thought the real match started then.

997
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:08,762
If you mess with me, I won't die alone.

998
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:10,032
I was confident that I'd never lose.

999
00:43:10,032 --> 00:43:11,262
I decided to get many chances for my team.

1000
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:12,302
Start.

1001
00:43:12,302 --> 00:43:13,371
(Round 1 of the Infinite Cypher has started.)

1002
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:16,172
Gosh, that's...

1003
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:18,501
(Block 5's leader, JP, steps up first.)

1004
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,672
Even before the beat is played.

1005
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,112
He's quick.

1006
00:43:22,512 --> 00:43:23,641
He's taking it right away.

1007
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,851
That crazy punk took it right away.

1008
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:33,092
New Pi 3.14, obliquitous

1009
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:35,251
Don't know, They only see negative things

1010
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:37,262
They say the sounds I made are childish

1011
00:43:37,262 --> 00:43:38,621
Man, come look what I've found

1012
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:40,891
I like how you want to get a free ride

1013
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:43,532
Get that dough, cash, money, count them all

1014
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:44,532
No spoilers

1015
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:45,601
- He's darn good. - Now take your mask off

1016
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:46,932
- You're good! - Dripping wet blood

1017
00:43:47,302 --> 00:43:48,632
All over on the floor

1018
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:51,601
I don't lower my head until I see blood, you all already know

1019
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:54,411
JP!

1020
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:56,441
Who will he give the mic to?

1021
00:43:57,211 --> 00:43:58,641
(JP chooses HAON.)

1022
00:43:58,641 --> 00:43:59,981
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1023
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:01,282
Let's go!

1024
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:05,121
Hello, I'm a Mr. Story Teller

1025
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,851
Today's main character sometimes escaped early in the morning

1026
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:10,422
I drank when I was 15, I was a thief when I was 8

1027
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:11,961
- The second dream of a fool - What?

1028
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:12,961
Was to become a rapper

1029
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:15,362
I was not a gangster, but I knew

1030
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:17,461
What was bad rap, I surpassed my peers

1031
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:19,202
- He's darn good. - TV shows were worse than reality

1032
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:20,231
- He's darn good. It's unbelievable. - Money wasn't an issue

1033
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:21,231
So I wanted more problems

1034
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,842
Zeroes are pouring on the paper

1035
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:28,941
- Oh, my goodness! - Let's go!

1036
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:30,012
(HAON chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1037
00:44:31,012 --> 00:44:32,141
Let's go!

1038
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:33,981
Fleeky Bang!

1039
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:35,512
Ain't no joke, I'm not a troll

1040
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:36,751
I'm calling my boss

1041
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:39,452
And calling you, pull up to a spot, I kill them all

1042
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:40,891
I got a lot of money in my bank account

1043
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,422
- He's good. - Feeling like I'm Tony Stark

1044
00:44:43,191 --> 00:44:45,021
The enemies of Uneducated Kid and Polodared are my enemy

1045
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,021
They're all fake

1046
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:48,561
Because it doesn't make sense, they're my family

1047
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:53,072
(Fleeky Bang chooses Kaogaii.)

1048
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:54,231
- Let's go! - Okay.

1049
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:01,271
Who is the best spitter? Who has the best stick?

1050
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:03,882
It's always R-rated, Kids can't listen to my background music

1051
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:04,882
Agencies, advertising agencies

1052
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,081
I have no intention of lowering my price for them

1053
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:07,251
Why is everyone so good?

1054
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:08,251
I'm still the reckless guy from Namyangju

1055
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:09,652
You can't change me until you kill me

1056
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,621
- You shut it for money - Why is he so good?

1057
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,191
And collaborate with losers, I don't care

1058
00:45:13,191 --> 00:45:14,691
Look down, bad rappers

1059
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:17,322
I unfollow bad rappers, bad rappers are lame

1060
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:19,961
I have Kendrix in my back, let's go OG

1061
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:22,891
H to the bo, H to the izzo

1062
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:27,932
(Kaogaii chooses Loopy.)

1063
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:32,441
- Let's go. - Loopy!

1064
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:36,282
I play when I play

1065
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:39,041
There are some people in the club

1066
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,612
And the shabbiest one among them

1067
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:44,222
- Is you, the door is over there - Darn it.

1068
00:45:44,222 --> 00:45:46,492
I wear my Jordans and put my hat on backwards

1069
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:47,922
I'm sensitive to trends

1070
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:49,251
- But I remember my style - He might give the mic to us.

1071
00:45:49,251 --> 00:45:51,592
In a world full of lies, You need the truth

1072
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:54,391
Every moment I earned came from here

1073
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:57,001
Sleepless nights and worries

1074
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:59,461
Sleepless nights and worries

1075
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:02,132
I have rich memories of the land that is America

1076
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:04,572
Sleepless nights and worries

1077
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:07,342
I have rich memories of the land that is America

1078
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:10,211
They're in my skin and blood, so I'm going to say this again

1079
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:13,052
All the honors I'll have will come from here

1080
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:15,581
(Loopy chooses JP.)

1081
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:17,952
Still on this, I run around on the road

1082
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:20,952
Spotless Seoul is not a place for me

1083
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:23,121
Still on this, I run around on the road

1084
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:25,322
Spotless Seoul is not a place for me

1085
00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:26,461
He started rapping right after he got the mic.

1086
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:27,961
It feels farther, finish line go ham

1087
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:30,161
I got this fine right, next to me, no time

1088
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:31,961
- He's something. - I stretch my limbs and go out

1089
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:33,302
You are all losers

1090
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:34,402
We, who are living to be aware, are one no matter what

1091
00:46:34,402 --> 00:46:36,001
Oh, my gosh. JP.

1092
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,802
All you losers, you all be copying my work

1093
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:39,242
- He'll give the mic to Loopy. - While I be working

1094
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:41,211
On some masterpiece, so you all better be running, punk

1095
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,541
(JP chooses Loopy.)

1096
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:43,541
I make coffee and take a sip

1097
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:46,481
I put my cigarette in my lung and let out smoke

1098
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:47,711
- What's going on between them? - I turn on my Mac again

1099
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:48,811
- Do they like each other? - Search news on Naver

1100
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,621
How did they release another album?

1101
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:52,621
- They keep coming at each other. - I can't calm down

1102
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:54,521
Panic attack, I swallow pain again

1103
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:57,521
Whoever my fans, family even can't understand that

1104
00:46:57,521 --> 00:46:58,661
- Darn it. - I persevere every day

1105
00:46:58,661 --> 00:46:59,661
And face tomorrow

1106
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:02,862
Everyone except us is fake, but they all make money

1107
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,302
Oh, it makes sense, after several years

1108
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:08,101
I realized the problem wasn't the listeners, it's all about playing

1109
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:10,702
Losers act up without knowing their place, those darn haters

1110
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,041
I tried my best to give them the real thing, darn son

1111
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:17,911
I ask myself who is agitated, I don't know the answer

1112
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:18,981
(Loopy chooses JP.)

1113
00:47:18,981 --> 00:47:20,411
Walking all night long, there's no winter for me

1114
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:22,512
- He's crazy. - It took about four years

1115
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:24,121
Hocus pocus on this

1116
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:26,282
Where are all my dogs at? I don't see anything but a scumbag

1117
00:47:26,282 --> 00:47:29,322
Trying to rob around Mangwon City, Go to the darn barbershop

1118
00:47:30,262 --> 00:47:31,492
- How can he keep going like this? - Old school vibes

1119
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:33,061
What the heck are you talking about? You're not in your right mind

1120
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,231
- There's no break. - You're not in your right mind

1121
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:35,961
- Wake up and just do your thing - It's like a relay.

1122
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,202
I told you how this is going to be

1123
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:39,702
I need detachable balls, I need that, optical illusion

1124
00:47:39,702 --> 00:47:42,172
I'm different, everybody knows, someone stop me

1125
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:43,601
- Off the grid, I'll tease you - He's darn cool.

1126
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:46,371
Off the grid, you're dead, you look impatient, punk

1127
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:47,842
I'm going to teach you

1128
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:50,282
I teach you freaking lessons, so get your freaking mic on, punk

1129
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:51,342
He didn't choose him.

1130
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:53,081
The beat has changed.

1131
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,351
You're awesome!

1132
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:55,351
(The beat changes after they rap in turns 8 times on the same beat.)

1133
00:47:55,351 --> 00:47:56,552
JP!

1134
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:57,621
(They're cheering for the intense cypher.)

1135
00:47:57,621 --> 00:47:59,521
- No problem! - Yes!

1136
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:01,891
Hey, JP.

1137
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:07,161
You did so darn well.

1138
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:08,492
You killed it!

1139
00:48:08,492 --> 00:48:09,532
Loopy.

1140
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:18,541
You guys are so cool!

1141
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:20,271
They're scary.

1142
00:48:20,572 --> 00:48:22,141
It's darn crazy.

1143
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:24,081
It was so intense from the beginning.

1144
00:48:24,081 --> 00:48:25,811
- I know. - So this is how it goes?

1145
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,452
It's so darn hot.

1146
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:28,851
Let's go.

1147
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:30,481
(Round 1's second beat plays.)

1148
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:31,822
Let's go.

1149
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:33,021
Hey, look at me, punk

1150
00:48:33,021 --> 00:48:35,121
I'm Fleeky Bang, I'm the star

1151
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:37,061
I have bad grades

1152
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,121
But I sent all my enemies up to the sky

1153
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:40,691
My enemies can't do music

1154
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:42,632
Or make money, why is that?

1155
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:44,501
Their bank accounts are empty, no need to check

1156
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:47,871
If you don't know how much I make, so just shut it

1157
00:48:50,672 --> 00:48:51,672
(Fleeky Bang chooses JP.)

1158
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:52,702
It's dangerous.

1159
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:55,211
I'm feeling small

1160
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:56,581
- You should keep that in mind - He must be crazy.

1161
00:48:56,782 --> 00:48:59,041
- He has so many verses. - My life is like a maze

1162
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:01,081
I hope my anxiety is over

1163
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:02,652
Done with you, I turn back time

1164
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:04,282
- Here he goes. - Who knows what's going on?

1165
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:05,581
I organized everything

1166
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:06,851
- Don't worry and move on - It's a 1-on-1 with Fleeky Bang.

1167
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:07,891
Laziness is harmful

1168
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,152
So don't overdose and I'm on this

1169
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:11,222
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1170
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:15,132
- Fleeky Bang. - Yes.

1171
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:17,902
Fleeky and Bang, I'm burning

1172
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:18,932
Hop out the whip, they know

1173
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:19,932
- They keep going on. - That I'm coming

1174
00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:21,601
- New opp, they're cute - A 1-on-1 like this isn't good.

1175
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:23,472
- They run away when they see me - Everyone is attacking our block.

1176
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:26,072
- My people know I'm honest - It seems JP is everyone's enemy.

1177
00:49:26,072 --> 00:49:27,371
Fleek, iconic

1178
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:31,141
New opp, I capture them, I'm possessed every night

1179
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:33,552
These punks are wearing similar clothes, spitting similar bars

1180
00:49:33,552 --> 00:49:34,811
Like decalcomania

1181
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,081
Wait, why is that jerk full of confidence?

1182
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:38,682
Do you really think you're good?

1183
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:42,822
- He's giving him the mic again. - Again?

1184
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,762
(Fleeky Bang chooses JP.)

1185
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:47,532
I'm on this, tie my shoes real tight

1186
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:48,561
- I lower my position - What's this?

1187
00:49:48,561 --> 00:49:50,432
They probably still don't know how their mothers feel

1188
00:49:50,432 --> 00:49:51,932
- He raps right away. It's weird. - They act like they're smart

1189
00:49:52,362 --> 00:49:53,532
- Harder and better like Moses - It's weird.

1190
00:49:54,072 --> 00:49:55,902
I don't even know where I should go now

1191
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:57,871
- When you're about to act rashly - He's a lunatic.

1192
00:49:58,472 --> 00:49:59,871
- I'll embark on an adventure - He's darn good.

1193
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,172
Day one, I'm kind of ignited

1194
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:04,012
My heart and mind are burning

1195
00:50:04,012 --> 00:50:05,941
What can I do? They're so enlightened

1196
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:08,012
After making the baseline, I'm in the rage mode

1197
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:09,952
My plans collapse like dominos

1198
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:11,552
- Is he going to give him the mic? - I don't want to be numb, you know

1199
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:13,452
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1200
00:50:13,452 --> 00:50:14,492
- No. - He's doomed.

1201
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:17,461
This is tough.

1202
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:20,061
- Yes. - Don't come!

1203
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:21,432
Yes, I'm back, now, where you at?

1204
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:22,891
I sometimes stay up all night to count money

1205
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:24,831
Blicky on my hip, it's always on my waist

1206
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:26,001
- He's going to JP again? - Everything is done, I'm wearing

1207
00:50:26,672 --> 00:50:28,302
- Did you rap? - No.

1208
00:50:28,601 --> 00:50:30,441
They cough like they caught a cold

1209
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:32,271
Tell them to come here, lick my thing

1210
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:34,242
- Like Son Dam Bi - This is so fun.

1211
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:37,842
I know you're all pretending, I don't know the rules

1212
00:50:39,282 --> 00:50:41,012
- Okay. - It was good.

1213
00:50:41,012 --> 00:50:42,351
He has good manners.

1214
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:44,282
- Good job. - Yes.

1215
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,152
Two years of absence, I bang in two months

1216
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:48,521
Had debts for 5 years, it's 0 after 5 months

1217
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:49,751
- His voice is so loud. - I'm already scared

1218
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,922
Of May next year

1219
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,762
I know how the rappers who make dozens of millions

1220
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:56,391
BOIB, the don, I'm your new rap phenomenon

1221
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:58,731
We don't give a darn about you and your whole team

1222
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:00,501
You'll be knocked out like dominos

1223
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:02,501
Did you have fun, you punk?

1224
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,141
This is a battlefield, punk

1225
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:06,072
- He's different. - Microdot with the mic

1226
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,012
I'll draw a dot on you, just came out

1227
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:11,882
From nothing to something, I want to be someone's number one

1228
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,581
Let me preach

1229
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:19,081
- Hey, gamma, let's go! - Yes, let's go!

1230
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:21,222
I'm curious.

1231
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,391
The light is more visible in the darkness

1232
00:51:24,391 --> 00:51:26,191
I'm out of breath when I make you cry

1233
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:27,961
In the forbidden depths of salvation

1234
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,791
- What? - I'm hoping to overcome it

1235
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:31,831
- We were the same before - Does he always rap like that?

1236
00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:33,532
- We found our roots but changed - Why is his voice so weak?

1237
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:34,672
- He always raps like that. - I forced myself before

1238
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:36,402
- Now I ask and turn the light - Take him out of here.

1239
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:37,472
To find it

1240
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,771
I'm so tired, arrogance, the bridge

1241
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:41,112
- Is collapsing - Block Eight doesn't look happy.

1242
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:44,911
I'm now communicating with the laughable and terrifying deity

1243
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:48,081
- There you go. - Yes.

1244
00:51:48,811 --> 00:51:51,782
It was dangerous as his rap wasn't powerful.

1245
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:56,191
(gamma chooses Chaboom.)

1246
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,661
All black Equss

1247
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,932
- Let's go! - EQ 900, shiny bonnet

1248
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:05,601
Jag, Porsche, blast that

1249
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:07,432
AMG, M Series, RS, blast that

1250
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:08,731
My boss gives me a ride

1251
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:11,072
I don't sit in the front seat I recline my seat to the back

1252
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:12,541
The gas gauge is full

1253
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,672
Jimmy Page, Stairway to heaven's door, knock

1254
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:18,842
I did everything, I drink Red Bull and ride a gold calf

1255
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:22,552
When I've said everything, I go make love with Melon

1256
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:26,052
I have nothing more to say, I'll just end it here

1257
00:52:28,052 --> 00:52:31,092
(Chaboom chooses gamma.)

1258
00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:32,691
Yes, let's go!

1259
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,561
- Let's go! - gamma, let's go!

1260
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:39,632
I want bands in my pocket

1261
00:52:39,632 --> 00:52:43,231
I make songs at the speed of a rocket

1262
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:44,271
What's that?

1263
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:46,672
Even if I throw away a few things, I'm okay

1264
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:47,972
- I think he can just freestyle... - My eyesight is getting worse

1265
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:49,311
- at this rate. - But it's 4K

1266
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:52,641
I got that vision, Take out your foot out of the water

1267
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:55,751
No more losses, darn, an impenetrable shield

1268
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,882
Now wait, you're all lining up to twerk

1269
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:02,291
I'm walking in my slippers

1270
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,492
(gamma chooses Chaboom.)

1271
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:09,362
Glare

1272
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:10,961
Freaking glare at them

1273
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,632
Let's go!

1274
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:18,202
Make a whole lot of money, won, dollar, pound, euro, yen

1275
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:19,501
- His rap is delicious. - Fake celebrities

1276
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:21,441
Spit them all, racks on racks

1277
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:24,182
Whether it's 10K or 100K, these guys all like it

1278
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:25,612
- Even Kang Hyung Wook acknowledges - gamma looks nervous.

1279
00:53:25,612 --> 00:53:27,052
You're darn incredible

1280
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:29,382
Kill it like oyster sauce by Lee Kum Kee

1281
00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:32,682
- He's good. He's a good rapper. - I have plans like Choi Woo Shik

1282
00:53:32,682 --> 00:53:34,322
Preach

1283
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:42,992
- Oh, yes. - Fleeky Bang has so many verses.

1284
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:44,432
Unedu, blick that ninja

1285
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:45,961
- POLO, go blick that ninja - Blick that ninja

1286
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,632
Sip 40 when I see an opp

1287
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:49,402
I steal and collect them, my enemies' sneakers

1288
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:50,871
Like grah, every opp's hag

1289
00:53:50,871 --> 00:53:52,541
All the enemies, call them senorita

1290
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:55,112
I learned Muay Thai to say hello when I fight my enemies

1291
00:53:55,112 --> 00:53:56,411
Thank you

1292
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:59,012
I'm in DPR, feel like I'm DPR LIVE

1293
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,552
gamma, let's go.

1294
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:05,822
He wants to eliminate gamma.

1295
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,222
- Let's go! - Bad man talk it like so tight

1296
00:54:08,222 --> 00:54:10,021
In my lips, I got cannonballs

1297
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:13,391
The guy who is stronger than Martini came from country, no town

1298
00:54:13,391 --> 00:54:14,961
These rats hope for my headshot

1299
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:16,432
That's why they do it like

1300
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:17,432
- What? - Pistol in my tongue

1301
00:54:17,432 --> 00:54:18,561
My scope is K-hip-hop

1302
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:19,961
Don't be mistaken, it's not a car, K5

1303
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:21,601
Go, gamma.

1304
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:22,802
- It's not a car, K5 - He's done for.

1305
00:54:23,271 --> 00:54:25,871
- What? Wasn't it too short? - Wasn't it too short?

1306
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:26,871
What?

1307
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:28,271
It wasn't eight verses, was it?

1308
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,782
Is it because it's short?

1309
00:54:32,411 --> 00:54:33,652
Too much, I couldn't be regular

1310
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:35,182
Toward a Chrysler, Now, I'm in Wrangler

1311
00:54:35,182 --> 00:54:36,751
If you bet on your fans, who is going to be a gambler?

1312
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,751
Show down, come to this table

1313
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:40,452
Keeping low-key, don't talk about it

1314
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:41,952
- Playboi, You're no Carti - Did he miss the beat?

1315
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:43,521
How exactly am I the same as you?

1316
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,222
You can't be like me

1317
00:54:45,222 --> 00:54:48,432
I'll fix it, optical, I freeze it, even when it's tropical

1318
00:54:48,432 --> 00:54:50,061
Bumblebee can't be Optimus

1319
00:54:50,061 --> 00:54:51,902
Boys want to look like Raf Simons

1320
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:57,342
It's iffy.

1321
00:54:57,702 --> 00:54:59,041
He barely made it.

1322
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:01,411
gamma looked very unstable.

1323
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:05,811
We could see how gamma looked confused.

1324
00:55:09,282 --> 00:55:11,952
- I got you, gamma. - It seemed gamma was nervous.

1325
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:13,592
Okay. I'll give him the mic.

1326
00:55:13,722 --> 00:55:16,052
Let's go!

1327
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:20,161
When I hop on the beat like this, I roll my tongue like I'm on a slope

1328
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,891
Your melodies are similar, not expensive

1329
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:23,092
I hope you wipe the dust quickly

1330
00:55:23,092 --> 00:55:25,432
It looks old, I'm so fresh as the owner of Pulmuone

1331
00:55:25,432 --> 00:55:28,202
PD, put you on a drama, Psick Show, you're good

1332
00:55:28,202 --> 00:55:30,202
At pretending to be comedians and foreigners, you are all ten

1333
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,402
Money, that's what I'm stacking up

1334
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:33,302
I fly over the stage to make more money today

1335
00:55:33,302 --> 00:55:34,342
I'm Dr. Strangelove

1336
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:36,342
I move around busily to play a banger

1337
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:37,742
They copy my ideas and act like they don't

1338
00:55:37,742 --> 00:55:39,211
- They can't steal my stamina - Yes.

1339
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,182
Even if you try to copy me, I'm a better version

1340
00:55:41,182 --> 00:55:43,652
- Oh, my gosh. - He didn't make a single mistake.

1341
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:47,291
- That was insane. - Let's go.

1342
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,391
I ride the beat and spit it

1343
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:49,422
- Let's go! - I shed my skin like a snake

1344
00:55:49,422 --> 00:55:50,762
I fill the emptiness, the feeling of my mula

1345
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:52,161
The blurred pupil reflects evel

1346
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:53,862
The rhythms are filled with trust

1347
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:55,362
(The rhythms are filled with trust)

1348
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:56,932
Empty audio, Pinocchio

1349
00:55:57,032 --> 00:55:58,101
Raise your hands.

1350
00:55:58,101 --> 00:55:59,961
- Empty audio, Pinocchio - Raise your hands.

1351
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:02,302
Now, leave this song behind and run away

1352
00:56:05,672 --> 00:56:06,972
With my small steps

1353
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:09,141
- Should we save him? - I don't think this is right.

1354
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,481
Runway, I can't stop snoring

1355
00:56:10,481 --> 00:56:11,811
All those expensive things

1356
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:13,282
- He's barely doing it. - The sound of crying foxes

1357
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:14,751
They're acting big

1358
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,411
They see the tag and lag

1359
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:17,851
I'm going to shave the side of my head

1360
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:19,552
- Get rid of those money leeches - Raise your hands.

1361
00:56:19,552 --> 00:56:21,391
- Right. - Why do they not raise their hands?

1362
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:22,652
I keep floating

1363
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:23,961
Why do they not raise their hands?

1364
00:56:24,922 --> 00:56:26,362
Cut it.

1365
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:27,362
This isn't going to work.

1366
00:56:28,262 --> 00:56:30,362
We should eliminate someone quickly. There you go.

1367
00:56:30,362 --> 00:56:33,972
(He'll be eliminated if the majority of them raise their hands.)

1368
00:56:34,802 --> 00:56:37,702
gamma is dead.

1369
00:56:41,612 --> 00:56:42,612
Oh, gosh.

1370
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:45,742
The leader of Block Eight, gamma, is eliminated.

1371
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:49,382
You did your best.

1372
00:56:49,581 --> 00:56:51,922
Only one of them was eliminated so far.

1373
00:56:51,922 --> 00:56:54,251
- Loopy is so cool. - Darn!

1374
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:57,092
Nice!

1375
00:56:57,092 --> 00:56:59,222
- Keep going like that. Nice. - Oh, my gosh.

1376
00:56:59,222 --> 00:57:01,391
- This is fun. - The leaders are amazing.

1377
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:03,532
- This is too much. - They're great.

1378
00:57:08,101 --> 00:57:09,371
- You worked hard. - You worked hard.

1379
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:10,702
- Good job. You worked hard. - You worked hard.

1380
00:57:10,702 --> 00:57:11,802
You worked hard.

1381
00:57:11,802 --> 00:57:13,371
- Well done. - You did your best.

1382
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:15,271
- I'm really sorry. - Don't say that.

1383
00:57:16,512 --> 00:57:17,541
My goodness.

1384
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:21,452
It felt like my pride was crushed.

1385
00:57:23,552 --> 00:57:26,621
It's a difficult mission for anyone.

1386
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,152
It was a crushing defeat.

1387
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:30,722
I think he was pressured...

1388
00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:33,322
as he went out as the leader of the team.

1389
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:35,891
The red cube is so humiliating.

1390
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:37,061
The red light?

1391
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:39,061
It suddenly looks like a butcher's.

1392
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:40,302
It's scary.

1393
00:57:40,802 --> 00:57:42,871
JP is unbelievable.

1394
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:45,742
I think these guys were meant to become leaders.

1395
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:47,472
It really surprised me.

1396
00:57:47,641 --> 00:57:50,112
- They're crazy. - They're leaders for a reason.

1397
00:57:50,112 --> 00:57:52,411
Oh, right. This was RAP:PUBLIC.

1398
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:54,182
It felt like I was watching a movie.

1399
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:57,152
- JP, you're doing great. - JP, you're doing so well.

1400
00:57:57,322 --> 00:57:58,621
But step backward just a little.

1401
00:57:58,621 --> 00:58:00,891
Or they would want to give the mic to you.

1402
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:03,121
But you're so cool, JP.

1403
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,661
- Be quiet. - Hey, don't encourage him.

1404
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:07,592
I'm just rooting for him.

1405
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:09,061
I genuinely like his rap.

1406
00:58:09,061 --> 00:58:10,561
This is too much.

1407
00:58:10,561 --> 00:58:12,461
- Fleeky Bang used so many verses. - It's so scary.

1408
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:14,501
We're in trouble. This is unbelievable.

1409
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:16,231
- They were fighting each other. - Boi B saved his verses.

1410
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,302
He saved his verses.

1411
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:19,842
- It's so nice. - It's good for us.

1412
00:58:19,842 --> 00:58:22,112
Hey, you're doing well.

1413
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:24,742
- This is super intense. - I'm worried more and more.

1414
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:25,782
I know.

1415
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:28,612
- You got this. - Chaboom, you got this.

1416
00:58:28,782 --> 00:58:30,311
Yes.

1417
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:32,021
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1418
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:33,791
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1419
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:34,851
- Yes! - You can do it!

1420
00:58:34,851 --> 00:58:37,322
- JP! - You can do it.

1421
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:38,691
Boi B, you got this.

1422
00:58:38,691 --> 00:58:42,132
- You got this. - Go!

1423
00:58:42,362 --> 00:58:43,492
Let's go.

1424
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:47,501
You got this!

1425
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:50,072
- Go, Fleeky! - You're doing great.

1426
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:51,641
- Kaogaii. - Kaogaii.

1427
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:53,472
- Kaogaii. - Kaogaii.

1428
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:55,612
Start.

1429
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:56,811
(Round 2 of the Infinite Cypher has started.)

1430
00:58:58,512 --> 00:58:59,941
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1431
00:59:00,981 --> 00:59:02,351
JP is going first again. Let's go.

1432
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:04,722
- He's amazing. - Darn. JP.

1433
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:08,521
I was attacked a lot in the beginning.

1434
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:10,521
I wanted to show that I would not lose here.

1435
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:11,592
Oh, darn it.

1436
00:59:11,992 --> 00:59:14,291
- How many verses does he have? - Darn. JP.

1437
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:16,632
- Go for it. - Save your verses, you crazy punk.

1438
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:18,632
It feels suffocating, keep in mind that I've changed

1439
00:59:18,632 --> 00:59:19,762
- Darn it. - Accept it

1440
00:59:19,762 --> 00:59:21,132
There's nothing to block me, you spotted

1441
00:59:21,132 --> 00:59:23,032
- What is this? - The highest speed, andante

1442
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:24,541
- I'm not even a half of it - This is unbelievable.

1443
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:25,771
But I came back to this place

1444
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,141
Now, the time passed midnight

1445
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,512
- What's this? - Do you still believe in people?

1446
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:30,441
- I feel betrayed, I see your blood - The rhythms are crazy.

1447
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,941
I saw everything, in the meantime, I be chasing for the dollars

1448
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:35,552
I didn't know I would come this far when I grow up

1449
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:36,552
Play by the rules

1450
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:37,782
- Sudden bad news - Don't come.

1451
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,882
- Please don't come. - When I count to two, I hit you

1452
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:40,182
- Like I'm Master Shifu - He's good.

1453
00:59:40,182 --> 00:59:42,351
- Seriously? - Loopy?

1454
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:43,822
Care about yourself, everybody, breathe

1455
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:45,222
- Because I said so - If he picks on a fight,

1456
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:46,262
I'll give him that.

1457
00:59:46,422 --> 00:59:47,561
JP!

1458
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:49,592
- JP! - Who is next?

1459
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:52,632
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1460
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:54,371
Fleeky Bang!

1461
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:58,041
- Yes, let's go. - Yes.

1462
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,302
I think he's doomed.

1463
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,371
YEL, when I show up, an earthquake occurs in Korea

1464
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:04,941
They're TWICE because they all "TT"

1465
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:07,282
I don't play safe, I only take a risk

1466
01:00:07,282 --> 01:00:08,512
Tray B, KAY G, Runner J4

1467
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:09,512
- I'm a Big Fleeky - Let's go.

1468
01:00:09,512 --> 01:00:11,121
- He's good. - If you're curious about me

1469
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,152
Check out the Namuwiki

1470
01:00:12,152 --> 01:00:14,452
If you disrespect me, you'll earn a ticket to the fiery pit

1471
01:00:14,452 --> 01:00:16,791
If you're curious about me, check out the Namuwki

1472
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:20,291
What you're going to see is your dead body

1473
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:22,331
(Fleeky Bang chooses JP.)

1474
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:23,902
- Oh, my gosh! - Yes.

1475
01:00:23,902 --> 01:00:24,902
- It's JP again. - Don't give me false hope

1476
01:00:24,902 --> 01:00:25,932
Every night

1477
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:26,932
- It's crazy. - I realized

1478
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:28,072
When I checked it as if I was busting

1479
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:29,371
Maybe that's the way we interact

1480
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:30,432
- From one another - He's almost a rapping machine.

1481
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:31,472
I thought I would do it someday

1482
01:00:31,472 --> 01:00:33,842
- I moved on and stayed up all night - He messed with the wrong person.

1483
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,641
Money move, it doesn't feel like I've come a long way

1484
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:38,012
You're not going to make it anyway

1485
01:00:38,012 --> 01:00:39,811
The spiritual bonding, I say everything is in your mind

1486
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:41,351
- Keep that in mind - Oh, my gosh.

1487
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:43,081
To the paradise, goodbye

1488
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:46,081
That's crazy.

1489
01:00:46,081 --> 01:00:48,952
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1490
01:00:48,952 --> 01:00:51,161
It was like, "Try me. I'm annoying, right?"

1491
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:53,822
I chose him as I wanted to win against him.

1492
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:56,362
- Nice. - Yes.

1493
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:57,632
I want a paper

1494
01:00:57,632 --> 01:00:58,702
KAY G, RUNNER, racer

1495
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:01,202
I'm going to make it no matter what, it's my big data

1496
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:04,101
Those losers say they want to make it, but they're slow

1497
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:06,601
Hustle, grind, I'm the epitome of it

1498
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,972
When you're wasting time, Big Fleeky already made it

1499
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:10,041
Coward rappers, go home

1500
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,682
- Play with your girlfriend - He's good.

1501
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:14,251
He avoided JP.

1502
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:16,012
- Nice defense, Fleeky Bang. - Yes.

1503
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:18,152
- Let's go! - Everyone is good.

1504
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:19,682
What's this?

1505
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:23,351
The earth revolves around money, I'm sorry, Galileo Galilei

1506
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:24,391
Others have Class 2 Ordinary license

1507
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:25,661
I have Type 1 Large and reverse park a truck

1508
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:27,121
His rap is intense.

1509
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:30,262
I'm going to cut off the fingers of the rappers who had it easy

1510
01:01:30,262 --> 01:01:32,302
All my prices have risen

1511
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:35,072
They shout filled with narcissism, everyone is Korea's Snoop Dogg

1512
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:36,371
What's up, doug, what's up, cousin

1513
01:01:36,371 --> 01:01:37,672
Hey, someone is having a blast these days

1514
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:39,842
Let me join them and taste it like Hwang Kyo Ik

1515
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:42,871
Here comes His Majesty, keep your tension even if you're anxious

1516
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:45,211
Smile, light, camera, action, and cut

1517
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:47,311
- It's you again. - My gosh.

1518
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:50,052
(Chaboom chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1519
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:51,052
"It's you again."

1520
01:01:51,952 --> 01:01:54,191
He's in danger now.

1521
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:55,621
- Let's go. - All right.

1522
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,461
- I guess he doesn't have any verse. - It must be so hard.

1523
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:01,592
He doesn't have anything left.

1524
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,161
- Yes. - Think quickly.

1525
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:05,432
Rich or die, I feel like I'm 50

1526
01:02:05,432 --> 01:02:07,572
Don't you ever kid me, when I'm with a woman, she is

1527
01:02:07,572 --> 01:02:09,532
- Oh, my gosh. - My goodness.

1528
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:11,172
Fetty Wap, you losers

1529
01:02:11,172 --> 01:02:12,242
Don't play with me

1530
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,941
Look who is around me, only the cool ones

1531
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:15,112
Yelling and dirty play with me

1532
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:17,481
Hey, I'm beating coward rappers

1533
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:21,012
Hey, look at what you guys doing

1534
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:23,581
I can't stand it

1535
01:02:24,052 --> 01:02:26,782
(Fleeky Bang chooses HAON.)

1536
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:27,891
Let's go!

1537
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:29,251
Let's go!

1538
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:31,521
The scholar spirit in 2020

1539
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:33,862
I don't let time chase me, I make them follow me

1540
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:36,262
It's 2am now, ain't got nothing to do

1541
01:02:36,262 --> 01:02:38,632
Everyone has their dawn, but they're confused

1542
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:41,231
I stretch my body, The media is too noisy

1543
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:43,632
I stay calm because it's nauseating here

1544
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:44,941
I hold the cane up like dad

1545
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:46,342
- Baby boy, why do you talk back? - You need to choose Fleeky Bang.

1546
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:48,742
I can't talk but I act well, I put my feet up while carrying the load

1547
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:50,711
It continues even if I don't like it It's obvious, I'm like okay, okay

1548
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:52,282
- He's really good. - You spoke of fair play

1549
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:53,742
But you close down after a few steps

1550
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:55,782
For example, you shouldn't pour water on fire

1551
01:02:55,782 --> 01:02:57,052
We just endure even in rain or snow

1552
01:02:57,052 --> 01:02:58,922
They close their eyes after checking the weather, I'm done

1553
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:03,391
He's so good.

1554
01:03:03,722 --> 01:03:05,021
HAON is really good.

1555
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,291
(HAON chooses Boi B.)

1556
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,731
- Let's go. - Let's go, Boi B!

1557
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:12,862
- Boi B. - Boi B!

1558
01:03:12,862 --> 01:03:15,001
Spend and earn again, Why you ball like that

1559
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:17,342
Teamplay hoodie, Why you dress like that

1560
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:19,072
- Came from bottom - I think it'll end...

1561
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:20,072
- Will you roll at the back door? - if he gives it to Fleeky Bang.

1562
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:22,342
Look at look at me now, I DM Incheon's mayor

1563
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:24,711
Check my aura, chosen one

1564
01:03:24,711 --> 01:03:27,952
Cheongdam, Hongae, Apgujeong wherever, just make it work

1565
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:34,021
- No. Please. Stop this. - He's done.

1566
01:03:34,152 --> 01:03:35,521
I feel bad for him now.

1567
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,691
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1568
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:37,992
- He's not in my team but it's sad. - Let's go.

1569
01:03:37,992 --> 01:03:38,992
Let's go.

1570
01:03:39,621 --> 01:03:40,661
It's here.

1571
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,092
It's what he's good at.

1572
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:45,362
- He's an expert. - Let's go!

1573
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:47,132
BIG SCH YEL, Whippin'

1574
01:03:47,132 --> 01:03:49,032
Up in the studio, Always rapping

1575
01:03:49,032 --> 01:03:50,632
Club trash tripping on me

1576
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:52,601
Bad little brats, I don't give them attention

1577
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:55,941
BIG YEL, you know the vibes, Look at the sky if you want enemies

1578
01:03:56,072 --> 01:03:59,481
Diss me if you hate me, I can make you a star

1579
01:04:02,682 --> 01:04:03,711
He's going to JP?

1580
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:05,952
(Fleeky Bang chooses JP.)

1581
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:10,092
I'm back on chopping lack of toxic, target like cancer

1582
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:13,021
Spank them then I pack my backpack, I don't care about their state

1583
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:14,691
Make some vicious sounds, and I be going back to Mars

1584
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:16,262
- How do you win against him? - She's been all alone

1585
01:04:16,262 --> 01:04:17,362
- That is what I know, - What's with him?

1586
01:04:17,362 --> 01:04:18,831
Good work cause you've been tripping on

1587
01:04:18,831 --> 01:04:20,902
- Unlike before I said whatever - Again? Let's go.

1588
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:21,932
It's crazy.

1589
01:04:21,932 --> 01:04:24,001
Yes sir, man it's been a long time

1590
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:25,001
So long, how you looked

1591
01:04:25,001 --> 01:04:26,041
- I don't even remember - He's so good.

1592
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,672
I walked these dirty streets

1593
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:28,742
Them be telling me

1594
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:30,711
- To find your own way - Isn't he an AI?

1595
01:04:30,782 --> 01:04:31,842
- JP is good. - It ain't the way I wanted

1596
01:04:31,842 --> 01:04:32,911
You made a mess

1597
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,911
Put them gang signs up, Put them up, pour them up now

1598
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:37,552
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1599
01:04:38,682 --> 01:04:40,481
Fleeky B-A-N-G-O-A-T

1600
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:42,021
Bang all the enemies

1601
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:44,092
My stack keeps stacking, Yours is also here

1602
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:45,191
But you can't get it back SCH YEL

1603
01:04:45,362 --> 01:04:46,961
- We rocking this club - He's in his flow.

1604
01:04:47,121 --> 01:04:49,092
I don't mess with these You'll already know that's fax

1605
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:52,601
I make violence even if you hate it, I got no clock but my AP is Silas

1606
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:56,202
Tell on their friends, Change the the direction of hip like a pilot

1607
01:04:58,001 --> 01:04:59,472
(Fleeky Bang chooses Boi B.)

1608
01:05:02,612 --> 01:05:06,141
I still hold unkind words and enter the booth every day

1609
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:10,282
The numbering changes even if I maintain the savior mood

1610
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:13,851
What, make business, Make another hit list

1611
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:17,891
I'll kindly draw a line, Your role is a witness

1612
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,621
Boi B is good.

1613
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:21,932
(Boi B chooses Loopy.)

1614
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:24,501
- Loopy. - Loopy!

1615
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:29,202
Gang, gang, gang

1616
01:05:31,572 --> 01:05:35,411
They're all but talk, I just put light on my name

1617
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:36,911
Open the hell gate, put it in front of you

1618
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:38,641
I'm taking it over, you never

1619
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:41,012
My verified name, You're not even tie level

1620
01:05:41,012 --> 01:05:42,452
- He still wants European - It's coming.

1621
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:43,452
I'm like whatever

1622
01:05:43,452 --> 01:05:45,722
If you think it's unfair do it, do better

1623
01:05:45,722 --> 01:05:47,422
I knew it, He's already done for me

1624
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:49,152
You can't hide it It shows on you, you're busted

1625
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:51,161
Don't try to teach me, ordinary person

1626
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:52,762
Change my resume and bucket list

1627
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:54,492
You never stood up, you fell

1628
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,891
You need someone else's pick since you've fallen

1629
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,702
I was actually a king since birth

1630
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:00,831
The team wants me I was born with this lead

1631
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:04,572
(Loopy chooses Chaboom.)

1632
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:05,902
This is so hard.

1633
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:08,271
Keep my stance forever like a child

1634
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:11,941
I still have overflowing strength

1635
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:15,411
Gucci clutch bag full of cash

1636
01:06:16,612 --> 01:06:20,052
A room prepared for me, International dot dot killer

1637
01:06:20,222 --> 01:06:22,592
No more monkey business, I'm gorilla

1638
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:26,092
A killer in a thriller movie The ultimate boss, main villain

1639
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:28,461
Feel the energy

1640
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:31,932
Little homie, so lower your tone

1641
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:36,001
Think, who you think you are, son? Beach Boys

1642
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,172
Chaboom keeps giving it to Fleeky Bang.

1643
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:42,512
Is it Fleeky Bang again?

1644
01:06:43,141 --> 01:06:44,172
Stop.

1645
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:48,282
It seemed like there was an unspoken agreement...

1646
01:06:48,282 --> 01:06:51,351
that they should eliminate Fleeky Bang first.

1647
01:06:51,481 --> 01:06:52,722
I hope they stop giving him the mic.

1648
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:57,822
Dirty play, soon be back

1649
01:06:57,891 --> 01:06:59,762
I'm in store with two hunnid racks

1650
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:03,191
They say Korean rappers are horrible They ramble on Instagram

1651
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:06,731
I walk in the party and I see an opp Tray, you know I'm going to spray

1652
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,231
Like nosebleed, They all jump around, get away

1653
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:11,771
- My enemy is Crayon Pop - He still has more verses.

1654
01:07:11,871 --> 01:07:12,941
I know.

1655
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:14,711
All the enemies go, Who got the knocks?

1656
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:16,211
All the enemies go, Who got the knocks?

1657
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:18,842
Really, in Korea, Who got the knocks?

1658
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:23,251
(Fleeky Bang chooses HAON.)

1659
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:24,922
Let's go.

1660
01:07:25,952 --> 01:07:29,592
A status lifter, the peacemaker walking demolition, A great filter

1661
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,322
Ain't no man going to stand right next to me

1662
01:07:31,322 --> 01:07:33,291
Say the name, your parents probably know me

1663
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:34,862
- It's coming. - Play the game, Who's the champion?

1664
01:07:34,862 --> 01:07:36,262
Blame on the player, go ahead

1665
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:37,961
If you wanna be a king slayer, No way

1666
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:40,762
We all know the flavor of success, Alchemy before the junks

1667
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:42,802
Is my hobby, I'm sorry, but you need a talent

1668
01:07:42,802 --> 01:07:43,802
Only gold in my mind

1669
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:44,802
- He's good. - The intentions are bad

1670
01:07:44,802 --> 01:07:46,402
The fake will try to smile but end up in tears

1671
01:07:46,402 --> 01:07:48,842
23, A recipe from going around the earth

1672
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:50,981
I'm so much fun without Hennessy

1673
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:53,512
Enemies, they didn't see my price, They all faint

1674
01:07:54,411 --> 01:07:56,952
- That was good. - Darn.

1675
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,121
Gosh, HAON.

1676
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:01,552
HAON.

1677
01:08:02,722 --> 01:08:04,362
He's good.

1678
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:06,262
What kind of beat is this?

1679
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:08,132
It's tricky.

1680
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:11,402
Let's get it.

1681
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:14,771
(Block 5's leader JP starts again.)

1682
01:08:16,201 --> 01:08:17,501
It's very slow this time.

1683
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:19,401
- It's difficult. - It's about 60BPM or something.

1684
01:08:19,741 --> 01:08:21,842
Darn it, brats, I'm out of the space

1685
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:23,442
- There's a flume in you - This is crazy.

1686
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,512
- I'm a murder - He's a machine.

1687
01:08:25,512 --> 01:08:26,581
You roll on the surface I got it

1688
01:08:26,581 --> 01:08:27,911
I feel like I am the demigod

1689
01:08:27,911 --> 01:08:29,151
You talking about, I got an AK in

1690
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,182
I know.

1691
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:31,781
Don't tell me nothing when I'm gone

1692
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:33,552
Cause your life's a mess, and I don't want to ruin it

1693
01:08:33,552 --> 01:08:36,552
So have a nice life and find someone to love and go bounce yourself

1694
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:37,692
He's really crazy.

1695
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,592
- He must be crazy. - Let's go.

1696
01:08:40,762 --> 01:08:42,331
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1697
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:44,092
Darn it. Why do they keep coming to him?

1698
01:08:44,262 --> 01:08:45,732
No. It's okay.

1699
01:08:48,071 --> 01:08:49,632
I don't stop even if there's a stop sign

1700
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:51,371
- SCH YEL, he going to do do spin - He has so many.

1701
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:53,001
All the Korean rappers are beautiful

1702
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:54,741
Because they sleep whenever we meet

1703
01:08:54,871 --> 01:08:56,371
I'm a winner no matter what he says

1704
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:58,081
But I'm not YELLIN, I'm A-Team

1705
01:08:58,081 --> 01:08:59,611
My life is a ten-million-viewer movie

1706
01:08:59,611 --> 01:09:01,552
- You're just a clip on YouTube - Let's go.

1707
01:09:01,552 --> 01:09:02,852
Born in 2002, I'm a ball baby

1708
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:04,781
That's why I'm good at balling

1709
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:08,022
He's calling me cus I might be famous, I won't accept, I'm sleepy

1710
01:09:08,222 --> 01:09:09,552
- No kizzy, No kidding - He has lots of verses.

1711
01:09:09,552 --> 01:09:12,821
I'm sliding if he overtakes me, Fleeky Bang, I can't miss a party

1712
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,302
(Fleeky Bang chooses HAON.)

1713
01:09:21,302 --> 01:09:22,772
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1714
01:09:24,802 --> 01:09:26,701
Nothing changes, I'm not done with preaching

1715
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:28,241
You keep the amygdala on

1716
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,111
In your system that just spits out any words

1717
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:31,611
I'll make a change

1718
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:34,512
My condition is CEO, I'm my boss like Jay Park

1719
01:09:34,512 --> 01:09:38,022
Get complicated, sometime my emote Feet move to the mic, Record

1720
01:09:38,022 --> 01:09:39,581
They would pull their hair, but give me 20 minutes

1721
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:41,491
A new song comes out, The secret to my hair texture

1722
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,092
I don't even need an air conditioner,

1723
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:44,722
There's no fever in my head

1724
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,661
There's no fever in my head

1725
01:09:50,661 --> 01:09:52,461
(HAON chooses Loopy.)

1726
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:57,232
This must be tiresome too.

1727
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:01,911
All the rest are obvious, I take out my knife

1728
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:05,111
Take out new clothes, Feels great

1729
01:10:05,111 --> 01:10:08,552
It's raining, now no cap, We dance slow

1730
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:11,821
Eating chocolate pudding after shopping, My amazing life's a movie

1731
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:13,852
First shake it, Jonny Dang

1732
01:10:13,852 --> 01:10:15,552
Chain on my neck you cannot pay

1733
01:10:15,552 --> 01:10:17,192
I do it every day, You can fail

1734
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:18,861
- He's relaxed. - Cashing out daily, You can't say

1735
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:20,762
- Got many and get more again - It's so good.

1736
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:22,192
It's still not enough

1737
01:10:22,432 --> 01:10:24,132
Burn lots of packs

1738
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:25,701
Pack it in my bag

1739
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:27,701
That was crazy.

1740
01:10:28,932 --> 01:10:30,201
Let's go, Loopy.

1741
01:10:31,241 --> 01:10:32,442
He's coming again.

1742
01:10:32,442 --> 01:10:33,541
(Loopy chooses Kaogaii.)

1743
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,472
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1744
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:39,982
I don't go back to the past, I go the highway not in low speed

1745
01:10:40,142 --> 01:10:41,911
If you fell in love with me just keep living there

1746
01:10:41,911 --> 01:10:43,812
- Taegeukgi flapping doesn't change - He's amazing.

1747
01:10:43,812 --> 01:10:46,852
A trash in human shape, Kitsyojii next to me, better than me

1748
01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:48,422
Show my seed money more and beep it

1749
01:10:48,422 --> 01:10:50,151
- I really respect that. - Miracle finally came

1750
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:51,762
Liquidating poverty on this road

1751
01:10:51,762 --> 01:10:53,491
Darn you, We'll skyrocket

1752
01:10:53,491 --> 01:10:56,361
Green notes, you're my love and inspiration forever

1753
01:10:56,361 --> 01:10:58,001
- He's good, indeed. - Like hitting my friend's bully

1754
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:00,132
Cutting through the uncertain past on full speed

1755
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:01,371
Negative moles, I won't do it even if it pays well

1756
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:03,102
Just shut it if it's not a plus

1757
01:11:03,102 --> 01:11:05,302
The poor times flashing in the side mirror

1758
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,871
I don't want to see it Just fold it and drive, I'm back

1759
01:11:07,102 --> 01:11:10,472
Don't worry, fans, We somehow survive in the end, He said

1760
01:11:10,472 --> 01:11:13,182
Wanted to punch Kitsyojii's mouth who keeps shouting we go up

1761
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:16,352
But you can do it too, Shout it, You'll really go up

1762
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,321
(Kaokaii chooses JP.)

1763
01:11:21,321 --> 01:11:22,651
Why is he giving it to us?

1764
01:11:22,722 --> 01:11:25,262
JP. Again?

1765
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:27,661
I do nothing, Stay up all night daily, That's nothing

1766
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:29,161
You want something more stimulating, Know what I'm saying?

1767
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:30,892
- He did it. - You probably want something else

1768
01:11:30,892 --> 01:11:32,401
I can't take it back no more, It's a bit tricky

1769
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:34,461
My ears didn't change in a while

1770
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:35,802
- But it's okay now, Bright future - Didn't he do more than ten verses?

1771
01:11:35,802 --> 01:11:37,571
There's nothing like it, I keep bringing up new works

1772
01:11:37,571 --> 01:11:39,172
I guess I looked easy, Then see you on the next page

1773
01:11:39,172 --> 01:11:40,401
- Is it Fleeky Bang again? - You acting like some rockstars

1774
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:42,041
- It's not easy, so I left it empty - Fleeky Bang again?

1775
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,071
Did you see silky hair like this?

1776
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,842
I kept going to Fleeky Bang.

1777
01:11:46,012 --> 01:11:47,781
I wanted to get him.

1778
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:51,522
That's cheap, Don't judge whatever the case is

1779
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:52,522
If not, you're the target

1780
01:11:52,522 --> 01:11:54,382
Spending more time on this back and forth

1781
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:55,852
- Shouldn't he throw in the towel? - I hope you know that

1782
01:11:55,852 --> 01:11:57,022
- I feel so bad. - I know you all have your worries

1783
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:58,321
But I don't have the capacity to care about that too

1784
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:59,361
You guessed it, son

1785
01:11:59,762 --> 01:12:01,861
(JP chooses Fleeky Bang.)

1786
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:05,932
They all passed the mic to me.

1787
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:08,932
It seemed like they all wanted to eliminate me.

1788
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:11,102
So I think I'll do my best instead.

1789
01:12:16,472 --> 01:12:17,812
Fleeky move oppy

1790
01:12:17,812 --> 01:12:19,382
Hop out the V, They know what I did

1791
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:20,982
I see an opp, Tray's going to click

1792
01:12:20,982 --> 01:12:22,751
Internet gangster pointing fingers

1793
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:24,352
Like, shining even brighter, Drip

1794
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,081
Oh, my gosh, I've become blind

1795
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:27,552
042, Them city got back

1796
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,352
It's my Ninjas 2, I'm with the YEL

1797
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,262
- Why does he have so many verses? - Wilding back in the day, 042 YEL

1798
01:12:31,422 --> 01:12:32,791
- He's very good. - Every opp shot

1799
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:33,791
You know I'm a vet

1800
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,531
Blah blah on Instagram, Do it, get back

1801
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:37,732
They'll be taken if you see me, Your chain and money

1802
01:12:37,732 --> 01:12:38,961
And your soul too, take that like

1803
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:40,732
I think they rapped at least 30 times all together.

1804
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,172
I don't need a gun because I'm the bang, like

1805
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,241
- Oh, my. - Yes.

1806
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,901
He's good!

1807
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:47,911
(Fleeky Bang chooses HAON.)

1808
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:49,111
- Hey. - This is crazy.

1809
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:51,111
Everyone is amazing.

1810
01:12:51,111 --> 01:12:53,182
- Fleeky Bang is amazing. - I know, right?

1811
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:55,251
- Seriously. - He's rapping like a machine.

1812
01:12:55,382 --> 01:12:56,951
They're too good.

1813
01:12:57,052 --> 01:12:58,121
- It's Boom Bap. - Yes.

1814
01:12:58,121 --> 01:12:59,451
My gosh.

1815
01:12:59,451 --> 01:13:00,682
Okay.

1816
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:06,621
Guess who's back, tell them I'm back

1817
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:08,432
Bring a lot, Bring anyone here

1818
01:13:08,432 --> 01:13:10,031
Do your best, my name on top

1819
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:11,531
Wherever it is, parking lot, back yard,

1820
01:13:11,531 --> 01:13:12,861
Even a rooftop can be my stage

1821
01:13:12,861 --> 01:13:14,871
Then you can meet my two feet

1822
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:16,831
You are yawning as if you're on vacation

1823
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:17,901
I can make you sleep

1824
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:20,302
With a pure face, I'm chasing for my goal

1825
01:13:20,302 --> 01:13:22,842
I don't want to see a loser when I stand in front of the mirror

1826
01:13:22,842 --> 01:13:23,942
I'll plan more things

1827
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,611
I trust it and never doubt it

1828
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:27,342
Why? This question is funny

1829
01:13:27,342 --> 01:13:28,911
As if throwing an egg at a rock

1830
01:13:28,911 --> 01:13:31,081
You don't seem to understand, Look at my results

1831
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:33,382
I bet myself and I'm growing fast

1832
01:13:33,382 --> 01:13:34,791
- I love his verse. - I throw

1833
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:35,892
A fast-breaking pitch slider

1834
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:37,592
Yes I'm a rider, When I go low

1835
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:39,361
Lower your eyes or shut your mouth

1836
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:40,722
Knocking you out like football

1837
01:13:40,722 --> 01:13:42,692
I started to enjoy the pain, and it became an addiction

1838
01:13:42,692 --> 01:13:45,701
Let's just embrace it and move forward like a bulldog

1839
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:51,232
- Yes. - We never lose.

1840
01:13:55,442 --> 01:13:56,972
- No! - For goodness' sake.

1841
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:59,241
Chaboom's going to soar on this stage.

1842
01:13:59,241 --> 01:14:00,541
- Steal. - Chaboom!

1843
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,882
- Steal. - I think he'll do well.

1844
01:14:01,882 --> 01:14:03,852
This song is true story, real life

1845
01:14:03,852 --> 01:14:06,482
Tick-tock, my defiant rap, you know what time it is

1846
01:14:06,482 --> 01:14:07,821
- Without connections or backing - Nice.

1847
01:14:07,821 --> 01:14:09,222
- Keep doing my business - Keep doing my business

1848
01:14:09,222 --> 01:14:11,821
I bet my life on the two syllables of my name, Chaboom

1849
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:14,262
I walk only one path, just like fight my way

1850
01:14:14,262 --> 01:14:16,661
In the style of the 80s, I still bet my life

1851
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,562
My rap is overflowing, Get it down, bro

1852
01:14:20,432 --> 01:14:21,831
- My goodness. - Darn.

1853
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:23,701
- Yes! - My gosh.

1854
01:14:23,701 --> 01:14:25,541
They keep choosing Fleeky Bang.

1855
01:14:25,972 --> 01:14:27,071
Gosh, here...

1856
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,741
I don't think he has any verse for this BPM.

1857
01:14:29,272 --> 01:14:30,512
He's doomed.

1858
01:14:31,942 --> 01:14:32,982
Fleeky Bang is doing Boom Bap?

1859
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:34,812
I'm excited. Let's go!

1860
01:14:37,012 --> 01:14:39,151
I think he has something.

1861
01:14:39,151 --> 01:14:41,592
One, two, let's go!

1862
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:43,321
I don't need backup, Flossing, I stack up

1863
01:14:43,321 --> 01:14:45,922
KAY G, do pack up, I'll need a stripper

1864
01:14:45,922 --> 01:14:47,461
From now on

1865
01:14:47,762 --> 01:14:48,831
I'm sorry.

1866
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,932
I tried, but I ran out of verses.

1867
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:54,461
- You did well. - I wanted to keep trying.

1868
01:14:54,461 --> 01:14:56,071
No. You were cool.

1869
01:14:56,302 --> 01:14:57,831
Seriously. Let's go!

1870
01:14:58,201 --> 01:14:59,642
You did well!

1871
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,642
- You did well! - He's so cool.

1872
01:15:07,482 --> 01:15:08,711
He rapped a lot.

1873
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:10,911
- Right. - He did a lot.

1874
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:12,581
- He used up everything. - Oh, my gosh.

1875
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:14,422
It's amazing that he came this far.

1876
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:17,621
This is seriously...

1877
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:19,562
I respect you!

1878
01:15:20,491 --> 01:15:22,062
- Thanks for your effort. - You did so well.

1879
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:26,802
Block One's leader, Fleeky Bang is eliminated.

1880
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:29,302
- Fleeky Bang, you did well. - You're the best.

1881
01:15:29,302 --> 01:15:31,571
- I'm sorry. - You did really well.

1882
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:33,472
- Great job. - You did very well.

1883
01:15:33,472 --> 01:15:34,541
- You did well. - I'm sorry.

1884
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,172
I felt sad and bad for him.

1885
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:38,911
Fleeky Bang rapped a lot.

1886
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,382
He was ganged up on.

1887
01:15:40,611 --> 01:15:41,951
They kept giving the microphone to him.

1888
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:44,982
(From the start of Round 1 until the end of Round 2,)

1889
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:48,491
(he was chosen 15 times.)

1890
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:50,692
They found a way to win.

1891
01:15:50,692 --> 01:15:52,692
I did my best.

1892
01:15:52,692 --> 01:15:55,432
I have no regrets at all, so I feel very relieved.

1893
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,361
It seems like we really are a strong competition.

1894
01:15:58,732 --> 01:16:01,262
Actually, he's the winner.

1895
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:02,972
How many times did he rap?

1896
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:04,842
How many times did he rap?

1897
01:16:05,142 --> 01:16:06,501
It's amazing.

1898
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:09,241
I thought he was only good at one genre.

1899
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:10,741
I guess I had some prejudices.

1900
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:12,142
Fleeky Bang did really well.

1901
01:16:12,142 --> 01:16:15,081
I thought he didn't have a lot of experience in cypher.

1902
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:17,552
I thought he wouldn't do well, but he was very good.

1903
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:18,882
He was like a wild beast.

1904
01:16:19,552 --> 01:16:20,621
Fleeky Bang.

1905
01:16:21,151 --> 01:16:23,192
I like you.

1906
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:27,121
(A competitive rap battle between the leaders)

1907
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:28,291
You're awesome!

1908
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:32,331
(Infinite cypher)

1909
01:16:32,331 --> 01:16:34,661
(So you need to be this good.)

1910
01:16:35,172 --> 01:16:36,272
(They're monsters.)

1911
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,942
(A competitive battle...)

1912
01:16:38,942 --> 01:16:41,772
(between the leaders over the Block Money)

1913
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:44,642
(Kaogaii is so cool.)

1914
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:45,882
(Let me eat you up.)

1915
01:16:45,882 --> 01:16:46,911
(I'm going again. Bring it on.)

1916
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,552
(Members of RAP:PUBLIC,)

1917
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:52,422
(welcome to the village.)

1918
01:16:52,422 --> 01:16:54,052
(This is a city.)

1919
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:55,892
(The scale is huge.)

1920
01:16:57,022 --> 01:16:58,961
(It looks like a real bar.)

1921
01:16:58,961 --> 01:16:59,961
(What?)

1922
01:17:00,722 --> 01:17:03,491
(This is why I didn't want to be a leader.)

1923
01:17:04,232 --> 01:17:05,961
(The first block match of RAP:PUBLIC)

1924
01:17:06,262 --> 01:17:07,401
(Block Breaking)

1925
01:17:07,401 --> 01:17:08,531
(How are we breaking it?)

1926
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:10,302
(Through battles between the blocks,)

1927
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:11,432
(you can eliminate...)

1928
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:13,142
(all the members of your opponent.)

1929
01:17:13,142 --> 01:17:14,342
(This is the main match.)

1930
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:15,411
(Block 8 looks delicious.)

1931
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:17,071
(There's no choice. The weakest gets eliminated.)

1932
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:18,482
- Block 8. - Block 8.

1933
01:17:18,482 --> 01:17:19,882
(I chose them because they looked weak.)

1934
01:17:19,882 --> 01:17:20,911
(I was annoyed.)

1935
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:22,951
(It's time to show our skills.)

1936
01:17:22,951 --> 01:17:24,012
(Where are you going?)

1937
01:17:27,052 --> 01:17:28,522
(I think Block 8 will win.)

1938
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:32,222
(I was disappointed in myself.)
