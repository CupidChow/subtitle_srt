48

You need to take the stage in ten seconds to enter.

49
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,500
- Darn. Let's do this. - Yes.

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,438
- Can I do it? - Go ahead.

51
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,508
- I should do this, right? - Take the stage.

52
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,378
- If you can do it, come on out. - It's better to come out.

53
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,909
Four, three, two, one.

This is intense. This is no joke.

56
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,989
The spirits were important.

57
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,658
My team had the spirits.

58
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,418
We decided to keep up with our spirits.

59
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,158
Our block took control. We just need to solidify it.

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,329
- Block 1 lost in Rounds 1 and 2. - We can't let our guard down.

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,300
I said, "Let's take the stage if we can rap to the beat."

62
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,969
What do you think is bpm?

63
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,339
I don't know.

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,639
The only thought in my mind was, "We need to win the Block Money."

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,538
Everyone, we'll begin right away.

66
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,179

Koreans do hip-hop and Americans do taekwondo

Whether you like it or not, you'll have to listen

175
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,479
To the album I put together, I'm a kind of a legend

176

Hop on my whip, GBC is drunk

177
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,049
Fans who earn money and fill up the venue memorize songs

178
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,758
Ah, for the jail that locked up the young ones

179
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,559
I don't bust down, but I'm doing good, unfair

180
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,729
My soul comes alive

181
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,559
- You hang yourself on a necklace - He's so good.

182
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,500

193

Those people always want to settle

194
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,669
The rappers here are too strong

195
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,929
I'm going

196
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,669
Am I trembling?

197
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,438
Am I trembling? Say it

Am I trembling right now?

199
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:28,409
I have no sponsor, boyfriend, someone who can help me

200
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,148
Only you guys can help me today

201

Please, I'm begging you

202
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,789

Who hasn't gone yet?

215
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,278
I continued to wait.

216

While watching Rounds 1 and 2,

217
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,960
it occurred to me that people who went later had an advantage.

218
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,589
- Let's go. - Let's go.

I won't come back here again

222
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,028
I talk big because I have to leave

223
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,369
What I always say is, "More"

224
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,768
Behind me is a cliff

225
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,199
If you're going to fall behind, just quit

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,609
My money and blood are new

227
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,939
They're like nails to you who lagged behind

228
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,709
- Start over, I never questioned it - He's really good.

229
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,778
I'm going to go, I probably won't stop

230
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,109
I must soar into the night sky, No one can hold me down

231
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,548
Even if your ears are stuffed, you'll understand me

232
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:36,979
Even if the stars fall, I must climb the wall

233
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,250
And move on when the night falls

234
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,749
Say goodbye to the present

235
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,089
Those who deserve to sink will sink

236
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,450
Keep your eyes open and watch because I'll remain

237
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,119
I can't keep things PG-rated, I make things R-rated and run

238

But I ain't worried

242
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,398
That punk is begging for attention, I watch and learn

243
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,469
My movements come as a series, This is what I wanted

244
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,798

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,038
- They watch and I feel the stare - How is he so good?

247
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,308

257

Mckdaddy ripped up the stage.

258
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:25,960

263
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,740
I was wondering when I should enter.

264
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,379
I waited until the end...

265
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,308
because I wanted to take responsibility...

266
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,909
and acquire the Block Money.

267
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,388
I'm not done with preaching, I'm not even Christian

268

You said I was in crisis, Run your mouth, boy, I'm priceless

269
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,859
You thought I was playing around, I was different since my school days

270

If you compare yourself to me, You'll see it each time

271
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:57,028
Your guilty conscience, I'm beyond

272
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,298
All of that You yippity yappity yappin' about

273
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:01,969
It isn't my duty to prove myself every time you suspect me

274
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,768
If you want me to service you, You'd better pay me right

275
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:07,469
Who wanted peace from the start? Boy, you're tweaking out

276
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,709
Sorry, I'm done being nice, You say I changed and speak rudely

277
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,908
Now, I'll go, stupid, You'd better not change

278
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,949
Yes, keep the same energy I won't look for one year

And you'd better not play that brain game

281
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,278
I do that way better

282
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,319

I was disappointed.

Between 1st and 2nd places,

309
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,219
there's a difference of one vote.

310

(There's a difference of one vote.)

311
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,619
- Who is it? - I think Mckdaddy will win.

312
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,820
Mckdaddy did well.

313
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,428
Mckdaddy overwhelmed the audience...

314
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,258
with his skillful rap.

315
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,730
I think it was perfect in every way.

316
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,529
Please.

317
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,899
This is...

318
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,139
The reaction was definitely different.

319
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,299
Was it HAON?

320
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,240
His vibe was definitely different.

321
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,870
I could tell that he was relaxed.

322
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,809
I watched his performance in awe.

323
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,379
Any one of them could be the winner.

324
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,750

325
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,149
I need to rank first.

326

Mckdaddy, get your cash...

331
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,149
and go back to your seat.

332
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,278
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank goodness.

333
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,349
- Mckdaddy. - My goodness.

334
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,490
Seriously.

335
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,860
It was a strategy.

336
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,419
He went toward the end. I think that was important.

337

339
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,959

340

Well done. Good job, brother.

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,419
we fell to third place.

348
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,919
It's upsetting.

349
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,090
Another team came from behind.

350
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,158
We can't put our guard down.

351
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,519
I thought, "We have to do this as if our lives depend on it."

352
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:17,628
Let's begin Round Four right away.

353
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,829
Everyone, you need to bet 1,000 dollars again.

354
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,428
Bet 1,000 dollars. Let's go.

355
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,499
Put up your bread.

356
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,570
We have so much money.

357
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,639
- Let's go. - Let's go.

358
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,569
- Let's go. - Let's win.

359
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,269
- Let's win. - Let's get it.

360
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,409
There's 5,000 dollars.

361
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,409
(Block Money betting is completed.)

362
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,710
Which beat will we get? I'm a bit excited.

363
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,620
DJ Holiship, let's go.

364
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,820
- I don't have a verse. - Come on out to enter.

365
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,419
- Let's go. - Save your verses.

366
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,330
Loopy entered, so save your verses.

367
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,929
Is this the main beat for anyone?

368
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,330
- Hold on. - Who wants it?

369
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,399
I can do it.

370
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,039
Are you going to do it?

371
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,500
Does anyone want to go?

372
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,668
- Okay. - I don't have one.

373
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,839
While I'm not certain about it...

374
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,909
How about your verse? Can you kill other blocks with it?

375
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,778
It suits the beat perfectly.

376
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,950
Then you should go. It's best to continue the energy.

377
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,250
Go. You go.

378
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,819
You can go.

379
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,878
Nosun, just go out here.

380
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,918
This isn't something to think about. We need to buy time.

381
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,690
I'll begin the countdown. Ten.

382
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:18,919
- Nosun! - Nine.

383
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,918
Eight. Seven.

384
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,258
Two. One.

385
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,199
Now, there's no chance to enter.

386
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,258
These will be the participants.

387
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,330
DJ Holiship, drop that beat. Let's go!

388
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,799
Let's give more energy.

389
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,869
Let's steal another block's chance to place first.

390
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,509
That was my strategy.

391
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,048
(Block 2's Loopy enters Round 4.)

392
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,209
If you see me, You'll see these ice, ice on my neck

393
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,018
Rain gang shawty, Got some beats with a pack

394
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,749
Get lost with your team or gang, Is that what you think?

395
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,119
What I want isn't fame, I want to take a lot of cash

396
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,959
K, K, I wrote it on the neck, Three Ks and Bapes

397
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,699
Bapes, Bapestas on my feet It's pretty, call it lemonade

398
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,499
Ring, yes, pinky rings See my Cuban links

399
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,898
King with some pieces, Yuna Kim

400
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,599
I don't know the heat, I freeze everything

401
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,008
I have a cramp on my neck, I walk slowly

402
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,768
What I have on my shoulder is Gucci

403
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,378
I'm not highly-educated, but I don't mind, I'll make money

404
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,349
I freeze everything here, No, she wants some more

(Block 2's Nosun enters Round 4.)

419
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,148
I saw it in my dream last night, My dead brothers, my slimes

420
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,989
My mind is messed up, but I gotta work, so I do it

421
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,620
We have no choice, life is short, out of time

422
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,018
That's just how it goes, Man, all we gotta shine

423
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,888
Smoking heavy, I got pain all up inside my lungs

424
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,328
Demons steady chasing on me, I've been on the run

425
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,699
I take medication, Big 40, I'm out of patience

426
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,839
You run when you see my big gun, Your population always goes down

427
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,939
I can't look back, I see all my fears when I do

428
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,108

I'm the new lunatic in your generation, what about it?

442
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,139
Break it, break it up, Do it all over again

443
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,879
Are Americans really like this? I say

444
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,749
When I grow old, my knees will give out first

445
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,518
When things get rotten, it'll become more apparent

446
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,690
The broken fingers take on a different color

447
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,359
(Block 3's Reddy enters Round 4.)

448

451

I'll go again.

452
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,499
I relax my voice, My voice is like T-Pain's

453
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,639
They're too chill, But I'm working on my six-packs

454
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,379
So that money flows in easily

455
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,450
I stick it deep in my ears, Then my gold will be yellow

456
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,949
Lower the pants, hey

457
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,789
You can add the swag for ten percent

458
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,419
If you can't win, go home

459
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,690
Unless I get a big break, I'm going home

460
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,528
We're too hip, we rip up bad hip-hop

461
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,258
I'm your connection, I feel like a Big Mac

462
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,098
The taste of money is rich, Yes, like milkshake

463
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:51,240

- Let's go! - Go.

473
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,429
Yes, look at my pop filter, My dirty spit splattered everywhere

474
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,028
I can't smell things when I rap, The smell of trash, I like it

475
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,969
I eat a lot of gas, I'm a V8 engine, I lose efficiency and speed up

476
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,939
The rapping Camavinga, strike it, Stop blocking me, punks

477
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,379
Spit out the verses, Grab the microphone here

478
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,548
Studio MC or whatever, Your concert is a waste of money

479
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,449
I'm a little GOAT, I bet everything with my hands

480
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,278
Just forget about it, Bring everything, still, money talks

481
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,118
Ayo, I go like a psycho, still rapping with the Bible

482
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,959
I'm super fly like Michael, Why are you surprised? I do it daily

483
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,729
Look, we slide on the 808, You can't do anything other than rap

484
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,558
I honed my skills since high school, I turned on the microphone every day

485
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,098
You're a microphone checker, Rap money stack on stack

486
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,899
I use what I earn on my album and fill it up with something else

487
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,798
I talk a lot, I'm a rapper, I just spit out the words

488
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,039
They had a chance to kick me out, What will they do with my choice?

489
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,480

(Roh Yun Ha: 67 votes, Reddy: 65 votes, )

498
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,059
(Loopy: 40 votes, Nosun: 33 votes)

499
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,229
He did well like he always does.

500
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,729
I thought, "He'll take Round Four."

501
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,400
If we win once or twice, we'll have a chance.

502
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,009
All right. Hey.

503
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,838
Mills is going to do it! What?

504
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,140
- What? - Mills is going to do it!

505
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,179
I came back to Seoul in 2020

506
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,919
Even a national sports festival got postponed due to the pandemic

507
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,659
Photos of the wedding guests with masks will go down in history

508
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,018
Hyangdongdong, Hwang Dong Hyun Mills is going to do it

509
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,389
I'll go down in history

510
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,758
Pull up and press rest, Shove the weight of history

511
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,959
Seep into it, historical figures, TV, and laptop

512
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,999
I switch the cell phones and get greedy, so there's no end

513
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,368
When will I see the pin light again? I shine on my own

514
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,469
Brand new, fresh off the boat, MVP rap

515
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,139
Rapping naked, the attic is my place

516
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,038
I chase my dream there and enjoy my life

517
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,709
Rapping naked, the attic is my place

518
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,508
I chase my dream there and enjoy my life, call me

519
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,419
- MVP, what? MVP, let's go - MVP

520
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,818
- MVP! - Let's go!

521
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:24,419
- MVP! - They call me the MVP

522
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,088
- MVP! - Let's go!

523
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,559
- MVP! - Mills is going to do it!

524
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,500
The voting begins.

525
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:35,099
- Ten. Nine. - The hook ripped up the stage.

526
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,039
- Eight. Seven. - Give me the votes.

527
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,239
- Six. Five. - The hook was insane.

528
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,140
- He did so well. - Four. Three.

529
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,640
Two. One.

530
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,880
- Thank you. - The voting is closed.

531
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,680
It was incredible.

532
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,979
He did so well with the hook.

533
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,649
Don Mills ripped up the stage.

534
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,588
It's always cutthroat. Each round is cutthroat.

535
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,118
Looking like a bouncer, acting like a monkey

536
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,389
Why are they staring at me funny?

537
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,258
I got no clue why they do that, but

538
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,999
Don't run, spark

539
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,828
Challenge yourself and spark

540
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,699
Yes, break this, break that

541
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,470
I do what I want to do without caring about the others

542
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,779
Mckdaddy isn't coming out until the end.

543
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,848
(All rappers have performed.)

544
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,578
It's our strategy to enter when people are bored...

545
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,548
and give an explosive performance.

546
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:28,920
I waited for this moment.

547
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,059
(Block 6's Mckdaddy enters Round 4.)

548
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,789
I want to do it, y'all

549
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,259
Let's go!

550
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,798
HNML, no words are needed, My failure is a misunderstanding

551
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,469
It gets bigger with time, Posters fill up the walls

552
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,798
When I own them, I take down and get new posters

553
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,669
I keep going without catching a breath

554
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,969
What more do I want? I want the things I don't need

555
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,838
What? I envy you, A week with Monday remaining

556
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,239
Listerine due to the sweaty mouth

557
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,538
Cigarette and cranberry on the desk

558
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,008
I just need two items to get ready

559
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,409
Look around, whose turn is it to go?

560
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,749
Wait and I'll show you

561
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,118
It's time for a bigger picture

562
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,449
What? New money, stack it up

563
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,749
On the top, add it up

564
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,048
Buy time if you want to see me, new blood

565
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,018
Ice flows in my arteries, I know that cash comes

566
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,118
With my steps, There's no way it'll stop

567
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,758
You're the one who's ruined, Success became a habit for me

568
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,129
I use my feelers to chase after success

569
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,729
It's a habit that feels like nature

570
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,929
My future is like a Christmas tree

571
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,229
Jerks who aren't helpful can stay at a distance

572
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,669
They can't stop me, if they annoy me

573
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,969
I'll fire multiple bullets

574
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,739
I always walked with no tomorrow, I've no complaints about tomorrow

575
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,139
No one looks at my time anyway

576
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,869
You just have to feel this, hey

577
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,038
- The voting begins. - It was insane.

578
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,078
- He ripped up the stage again. - Let's go.

579
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,150
Eight. Seven.

580
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,318
- Six. Five. - He did well. Mckdaddy is so good.

581
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,318
Four. Three.

582
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,859
- Here we go. - Two. One.

583
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,288
- The voting is closed. - He did so well.

584
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,289
I think Mckdaddy will win.

585
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,459
Okay. The cypher is set.

586
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,200
Give it up! Make some noise!

587
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,299
- I think all of us did well. - All of us did well.

588
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,838
I'll announce the result.

589
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,869
The rapper who ranked 1st and won 5,000 dollars is...

590
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,369
Please.

591
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,818
Mckdaddy of Block Six!

592
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,950
(Block 6's Mckdaddy wins 1st place with 77 votes in Round 4.)

593
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,759
- That's insane. - He's taking all the cash.

594
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,559
I can't believe it.

595
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,630
- What? - Mckdaddy.

596
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,129
I placed first, so I'd like to say something.

597
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,140
I felt like I had beaten all of them.

598
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,299
I felt like...

599
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,839
the winner. Yes.

600
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,939
Thank you for your hard work. You did well.

601
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,140
It's too bad.

602
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,848
If things keep going this way, we'll struggle in the future.

603
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,679
I thought that we needed to take a win in the beginning...

604
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,519
for a chance of survival.

605
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,920
But Block 6 took 2 consecutive wins.

606
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,559
I was like, "What should I do?"

607
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,288
(The current Block Money rankings)

608
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,430
(Block 6:48,000 dollars, Block 2:45,000 dollars)

609
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,660
Here comes Round Five, everyone.

610
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,368
- Right away? - Right away?

611
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,838
- Are we in 1st place? - We're in 1st place.

612
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,240
Then we don't need to worry.

613
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,568
- We're still in third place. - Okay.

614
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:06,039
Depending on the result, we could go from 3rd place to 4th place.

615
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,639
We need to win in this round.

616
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,380
We need to take this round. We have no other choice.

617
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,849
My resolution was, "Let's win in one round."

618
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,319
Okay.

619
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,089
DJ Holiship, drop that beat. Let's go!

620
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,329
- What kind of a beat is this? - KHAN, do you have one?

621
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,169
Okay. KHAN, let's go.

622
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,640
(Block 2's KHAN takes the stage 1st.)

623
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,939
What's the bpm? Do you know?

624
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,239
The bpm is in the 90s.

625
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,980
- We need to win this one. - We need to win.

626
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,709
I do have a verse, but...

627
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,079
I think you should enter.

628
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,919
(When Block 2's JTONG enters, )

629
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,450
(Blocks 1, 3, and 4 become nervous.)

630
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,390
If you have a verse, go ahead.

631
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:54,960
Does no one else have a verse?

632
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,960
I have one, but it isn't strong. Does anyone have a strong verse?

633
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,460
- What should we do? - Six.

634
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:01,598
Five.

635
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,328
- Four. Three. - Hurry up.

636
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,940
- Come on. Go in there. - Two. One.

637
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,339
Now, the chance to enter is closed.

638
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,269
Let's begin right away.

639
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,910
Unless we win this time, our chance of survival will be gone.

640
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,379
"I'll need to rap diligently." I had that thought.

641
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,118
I entered because I felt like I could win.

642
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,949
I wanted to restore my honor.

643
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,889
No matter the beat, I'll give it a go.

644
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,559
I'll aim for the best result...

645
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,690
so that I won't have any regrets.

646
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,160
DJ Holiship, drop that beat. Let's go!

647
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,369
Let's go.

648
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,308
She said, "Tray, I love your curls"

649
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,778
She said, "My boyfriend is a nerd"

650
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,479
She said, "Tray B, am I first?" No way

651
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,679
You can't be my girl

652
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,979
Where I came from, it's way too dirty

653
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,508
Hey, my brother, what's the word?

654
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,018
It's time to shake the world, Our turn has finally come

655
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,389
You know that I'm a beast, I love to bark

656
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,818
YEL member, everybody's turn

657
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,118
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee

658
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,558
I'm up way too high, It's happening in front of us

659
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,288
- I put my mark on your body - It's electrifying.

660
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,389
Tray B, I feel like a vampire

661
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,129
You keep giving me your heart

662
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,558
I don't need it, The offensive player attacks

663
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,399
What on earth? What should I do?

664
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,098
Year 2025, come quickly, free yo

665
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,839
Rush to Cheongju in 2025

666
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,480
- Yes. - The voting begins.

667
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,690
- Well done. - Ten.

668
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,149
- Nine. Eight. - Well done.

669
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,619
- He was full of anger. - Seven.

670
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,190
- Tray B is good at damping. - Six. Five.

671
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,889
- Four. - Please.

672
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,528
- He's begging for real. - Three.

673
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:40,630
Two. One.

674
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,569
The voting is closed.

675
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,598
I wondered how I could deliver my sincerity.

676
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,670
I rapped as if my life depended on it.

677
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,338
Where are you going? I'm on my way to find my dad

678
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:53,980
Well done, the girls next to me are new

679
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,778
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes, The age of 20

680
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,308
Everyone is becoming desperate.

681
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,078
I became serious.

682
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,680
Everyone feels that way.

683
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,259
Say, "Hip-hop"

684
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,828
- Hip-hop! - Hip-hop!

685
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,029
Why was it so small?

686
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,159
You're the one who looked down on me

687
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,229
Why are you hanging your head now?

688
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,798
It's too soon for that, I'll get in slowly

689
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,929
You get tired so soon

690
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,538
I didn't start this to make a measly amount

691
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,538
Spit, spit, you can wear the clothes that don't fit me

692
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,268
Who made it as big as me from the underground music scene?

693
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,179
I do everything with my team

694
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,078
I'll cut your label in half, I bet you had fun for a while

695
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,508
I'll attempt a deal with a demon and kill the demon instead

696
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,318
What I like the most is a 1-on-1 with you

697
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,348
New generation

698
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,389
Rookies kill the old generation, The new king is born

699
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,389
With big wheels, I'll crush you

700
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,719
I scratch the listeners' itch

701
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,088
It's the sea of blood, so turn around

702
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,858
It's a tank with five members, We're never getting off

703
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,460
I'll just look down on you

704
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,900
- Yes! - The voting begins.

705
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,400
Ten. Nine.

706
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,039
Eight. Seven,

707
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,139
- Why did he get mad at people? - six,

708
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,068
- five, four, - He shouldn't shout at the people.

709
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,680
- He got angry. - three,

710
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,079
two, one.

711
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,179
The voting is closed.

712
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,179
(The voting is closed.)

713
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
You're good.

714
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,288
I think our block did well,

715
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:13,919
but we kept losing.

716
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,759
So I was disappointed.

717
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,129
I managed to come here after everything that happened.

718
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,500
I just really wanted to win.

719
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,700
Is there anyone?

720
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,939
Why?

721
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,470
What's this?

722
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,538
What's this?

723
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,439
(Block 2's JTONG enters Round 5.)

724
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,150
- JTONG? - This is how you'll do it?

725
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,920
Does this mean he'll win first place this time?

726
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,549
Let's go, JTONG.

727
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,889
It all runs strong and busy

728
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,589
The wheel that rolls out from the rough reality

729
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,229
The Gyeongsang Province attitude, Disregarding everything else

730
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,159
I just move forward, And there's a downhill ahead

731
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,729
Let's get it popping, Take a deep breath

732
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,439
And just throw the body on the ground

733
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,308
My style is like a hammer that crushes heads

734
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,139
A deep bass rocking with a thug-like style

735
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,439
Microphone check, Like I'll beat up everything

736
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,909
A 0.1t drum smash on the punch-like track

737
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,848
A lesson that is clearly shown to others

738
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:15,789
It would look real to anyone, Like a pit toilet

739
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,390
No matter what the situation is, I leave it to my decision

740
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,119
I'm the impossible type, That's my strength and weakness

741
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:23,859
I leave the result to the sky, And I let it flow

742
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,960
Under the holy sun, I spread my soul without regrets

743
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,098
He finally brought out his killer move.

744
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,339
The voting begins.

745
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:35,439
- Ten, nine, eight, - Block Two.

746
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,710
- Block Two. - seven,

747
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,409
- six, - JTONG is doing this.

748
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,440
Five,

749
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,740
four,

750
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,180
three,

751
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,480
two,

752
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
one.

753
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,349
The voting is closed.

754
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,119
I felt good because it looked like everyone enjoyed it.

755
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,589
It was fun.

756
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,390
(Will JTONG be able to take 1st place?)

757
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,328
(Block 3's leader HAON enters Round 5.)

758
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,429
Let me hear you say, "Ah, yes."

759
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,459
- Ah, yes. - Ah, yes.

760
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,199
Say "Ah, yes."

761
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,229
- Ah, yes. - Ah, yes.

762
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,868
Say "Ah, yes."

763
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:06,869
- Ah, yes. - Ah, yes.

764
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay.

765
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,338
Before we have a conversation

766
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:12,538
Have some respect first

767
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,879
I learned that what goes around comes around

768
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,409
This isn't like "Kongjwi And Patjwi"

769
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,479
I can't get a hang of it

770
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,808
It's not enough to fulfill everyone's greed

771
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,879
Then I'll just take care of myself, those around me, and everyone

772
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,249
But the circle keeps growing

773
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,588
Who will stop you?

774
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:24,818
This is irreplaceable

775
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,159
It's beyond control

776
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,489
The fact that these tacky lines work

777
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,929
Is what bothers me most as someone spitting them out

778
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,258
But sometimes these things

779
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,960
Can be a good example for the young children

780
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,459
It's fire even if you spit anything

781
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,868
Stepping it we're going H1GHR

782
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:38,469
Make them retire, If they treat me wrong

783
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,899
I put myself up like a thumbs-up

784
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,239
My friends protect me

785
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,268
The BGM is your scream

786
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,640
Say what?

787
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,410
- What? - What?

788
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,210
- I think he got it. - The voting begins.

789
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,349
- Ten, nine, - Nice.

790
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,919
- eight, seven, - Nice! Let's go.

791
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,789
- six, five, - Block Three, let's go!

792
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,518
Four, three,

793
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,460
two, one.

794
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,489
The voting is closed.

795
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,160
(The voting is closed.)

796
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,359
Cypher set.

797
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,430
Make some noise!

798
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,268
Everyone, please be quiet.

799
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:14,240
- It really was good. - You really did great.

800
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,869
- I'm proud of you. - You did really great.

801
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,069
I feel proud of you.

802
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,680
We did great.

803
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,409
Please.

804
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,220
Help me, Almighty.

805
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,518
- Please. - It's here.

806
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,119
We have it. It's almost in my mouth.

807
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,549
Yummy.

808
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:34,088
We'd either win or lose by a neck.

809
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,490
We definitely have a chance.

810
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,499
I wanted our desperate wish...

811
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,730
of wanting to win at least once came true.

812
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,868
I wanted us to win very much.

813
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:48,440
So I had high hopes.

814
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,380
This time,

815
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,548
the block won by a landslide.

816
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,949
(The block in 1st place of Round 5 won with many votes.)

817
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,048
- Who is it? - Please.

818
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,079
- Just once. - Please.

819
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,880
- Please. - Please help us.

820
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,950
JTONG!

821
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,490
The rapper who will earn 5,000 dollars.

822
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,960
In first place,

823
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,068
- Block Three's HAON! - Yes!

824
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,769
(Block 3's HAON wins 1st place with 88 votes in Round 5.)

825
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,210
Get your cash.

826
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:34,949
I'm finally showing my team members...

827
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,288
my worth as a leader.

828
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,519
It felt really great.

829
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,589
It was a shining moment.

830
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,529
I have a good feeling. We're getting good reactions.

831
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,630
It's going great now.

832
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,159
(Current Block Money Ranking 1st: Block 6, 2nd: Block 2)

833
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,170
(3rd: Block 3, 4th: Block 1, 5th Block 4)

834
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,970
This is the final round, Round Six.

835
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,940
Last round, Round Six.

836
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,299
It's the last one.

837
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,509
It's the last one.

838
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,608
We have to win this one no matter what.

839
00:33:58,609 --> 00:33:59,980
We have to win no matter what.

840
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,679
We're at the end of a cliff.

841
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,549
If we don't win, we'll get eliminated.

842
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,849
We have to win no matter what.

843
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,948
We're not sure yet. We have to win more.

844
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,420
We have to make this round ours somehow.

845
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,320
Four thousand dollars.

846
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,219
Five thousand dollars. Okay.

847
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,590
DJ Holiship. Drop the beat. Let's go.

848
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,158
Okay.

849
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,900
Do you have it? You can go if you have it.

850
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,530
I don't.

851
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,840
- You don't? Then I'll go. - I'll just go too.

852
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,768
- Will you do it? - I'll do it.

853
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,268
- Okay. - I'll make a countdown.

854
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,908
- Nine, eight, - Is it fast?

855
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,839
- seven, six, - It's not that fast.

856
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,678
- five, four, - Then should I wait and go last?

857
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,819
- You can just skip it. - three, two, one.

858
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,050
DJ Holiship. Drop the beat. Let's go.

859
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,618
It's too safe

860
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,658
I'll do hip-hop until I die

861
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,259
They ask if I can handle it

862
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,058
That's not my concern

863
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,729
I change it to mine with my words

864
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,968
Sambong, Lee Sang Yong, I do it if I say so

865
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,768
I know my ending even if there's no script

866
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:59,238
The style is great even if I don't see it

867
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,939
In other words, stylish, In other words, safe

868
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,268
- In other words, safe - Okay.

869
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,609
Why worry about tomorrow?

870
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,839

980
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:07,150
Block One might take this round.

981
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,089
I have to win the money...

982
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,489
so that our block has a chance to advance.

983
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,519

The ups and downs of my life was introduced on TV

992
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,078
For the last few years, I only had Yulgok in my wallet

993
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,678
I lived without a mom, But now I'm fulfilled

994
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,779
I fill in the empty spot with a few Saimdangs

995
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,488
I count bundles of money these days

996
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,788
Go-stop, I went with go even if I didn't eat three meals

997

From the Express Bus Terminal, I go to Shinsegae

00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:50,029
I was poor when I washed dishes at a cafe

1000
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,129
I first went to "MIC SWAGGER" wondering what to wear

1001
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,299
A 40-dollar KAWASAKI jacket

1002
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,459
- From Dongmyo - She's angry

1003
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,658
That was the maximum I could spend back then

1004
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,169
Now I wear Louis Vuitton even when I get cigarettes

1005
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,828
I just wear anything, But automatically maintain my class

1006
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,939
My father cried in worry of his child

1007
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,538
I wipe his tears with money like tissues

1008
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,468
I switch from troublemaker to money bundle

1009
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,138
I earned money, But I'm on my way, no switching

1010

00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,779
Make it bounce right here

1050
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,279
It's quite fierce every night

1051
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,718
Now is the time to see a different morning

1052
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,589
I'll confidently walk on the red carpet

1053
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,388
Do you know how gloomy your mirror is?

1054
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:04,460
I'll show you, so put me at the top

1055
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,099
The voting begins.

1056
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,630
- Ten, nine, - That was crazy.

1057
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,839
- eight, seven... - I could feel how desperate he was.

1058
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,569
- That was cool. - It was so cool.

1059
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,139
Four, three, two, one.

1060
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,309
The voting is closed.

1061
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,578
Since it was the last round,

1062
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:27,779
it looked like he was using all his strength. It was cool.

1063
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,848
(Kill Them All Round 6: 1st, Double Down with 81 votes)

1064
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:29,888
(2nd, ZENE THE ZILLA with 72 votes 3rd, Boi B with 68 votes)

1065
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:30,948
(Polodared, SINCE)

1066
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,089
(The time is almost up for Round 6.)

1067
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,630
(Who will be the last rapper in Round 6?)

1068
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,829
It's Jo Gwang Il.

1069
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,730
Jo Gwang Il is here.

1070
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,000
(Block 6's Jo Gwang Il enters Round 6.)

1071
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
It's the acrobat.

1072
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,609
You have to be afraid of Gwang Il.

1073
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,980
The impact of his rap is strong.

1074
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,578
We regarded Gwang Il as an important card.

1075
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,809
Gwang Il had a strong weapon.

1076
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,779
You should go last.

1077
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,980
(Kaogaii made Gwang Il go last.)

1078
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,749
He'd have a great impact on the audience.

1079
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,260
Yes. What?

1080
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,328
I'm living properly for the green money

1081
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:11,089
The third-rate people who were sitting beg to survive

1082
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,229
My rap and my flow, Not a branch, the head office

1083
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,459
- I have no connections - It's done.

1084
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,558
- No school or neighborhood people - They're too strong.

1085
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,629
Then however good you are

1086
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,799
You're not S but A or B

1087
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,598
They calculate the value of my rap

1088
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,198
I thought it cooled down, But my passion and my forehead

1089
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,238
Are still hot, The sun is still up

1090
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,669
Okay? I spit it out and give you chills

1091
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,908
My words say no lies, I just say the facts of my life

1092
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,779
- Metronome in my head, not natural - It's Gwang Il's first entry.

1093
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,379
- So he'd have a strong impact. - I write a death note with my pen

1094
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,549
I came out of my room

1095
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,419
I make my commercial value

1096
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,078
I won't compromise even if I die

1097
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,448
I won't bend to those who fool me

1098
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,618
Look and listen well with your eyes and ears

1099
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,959
The only common thing in our raps is your tight pants fit

1100
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,388
I'm waiting with my arms stretched

1101
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,658
Come inside them, This is my Hakikjin

1102
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:46,259
If we brushed past each other, that's not fate

1103
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,859
What brushed was the tongue that attempted to murder

1104
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,729
I'm confident about this fact, It's the finger pointing at you

1105
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,329
The gossip you start gets ignored, I spit on it

1106
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,098
Yes!

1107
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,598
- The voting begins. - They all like it.

1108
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,509
- Ten, nine, - Block Six.

1109
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,169
- You can't tell. - eight,

1110
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,308
- No. - seven,

1111
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:02,078
- Don't forget us. - six,

1112
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,579
- It's over. Time's over, anyway. - five,

1113
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:04,879
- four, - That was really good.

1114
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,909
- three, - Well done.

1115
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,078
Two, one.

1116
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,420
- It's good we kept him. - The voting is closed.

1117
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:16,129
It was fast, but he pulled it off well.

1118
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,788
It's bound to sound good.

1119
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,058
He's really good.

1120
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,529
It would be hard.

1121
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,968
Set. Make some noise!

1122
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:26,968
- It's over. - Fifty minutes are up.

1123
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:28,900
If they win this as well...

1124
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,670
Block One did really well.

1125
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,239
Get ready to go.

1126
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,179
It's tough.

1127
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,149
Everyone, please be quiet.

1128
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,879
I'll announce the results now.

1129
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,948
Goodness.

1130
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:42,420
The rapper who earned the Block Money.

1131
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,619
Come.

1132
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
In first place.

1133
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:49,429
(The competition was fierce between ranks 3 and 4 in Round 6.)

1134
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,030
(Block 1 swept the stage at the beginning of Round 6.)

1135
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,629
Gangnam Style

1136
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,869
I thought we definitely won.

1137
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:04,239
(Block 3 entered Round 6 with a desperate heart.)

1138
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,979
I had the thought that we had to win.

1139
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,980
"We can win. We'll win."

1140
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:12,820
Let's continue our spirit.

1141
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,149
In first place, Block Six's Jo Gwang Il.

1142
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,149
- What? - No way.

1143
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,359
(Block 6's Jo Gwang Il wins 1st place in Round 6.)

1144
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,589
(1st, Jo Gwang Il with 83 votes 2nd, Double Down with 81 votes)

1145
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,718
(3rd, Polodared with 80 votes 4th, SINCE with 77 votes)

1146
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,859
(5th, ZENE THE ZILLA with 72 votes)

1147
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,190
They're definitely in first place.

1148
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,599
- Nice. - Thank you.

1149
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,929
It's awesome. What's with this?

1150
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,670
- It's done. - What is this?

1151
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,268
I was dazed. It was nice, though.

1152
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:39,738
We went from the bottom to first place.

1153
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:43,209
It's a position you really don't want to lose.

1154
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,649
(1st: Block 6, 510,000 dollars 2nd: Block 2, 430,000 dollars).

1155
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,749
(3rd: Block 3, 400,000 dollars)

1156
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,078
(4th: Block 1, 370,000 dollars)

1157
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,179
(5th: Block 4, 340,000 dollars)

1158
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,250
Goodness.

1159
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,190
I didn't think I'd go home after this mission.

1160
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:58,558
I never imagined this. I never expected this.

1161
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,059
We were all depressed.

1162
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,729
Everyone, we'll give you...

1163
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,899
a bonus chance to get some Block Money.

1164
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,569
I'll reveal the Hidden Match.

1165
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,869
- What? - A Hidden Match?

1166
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,368
- A Hidden Match? - What?

1167
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,610
What's the Hidden Match?

1168
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,509
The Hidden Match...

1169
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,479
is a match where only one member from each block can participate.

1170
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,348
Five rappers representing their blocks...

1171
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,150
will have a cypher.

1172
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:29,190
Only the block of the rapper who receives the most audience votes...

1173
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,158
can earn the additional Block Money.

1174
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,230
(The block of the rapper who wins earns additional Block Money.)

1175
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,658
How much?

1176
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,029
- How much would it be? - About 5,000 or 10,000 dollars?

1177
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:41,070
The amount you earn from the Hidden Match is 5,000 dollars.

1178
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:42,538
What?

1179
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:44,469
We should do everything we can.

1180
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:45,869
We have to get it no matter what.

1181
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:48,979
We should definitely win and recover.

1182
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,949
The amount you earn from the second Hidden Match...

1183
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,078
is 7,000 dollars.

1184
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,750
It's 7,000 dollars? Goodness.

1185
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,349
You can change the ranking.

1186
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:00,888
We have to get this chance as if our lives depend on it.

1187
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:01,960
We can change the ranking.

1188
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,558
There will be one person from each block.

1189
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,860
So I think it'll be easier to win.

1190
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:09,098
It's going to be very dangerous now.

1191
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:13,138
The block members started to feel anxious.

1192
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:16,039
We had to make it ours somehow.

1193
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,340
By all means.

1194
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,840
Five thousand dollars. Who wants this?

1195
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,109
Who wants this 5,000 dollars? Let's go.

1196
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,779
Here's the money. Let's get it.

1197
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,449
Let's go!

1198
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,319
Yes.

1199
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,849
DJ Holiship. Drop the beat. Let's go.

1200
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,559
(The blocks decide who will participate.)

1201
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,570
What do we do?

1202
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:45,828
I go every day

1203
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,598
I can't do this. It's too slow.

1204
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,639
I can't do it at all.

1205
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:50,868
How should we do this?

1206
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,510
- JP. - Should I go?

1207
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,839
I don't have one for this.

1208
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,739
- Me? - I also don't have any verse.

1209
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,618
(Block 2's JP enters the Hidden Match.)

1210
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:01,719
Do you want to go?

1211
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,718
- Can I go? - Of course.

1212
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:06,050
PUNCHNELLO has to show them at this point.

1213
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:07,219
Go and nail it.

1214
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,489
(Block 4's PUNCHNELLO enters the Hidden Match.)

1215
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,359
I thought he was a strong opponent.

1216
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,158
I thought I should do my stuff well.

1217
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,299
I was confident in cyphers.

1218
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,000
We would definitely win this one.

1219
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,538
- Go. - Go up there.

1220
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,340
(Block 6's Mckdaddy enters the Hidden Match.)

1221
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,170
Okay. Mckdaddy is popular.

1222
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,409
- Let's go with SINCE. - Let's go with SINCE.

1223
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,980
- Okay. I'll go. - Okay.

1224
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,379
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1225
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,749
(Block 3's SINCE enters the Hidden Match.)

1226
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,788
Let's go.

1227
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,319
- Darn. It's SINCE. - It's SINCE.

1228
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
It's okay.

1229
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:42,689
- Do you want to go? - Okay.

1230
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,759
Tray B will go. Tray B?

1231
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,089
(Block 1's Tray B enters the Hidden Match.)

1232
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,759
We have the five representatives.

1233
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,599
(The rappers in the first Hidden Match were chosen.)

1234
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:55,098
- General. - You can do this.

1235
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,199
Let's go, Mckdaddy!

1236
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:59,139
This is doable, JP. Let's go.

1237
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,679
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1238
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,949
I thought there was a chance.

1239
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:06,849
My secret weapon...

1240
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,719
is to rap awesomely well.

1241
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,150
I should really put in everything to earn the money.

1242
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,889
I'm the real hidden card.

1243
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,190
I'll crush them.

1244
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,629
We'll start the Hidden Match cypher now.

1245
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,760
DJ Holiship. Drop it the beat. Let's go!

1246
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:26,639
(Tray B grabbed the mic first.)

1247
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,469
Dirty play, dirty play

1248
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,440
Block One

1249
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,939
We're going to pull up beamer, Hop out

1250
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,538
Move aside when we come out

1251
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,948
Popping and smoke, rocking Dior

1252
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:39,078
I'm a big baller, but I'm not a kicker, like

1253
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,848
When Tray B comes out, all the speakers will burst

1254
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,689
Scream out like me and my brothers

1255
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,988
We're Mr Beast

1256
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,590
- But you're just Mr. Bean - Mr. Bean

1257
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,419
We're going to pull up and throw with the beam

1258
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,288
You should get hit by an action beam

1259
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:52,129
- Broke boy, you and your team - Tray B nailed this.

1260
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,999
You just talk too much

1261
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,828
I'm on another level, Know how I get it

1262
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:57,629
Every day is a party for us Everyday geek

1263
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,598
When I see her, She gets on her knees

1264
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,138
When I see her, She gets on her knees

1265
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,968
- Yes! - Tray B

1266
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,839
It's big Block One, let's go

1267
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,380
It's big Block One, let's go

1268
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,650
The voting begins.

1269
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,819
- Ten, nine, - Tray B.

1270
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,349
- eight, seven, - Please.

1271
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,789
- six, five, - We have to win. Please.

1272
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,219
- four, three, - Press it.

1273
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:24,789
Two, one.

1274
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,829
The voting is closed.

1275
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:29,260
I predicted he'd be in first place.

1276
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,599
His rap was very solid.

1277
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,469
I thought he could win.

1278
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,599
The audience liked it too.

1279
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,369
I thought they'd have an advantage.

1280
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,308
(Block 4's PUNCHNELLO goes 2nd.)

1281
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:45,309
Yes.

1282
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,549
It's time to shine, I'm ready

1283
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,379
I came out of the trash, I'm above you

1284
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,218
They talk too much, They keep their head on the ground

1285
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:53,089
I feel dizzy every day, Alcohol keeps my head clear

1286
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,919
What? What do you mean?

1287
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,689
Fight? You will lose

1288
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,558
Power? I already have that

1289
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,428
Don't talk, I'm so real

1290
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:02,158
The world is noisy, I keep a poker face

1291
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,029
I'm waiting, It's time to grab my time

1292
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,768
My mind was all over the place because I've been living a busy life

1293
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,768
Where is the album? Here, enjoy it

1294
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:09,569
I was ripening these amazing things

1295
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,538
That made me tired, How does that taste?

1296
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:14,109
I'll collect lots of money on your behalf as well, but well

1297
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,209
Just shut your mouth

1298
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,609
Yes, sir, I'm here, What do you want?

1299
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,848
Chief keef, that fools I don't give a thing about it

1300
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:20,749
What do you expect from this chaotic situation?

1301
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,578
I empty the bottle, spinach Popeye

1302
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,218
I don't need security, I pour it in

1303
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,320
One shot, two shots, three shots, Now I'm faded

1304
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,289
The voting begins.

1305
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,260
Ten, nine,

1306
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,800
- eight, seven, - What is that?

1307
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,428
- six, - No bowing.

1308
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:40,098
Five, four,

1309
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,738
three, two,

1310
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:43,840
one.

1311
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:45,409
The voting is closed.

1312
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,909
- JP. - Block Two

1313
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,550
- Block Two - Block Two

1314
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,788
Stepping on this border, Got me feeling like

1315
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:57,789
I want to fight no matter who it is

1316
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,448
The rotten mind talking about haters when there are no enemies

1317
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,419
I put them ten toes down to be the one and only kind

1318
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,388
I get to my senses when I taste it, I'm not satisfied yet

1319
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:04,928
I turn the channels up, Like it's still far

1320
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:06,799
You don't notice until the product gets sold out

1321
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,558
The price goes down like the weather of Seoul

1322
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,899
And my mother told me never pour your talent on these cowards

1323
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,328
The merry-go-round keeps turning

1324
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,138
I make a phonecall to the one on the throne

1325
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:15,939
Forget it, I have no time to comprehend with anybody

1326
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,368
Yes, I'm back on the host, It is packed

1327
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:18,939
I can see you through

1328
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,709
I can see you through

1329
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,538
Don't look at them, they're corny

1330
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:26,050
We're going to make our own story, I call it fantasy

1331
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,578
Should we go and fly to Tennessee?

1332
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,549
ADHD, need some medicine

1333
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,319
I see no enemies near me, It's funny

1334
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,989
I don't get any more damages

1335
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:36,860
- Block Two - Block Two

1336
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,130
The voting begins.

1337
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:41,659
Ten, nine,

1338
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,230
eight, seven,

1339
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,229
- six, - Press it!

1340
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,868
Five, four,

1341
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,569
- three, two, - Press it. Let's go.

1342
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,610
One.

1343
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,309
The voting is closed.

1344
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,279
- Let's go! - SINCE!

1345
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,749
- Let's go! - SINCE!

1346
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,779
(Block 3's SINCE is the 4th rapper.)

1347
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,479
- Let's go! - Put your hands up.

1348
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,050
(Block 3's SINCE connects with the audience and heats it up.)

1349
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:08,820
SINCE is scary.

1350
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:11,029
The same place as before but my position is different

1351
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,888
I pull my shoulders back, A different mindset

1352
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,729
Since I came back I rise with the friends behind me

1353
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,499
I share the pie, But I'm not satisfied yet

1354
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,629
That's why we're here, I still trust it

1355
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,368
Those who can't do it, They betray the trust, for real

1356
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:22,868
Sillim that I know, I have enemies

1357
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:25,009
But I've not seen one pretending for real

1358
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,879
Watch my way, highway at dawn, Get on it like Hahoe

1359
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,738
- It feels new, I do it all night - She came ready.

1360
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,780
My every day is too tough to go back down

1361
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:34,078
Ran away five years ago for my dream, I told you

1362
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,718
I'll return the poor treatment so many times over

1363
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:37,149
They waited and I got my revenge

1364
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,689
This line isn't a metaphor now, I'm a boss

1365
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,919
Boss

1366
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,328
- Boss - Boss

1367
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:44,859
- Boss - Boss

1368
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,598
- She nailed it. - Boss

1369
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,159
If SINCE wins here,

1370
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,730
our block is in danger.

1371
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:52,428
- No. - Boss

1372
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,570
How was it?

1373
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,739
The voting begins.

1374
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,509
- Ten, - She has it.

1375
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,808
- nine, - SINCE has this round.

1376
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:02,009
- eight, - She's so good.

1377
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,509
- seven, - Press it.

1378
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,109
- six, five, - Please press it.

1379
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,448
- four, - Please.

1380
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:08,819
- three, - Please press it.

1381
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,549
- two, one. - Let's go. Press it.

1382
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,849
The voting is closed.

1383
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:14,989
I heard SINCE's rap,

1384
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:16,888
and I had chills over my body.

1385
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:18,089
I thought it would work.

1386
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,900
It just sticks in your ears.

1387
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:23,428
(Block 6's Mckdaddy goes last in Round 1 of the Hidden Match.)

1388
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:24,868
Let's go!

1389
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,268
I already feel it

1390
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:28,038
The sound of my brain goes out the door

1391
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,839
I'm like a disaster, A thread in the needle

1392
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,738
It's full, there's no seat for you, It's fair

1393
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:33,069
Forget about the process, Look at my results

1394
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,939
My style doesn't make money, Those rappers

1395
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,609
Call for attention by acting cute, They earned millions

1396
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,009
I just go even if it's not fair, They just fall after a blow

1397
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,149
But I didn't shoot

1398
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,249
Most of them are lying down, I'm standing on the other side

1399
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,078
Without a straw, I just swallow and get drunk

1400
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,948
My music fills the clubs, But that's not enough

1401
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,788
I go closer and whisper, firework festival

1402
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:48,689
Many things to have but little time, So I'm always full

1403
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,960
There's no expiry date, I can never rest

1404
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,529
Let's go!

1405
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,960
- The voting begins. - Mckdaddy!

1406
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,499
- Ten, - That was crazy.

1407
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,799
Nine,

1408
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,098
- eight, - They're all great.

1409
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,868
- seven, six, - Please.

1410
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:03,868
Five, four,

1411
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,638
- SINCE was good, though. - three,

1412
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,209
- two, - I think SINCE will win.

1413
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,538
- one. - Please.

1414
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,880
The voting is closed.

1415
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,420
(Round 1 of the Hidden Match ends.)

1416
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:19,050
Give it up! Hidden Match cypher!

1417
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,329
So the result of the Hidden Match...

1418
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:32,329
(The rappers fought fiercely to earn 5,000 dollars and flip the results.)

1419
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,599
Tray B.

1420
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,599
General SINCE.

1421
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:40,079
(Who will win Round 1 of the Hidden Match and win 5,000 dollars?)

1422
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:44,880
I won't announce that now. It will be announced at the end.

1423
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:46,050
Well done.

1424
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:49,049
- What? - Well done.

1425
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,590
That will be used as the changing factor.

1426
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,489
- It won't be announced now? - No.

1427
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:55,189
SINCE did so well.

1428
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,959
I thought it would be Tray B or SINCE.

1429
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,329
Someone I would keep in check would be Tray B.

1430
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,698
His stage was very powerful,

1431
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:04,900
and he had a great performance.

1432
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,698
Thank you, all the rappers.

1433
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:08,238
You can return to your places.

1434
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,300
Well done.

1435
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,539
Well done!

1436
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,908
- The Hidden Match is helpful. - Now.

1437
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:17,980
It's 7,000 dollars.

1438
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,480
DJ Holiship, give us the beat.

1439
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,488
No. Wait.

1440
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,259
- Who has a verse? - I have it too.

1441
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,558
- Should we send Yun Ha? - Yun Ha can go.

1442
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,190
- Yun Ha can go. - Okay.

1443
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,260
Okay.

1444
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,229
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1445
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,230
Let's go.

1446
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,570
(Block 1's ZENE THE ZILLA enters the Hidden Match.)

1447
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,639
What do we do? Mine's not bad for this.

1448
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:42,439
If they're all manly, I...

1449
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,769
It's JTONG.

1450
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,339
JTONG.

1451
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,209
JTONG.

1452
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,480
- Let's go! - JTONG, let's go!

1453
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,078
- Yes! - He's so cool.

1454
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,679
JTONG!

1455
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,718
JTONG!

1456
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,590
You're here. Goodness.

1457
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,219
JTONG!

1458
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:07,129
It was a chance to bring 7,000 dollars...

1459
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,670
to my block members.

1460
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:11,800
I should do well.

1461
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:13,368
It's JTONG.

1462
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:15,069
- Should we send COCONA? - Can you do it?

1463
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,170
- I'll go. - COCONA.

1464
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,368
Let's go!

1465
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,639
It's JTONG.

1466
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,009
Someone who can nail it should go.

1467
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,109
I think it's Gwang Il.

1468
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,379
I also think it's Gwang Il.

1469
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,049
I think it's definitely Gwang Il.

1470
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,249
It's for 7,000 dollars.

1471
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,949
- We have to send a strong one. - Or...

1472
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:31,919
Block Two really wanted to win.

1473
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,119
It was really tough.

1474
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:35,288
We have to go with the spirit.

1475
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,618
Gwang Il...

1476
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,428
had a strong weapon that worked on stage.

1477
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:40,500
That's why we chose him.

1478
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,869
The five representatives were chosen.

1479
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:47,269
DJ Holiship. Hold on.

1480
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,269
Everyone. Are you ready?

1481
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,269
The second Hidden Match.

1482
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:56,980
DJ Holiship. Drop the beat. Let's go!

1483
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,879
- Go for it. - Yes.

1484
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,718
(Which rapper will go first?)

1485
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,380
- Yes! - He's so cool!

1486
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,018
- Oh, my. - Let's go.

1487
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,328
- Yes. - This is just crazy.

1488
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:13,828
You'll be on a roller coaster tomorrow, and then there's me

1489
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:15,299
Why on earth would I envy you?

1490
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,698
You think about how you can make more of that dirty dough

1491
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:18,098
That's all you think about, so being a rapper is a side hustle

1492
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,899
I'm having a great year and selling my verse without a hitch

1493
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,339
Mastering the art is all about the mind

1494
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,738
So you'll lose by default from the start of the game

1495
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:25,069
There's no time to goof around

1496
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,408
It's all up to my skills on how far I'll make it in this game

1497
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:28,109
The rising curve in front of me bent more than your mom's back

1498
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,178
And it shot up

1499
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,209
You can say whatever you want

1500
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,210
But I earn this spot with my hard work

1501
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:32,678
So nothing's going to soil my name, rappers who chase money

1502
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,078
Habitually sell off their looks

1503
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,479
Those whiners dismiss me as a troublemaker

1504
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,549
What should I say to them? It's easier to ignore what they say

1505
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,319
Then a rapper with BB cream on talks to me

1506
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,960
- Yes! - Yes!

1507
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,988
- The voting begins. - You're so good!

1508
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,000
- Ten, nine, - He was great.

1509
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:49,399
- eight, seven... - Jo Gwang Il.

1510
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,899
- He crushed it. - Jo Gwang Il! Let's go.

1511
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,400
- Five, - That was crazy.

1512
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,738
- four, three, - It'd be amazing if he wins this.

1513
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,339
- This is crazy. - two,

1514
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,368
- What if he wins the money? - one.

1515
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,409
- The voting is closed. - I think he just might.

1516
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,349
- Should I go now or not? - That was pretty good.

1517
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:11,488
- My gosh! - It's JTONG!

1518
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:12,519
(JTONG from Block 2 will go next.)

1519
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:14,920
Busan!

1520
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,360
- He's so chill. Let's see. - Hey!

1521
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,928
You're running away fast, but I ambush you

1522
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:26,468
And smack the back of your head

1523
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:27,899
It's totally the hunting season

1524
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,669
I show off my skill with my tongue as the weapon

1525
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,209
My pronunciation is sharp like a shotgun

1526
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,738
My muzzle is on your temple

1527
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:35,209
It goes like click-clack

1528
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,679
I've been holding my breath for this moment

1529
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,408
Bang, the sound of a loud explosion pierces through your head

1530
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,420
I'm a rough rider on this beat with my microphone held tight

1531
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:44,788
- There's no break in my rough style - Did you see his eyes?

1532
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,618
- I go straight until my last breath - Look at him.

1533
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,158
I don't switch lanes even if I blow up everything I have

1534
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:52,029
Even if my life goes south, I hate going back

1535
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:54,558
My rock-solid conviction is my seat belt

1536
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,158
Those rats who switched sides

1537
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,768
They better pray that I don't run into them on the track

1538
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:01,768
Check my microphone, I'm straight out of a rock by the shore

1539
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:04,869
You can find me at 247, Yeonhwa-ri

1540
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,178
There's no limit, nothing can get in my way

1541
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:10,409
I'm ready to crash from head to toe, Pull the clutch to 100

1542
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:14,750
This is so much fun.

1543
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:16,349
- Let's go! - The voting begins.

1544
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,018
- Ten, nine, eight, - He's totally going to take this.

1545
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:22,690
- JTONG. - seven, six,

1546
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:25,329
- This is crazy. - five, four,

1547
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:29,158
- three, two, one. - Block Two!

1548
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,329
- Block Two! - The voting is closed.

1549
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,069
My gosh, I could feel that the momentum went to their side.

1550
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,268
I thought, "I don't think I can take this momentum back."

1551
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:37,368
So I took a step back.

1552
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:39,239
(JTONG from Block 2 is dominating the atmosphere.)

1553
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,609
(Which rapper will go after JTONG?)

1554
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,178
- Hey! - Yes!

1555
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:44,609
- Go, ZENE THE ZILLA! - Hey!

1556
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,479
- Ambition. - Yes!

1557
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,320
- Hey, let's go. - Hey.

1558
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,589
I signed with Ambition, but Despair said I had no future

1559
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,718
I still worked hard as if it was either money or death

1560
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,959
Now, I can't live without money

1561
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,058
My hair is too wavy, but I didn't get a perm

1562
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,959
I spend money to look cool, but I still got money in spades

1563
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,169
No one can stop me now, Sleepy in 2020

1564
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,238
Untouchable, unstoppable, and I'll make more dough

1565
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:10,268
I still got the color of money on my left-wrist watch

1566
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:13,069
It's already 11:11pm, then I start counting the bills

1567
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,839
Q made the right decision, and I'm proving it

1568
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,979
While those boomers are getting old and dropping off like flies

1569
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,549
Those young pretentious kids are going through puberty

1570
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,388
Meanwhile, ZILLANATION greets its heyday

1571
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,049
- Yes! - GRAY beat, that's my spot

1572
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,189
Life is so much fun

1573
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:30,319
Look at my necklace, flexing like a jellyfish

1574
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,658
I lived in a tiny studio 3 years ago and now rule Gwanak-gu

1575
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:37,130
As for my house next year, where is it at?

1576
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,329
- That was good. - The voting begins.

1577
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:42,238
- Ten, nine, - That was a bit iffy.

1578
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,510
- It's either Gwang Il or JTONG. - eight, seven,

1579
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,710
six, five, four,

1580
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,510
three, two, one.

1581
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,579
The voting is closed.

1582
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,348
(COCONA from Block 4 goes next.)

1583
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:57,689
- Hey. - Let's go!

1584
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,518
- Say, "Oh, yes." - Oh, yes!

1585
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:03,359
- Say, "Oh, yes." - Oh, yes!

1586
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,058
- Say, "Oh, yes." - Oh, yes!

1587
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,800
Hey. I'll just do my best.

1588
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:11,229
Work out, I exercise every day

1589
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,529
What should I do today? Even with the smallest things

1590
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:14,598
I'm keeping it real

1591
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:17,468
Even if I have the money and time, what matters to me is my health

1592
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,768
My hectic mind gets quiet after a workout

1593
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,379
Even if I were to get burned out, I would still work out

1594
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,279
I've got my drinks in both hands, I fill it up and get a takeout

1595
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,649
Tell me, do or die, did you put your life on the line too?

1596
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,018
Let's see, why?

1597
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:33,518
Show me, I can't just take your word for it

1598
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,058
I don't like a fake

1599
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,359
If you're talking, you'd better play

1600
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,658
I move around every day

1601
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,388
- She's a dark horse. - In this snowstorm

1602
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,558
I'm in the driver's seat of my life

1603
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,399
Will my bank account be a money-making factory someday?

1604
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,138
Will I be able to buy my mom a house someday?

1605
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,968
I'll keep going with my eyes open wide

1606
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:53,768
I'll keep trying with my eyes open wide

1607
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,339
Work out

1608
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,709
Even if I get burned out, I still work out

1609
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:00,518
I'll be the girl-crush material, I work out

1610
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:03,249
- She's good. - I'll break the ceiling, I work out

1611
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,389
Work out

1612
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,860
Make some noise!

1613
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,760
- Thank you. - The voting begins.

1614
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,360
- Ten, nine, eight, - You killed it!

1615
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,199
Seven, six,

1616
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,669
- Why? She did well. - five,

1617
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,538
- You did so well. - four,

1618
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:23,869
- three, two, one. - Let's go!

1619
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,840
- You're the best. - The voting is closed.

1620
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,808
Hey, go ape, buddy, there's no filter in your brain

1621
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,709
You act first and go out of control, suck that, Murphy

1622
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,518
There's no losing streak for me, You know that, you fools?

1623
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,319
I don't care about Murphy's law, I dismiss that kind of rule

1624
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,348
Yes, I say it, go mess it up

1625
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:39,319
For real, I don't lie, while you're in the military,

1626
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,788
I made easy dough, my paycheck was crazy

1627
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:42,189
I worked nonstop two years ago

1628
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,618
I had a paper to write in school,

1629
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,029
But I never had enough paper because I had a lot to say

1630
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,359
I mindlessly spit out my verses like a dog

1631
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,658
I'm growing like a monster, it's dope

1632
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:49,328
Get ready to take my order, Ben Baller

1633
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:51,928
I have the most exemplary life among the trap rappers

1634
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:54,899
I'd rather stop rapping if I have to get high to do it

1635
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,198
If I don't make it, then I don't,

1636
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,509
I won't be kissing anyone's you-know-what

1637
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,308
I'll rule the hip-hop scene in Korea for a long time like Obama

1638
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:03,138
My banking app is blowing up, it comes and goes

1639
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,879
Feel the paper bills

1640
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,718
I never do things halfway, I either go big or go home

1641
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,288
I ought to climb up, Roh Yun Ha goes up, yes

1642
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:15,189
- Yes! - The voting begins.

1643
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,288
Ten, nine,

1644
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:18,629
- eight, - Come on.

1645
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,928
- Come on. - seven,

1646
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:21,158
- Roh Yun Ha! - six,

1647
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:24,199
- Roh Yun Ha! - five, four,

1648
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,039
- three, two, one. - Roh Yun Ha!

1649
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,039
- Roh Yun Ha. - The voting is closed.

1650
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:34,939
Set! Make some noise!

1651
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,879
- JTONG! - JTONG!

1652
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,408
- JTONG! - JTONG!

1653
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:43,049
- JTONG! - Roh Yun Ha!

1654
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,689
- COCONA! - COCONA!

1655
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,459
- Jo Gwang Il! - Jo Gwang Il!

1656
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,360
- ZENE THE ZILLA! - ZENE THE ZILLA!

1657
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:54,499
- Gwang Il. - Hey, you were so good.

1658
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,729
- You killed it. - JTONG put out a strong verse too.

1659
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,269
Why did JTONG compete in this match? Seriously.

1660
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,329
- You were so cool. - Was I good?

1661
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,539
- Good work. - Nice.

1662
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:05,368
JTONG was rapping as if he was possessed by an evil spirit.

1663
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:08,178
I'm a rough rider on this beat with my microphone held tight

1664
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:09,479
His performance was on a different level.

1665
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,279
I thought that he totally won this match...

1666
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,678
and it was impossible to beat him.

1667
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:14,779
I don't switch lanes even if I blow up everything I have

1668
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,150
Jo Gwang Il did his signature super-fast rap.

1669
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,448
You can say whatever you want

1670
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:20,618
But I earn this spot with my hard work

1671
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,860
As expected, the audience ate that up.

1672
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,189
It'd have been impossible not to cheer for him...

1673
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,259
even if I were in the audience.

1674
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,559
Then a rapper with BB cream on talks to me

1675
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,468
We don't know the result of the first match...

1676
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:36,098
between Tray B and SINCE.

1677
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,440
Given the result of the match, we couldn't lower our guard yet.

1678
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:42,009
There's a possibility that our rankings might change.

1679
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,379
So I was super nervous.

1680
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,150
Please let me breathe.

1681
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,948
Rappers of RAP: PUBLIC.

1682
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:54,689
I will now announce the match results of Kill Them All.

1683
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:55,760
Oh, my gosh.

1684
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:59,089
Well, everyone on my block did their best.

1685
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,859
Of course, I want to win and advance to the show match.

1686
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,129
I tried my best.

1687
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,570
I gave it my all. So I don't have any regret.

1688
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,299
Only the top three blocks,

1689
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,538
determined by the accumulated Block Money...

1690
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:13,610
from previous earnings and match results,

1691
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,480
will qualify for the show match.

1692
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,650
The show match.

1693
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,308
The show match is the real thing.

1694
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,579
We just have to be in the top three.

1695
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,250
I just hoped that we would be in the top three.

1696
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:30,159
The block with the highest Block Money...

1697
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:39,530
won 20,000 dollars from 4 rounds.

1698
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,698
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1699
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:42,739
- Goodness. - That's Block Six.

1700
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,569
(Block Six showcased solid verses in Kill Them All.)

1701
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,738
(Geegooin won 1 round.)

1702
01:06:47,739 --> 01:06:52,779
(Mckdaddy won 2 rounds.)

1703
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,750
(Jo Gwang Il won 1 round.)

1704
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:59,518
- And this block also won... - They won a lot.

1705
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:02,288
- seven thousand dollars. - They won the second match?

1706
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,689
Seven thousand dollars.

1707
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,230
- Yes. I told you it was you. - It's Block Six.

1708
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,329
(Jo Gwang Il from Block 6 won Round 2 of the Hidden Match.)

1709
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,530
- You were really good. - Yes.

1710
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:14,239
- So the match JTONG was in? - JTONG didn't win.

1711
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,940
(It was difficult to pick a winner for Round 2 of the Hidden Match.)

1712
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:24,209
- Jo Gwang Il took it. - Jo Gwang Il won.

1713
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,279
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1714
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,880
- He won the 7,000-dollar match. - Goodness.

1715
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,079
Gwang Il.

1716
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,289
Will I be the MVP now, not Mckdaddy?

1717
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:33,519
Here's how I felt today.

1718
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,489
"Did you see that?"

1719
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:40,259
With 58,000 dollars as their Block Money,

1720
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,130
Block 6 is in 1st place.

1721
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:43,460
Yes.

1722
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:46,070
They have so much money.

1723
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:48,900
They made 27,000 dollars.

1724
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,908
- This is amazing. - My gosh, this worked.

1725
01:07:50,909 --> 01:07:52,840
- We're in first place. - This is crazy.

1726
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,038
We were ranked fourth when we started.

1727
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,909
But I was like, "We won first place?"

1728
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:02,280
Next, I will announce the block in third place.

1729
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:10,460
This block has 43,000 dollars.

1730
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,859
It's Block Two.

1731
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,369
(Accumulated Block Money after Kill Them All)

1732
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:19,770
We're in.

1733
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:20,770
(3rd place: Block 2, 43,000 dollars)

1734
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,238
- What? - We're still in.

1735
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:23,599
- We're in. - We're in.

1736
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,908
- We're in? Really? - Seriously.

1737
01:08:24,909 --> 01:08:27,880
- Really? - I was relieved that we made it.

1738
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,409
But it was iffy.

1739
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:32,179
We placed six bets.

1740
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,180
But we failed to make any profits.

1741
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:37,489
The way we advanced...

1742
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:40,420
I couldn't be just happy about it.

1743
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,989
It was complicated.

1744
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,729
Everyone realized that we have to up our game.

1745
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:51,069
The block with the least amount of Block Money...

1746
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:56,800
ended with 34,000 dollars.

1747
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,409
It's Block Four.

1748
01:08:58,539 --> 01:08:59,568
(Accumulated Block Money after Kill Them All)

1749
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:02,009
(5th place: Block 4, 34,000 dollars)

1750
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,439
We didn't win any rounds.

1751
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:05,050
- Right. - Yes.

1752
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,649
I saw it coming.

1753
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,019
But hearing that in person...

1754
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,149
made me feel very disappointed.

1755
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:14,960
Between the remaining two blocks,

1756
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:17,559
only one block that can advance...

1757
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,189
to the show match.

1758
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,260
The last block to advance to the show match is...

1759
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,368
(The difference between the 2 blocks is only 3,000 dollars.)"

1760
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,270
(3rd place: 40,000 dollars, 4th place: 37,000 dollars)

1761
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:32,009
(Tray B and SINCE engaged in a heated competition...)

1762
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:36,439
(in Round 1 of the Hidden Match.)

1763
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,209
Boss

1764
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,749
(The 5,000 dollars is at stake.)

1765
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,279
(Who won Round 1 of the Hidden Match?)

1766
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,250
I was hoping this would be our Hail Mary play.

1767
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,229
I really hoped that we won the Hidden Match.

1768
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,029
We worked so hard to get to where we are.

1769
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,800
The block who obtained 5,000 dollars from the Hidden Match...

1770
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,970
and won second place is...

1771
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:03,839
- Block Three. - Gosh.

1772
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,140
Block Three.

1773
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,109
Block Three won a round in the Hidden Match.

1774
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,920
- SINCE. - SINCE.

1775
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,180
My gosh.

1776
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,319
Thank you so much!

1777
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:21,460
I'll work harder. Thank you. I mean it.

1778
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,590
Block 3's accumulated Block Money is 45,000 dollars.

1779
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,060
Block 3 won 2nd place.

1780
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,199
We have a lot of money.

1781
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:30,799
- Second place. - We're rich.

1782
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,270
My gosh, the sense of relief...

1783
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,599
We were ranked last when we started,

1784
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,100
but we were ranked second when we finished.

1785
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,140
Block Two had a lot of money.

1786
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,379
Honesty, I didn't think that we could beat them.

1787
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,109
But I thought, "How did this happen?"

1788
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,210
So Block One is eliminated?

1789
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,449
Block 1's accumulated Block Money is 37,000 dollars.

1790
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:54,859
Block 1 won 4th place.

1791
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,460
My gosh.

1792
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,829
They could've survived if they won one more round.

1793
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,470
I was dazed.

1794
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:06,300
I couldn't believe it.

1795
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,408
As Block 1 and Block 4...

1796
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:15,439
failed to survive in Kill Them All,

1797
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,439
they must leave RAP: PUBLIC tonight.

1798
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:19,078
- They're really eliminated. - What?

1799
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:20,778
- There's no consolation match. - No.

1800
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:21,850
I guess not.

1801
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,449
It's hitting me all over again.

1802
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:27,220
- This is so cruel. - Yes.

1803
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,359
Rappers of Block Four. You guys did a great job.

1804
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:35,759
It was an honor to battle with other rappers here.

1805
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,560
It was a fun ride. Thank you.

1806
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:39,899
Thank you.

1807
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,099
- Good work. - Good job.

1808
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,238
Good job!

1809
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,538
- Good work. - Good job.

1810
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:48,978
There was this thing we often said to each other in our block.

1811
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:51,279
"If we're getting eliminated, we should get eliminated together."

1812
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:54,448
"Or we should survive as a block." We used to say this a lot.

1813
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:56,078
(Boi B won 2nd place in the Infinite Cypher...)

1814
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,488
(and became a reliable leader of Block 4.)

1815
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:00,118
Our block had...

1816
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:02,560
the most reliable senior rapper like Boi B.

1817
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,960
I was happy and grateful to be part of your block.

1818
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:10,398
(PUNCHNELLO protected Block 4...)

1819
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,430
(in the deathmatch after the Block Competition.)

1820
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:18,140
(Block 4 was complete after recruiting 99' Nasty Kidz.)

1821
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,738
(Block 4 showcased stronger teamwork than any other block.)

1822
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:23,339
Complete strangers got together...

1823
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,009
and made meaningful achievements.

1824
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,849
It made me wonder, "Have I been this invested in something lately?"

1825
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:29,979
That's how I felt on this show.

1826
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:32,519
This show has been a series of many emotional rollercoasters.

1827
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,818
I felt a sense of comradeship too.

1828
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:36,519
We lost, but it doesn't change the fact that...

1829
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,029
we did our best.

1830
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,328
So I don't have to feel so bad that we're leaving.

1831
01:12:40,329 --> 01:12:42,559
From the way I see it, we put out great performances...

1832
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,130
on the show.

1833
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:50,269
I would like to thank all the rappers on my block...

1834
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,239
who trusted me and followed my lead.

1835
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:55,840
The biggest reason...

1836
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,649
behind joining this show...

1837
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,250
was...

1838
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,220
It was for my dad.

1839
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:06,750
He's quite ill.

1840
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:08,960
So I wanted...

1841
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,060
to bring smiles...

1842
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,430
After being on the show...

1843
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,039
First of all, Dad, I'm sorry.

1844
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:32,850
I love you all. Thank you.

1845
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,920
My gosh.

1846
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,329
Mom. I'm really sorry.

1847
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:48,100
I love you, okay?

1848
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,999
We were a really strong block.

1849
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,029
We were never seen as a weak block.

1850
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:56,340
(To bring smiles to his sick dad, )

1851
01:13:56,939 --> 01:13:59,538
(Fleeky Bang, the leader of Block 1, gave his all on stage.)

1852
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:01,209
(Block 1 ruled the stage with their unique wild swagger.)

1853
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:03,809
We did our best to prepare for it and gave our all on stage.

1854
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,449
We bonded a lot as a team.

1855
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,519
I thought that everyone on our block had a clear role on a macro level.

1856
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,390
I'm sure everyone knows that we're great rappers.

1857
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,988
We must show people better performances...

1858
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:18,759
and get acknowledged for our music. I'll keep trying.

1859
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,429
Block One, keep your head up.

1860
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,858
We did well. You know?

1861
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:23,600
It was a valuable experience.

1862
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,969
This show made me become a stronger rapper mentally...

1863
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,500
as well as in other aspects.

1864
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,869
Well done.

1865
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,979
- Good work! - Great job.

1866
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,680
- Good job. - Well done.

1867
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:40,148
Good job, SINCE.

1868
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:42,219
- You guys did well. I mean it. - Hey.

1869
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,319
- My gosh, brother. - See you.

1870
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,520
- Good job. - Okay.

1871
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:48,420
- Well done. - Well done.

1872
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,060
Seriously.

1873
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,398
You did well. You still have so much to show people.

1874
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:59,769
Darn it. I really worked so hard.

1875
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,930
Well done.

1876
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,439
I really worked so hard for it.

1877
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:11,180
I really worked hard. Darn it.

1878
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:15,818
I have no regret because I did my best.

1879
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:19,349
I got to show people who I am for the first time.

1880
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,819
I hope they like me for it.

1881
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,560
I really worked hard.

1882
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,689
Rappers of RAP: PUBLIC,

1883
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:29,829
only two matches remain now.

1884
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,898
It's going to be so hard to beat the other two blocks.

1885
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:32,930
Right.

1886
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,170
I'll crush them all.

1887
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:37,698
Please give your all and prepare your best performance...

1888
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,069
for the next match,

1889
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:42,478
so you can win a spot in the Final Block Match.

1890
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,139
Let's make it to the final match.

1891
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,350
Let's do it, darn it.

1892
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,409
It's time for Block Two.

1893
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:48,879
This is our time now.

1894
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,549
The show match will be my playground.

1895
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:52,220
And I'll be flying now.

1896
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:54,419
Since we made it this far, I'm going to show 100 percent...

1897
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,658
No, I'll show 200 percent...

1898
01:15:55,659 --> 01:15:58,260
of what I've got for this performance.

1899
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:00,259
I will not lower my guard.

1900
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,659
I'll prepare something that will shock everyone.

1901
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:25,649
This is the one and only society that's solely built on rap.

1902
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:30,619
People of RAP: PUBLIC, welcome.

1903
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,699
People gather around and form a society.

1904
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:43,270
Through competition, it evolves and expands.

1905
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,739
Right here on RAP: PUBLIC,

1906
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,639
the audience has joined as new members of the society.

1907
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,709
As the blocks expand again...

1908
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:53,078
in the journey of finding the final block,

1909
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:56,149
the fifth match is about to commence.

1910
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,989
After four intense matches...

1911
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:03,060
and changes of momentum that resulted from each block's strategy,

1912
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,560
only three blocks have advanced to perform in front of the audience.

1913
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,659
The number of blocks to advance to the Final Block Match...

1914
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,229
after surviving today's match...

1915
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:15,399
is only two.

1916
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:22,739
The blocks that advance to the Final Block Match...

1917
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:25,978
will be given Block Money of 50,000 dollars.

1918
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:27,649
(50,000 dollars of Block Money)

1919
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,149
Five thousand dollars?

1920
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:34,250

Let's go!

1926
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:14,390
Only one match remains before the final round.

1927
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:16,929
Aren't you excited?

1928
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,698
- Yes. - Yes.

1929
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:22,898

(Block 3)

1945
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,639
Complete balance, strong teamwork.

1946
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,249
Team Trinity of love and peace.

1947
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,510
Everyone, this is Block Three.

1948
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:10,720

(HAON, Reddy, Roh Yun Ha, Chaboom, SINCE, James An, DOMMIU, Yang Kyle)

1956
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:31,438
Lastly, this is Block Two.

1957
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,038
(Block 2)

1958
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,750
This is Block Two that's armed with powerful synergy.

1959
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:44,889
Young Generation Leader, ShyboiiTobii.

1960
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,988

1968
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,209
As it's their first performance of the day,

1969
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,840
all of them look very resolute.

1970
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:13,279
Here is how Crew Battle will proceed.

1971
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,750
The fifth Block Match, Crew Battle...

1972
01:20:18,989 --> 01:20:21,420
consists of three rounds.

1973
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:26,789
Rappers in each block will form a group of either 2 or 3.

1974
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:29,899
They will compete with new songs during the match.

1975
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:33,869
One producer participated in each round.

1976
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:37,438
Three blocks will perform with songs...

1977
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:39,369
made by the same producer.

1978
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,339
The audience voting will take place every round.

1979
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,978
First voting after every peformance,

1980
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:51,520
second voting after each round will take place.

1981
01:20:51,819 --> 01:20:55,090
There will be a total of three rounds.

1982
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:58,158
Depending on the voting result,

1983
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:03,229
two blocks to advance to the final round will be determined.

1984
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,868
Let's show what I prepared without leaving regrets.

1985
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:08,698
I will make everyone excited...

1986
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:10,769
and completely dominate the vibe.

1987
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:13,170
I can't wait to take out the passion in me.

1988
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:16,139
I'll ignite their passion...

1989
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,439
and start a huge fire.

1990
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,209
Hello, I'm Kaogaii!

1991
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:22,279
- Yes! - Yes.

1992
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:24,250
Block Six was formed...

1993
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,589
after many ups and downs.

1994
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,859
We'll complete ourselves with victory.

1995
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,090
Thank you.

1996
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:37,399
Hello.

1997
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,198
We're Block Two.

1998
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,999
As you can see, we look amazing. We also prepared something amazing.

1999
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,710
We'll do our best to deliver a spectacular performance.

2000
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,810
Hello, I'm Block Three's HAON.

2001
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,050
Our goal is also winning.

2002
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:03,158
This moment is unique, and it won't repeat.

2003
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:04,789
Let's enjoy it because it's rare.

2004
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:11,930
The last match toward the final, Crew Battle...

2005
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:13,829
will...

2006
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,210
start now. Let's go!

2007
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,538
(Members of each Block gathered for the Crew Battle.)

2008
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,148
We made it all the way here.

2009
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:28,578
We came a long way.

2010
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:30,879
JP and OSUN joined our block.

2011
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,948
- I bet we'll defeat everyone. - Yes.

2012
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,118
We've been losing until now.

2013
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,658
I feel like this is our game to play.

2014
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:40,829
- Right. - Seriously.

2015
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:43,630
(Block 3)

2016
01:22:43,729 --> 01:22:46,228
What makes us stand out is that we don't have strategies.

2017
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:47,299
Right.

2018
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,538
It has been the case for almost every mission.

2019
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:52,509
- We've just been sincere. - Exactly.

2020
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,810
This isn't a war.

2021
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:56,839
- It's about making music. - Right.

2022
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,840
First, it has to be fun.

2023
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:59,108
- Right. - That's what I think.

2024
01:22:59,109 --> 01:23:00,648
- So that's our strategy. - I agree.

2025
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:03,448
- We make it enjoyable. - Let's have fun.

2026
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:05,319
- Our strategy is not having any. - Right.

2027
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,858
I really want to make it. I want to win.

2028
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,189
I'll be honest.

2029
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,028
When I look at our block,

2030
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,728
I think that third place...

2031
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:16,129
- suits us the most. - Hey.

2032
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:17,898
- I shouldn't think that way. - I agree.

2033
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:19,729
- Oh, come on. - Here's why.

2034
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:22,738
We don't look like the lead.

2035
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:25,139
- The lead is the one who survives. - I mean...

2036
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,739
(The lead is the one who survives.)

2037
01:23:28,539 --> 01:23:30,510
- He's been in first place. - Right.

2038
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:32,509
Gwang Il has won before.

2039
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:35,519
I said that placing third seemed the best for us,

2040
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,879
but I really want us to win.

2041
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,889
If we make it in this mission,

2042
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,389
we have a chance of winning.

2043
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,520
- Great. - I want to win.

2044
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,559
- Block Six. - Let's go.

2045
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,260
Okay.

2046
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,158
Let's go, Block Three. Team...

2047
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:49,198
- Trinity. - Trinity.

2048
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,629
Block Two, let's go.

2049
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,328
- All right. - Let's go to the final round.

2050
01:23:52,329 --> 01:23:53,500
Let's go.

2051
01:23:53,869 --> 01:23:56,039
For this round of Crew Battle,

2052
01:23:56,699 --> 01:24:00,810
the producer who made songs for the three blocks is...

2053
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,608
Padi.

2054
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:07,810
(The first round's producer, Padi)

2055
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,960
(Produced "1 Over N" for the match on "Show Me the Money 6")

2056
01:24:18,789 --> 01:24:22,029
(Produced "Smoke" with Dynamic Duo for "Street Woman Fighter 2")

2057
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:26,568
(Started the "Smoke" dance challenge craze all over the country)

2058
01:24:26,569 --> 01:24:29,800
(Padi, a producer who makes hit songs)

2059
01:24:30,439 --> 01:24:33,039
It's a mega hit song presented on "Street Woman Fighter 2."

2060
01:24:33,539 --> 01:24:35,880
Smoke you up, I'm going to smoke you

2061
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:38,749
I'm going to smoke you up, I'm going to smoke you

2062
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,278
He's the producer who created this.

2063
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:42,478
With songs by Padi, the maker of hit songs,

2064
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:44,719
the three blocks will compete in the match.

2065
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,350
Which crew will perform next?

2066
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,919
It's SINCE and DOMMIU from Block Three.

2067
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,789
(Block 3, SINCE and DOMMIU)

2068
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:58,999
As hard as we worked,

2069
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,828
I'm sure Block 2 and 6 worked hard too,

2070
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,038
but someone has to go home.

2071
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,108
Today may be the last day for someone,

2072
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:08,039
but it won't be us.

2073
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:12,549
O'Domar and JOONIE from Block Six.

2074
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,180
(Block 6, O'Domar and JOONIE)

2075
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:17,278
If we win this one, we'll get to the final round.

2076
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,889
We have to give everything to this performance.

2077
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:22,819
I hope that I won't regret anything after this moment.

2078
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:28,499
JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun from Block Two.

2079
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,869
(Block 2, JTONG, KHAN, Nosun)

2080
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:36,469
One word that sums up our crew is "fire."

2081
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,169
The time has come...

2082
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:41,538
for us to show what we're good at.

2083
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:43,579
We'll win fervently and make it to the finals.

2084
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:45,749
(Block 3: SINCE, DOMMIU)

2085
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,349
(Block 6: O'Domar, JOONIE)

2086
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,948
(Block 2: JTONG, KHAN, Nosun)

2087
01:25:48,949 --> 01:25:52,220
The first crew to perform in this round is...

2088
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,658
SINCE and DOMMIU from Block Three.

2089
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,390
(Block 3, SINCE, DOMMIU)

2090
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,658
SINCE, let's go.

2091
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:08,328
The next performance by SINCE and DOMMIU will cause a girl crush.

2092
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,068
Everyone, are you excited?

2093
01:26:10,069 --> 01:26:11,569
- Yes. - Yes.

2094
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:15,278
Here are SINCE and DOMMIU from Block Three.

2095
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:19,109
Let's go!

2096
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:24,179
If I were to describe our performance in a few words,

2097
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,350
"I don't give a darn."

2098
01:26:25,489 --> 01:26:27,789
- We're BOWWOW. - BOWWOW.

2099
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,288
Even if dogs bark,

2100
01:26:29,289 --> 01:26:31,889
we won't be bothered. We'll continue our way.

2101
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:34,188
- We don't care what you say. - Go away.

2102
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,029
That's the gist of it.

2103
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:38,729
Female warriors!

2104
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,999
- The theme suits you very well. - I agree.

2105
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,238
It suits you well.

2106
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,868
It was easy to write the lyrics.

2107
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:47,809
- It was very easy. - The theme was nice and clear.

2108
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,810
It's like you put on...

2109
01:26:48,811 --> 01:26:50,078
- an outfit that fits you. - Right.

2110
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,249
The next performance will be important.

2111
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,309
It's rare...

2112
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:56,478
to see a performance by two female rappers.

2113
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:57,550
You're right.

2114
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,318
DOMMIU and I are the only female members in the block.

2115
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:02,358
If we work together, we'll be able to create...

2116
01:27:02,359 --> 01:27:04,319
a synergy effect as women.

2117
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:07,560
SINCE and I prepared a powerful performance.

2118
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,560
We're ready.

2119
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,569
- Is DOMMIU starting first? - Are you ready?

2120
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,399
Gosh, DOMMIU.

2121
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,439
(Other blockmates see their performance for the first time.)

2122
01:27:18,939 --> 01:27:20,369
Barking is my expertise.

2123
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,840
(Barking)

2124
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:25,278
BOWWOW, I'm okay Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2125
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:28,509
BOWWOW I'm okay, I'm the queen, I'm the Cap

2126
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,818
BOWWOW I'm okay, Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2127
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:33,549
BOWWOW, I'm okay

2128
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:36,489
The impact in the beginning was really strong.

2129
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,289
I love them

2130
01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:40,389
No matter what people say

2131
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,390
I'll keep living

2132
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,960
SINCE rapped so powerfully.

2133
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:47,229
DOMMIU's rap was so loud and sharp.

2134
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:50,538
Have you met a foreign worker like me?

2135
01:27:50,539 --> 01:27:52,739
They could be dangerous.

2136
01:27:53,239 --> 01:27:55,010
Big brother, Deepflow.

2137
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,078
Tired of Deepflow

2138
01:27:57,079 --> 01:27:58,608
The life has been too long

2139
01:27:58,609 --> 01:28:01,648
So the dog keeps barking, BOWWOW

2140
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:04,519
Soo Jin got hot and got wings, go up

2141
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,788
A savior of my life joined us.

2142
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:09,920
He's like my first father in my music career.

2143
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,259
He gave me his trust...

2144
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,089
and helped me release my first album.

2145
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,300
(SINCE's 1st album, SINCE 16')

2146
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:20,198
Without that album,

2147
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:23,139
I wonder if I could be where I'm now.

2148
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:25,970
I'm very grateful to him.

2149
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:29,478
BOWWOW, I'm okay I'm the queen, I'm the Cap

2150
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:32,448
BOWWOW, I'm okay Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2151
01:28:32,449 --> 01:28:33,979
I was very surprised.

2152
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:36,919
He set the balance with his steady rap.

2153
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,550
Overall, their performance was balanced.

2154
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,919
- BOWWOW - BOWWOW

2155
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,489
- BOWWOW, WOW - BOWWOW, WOW

2156
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,899
BOWWOW, we don't care

2157
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:52,800
- That was amazing. - BOWWOW

2158
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,568
The song hook is quite exciting.

2159
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:57,938
Don't worry about anything.

2160
01:28:57,939 --> 01:28:59,108
No matter what others say,

2161
01:28:59,109 --> 01:29:01,509
feel however you feel, and enjoy however you want.

2162
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,409
I hope that you'll enjoy our performance.

2163
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,479
BOWWOW, we don't care

2164
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:09,449
(The first performance by SINCE and DOMMIU)

2165
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:17,590
The dancers are coming up.

2166
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,060
They're coming up. Fill up the stage.

2167
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,539
- The first female duo. - You're right.

2168
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:35,680
What I'm curious about the most is the vibe on stage.

2169
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,439
- SINCE is so energetic. - Right.

2170
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:42,250
And will DOMMIU's energy level be up to par?

2171
01:29:42,979 --> 01:29:44,649
- I'm curious about that too. - Me too.

2172
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,720
SINCE?

2173
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,189
I'm curious about their performance.

2174
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,118
They'll do well.

2175
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,029
I bet they'll be amazing.

2176
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,359
Good luck, DOMMIU.

2177
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,600
You can do it.

2178
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:00,300
(How will SINCE DOMMIU crew's performance turn out?)

2179
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,269
("BOWWOW" featuring Deepflow)

Keep barking, then I am Racks on racks

The more you curse at me, the bigger you get

I disinfect the pain with soju, I'm alpha female

No pause after "Show Me the Money," Densely I made

Feeling like Ferg, I'm on a new level

2200
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,429
I take out a different weapon, which is rap

2201
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:02,658
Between my reality and paradise, I close down the gap

After running on treadmill every day my physique gets in shape, Taereung

- SINCE looks so amazing. - Jerks who don't know

2204

They can't help but recognize my talent

2205

Okay, go ahead and try, We don't care

At the same time, balling and balling

BOWWOW, we don't care

2226
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:57,379
Talking nonsense, okay

BOWWOW, we don't care

2228
01:31:58,619 --> 01:32:00,648
They're singing with the audience. That's good.

01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:02,288
BOWWOW, we don't care

2230
01:32:02,289 --> 01:32:03,818
Let's go, DOMMIU.

2231
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:07,089
Hello, let me introduce myself, have you met a foreign worker like me?

2232
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:10,728
You look down on me, but I have a ticket to this chaotic party

2233
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:12,328
Me and my homies, Block Three

2234
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:14,028
Remove the obstacles, I'm not afraid

2235
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:15,698
I gave up a lot to get here

2236
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:18,568
Why would I care about you for lifting your finger?

2237
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:20,108
You'll only be scratching your head in your room

2238
01:32:20,109 --> 01:32:21,809
While you went to karaoke with your mom's credit card

2239
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,639
I worked two jobs to earn money for school

2240
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,778
Gather and bow, wow, wow Louder, loud, loud, loud

2241
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:30,179
If you can't convince me, It's all nonsense, I go my way

2242
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:33,649
Listen up, You won't find anyone like me

2243
01:32:33,789 --> 01:32:37,118
- I made the impossible happen - She's a player.

2244
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:39,959
We get to the top, Now you need to stop

2245
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,089
Even if you bark down there, It sounds like cheering

2246
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,059
Children, study hard

2247
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,599
Watch me how to do, Let me cook

2248
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,129
It's all or nothing, Denial and hatred

2249
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,368
Pile them up and start a fire, Dance in the sea of fire

2250
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:50,499
Where is next?

2251
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,068
- What? - She's so good.

2252
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:53,369
The stage will be my paradise

2253
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,578
Under the lights, We make our future brighter

2254
01:32:56,579 --> 01:32:59,749
BOWWOW, I'm okay Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2255
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,379
- I got goosebumps. - Goodness.

2256
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:03,078
I'm the queen, I'm the Cap

2257
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:06,349
BOWWOW, I'm okay Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2258
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:09,658
BOWWOW, I'm okay I'm the queen, I'm the Cap

2259
01:33:09,659 --> 01:33:11,459
BOWWOW, we don't care

2260
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,959
What? I can't hear you

2261
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,759
BOWWOW, we don't care

2262
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,198
Okay, okay, okay

2263
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:17,800
BOWWOW, we don't care

2264
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,469
Nonsense, okay, okay

2265
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,769
BOWWOW, we don't care

2266
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,270
They still have one more coming.

2267
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,300
Big brother, Deepflow.

2268
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,568
Tired of Deepflow

2269
01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:28,938
The life has been too long

2270
01:33:28,939 --> 01:33:30,809
So the dog keeps barking, BOWWOW

2271
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,278
Zip up the nonsense

2272
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:34,078
That can't be directly translated

2273
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:37,349
Put on the armor, I have too many enemies, I overwork

2274
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:40,519
Too many enemies, my ears itch, No matter what I do

2275
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,520
No matter what I do

2276
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:43,118
Wherever I go, there's blood

2277
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:44,788
I can't handle your example

2278
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:46,429
Crush and throw away my moving stories

2279
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:48,028
You've got the nerve

2280
01:33:48,029 --> 01:33:49,728
Smoke my flame and retaliate

2281
01:33:49,729 --> 01:33:50,759
The stage at high temperature

2282
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,629
Soo Jin got hot and got wings, go up

2283
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:55,629
BOWWOW, I'm okay, Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2284
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,898
BOWWOW, I'm okay I'm the queen, I'm the Cap

2285
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:02,209
BOWWOW, I'm okay, Go ahead and bark, we don't care

2286
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:05,509
BOWWOW, I'm okay I'm the queen, I'm the Cap

2287
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,209
BOWWOW, we don't care

2288
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:08,679
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2289
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,519
BOWWOW, we don't care

2290
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,049
- We don't care - We don't care

2291
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,719
BOWWOW, we don't care

2292
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,318
- We don't care - We don't care

2293
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:18,589
BOWWOW, we don't care, I'm the king, I'm the Cap

2294
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,590
Let's go.

2295
01:34:19,591 --> 01:34:22,698
BOWWOW

2296
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:25,969
BOWWOW, BOWWOW WOW

2297
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:29,339
- They're so into it. - BOWWOW

2298
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:32,408
BOWWOW, BOWWOW WOW

2299
01:34:32,409 --> 01:34:33,809
We're Block Three.

2300
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:36,078
- Trinity. - And Deepflow.

2301
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:37,579
("BOWWOW" by SINCE and DOMMIU is available on all music platforms.)

2302
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,590
Block Three, baby.

2303
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:51,659
Well done.

2304
01:34:51,789 --> 01:34:54,029
- That was amazing. - They delivered the energy.

2305
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:59,100
Soo Jin, you were in Block Six.

2306
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:00,229
Do you miss her?

2307
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:01,869
A little.

2308
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:04,538
- Yes. - Block Three.

2309
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,310
- They're back. - They nailed it.

2310
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:07,738
Wasn't DOMMIU amazing?

2311
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:09,179
- She was incredible. - It was unbelievable.

2312
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,340
DOMMIU is a pop star.

2313
01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:14,579
As the first performance, they got a lot of response.

2314
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:15,649
SINCE showed...

2315
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,719
everything that she had...

2316
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,019
as much as possible today.

2317
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,090
It was impressive.

2318
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:24,760
DOMMIU nailed the performance, so I was really surprised.

2319
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:28,129
I could see how hard they worked,

2320
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:29,559
so I was very grateful.

2321
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,259
Their confidence and energy stood out so much.

2322
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,130
Watching them made me happy.

2323
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,469
The voting will begin.

2324
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:38,970
(1st voting begins for Block 3's SINCE and DOMMIU.)

2325
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:42,978
BOWWOW, we don't care

2326
01:35:42,979 --> 01:35:44,778
BOWWOW, we don't care

2327
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:46,549
BOWWOW, we don't care

2328
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,449
BOWWOW, we don't care

2329
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,249
- Six, five, - Six, five,

2330
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:55,049
- four, three, - four, three,

2331
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,659
- two, one. - two, one.

2332
01:35:57,489 --> 01:35:58,589
(1st voting ends for Block 3's SINCE and DOMMIU.)

2333
01:35:58,590 --> 01:35:59,590
Thank you.

2334
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:03,299
We were right about being wary of them.

2335
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,259
They showed us beyond what we had expected.

2336
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:08,099
However, we can do much better.

2337
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,100
DOMMIU nailed it.

2338
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:10,969
DOMMIU nailed it,

2339
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:13,538
and Deepflow was an amazing help.

2340
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:18,339
I was very pleased that everyone sang along...

2341
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,609
the hook.

2342
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:23,079
The second crew to perform in this round is...

2343
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,949
O'Domar and JOONIE from Block Six.

2344
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:31,159
You got this!

2345
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:36,729
It's the most special combination, isn't it?

2346
01:36:36,899 --> 01:36:40,469
I'm really curious about their performance.

2347
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:44,069
I thought they had great teamwork.

2348
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,609
(D'Domar and JOONIE performed many times in the last Block Match.)

2349
01:36:47,909 --> 01:36:51,038
I liked how they exchanged voices,

2350
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:53,210
unfolding the story with lyrical melodies.

2351
01:36:53,479 --> 01:36:55,209
I was excited about them in a different way.

2352
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:58,319
"What kind of song will they pick? How will they perform it?"

2353
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,649
(The rehearsal for the Crew Battle)

2354
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,159
(It's their first time to show their performance to other blocks.)

2355
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:07,529
The dots are lined up

2356
01:37:07,859 --> 01:37:11,158
- I can connect them and draw a line - I like her voice.

2357
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,300
JOONIE can sing.

2358
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,698
Brick by brick

2359
01:37:16,699 --> 01:37:18,139
I'm going to break this line

2360
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:20,868
My role model who had a positive influence on me

2361
01:37:20,869 --> 01:37:22,908
What makes you nod your head to my rap

2362
01:37:22,909 --> 01:37:25,949
Is not just the beat, but the power to live the life, propel

2363
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:28,550
He sounds good live.

2364
01:37:28,779 --> 01:37:31,618
Compared to what they showed before,

2365
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:33,250
they've improved more.

2366
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:37,659
The tone is better, and it's more sophisticated.

2367
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:39,589
Let me show you mine

2368
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,060
Oh, my.

2369
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:43,500
- It does feel different. - Definitely.

2370
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,828
That was cool.

2371
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:49,299
I really liked the song.

2372
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:52,839
It was heartwarming and beautiful.

2373
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,639
When I watched your rehearsal,

2374
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,009
I felt...

2375
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,278
it was therapeutic. I just loved it.

2376
01:37:58,279 --> 01:38:00,349
Thinking about it now,

2377
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:03,278
O'Domar and JOONIE were the only mixed duo today.

2378
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:06,749
I'm looking forward to the synergy or your secret weapon.

2379
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,119
JOONIE is the secret weapon.

2380
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:09,788
I think it's you.

2381
01:38:09,789 --> 01:38:11,390
Yes. We...

2382
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,759
The title of our song is "Seon."

2383
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,960
Seon is the "good" in "good and evil" in Korean.

2384
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,059
Seon also means "line."

2385
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,569
"Let's not draw a line between us..."

2386
01:38:20,869 --> 01:38:23,599
"and move forward together." That's what the song means.

2387
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,038
It's a new perspective of the world.

2388
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,539
I wrote the rap from a different perspective.

2389
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:33,078
There's no crew that looks the weakest.

2390
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:36,049
People in the other blocks will say it's O'Domar and JOONIE.

2391
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:40,318
That's why they must go against their expectations. I hope they do.

2392
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:42,890
Today, I'm going to perform without any regrets.

2393
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,959
(The second performers of the Padi Round in the Crew Battle...)

2394
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,460
(are D'Domar and JOONIE.)

2395
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,430
(O'Domar's wife)

2396
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,430
JOONIE is pretty.

2397
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,568
It's JOONIE.

2398
01:38:57,569 --> 01:38:59,710
- I'm really curious about them. - Yes. I'm curious.

2399
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:04,810
Let's go.

2400
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:13,288
("Seon" by O'Domar and JOONIE)

2401
01:39:13,289 --> 01:39:15,050
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

2402
01:39:18,289 --> 01:39:19,429
That's my sister.

2403
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:20,430
Don't be nervous.

2404
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:25,960
The dots are lined up, I can connect them and draw a line

2405
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:31,339
On the line, I trip, tripping

2406
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,010
We're all falling into the same trap

2407
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:37,139
- Brick by brick - She's gorgeous.

2408
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,549
I'm going to break this line

2409
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,349
This song, which captures all the thrills I felt

2410
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,919
From my role model who had a positive influence on me, is Nobel

2411
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,389
What makes you nod your head to my rap

2412
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:51,020
Is not just the beat, but the power to live the life, propel

2413
01:39:51,189 --> 01:39:53,158
"But it's not new, not cool"

2414
01:39:53,159 --> 01:39:55,728
"He thinks he's an artist, he's no fun, has no groove"

2415
01:39:55,729 --> 01:39:58,728
That's what they think about me, those words will leave scars

2416
01:39:58,729 --> 01:39:59,999
But they say it's criticism

2417
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,368
They tell me to listen and improve my style and looks

2418
01:40:01,369 --> 01:40:03,568
When things go well, even malicious comments are the credit

2419
01:40:03,569 --> 01:40:06,139
Even when things don't, there's no editing, so I'll seize it

2420
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,368
Now, I'll let it all out, the cries I couldn't release

2421
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:10,978
- Nice. - I'll finish the march proudly

2422
01:40:10,979 --> 01:40:13,849
I gave my entire 20s to rap

2423
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:16,318
What I chased wasn't a passing trend, but eternity

2424
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:18,879
In this age of widespread hatred, what's needed is variation

2425
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,589
Show me everything you have before crossing the line

2426
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:23,959
- That was amazing. - This is nice.

2427
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,289
If I show them everything, won't they hate me?

2428
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,829
Don't know, will this be worth it?

2429
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:31,728
No matter how much I think about it, you and I are so different

2430
01:40:31,729 --> 01:40:33,970
We've been on this for a while lately

2431
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:36,639
I'll show you, please don't hate me

2432
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:39,238
Don't know, will this be worth it?

2433
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:40,368
Just the way I am

2434
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:43,609
- Accept me for who I am - How do I look?

2435
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:48,509
I'm painted with clumsy and awkward lines

2436
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:49,549
It's oceanfromtheblue.

2437
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:55,719
No matter how much I try to paint it, what's left is

2438
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,158
It feels like my own way

2439
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:01,560
Own way

2440
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:04,728
There's no right or wrong, just know we're different kinds

2441
01:41:04,729 --> 01:41:07,328
We want to stay strong, accept with open minds

2442
01:41:07,329 --> 01:41:09,898
Please don't cross my line, respect my boundary

2443
01:41:09,899 --> 01:41:12,469
Have to pay the fine, please don't cross my line

2444
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:14,969
Why bother with right and wrong? That's my standard

2445
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:17,478
We judge others' lives more easily than our own

2446
01:41:17,479 --> 01:41:20,148
I don't want to get hurt, so this is what I'll do

2447
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:21,608
- She's good. - That's why I should draw the line

2448
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:22,609
JOONIE.

2449
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:24,948
After all, it's all grey between lines that are made

2450
01:41:24,949 --> 01:41:27,549
It's not wrong to switch lanes, it's just a process

2451
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:30,019
It's just a process, so don't give up and try

2452
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:31,389
I'll reach out to you first

2453
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:32,759
- He did that in front of his wife? - I wish you all could understand

2454
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,288
After all, it's all grey between lines that are made

2455
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:37,858
It's not wrong to switch lanes, it's just a process

2456
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:40,368
It's just a process, why do you give up without trying?

2457
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:41,828
I'll reach out to you first

2458
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:42,839
It's time to give me your hand

2459
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,738
- How do I look? - Hands up!

2460
01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:49,939
I'm painted with clumsy and awkward lines

2461
01:41:50,579 --> 01:41:56,948
No matter how much I try to paint it, what's left is

2462
01:41:56,949 --> 01:41:59,519
It feels like my own way

2463
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,789
- Own way - It's a heartwarming song.

2464
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,188
It always feels like if I take one more step further

2465
01:42:06,189 --> 01:42:08,658
I'll reach the scene where they cheer for me

2466
01:42:08,659 --> 01:42:11,299
Somehow, I've made it to the threshold,

2467
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:13,769
But I was always left with lingering regret, collapsing in defeat

2468
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:16,299
I've always believed in the process, but now I'm losing faith

2469
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:17,599
What I've learned from their indifference is

2470
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,898
To wear a mask and pretend it doesn't affect me

2471
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:21,209
Tempted to give up when the twist doesn't come

2472
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:23,938
Falling into the trap of thinking I've done well enough, every time

2473
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:26,448
My creation is hailed as a masterpiece, but I feel like

2474
01:42:26,449 --> 01:42:28,879
I can't move forward from this place I'm in

2475
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,478
I lost the values I built, made mistakes by wandering

2476
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:34,188
To erase them, I reminded myself of my first resolve and determination

2477
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:36,759
It's not the fact that I can't be loved, nor the unreachable success

2478
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,118
That drove me, even clear limits

2479
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,488
Are made by me, so I walk again

2480
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:43,328
On every line drawn, not for others' standards

2481
01:42:43,329 --> 01:42:46,770
- But for myself - How do I look?

2482
01:42:47,029 --> 01:42:49,368
- I'm painted - Hands up!

2483
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:51,670
With clumsy and awkward lines

2484
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:58,278
No matter how much I try to paint it, what's left is

2485
01:42:58,279 --> 01:43:00,608
It feels like my own way

2486
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:03,819
Own way

2487
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,389
Personal space is always needed, my boundary

2488
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,158
Is the same as the line of honor drawn on my palm

2489
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,188
Society changing, people invading

2490
01:43:12,189 --> 01:43:15,358
Personal space, that's how I drifted away from them every day

2491
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:17,259
"He's like that, she's like this"

2492
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,868
We keep pushing each other away, saying we're different

2493
01:43:19,869 --> 01:43:21,129
We don't even need a fight

2494
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,068
Everyone just has their own way to cope

2495
01:43:23,069 --> 01:43:25,569
Let's just open up, let me show you mine

2496
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,478
("Seon" by O'Domar and JOONIE is available...)

2497
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:32,340
(on all music platforms.)

2498
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:35,778
Give it up for the NANA Crew that performed with us today.

2499
01:43:35,779 --> 01:43:39,118
Oceanfromtheblue, JOONIE, and O'Domar.

2500
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:42,819
Everybody, make some noise!

2501
01:43:43,789 --> 01:43:45,189
Thank you.

2502
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:49,459
- Well done. - Yes.

2503
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:51,398
I think they found the perfect subject...

2504
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:53,769
- for both of them. - I think they did.

2505
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:54,770
JOONIE was good.

2506
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:55,828
It's a great song to listen to.

2507
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:57,038
- They worked hard. - I really respect them.

2508
01:43:57,039 --> 01:43:58,639
- They worked very hard. - It was nice.

2509
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,840
JOONIE and O'Domar. It was good.

2510
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:01,510
Well done.

2511
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:03,438
It was great.

2512
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:04,908
O'Domar is quite cool.

2513
01:44:04,909 --> 01:44:07,648
The most unexpected combination, O'Domar and JOONIE.

2514
01:44:07,649 --> 01:44:10,220
I wondered how they would blend, but they were amazing.

2515
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:11,319
It was so cool.

2516
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,850
It was a special performance with their unique colors.

2517
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,788
It was a perfect rendition of the Y2K sound.

2518
01:44:17,789 --> 01:44:20,430
It felt like a song people played on the social media back then.

2519
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:22,430
It felt like I went back in time.

2520
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:25,029
They really captured the essence of that era.

2521
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:28,198
The song was nostalgic.

2522
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:30,368
O'Domar was at his best today.

2523
01:44:30,369 --> 01:44:33,568
Out of all his performances on RAP: PUBLIC, it was the best.

2524
01:44:33,569 --> 01:44:37,709
Things really haven't worked out for him on the show so far.

2525
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:40,680
He was very upset about it.

2526
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:42,478
It was great to see today's performance...

2527
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:43,720
help him overcome his frustration.

2528
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,988
His heavy rap balanced out the song throughout the performance.

2529
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,749
I especially liked the lyrics.

2530
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,719
Their performance was executed flawlessly.

2531
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,028
JOONIE finished the song by herself at the end.

2532
01:44:54,029 --> 01:44:56,059
I really liked that part.

2533
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:00,398
I liked how her innocent charm was beautifully expressed...

2534
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:02,728
in that part.

2535
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:04,939
- They did so well. - They did a good job.

2536
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:06,569
It was cool.

2537
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:09,408
When O'Domar spat the first verse,

2538
01:45:09,409 --> 01:45:12,238
and when JOONIE spat the 1st verse after coming up on stage at 1st,

2539
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,310
I knew they would make it.

2540
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:17,948
When JOONIE rapped on stage,

2541
01:45:17,949 --> 01:45:20,318
I could see she had a lot of experience as a K-pop idol.

2542
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:24,060
She was so into it. It touched my heart.

2543
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:27,159
We will now begin the vote.

2544
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,359
Please press it.

2545
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,930
Save us just once.

2546
01:45:35,069 --> 01:45:37,069
Nice. Keep begging.

2547
01:45:39,539 --> 01:45:42,340
- Six, five, four, - Six, five, four,

2548
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:45,180
- three, two, one. - three, two, one.

2549
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:47,479
(The 1st voting for O'Domar and JOONIE ends.)

2550
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:50,978
The first voting is closed.

2551
01:45:50,979 --> 01:45:52,779
Good job.

2552
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:57,419
I was wondering what O'Domar and JOONIE would show.

2553
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,358
They blended their individual strengths well...

2554
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:01,559
and showcased them.

2555
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,499
It was a nice song to listen to.

2556
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,728
And I could clearly see it.

2557
01:46:04,729 --> 01:46:08,569
Since she is an idol singer as well,

2558
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,970
her eye contact with the camera was clearly different.

2559
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:14,970
I feel I showed my competence through this performance.

2560
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:17,679
To myself,

2561
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,880
I'd like to give a compliment, "You did a good job."

2562
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,909
The crew that will give the last performance of this round...

2563
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:28,520
is JTONG, KHAN, Nosun of Block Two!

2564
01:46:29,689 --> 01:46:32,019
In addition to the powerful performance three of them prepared,

2565
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:35,489
a featuring artist that will surprise you will appear.

2566
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:39,499
When we discussed the scenario we could definitely win,

2567
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,599
we talked a lot about the combination of old and new.

2568
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,300
Our images go well together in the first place.

2569
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:46,539
We are just sophisticated beasts.

2570
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:48,569
We're beasts with self-control.

2571
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:51,809
It seems that people with the same thinking gathered.

2572
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:53,038
- Right. - You're right.

2573
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:55,409
Since each of us has things we want to do,

2574
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:56,949
we organized a crew...

2575
01:46:57,279 --> 01:46:59,278
consisting of me, Nosun, and JTONG.

2576
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:00,688
(The 1st crew of Block 2 consists of JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun.)

2577
01:47:00,689 --> 01:47:04,788
It was the only song that mentioned Block Two,

2578
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:06,220
and I loved it.

2579
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:08,960
The song seemed to express...

2580
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:12,229
our teamwork and identity.

2581
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:14,600
We will move on to the last stage with passion.

2582
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:18,340
The overall theme was the blazing emotions.

2583
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,140
After all, we overcame difficulties while being this passionate.

2584
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:22,769
We broke through being on fire.

2585
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,438
My heart is still aflame.

2586
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:28,279
I want to take out the flame to the world.

2587
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:30,619
KHAN, Nosun, and JTONG.

2588
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,219
Those three will make an appearance.

2589
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:34,250
I will be watching it.

2590
01:47:34,989 --> 01:47:36,319
They will give a very intense performance.

2591
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:39,488
Block Two, by the look of it...

2592
01:47:39,489 --> 01:47:42,429
JTONG, Nosun, and KHAN...

2593
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:44,028
are all incredible rappers,

2594
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:45,060
so I cannot but keep them in check.

2595
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,939
The stage is on fire.

2596
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,510
(The performance begins with JTONG's intense rap.)

2597
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:58,840
(Other block crews watch Block 2's rehearsal carefully.)

2598
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:01,880
The payment soars

2599
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:03,250
Paycheck

2600
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:06,020
- We are peddlers - They're good.

2601
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:10,719
Goodness.

2602
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:13,989
(Nosun's rap fills the stage after JTONG's performance.)

2603
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:20,169
(It's the first time to reveal...)

2604
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:25,500
(Block 2 crew's featuring artist.)

2605
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:28,069
It's him.

2606
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:33,010
(Block 2 crew's intense featuring increases tension for other crews.)

2607
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:35,779
The featuring artist does the hook part.

2608
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:37,479
(Exclaiming)

2609
01:48:39,649 --> 01:48:42,019
Sizzle, sizzle, blazing No, I shouldn't!

2610
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:43,988
Sizzle, sizzle, blazing

2611
01:48:43,989 --> 01:48:47,688
- Snatch the performance - No, I shouldn't!

2612
01:48:47,689 --> 01:48:48,789
Block Two!

2613
01:48:48,829 --> 01:48:50,029
No!

2614
01:48:51,329 --> 01:48:53,770
I could recognize who did the featuring from the voice.

2615
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:56,698
I could tell.

2616
01:48:56,699 --> 01:48:58,970
The special guest for the three of us...

2617
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,640
is ZICO.

2618
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,739
I've known ZICO for a long time.

2619
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,710
I started a crew called Buckwilds in the past.

2620
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:09,010
It's been over ten years.

2621
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:11,778
We've known each other since I was in my early 20s.

2622
01:49:11,779 --> 01:49:14,788
The relationship made this performance possible.

2623
01:49:14,789 --> 01:49:18,259
Since I was young, I sang a lot...

2624
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:21,358
of the songs JTONG and he collaborated.

2625
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:24,199
I sang those songs at home and in karaoke.

2626
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:27,100
Our relationship started since then.

2627
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,569
I did a featuring for ZICO's song too.

2628
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:33,769
(JTONG featured in my song "Predator." We got close.)

2629
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:35,839
(I heard JTONG didn't like me being a rapper and an idol singer.)

2630
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,908
(I was in his crew for 3 years, and now we're on good terms.)

2631
01:49:37,909 --> 01:49:40,809
(My rival is somewhere else Nothing in the broadcasting station)

2632
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:43,949
(JTONG who was my hater recruited me to Buckwilds)

2633
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:46,988
It's our first time being on the same stage...

2634
01:49:46,989 --> 01:49:50,590
since we did a crew performance in the past.

2635
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,489
I guess it's been about ten years.

2636
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:56,430
I sang their songs when I was a kid,

2637
01:49:56,659 --> 01:49:59,759
and now I perform together with those singers.

2638
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,430
I feel so happy now.

2639
01:50:01,729 --> 01:50:03,869
Would doing this look more stylish, or shall I stay here?

2640
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:06,398
(ZICO proactively gives advice to Block 2.)

2641
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:07,538
Do it like this.

2642
01:50:07,539 --> 01:50:09,839
- The slide... - This one opens.

2643
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,938
Does the door open?

2644
01:50:10,939 --> 01:50:13,108
How does JTONG appear? Is he using a lift?

2645
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:14,179
I use a lift.

2646
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,908
The lift will move now.

2647
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:17,148
(The camera rehearsal begins in earnest.)

2648
01:50:17,149 --> 01:50:18,149
Darn.

2649
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:23,788
(A lift goes down for the opening appearance.)

2650
01:50:23,789 --> 01:50:24,890
Oh, yes.

2651
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,658
Since you're tall...

2652
01:50:26,659 --> 01:50:28,629
If you kneel and then stand up,

2653
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:30,029
it will make a bigger impact.

2654
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:31,199
If I kneel?

2655
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,329
Since ZICO has a lot of experience in performing on the stage,

2656
01:50:34,369 --> 01:50:38,669
he gave detailed advice on the flow on the stage.

2657
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:40,069
I felt I could rely on him.

2658
01:50:40,739 --> 01:50:42,408
Don't we need to mark it or something?

2659
01:50:42,409 --> 01:50:44,609
We can do this. The center is here.

2660
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,309
You see the blocks here.

2661
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:48,010
Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4.

2662
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:50,648
Gosh. Thank you.

2663
01:50:50,649 --> 01:50:52,318
(ZICO pays attention to JTONG for a joint performance.)

2664
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:54,219
- This is fun. - It is fun.

2665
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,489
It's going to be fun!

2666
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:59,089
It felt very special.

2667
01:50:59,090 --> 01:51:00,859
It felt like we went back to the past.

2668
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:03,800
I felt ZICO and I met again...

2669
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:06,259
to give a nice performance.

2670
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:08,469
I came all the way from New York,

2671
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:10,239
and I'll show you why I am here.

2672
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:12,438
Since we're on the stage we dearly wanted,

2673
01:51:12,439 --> 01:51:14,210
let's make a blazing victory and move on to the finals.

2674
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:16,139
We'll burn it up...

2675
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,380
and move on to the finals.

2676
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:23,550
Let's see the performance of JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun of Block Two.

2677
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:27,250
Let's go!

2678
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:29,648
The shouting sounds different already.

2679
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:30,859
- Oh, my goodness. - Come on!

2680
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:32,390
Gosh.

2681
01:51:32,689 --> 01:51:34,488
- Here they are. - I'm excited.

2682
01:51:34,489 --> 01:51:35,489
It's JTONG, Nosun, and KHAN.

2683
01:51:35,729 --> 01:51:37,000
Their performance worries me.

2684
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:38,329
I'm curious about how they're going to do it.

2685
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:42,500
(The third performance by JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun)

2686
01:51:44,369 --> 01:51:45,939
- Here we go. - It starts now.

2687
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:47,640
I bet it will be awesome.

2688
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:49,068
- I'm excited. - Yes.

2689
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:51,140
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2690
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:57,319
Please. Let's go.

2691
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:10,430
("Sizzle Sizzle" by JTONG, Nosun, KHAN, featuring ZICO)

2692
01:52:11,699 --> 01:52:14,270
Block Two, We coming through, Bad girls love us

2693
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:17,069
Lights flashing, We slay the performance in turn

2694
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:19,640
We burn black smoke like a beam of flame

2695
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,470
My income soars, I need more commas

2696
01:52:22,869 --> 01:52:24,909
Under the ground, Now I'm everywhere

2697
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:27,310
Through this song I record a page of my passionate life

2698
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:29,050
- Darn it, It burns like a flame - I'm getting goosebumps.

2699
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:32,680
Smoking gas

2700
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:35,250
One hundred dash

2701
01:52:35,449 --> 01:52:37,789
One hundred dash

2702
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:41,158
Don't look back and keep going, Go straight home

2703
01:52:41,159 --> 01:52:43,329
We living through the past, A new wall is coming

2704
01:52:43,859 --> 01:52:46,000
Just do your best to death

2705
01:52:46,829 --> 01:52:48,828
You chew over what I said, all through the night

2706
01:52:48,829 --> 01:52:51,738
I'll die as a rapper and leave this message

2707
01:52:51,739 --> 01:52:54,139
Rather than living as a fake, I'd like to have a deathmatch

2708
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:56,669
- He fills the stage all by himself. - The punks to run to the objective

2709
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:59,578
- We Block Two, We coming through - I feel proud of them.

2710
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:02,180
Lights flashing, We slay the performance in turn

2711
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:04,779
We burn black smoke like a beam of flame

2712
01:53:05,079 --> 01:53:08,289
My income soars, I need more commas

2713
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,959
That's how it goes, Be a heck of hectic

2714
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,358
They don't know the thing that we've been through

2715
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:14,759
- Man, they won't ever get it - Ever get it

2716
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,328
I became a red devil, Even though I bleed, I just let it

2717
01:53:17,329 --> 01:53:20,269
I will see it again, The brothers in the sky said it

2718
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:22,528
You don't know pain, You listen but you don't have no aim

2719
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:23,669
Got to see through the beam, You haven't seen this flame

2720
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:25,698
On the path we've been, No sun, All rain, Like who

2721
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:27,839
Could be like us, Smarten up like this

2722
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,578
I grew up in a fire, But there's new ice in my throat

2723
01:53:30,579 --> 01:53:33,238
The spirit remains although the bone in my body is broken

2724
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:35,979
Sincerely mess them all, I'm here to make pay so

2725
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:38,148
Three, six, five, I grind without a break

2726
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:39,778
I'm the one who chose this life

2727
01:53:39,779 --> 01:53:41,250
- He's awesome. - I have to shine

2728
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:44,488
The burnt smell is all over somewhere

2729
01:53:44,489 --> 01:53:47,288
Through the misty smoke I move forward

2730
01:53:47,289 --> 01:53:49,259
Through half-closed eyes, I look for prey

2731
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,630
Catch them, Kill them, Cook it

2732
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,828
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2733
01:53:54,829 --> 01:53:57,499
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2734
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,499
We don't care, We don't give a thing

2735
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:02,938
Come from a concrete jungle, Devour prey like a beast

2736
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:05,509
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2737
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:08,249
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2738
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,219
We don't care, We don't give a thing

2739
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,380
All going to the fiery pit, Welcome to the underworld

2740
01:54:14,189 --> 01:54:15,589
I hit the bottom and came back

2741
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:16,988
Through a violent storm

2742
01:54:16,989 --> 01:54:19,488
I'm riding on behalf of the colleagues who left before me

2743
01:54:19,489 --> 01:54:21,288
You've seen my style

2744
01:54:21,289 --> 01:54:24,100
I keep my position, Still Block Two, We sliding

2745
01:54:24,859 --> 01:54:26,228
I have nothing to lose anyway, Even if I go back

2746
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:29,398
Knowing how to hide pain we keep going after a miracle

2747
01:54:29,399 --> 01:54:31,799
Like a wildfire with a blast of wind I have no fears

2748
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,209
I'm not a Genie but moving smart, Keep raising stakes

2749
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:37,078
I know it's digital here, But please be original

2750
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:39,908
I only spit out what I see, hear, and feel, Forget your awareness

2751
01:54:39,909 --> 01:54:42,549
I walked in the dark but I saw the light in it

2752
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:45,279
I keep piling up one by one like 420

2753
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,618
The wind of embers blows, I catch the chance Hold up this flag

2754
01:54:48,619 --> 01:54:51,219
The burden on my shoulders felt heavy but I never kneel

2755
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:53,488
There's no way other than dashing forward

2756
01:54:53,489 --> 01:54:56,430
Feel like I'm Ghost Rider, We go after the next opponent

2757
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,130
The burnt smell is all over somewhere

2758
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:01,569
Through the misty smoke I move forward

2759
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:03,938
Through half-closed eyes I look for prey

2760
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:06,969
Catch them, Kill them, Cook it

2761
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:09,509
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2762
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:12,179
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2763
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:14,148
We don't care, We don't give a thing

2764
01:55:14,149 --> 01:55:17,578
Come from a concrete jungle, Devour prey like a beast

2765
01:55:17,579 --> 01:55:20,219
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2766
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:22,919
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2767
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,919
- They'll get all the votes. - We don't give a thing.

2768
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:28,060
All going to the fiery pit, Welcome to the underworld

2769
01:55:28,229 --> 01:55:30,858
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2770
01:55:30,859 --> 01:55:33,528
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2771
01:55:33,529 --> 01:55:35,568
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2772
01:55:35,569 --> 01:55:37,840
This is insane. Look at the audience's atmosphere.

2773
01:55:38,869 --> 01:55:41,568
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2774
01:55:41,569 --> 01:55:44,210
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2775
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:46,009
The audience is showing a great response.

2776
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:49,310
All going to the fiery pit, Welcome to the underworld

2777
01:55:49,409 --> 01:55:51,849
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2778
01:55:51,850 --> 01:55:53,179
Sizzle, sizzle, yes

2779
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:54,818
- Blazing, yes - One more time!

2780
01:55:54,819 --> 01:55:56,948
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2781
01:55:56,949 --> 01:56:00,528
Come from a concrete jungle, Devour prey like a beast

2782
01:56:00,529 --> 01:56:03,390
Woof, Block Two!

2783
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:09,770
Make some noise!

2784
01:56:09,899 --> 01:56:11,898
("Sizzle Sizzle" by JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun featuring ZICO...)

2785
01:56:11,899 --> 01:56:14,239
(is available on all music platforms.)

2786
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:25,118
That was seriously awesome.

2787
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:27,949
- It was so cool. - This is unfair.

2788
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:31,590
Is this combination real?

2789
01:56:31,789 --> 01:56:33,688
- Gosh. - Darn.

2790
01:56:33,689 --> 01:56:36,228
- It was so good. - Gosh.

2791
01:56:36,229 --> 01:56:37,329
This is insane.

2792
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:41,969
That was awesome!

2793
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:44,199
That was crazy. Come on!

2794
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:48,009
- We won! - We won!

2795
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:49,669
I think we really won.

2796
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:51,778
- Such intense response. - It was so cool.

2797
01:56:51,779 --> 01:56:53,880
I'm so proud that they're in our team.

2798
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:56,648
There was one jaw-dropping performance, "Sizzle Sizzle."

2799
01:56:56,649 --> 01:56:58,879
It was true hip-hop.

2800
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,318
It truly showed a maximum of masculinity.

2801
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:04,419
Of all the performances ever given on survival shows,

2802
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,819
it was the top performance to me.

2803
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:08,890
Who likes to hoot?

2804
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:12,460
- Block Two. - Yes.

2805
01:57:14,029 --> 01:57:15,600
Buckwilds, baby!

2806
01:57:16,699 --> 01:57:18,738
But to me, only JTONG was visible.

2807
01:57:18,739 --> 01:57:21,038
JTONG opened the performance...

2808
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:24,339
- just like this. - It made me speechless.

2809
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:27,278
JTONG is just awesome as a human being. I envy him.

2810
01:57:27,279 --> 01:57:30,149
When JTONG appeared on the stage and started rapping,

2811
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:33,419
he had amazing charisma, and it overwhelmed me.

2812
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:35,488
Gosh, Nosun. Goodness.

2813
01:57:35,489 --> 01:57:37,589
His eyes, how he uttered the rap,

2814
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:40,158
and acting from his body, which wasn't artificial.

2815
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:41,759
Nosun was really awesome like crazy.

2816
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,100
And KHAN wasn't shaken at all.

2817
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,430
He's become a total veteran.

2818
01:57:47,699 --> 01:57:51,470
The performance was so intense and sizzling.

2819
01:57:51,939 --> 01:57:53,238
I thought they were incredible.

2820
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:55,509
They showed insane stage presence.

2821
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:59,679
That performance deserves praise and applause.

2822
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,050
I expected that we could take first place easily.

2823
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:05,019
The voting begins.

2824
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:06,649
(The 1st voting for JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun of Block 2 begins.)

2825
01:58:09,649 --> 01:58:11,260
I trust your ears.

2826
01:58:14,789 --> 01:58:16,559
- JTONG! - JTONG!

2827
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,659
- JTONG is awesome! - JTONG is awesome!

2828
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:21,999
You're awesome!

2829
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,300
I told you we needed to recruit him.

2830
01:58:24,569 --> 01:58:27,069
- Now you're saying that? - Hash Swan is sitting next to you.

2831
01:58:28,609 --> 01:58:30,538
- I quit. - Come on.

2832
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:32,279
(I was kidding.)

2833
01:58:32,439 --> 01:58:35,380
Three, two, one.

2834
01:58:35,579 --> 01:58:38,420
(The 1st voting for JTONG, KHAN, and Nosun is over.)

2835
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,948
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2836
01:58:41,949 --> 01:58:45,358
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2837
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:48,629
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2838
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:51,959
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2839
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:55,328
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2840
01:58:55,329 --> 01:58:57,130
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2841
01:58:58,069 --> 01:59:00,099
- Thank you! - Thank you.

2842
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:01,170
Yes!

2843
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:02,568
You're awesome!

2844
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:04,579
- The mood changed. - It changed.

2845
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:09,350
- But we never know. - We don't know yet.

2846
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:10,879
You need to put the cards on the table.

2847
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,319
- We need to see it. - That's right.

2848
01:59:14,689 --> 01:59:16,488
I hold Block Two in check.

2849
01:59:16,489 --> 01:59:19,889
They kept the tension from the beginning to the end.

2850
01:59:19,890 --> 01:59:22,489
Since they showed a powerful performance,

2851
01:59:22,659 --> 01:59:25,728
it overlapped with our performance's vibe,

2852
01:59:25,729 --> 01:59:28,799
and that made me hold them in check a bit.

2853
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,938
But we don't care. We're rather glad.

2854
01:59:30,939 --> 01:59:34,009
We thought we'd express good energy.

2855
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:36,569
To rank the performances very honestly,

2856
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:40,479
we're pretty much tied, but we'll take the top.

2857
01:59:40,579 --> 01:59:44,078
Members with a lot of experience on the shows led the performance...

2858
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:45,079
to look nice,

2859
01:59:46,619 --> 01:59:49,148
so I feel proud.

2860
01:59:49,149 --> 01:59:52,919
JTONG started the performance so nicely,

2861
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:55,858
so it motivated me a lot to do my best.

2862
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:58,398
The audience showed such great response to the performance.

2863
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:00,568
I think we'll take the top spot.

2864
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:03,270
This round of Crew Battle is over, everyone.

2865
02:00:04,939 --> 02:00:06,398
- Well done. - O'Domar and JOONIE did a good job.

2866
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:07,609
They did what they could do.

2867
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,408
Now, we'll have the second voting.

2868
02:00:10,409 --> 02:00:13,140
We'll bring all three crews on the stage.

2869
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:18,478
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2870
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:20,448
- Block 2! - Block 2!

2871
02:00:20,449 --> 02:00:23,249
They're awesome. Our crew members are devils,

2872
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:25,189
but JOONIE and O'Domar behind them are like fairies.

2873
02:00:25,859 --> 02:00:27,589
BOWWOW, we don't care

2874
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:30,959
- BOWWOW, we don't care - BOWWOW, we don't care

2875
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,328
Block Six, AKA, That's my, AKA

2876
02:00:34,329 --> 02:00:37,639
- Block Six, AKA, That's my, AKA - Block Six, AKA, That's my, AKA

2877
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:38,699
Thank you.

2878
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:43,140
The second voting begins.

2879
02:00:43,539 --> 02:00:46,038
(The 2nd voting for Crew Battle begins.)

2880
02:00:46,039 --> 02:00:47,210
Block Six!

2881
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:49,310
Block Three!

2882
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:50,849
Block Three!

2883
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:52,479
- DOMMIU! - You look nice!

2884
02:00:52,649 --> 02:00:55,188
Block Two!

2885
02:00:55,189 --> 02:00:57,590
- JTONG! - JTONG!

2886
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:01,930
Don't cry.

2887
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:03,929
Don't cry.

2888
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:07,398
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

2889
02:01:07,399 --> 02:01:08,970
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

2890
02:01:13,369 --> 02:01:19,108
- Five, four, three, two, one. - Five, four, three, two, one.

2891
02:01:19,109 --> 02:01:20,880
(The 2nd voting for the Padi Round is over.)

2892
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:22,909
Everyone went through a lot.

2893
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:24,279
Thank you for your work.

2894
02:01:24,979 --> 02:01:26,648
Gosh, JOONIE.

2895
02:01:26,649 --> 02:01:27,649
They did a great job.

2896
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:31,318
The final result will be revealed soon.

2897
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:32,359
Thank you for your hard work.

2898
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:37,698
(What will be the result of the vote?)

2899
02:01:37,699 --> 02:01:38,898
It was so intense.

2900
02:01:38,899 --> 02:01:41,129
Sizzle, sizzle, yes, blazing

2901
02:01:41,130 --> 02:01:44,438
We could show the performance while maintaining the theme.

2902
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:46,199
It feels very refreshing.

2903
02:01:46,569 --> 02:01:50,210
I feel I showed who I was through this performance.

2904
02:01:51,979 --> 02:01:53,909
So I was very satisfied.

2905
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:57,880
When everyone sang "BOWWOW" together,

2906
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:00,850
the cheer from the audience made me so happy.

2907
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:05,289
I thought we could expect a good outcome.

2908
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:11,630
As a result of the first voting,

2909
02:02:12,130 --> 02:02:17,029
the block that took the top spot in each round will be revealed.

2910
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:22,510
The three blocks' crews that performed in the Padi Round,

2911
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:25,409
please come to the center of the stage.

2912
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:27,979
It's neck and neck.

2913
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:30,078
I just want one more vote.

2914
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:31,578
I want even one more vote.

2915
02:02:31,579 --> 02:02:32,750
Woof!

2916
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:36,850
(You got it, JOONIE!)

2917
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:44,528
As a result of the first voting of the Padi Round,

2918
02:02:44,529 --> 02:02:47,260
the block that won first place will be revealed.

2919
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,169
(The result of the 1st voting, Padi Round)

2920
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:50,739
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2921
02:02:51,399 --> 02:02:52,939
It makes me nervous again.

2922
02:02:53,069 --> 02:02:54,340
I feel nervous.

2923
02:02:54,939 --> 02:02:56,039
My heart is going to burst.

2924
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:57,239
Here we go.

2925
02:02:57,609 --> 02:02:59,108
(The result of the 1st voting, Padi Round)

2926
02:02:59,109 --> 02:03:02,578
As a result of the first voting of the Padi Round,

2927
02:03:02,579 --> 02:03:04,319
Of course, I want to win.

2928
02:03:04,979 --> 02:03:06,850
The block that won first place...

2929
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:10,419
We can't go home. Let's advance to the next stage.

2930
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,960
Gosh.

2931
02:03:12,989 --> 02:03:15,359
Block Two will move on to the finals.

2932
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:20,969
It makes me nervous.

2933
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:21,970
Which one will it be?

2934
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:25,299
(Block 2)

2935
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,470
It's Block Two.

2936
02:03:26,939 --> 02:03:30,710
(Block 2 wins 1st place in the 1st voting of Padi Round.)

2937
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:33,039
Yes!

2938
02:03:36,649 --> 02:03:38,578
They did a good job. They were really awesome.

2939
02:03:38,579 --> 02:03:41,688
First of all, everyone worked hard.

2940
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:45,188
I was glad to create a performance without regret.

2941
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:47,560
From now on, I will do my best...

2942
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:50,960
to show even better performances.

2943
02:03:54,199 --> 02:03:58,340
Let's win first place, and go to the finals with a smile, everyone.

2944
02:03:58,569 --> 02:03:59,569
Block Two, we can do it.

2945
02:04:00,069 --> 02:04:03,969
(The last match before the finals, Crew Battle)

2946
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:05,238
(Block 3 versus Block 6 versus Block 2)

2947
02:04:05,239 --> 02:04:06,409
(We will turn the tables.)

2948
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:09,009
(To advance to the finals, )

2949
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:13,119
(a fierce competition unfolds.)

2950
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:14,288
Gosh.

2951
02:04:14,289 --> 02:04:15,589
They're so good.

2952
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:17,049
I thought it was worth a try.

2953
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:18,920
Darn it, how can I forget that?

2954
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:24,800
(Block 2 counterattacks to beat Block 3 and Block 6.)

2955
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,629
(It was 100 out of 100.)

2956
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:30,300
(I thought I could aim to take 1st place.)

2957
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:33,569
(Big matches continue.)

2958
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:37,108
(Opening up the big match...)

2959
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:41,210
(are Loopy, OSUN, and JP of Block 2.)

2960
02:04:42,449 --> 02:04:47,220
(Mckdaddy, Hash Swan, and Jo Gwang Il of Block 6 oppose them.)

2961
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:49,090
(They did everything they could.)

2962
02:04:49,091 --> 02:04:51,090
(It's going to be a serious showdown against us.)

2963
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:54,828
(HAON, Yang Kyle, and James An of Block 3 have overwhelming charisma.)

2964
02:04:54,829 --> 02:04:57,189
(Has anyone not raised their hand yet?)

2965
02:05:00,729 --> 02:05:04,299
(The block to continue their journey on RAP: PUBLIC is revealed.)

2966
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:06,398
(I want to win 1st place at least once.)

2967
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:08,739
(I've honed my skill so far for this.)

2968
02:05:10,369 --> 02:05:13,009
The block to advance to the Final Block Match...

2969
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:14,038
(It's this block.)

2970
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:16,009
(I guess I expected a lot more than I thought.)

2971
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:18,549
(I told you. This never goes as we want it to.)

2972
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:21,949
(It might be different from what we think.)
