00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,988
(RAP: PUBLIC)

2
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,559
Everyone is really cool.

3
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,899
- Let's go. - Everyone is really cool.

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,230
- Insanely cool. - Let's go.

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,369
You guys are cool.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,000
Infinite Cypher isn't easy.

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,209
My goodness.

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,709
Relax and give a cool performance.

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,478
- You're already cool. - Just be cool.

10
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,538
- You're already cool. - Just be cool.

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,750
- Have fun and relax just like now. - That's right.

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,149
Boi B, do you want water?

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,578
- Do you want water? - It's okay. I have water here.

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,749
- Is it okay? - It's okay.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,719
- Let's go. - I'll try to hold out.

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,520
You're so cool.

17
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,359
- You're cool. - Let's go.

18
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,158
- Chaboom. - Yes?

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,228
- Have a drink. - Thank you.

20
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:58,699
- Let's go. - Let's go.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
Well done.

22
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:02,070
- Chaboom, let's go. - Yes. Let's go.

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,968
- How many verses do you have? - I don't know.

24
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,468
- I don't know. I'm out of ammo. - What was that?

25
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,439
JP, how many verses remain?

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,109
Ten.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,749
- Thank goodness JP is the leader. - Seriously.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,318
Everyone is so cool.

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,049
Real respect to everyone.

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,289
What am I doing here?

31
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,289
- I need to work really hard. - Seriously.

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,688
This is motivating me.

33
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,760
Ready.

34
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,719
Good luck.

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,958
Start.

36
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,169
(Round 3 of Infinite Cypher starts.)

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,329
Gosh, this beat is insanely difficult.

38
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,439
I think HAON will do well.

39
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,069
He'll rip up the stage.

40
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,109
There's no reason for Loopy to go first.

41
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,408
- May I go? - No!

42
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,449
Do what you want.

43
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,878
- Oh, no! - Yes!

44
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,348
Check.

45
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,849
(The 1st rapper of Round 3, Block 2's leader, Loopy)

46
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,548
I shine with ice in my throat

47
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,249
I take my steps with them woes

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,559
Gotta check it like Thugger

49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,389
We're just popping and we're stoned

50
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,458
Dripping, dripping, out all day, Here, you're such a jerk

51
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,158
Kids under the stage are in the mosh pit

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,929
- They want me to die early, yes - He's good.

53
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,298
I'm breathing fine, now I'm taking

54
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,799
My medicine every day, yes

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,799
I'm on your girl's lock screen, but you don't know it, yes

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,399
Rain over the head

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,038
Every night, come, yes

58
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,369
That's right, I'm the culprit, yes

59
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,079
Dress smart and come on out, yes

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,679
Raincoat and boots right now

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,249
Let's go because this is our stuff, yes

62
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,749
Everyone's clothes are getting wet, something is falling

63
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,249
It's already faint, what do you think, yes

64
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,418
Fendi on my body

65
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,388
- It looks so good on me, yes - His target is Chaboom.

66
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,918
You lack style, I'm not your older brother

67
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,989
I'm grateful, really

68
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,658
Louis, she's my body bag

69
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,188
I put it on haphazardly

70
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,258
Get it? Puss hater

71
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,258
Cut you off, oh, yes I made it twice as hard

72
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,799
Goyard belt, now, I'm a cop, Prada

73
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,560
Kid, wait a minute, my jeans

74
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,430
My jeans

75
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,029
(Loopy chooses Kaogaii.)

76
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,138
- Yes. - Yes.

77
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,198
Kaogaii, let's go.

78
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,008
- Come on. - Lil

79
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,270
Lil

80
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,179
Lil Kaogaii traveled the Dolpak Pass back and forth

81
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,709
And made deliveries all day long in a school uniform

82
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,448
Oh, my gosh, with the hourly wage of five dollars

83
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,809
He ripped off the school uniform and got the Nuptse Jacket

84
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,279
That punk now gets a motorcycle sponsored

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,818
That punk now gets a clothing commercial deal

86
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,079
Due to that past, the present is so sweet

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,749
I won't accept wedding invitations from those who looked down on me

88
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,848
Okay, what should I tell you now?

89
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,218
We fought after staring at the menu for ten minutes

90
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,359
"Why don't you have money?"

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,888
Jerk who called me a beggar, look how successful I became

92
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,388
Where are you now? Shall I spare you some time today?

93
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,489
- Let's go. - You must be jealous now

94
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,658
- But I don't care - Kaogaii, you're cool.

95
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,429
I bought a new apartment with the brain you looked down on

96
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,999
But I can't father your children

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,128
Let's go to Hongdae Station

98
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,499
Amateurs who ran away upon seeing

99
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,339
Five audience members must be carrying bricks now

100
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,839
I ripped off the stage then and earned money

101
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,709
- Unbelievable. - What get-together?

102
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,439
Worthless punks who talk behind my back

103
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,050
Okay, let's go.

104
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,348
(Kaogaii chooses Loopy.)

105
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,249
- Let's go. - Kaogaii is so cool.

106
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,689
- Let's go. - I'll take you on.

107
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,318
You ate twice as much, but didn't grow any taller

108
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,489
Even when a big fight broke out

109
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,559
You laughed and didn't make me your enemy

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,228
When I took the stage for the first time

111
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,658
You wanted to see how well I'd do

112
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,158
But your girlfriend took her eyes off the phone

113
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,968
And dropped her jaw

114
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,198
My mouth never runs dry

115
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,228
Ha Ru's dad taught me

116
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,668
About the ears, not the eyes, nose, and mouth

117
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:52,999
Deaf or mute

118
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,908
I only beat up the fake ones, I have 108 wins and 0 losses

119
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,209
Half of this game is rotten

120
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,878
- I'm getting a live performance. - You aren't the one, so it's hard

121
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,508
I'm groovy, but you can't hear it

122
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,149
I work hard day and night

123
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,709
I'm busy picking up the jobs

124
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,918
I'm ready 365 days a year My military power is 64 times yours

125
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,089
We play in different waters

126
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,948
The wind blows coolly as if I'm on vacation

127
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,460
Write it, my address is in LA

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,258
- Let's go. - Just you wait.

129
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,959
Just you wait.

130
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,629
I'll drag you out no matter what it takes.

131
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,799
Okay. Let's go.

132
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,169
- Let's go. - Let's go.

133
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,299
- Check. - Let's go.

134
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,638
"I have no money, but I have style"

135
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,008
I stand here after shouting that hundreds of times

136
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,708
So many part-time jobs in the infernal Namyangju

137
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,609
My feet were an app before smartphones came along

138
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,778
My city bag got crushed under Chairman

139
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,338
The fishy smell that permeates when you cut off the fish head

140
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,179
The stage I dreamed of when I was behind

141
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,749
On my insurance fee and rent is now a reality

142
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,719
Instead of living like the others, I'll show off my empty life

143
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,789
Even if my life is halved

144
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,849
I won't act out unless the style suits my standards

145
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,159
Sure, my mother cleans a building

146
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,989
My father who has cancer is still a day laborer

147
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,229
If I look down, nothing will change

148
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,629
I keep my chin up and preserve my style

149
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,198
- Yes. - He's cool.

150
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,799
Let's get it.

151
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,799
And preserve my style

152
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
(Kaogaii chooses Loopy.)

153
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,508
- You're a legend. - Let's get it.

154
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,240
- Let's take it to the end. - Let's get it.

155
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,809
- Bring it on. - Okay.

156
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,810
I'll choose you again. Bring it on.

157
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,949
One, two, one.

158
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,179
I had to come back I'm always bad at pretending

159
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,878
She pulled me down, go lay low

160
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,318
Listen to the love song as you drink

161
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,518
And I told you, it's a pain

162
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,458
Fake pictures and everything I send them alone

163
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,059
- I carried the rocks - This is legendary.

164
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,559
And they took me to the top

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,458
I... I don't know.

166
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,628
(I don't know.)

167
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,829
I'm sorry, my block.

168
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:29,069
I'm sorry, my block.

169
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,939
- Yes! - You won!

170
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,639
Yes!

171
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,239
You did it!

172
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,708
- That was insane. - Well done, Kaogaii.

173
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,679
Gosh, Kaogaii is a game changer.

174
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,849
I can't believe he won this round.

175
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,749
Kaogaii did so well.

176
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,818
He's a determined Korean.

177
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,188
- A determined Korean dad. - Yes.

178
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,989
He pulled Loopy down. My goodness.

179
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,660
It was like a last-minute goal.

180
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,259
It was like an MMA fight.

181
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,699
It was like Pacquiao versus Mayweather.

182
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,099
It was American hip-hop versus Gyeonggi Province hip-hop.

183
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,999
Watching them made my blood boil. My heart was about to burst.

184
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,769
They did so well. They were insane.

185
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,209
It was an honor to be in that scene.

186
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,609
Seriously, we picked the best leader.

187
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,810
My dopamine level reached its max.

188
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,078
I could hear other blocks' cheers.

189
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,448
"They're rooting for me."

190
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,379
"They're the people who didn't come to me."

191
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,719
"I must be doing well."

192
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,378
Kaogaii created a legendary moment.

193
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,649
It was the rediscovery of Kaogaii. My goodness.

194
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,990
It was so cool.

195
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,759
Loopy was amazing.

196
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,990
It's okay.

197
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,898
- You were really cool. - You were really cool.

198
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,199
You were so cool.

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,198
To be honest,

200
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,739
Round Three could've been loose...

201
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,239
without Loopy's provocation.

202
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,439
He gave the round a cool start.

203
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,708
- Bravo. - It was insane.

204
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,179
- Yes. - My goodness.

205
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,949
The leader of Block Two, Loopy, is eliminated.

206
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,688
- Yes. - My goodness.

207
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,949
(Round 3 of Infinite Cypher ends.)

208
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,290
- My goodness. - Seriously.

209
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,689
- You did really well. - Yes.

210
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,230
- You did really well. - Loopy, well done.

211
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,100
Loopy was incredible.

212
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Hip-hop...

213
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:09,730
needs to be cool.

214
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,499
What kind of coolness I can give on the stage...

215
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,540
is an important part of doing my job.

216
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,179
I thought I was the coolest.

217
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,410
It was very nice.

218
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,379
I had that feeling for the first time in a while.

219
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,979
It was the best scene.

220
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
It was insane. I'm getting a dopamine rush.

221
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,449
- The leaders are so scary. - Seriously.

222
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,359
- All of them are monsters. - I know.

223
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,758
Thank goodness I didn't become the leader.

224
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,088
That would've been disastrous.

225
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,929
How does everyone have so many verses?

226
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,060
They keep coming out.

227
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,568
I kept having the urge to waste my verses...

228
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,470
because I had so many to spare.

229
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,669
The need to have multiple verses for the same BPM is intense.

230
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,638
Let's say we go back and forth.

231
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,008
- Yes. - It'll put so much pressure on me.

232
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,079
Start.

233
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,148
- Let's go, HAON. - Let's go!

234
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,008
Boi B, let's go!

235
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,019
- Good luck. - Let's go.

236
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
They're ruined.

237
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,589
Gosh, what on earth?

238
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,889
JP, don't go first.

239
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,660
Which rapper will start?

240
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey.

241
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,528
(The leader of Block 5, JP goes first.)

242
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,568
Is it JP again?

243
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,198
Start this beat off like this

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,739
The color of the sky that turns darker

245
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,309
- Whenever I grew angry - Is it you again?

246
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,980
My mom told me to stay still

247
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,479
After leaving many comments

248
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,249
- Don't feel awkward, you jerks - He's good.

249
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,749
- I'm about to get off - It makes no sense.

250
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,750
So go ahead and pray

251
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
- For your changing face - What's up with him?

252
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,349
Don't die, you dig and get into your emotions

253
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,350
I'm too selfish and I'm mad

254
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,388
- He's really good. - I'll throw them away

255
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,449
I'm getting tired, My breath is coming out short

256
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,518
But I want them mula

257
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,288
On my dirty hands It's unhealthy, so I don't recommend

258
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,918
Bounce 1 time, bounce 2 times

259
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,388
Bounce three times, now I gotta stack

260
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,158
- There he goes. - Bounce 1 time, bounce 2 times

261
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,999
Yes, everything is pitch black

262
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,028
(JP chooses Chaboom.)

263
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,299
Why do they keep attacking us?

264
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,600
Let's go, Chaboom.

265
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,739
Flip, fold, flip, fold my Galaxy Z

266
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,408
My phone is on fire, I'm so busy

267
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,008
My time is money and 9.375g of gold, so cut to the chase

268
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,339
Up, up, up, yes, then come KOSDAQ

269
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,579
And KakaoPay, money flows in nonstop

270
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,518
"GQ," "ESQUIRE," "LEON," Louis, Givenchy, Dior

271
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,749
I have style, my coolness makes kids jealous

272
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,889
With Yuhan-Kimberly, flip, fold, flip, fold, flip, fold, yes

273
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,398
(Chaboom chooses Kaogaii.)

274
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,499
Kaogaii.

275
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,028
Let's go. You got this.

276
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,570
He doesn't look happy.

277
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,298
- He burned up his passion. - He's out of energy.

278
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,340
He's done.

279
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,610
Kaogaii used up his strength.

280
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,008
Kaogaii, let's go.

281
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,240
- Good luck. - Let's go.

282
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,849
I performed a miracle despite being a beggar

283
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,349
Now, Kaogaii is a name you know

284
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,548
It wasn't easy, but even when I was lost

285
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,378
I shoved my punchline and 2-4 rhythm in your head

286
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,949
My emoji is smiling in front of the closet

287
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,589
- What should I wear for a shoot - He's raking in the verses.

288
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,989
I used to consider stealing Nike shoes

289
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,058
Because I was ashamed of my five-dollar shoes

290
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,059
But my name will be a brand soon

291
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,590
One thing I need to know is my true friend

292
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,158
Unless I become rich, no, thanks

293
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,859
Live with your spirits, Your life is a last cigarette

294
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,799
So don't let anyone take it, okay?

295
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,799
(Kaogaii chooses HAON.)

296
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,709
Like how on earth do I remember that?

297
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,168
All this money that we manifested

298
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,869
Keeping my head cool is the main event

299
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,278
I meditated, not an ice bucket, My life is worth five stars

300
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,678
You guys are dry, Every day, I'm seated in a chair

301
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,278
Whether I hold a pen or a dumbbell

302
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,119
- I make results, really don't care - He's so stable.

303
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,449
Twenty-four, six, in the way the higher power created me

304
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,719
- I'm working and eating good meals - His performance is incredible.

305
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,859
I ain't see anyone, you're all lame

306
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,490
On my table, I'm feeling cozy

307
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,729
If you listened to the Q

308
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,459
Open the book right now and let go of your stubbornness

309
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,459
- He's so cool. - I throw that ball into a goal

310
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
They tripping

311
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,869
Let's go.

312
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,870
(HAON chooses Boi B.)

313
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,230
- Let's go. - Hey.

314
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,469
I'm different from the regulars at the internet cafe

315
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,138
My early mornings and late nights birthed

316
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,408
- New tracks - Boi B...

317
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,709
- Without holding back - has experience.

318
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,309
- He must have many verses. - He has many verses.

319
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,609
I aim my K-1, the target is your pants

320
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,008
I see the boys give a standing ovation

321
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,620
I put hearts in the girls' eyes

322
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,819
New rap phenomenon, it's Happy New Year

323
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,989
- My dream will come true - This is his last verse.

324
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,750
So let this be a New Year greeting

325
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,419
Already know, mates

326
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,730
Who'll go next?

327
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Nice!

328
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,129
(Boi B chooses HAON.)

329
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,128
- Let's go. - The idea of obtaining everything

330
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,869
I could only stare at

331
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,599
It sounds like a dream

332
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,069
But it isn't only a dream

333
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,609
My friends who cheered with enthusiasm

334
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,378
Even when I rapped at the karaoke

335
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,538
Thank you

336
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,548
- Now, I receive questions - The lyrics are touching.

337
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,209
Through DMs

338
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,819
They ask me how I became a rapper

339
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,749
I have a conversation with my aching head

340
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,418
To find an answer to the question

341
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,449
- My useless conclusion is - Two more measures.

342
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,658
That there's no right answer

343
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,659
I'll tell you how I did it, so take note

344
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,129
- Yes. - Yes.

345
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,028
- Yes. - Let's go.

346
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,099
(HAON chooses Kaogaii.)

347
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,999
- Let's go. - Yes.

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,100
Are you guys having fun?

349
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,169
He ran out of verses.

350
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,599
- Let's go. - Okay.

351
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,908
Kaogaii feels like J

352
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,569
Break, break the rock

353
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,109
We play paper right away

354
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,709
Tell me everything

355
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,009
We play paper right away

356
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,008
My dirt spoon and your dirt spoon taste the same

357
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,648
Acting out and lashing out won't change a thing

358
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,119
I'll win and grab the gold spoon

359
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,288
I'll make Hopyeong-dong as successful as Jongno Three-ga

360
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,949
Kaogaii from the 27th Infantry Division

361
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,119
- The 27th Infantry Division. - I'm the real man

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,058
- Follow me to beat my confidence - No.

363
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,719
- Don't come here. - My heart is this big

364
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,058
We're Jim Carrey in our masks

365
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,330
We carry each other's burden

366
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,099
On the day we remove our masks

367
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,500
We'll face each other and laugh

368
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,428
As if there's an agenda, as if we're stupid

369
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,699
Let's erase "Freedom" in the dictionary

370
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,099
If it's a fight everyone can win

371
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,470
- I'll take off "Kao" from my name - No.

372
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,508
(Kaogaii chooses HAON.)

373
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,109
Let's go.

374
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,048
When HAON became the new target,

375
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,480
I thought that it'd be hard for him to remain coolheaded.

376
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,679
Stop beating him up. Stop it, seriously.

377
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,719
So this is how it's going to be.

378
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,049
Okay. I'm the target this time.

379
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,419
I'll show them.

380
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,629
Poke me and provoke me, it'll be your losing move

381
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:36,829
I'll steal your inhalation and exhalation

382
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,859
- And make you pass out - No, don't come to Block Six.

383
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,229
- No. - I have no interest whatsoever

384
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,268
In this childish group fight

385
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,298
But if you mess with me

386
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,299
- Get your calculations right - He's out of verses now.

387
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,638
My life is

388
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,609
A mountain of wealth

389
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,569
- If you don't get it, forget it - HAON is so crazy.

390
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,878
A three-year-old should never stress out

391
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,008
I soar into the world

392
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,979
Outside a big birdcage

393
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,008
I fly high, look down, and say

394
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,350
"Como estas?"

395
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,450
(HAON chooses Chaboom.)

396
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,289
He survived the round.

397
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,559
- He held out well. - Nice.

398
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,860
Nice defense. Well done.

399
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,668
Hunnit million won, one hundred thousand dollars

400
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,628
It was a lot of money when I was little

401
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,668
- I asked Santa to put it in my sock - He went in perfectly.

402
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,369
It's a lot of money

403
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,638
Sunday night

404
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,669
I can't do this. Darn it.

405
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,178
Sunday night

406
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,240
(I can't do this. Darn it.)

407
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,080
I'll stop here.

408
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,378
I thought he was rapping.

409
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,949
- It's okay. - You were doing well.

410
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,279
The leaders are so talented.

411
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,989
No one deserves criticism.

412
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,990
I'm done.

413
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
You did well.

414
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,460
I held out as much as I could.

415
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,058
The leader of Block Seven, Chaboom, is eliminated.

416
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,158
- Infinite Cypher is so hard. - It's hard.

417
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,159
- Good job. - Chaboom fought well.

418
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,129
Watching them makes me dizzy.

419
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:49,970
This is incredible.

420
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,100
- Thank you for your hard work. - It was great.

421
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,700
- Well done. - Thank you for your hard work.

422
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm out of verses.

423
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,309
Four leaders remain.

424
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,580
From today onward, my name is Jundi Panda.

425
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,950
JP is insane.

426
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,449
- This is driving me crazy. - Kaogaii, let's go.

427
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,518
I'm out of verses, so I'll need to improvise...

428
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,919
with the ones I used for gigs.

429
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,620
Boi B, you're the best.

430
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:11,989
I'm surviving longer than I expected.

431
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,059
This is insane.

432
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,089
- He held out well. - He held out well.

433
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,460
- Okay. Four. - Let's go.

434
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,399
It was unexpected, but I might've become a target.

435
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,469
I need to trust my muscle memory...

436
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,339
and go with my instinct.

437
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,570
Watching HAON made me realize...

438
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,080
that he was someone who loved peace.

439
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,539
Even if a rapper chooses him,

440
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,509
he chooses another one. He's a peacemaker.

441
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,820
(Round 5 of Infinite Cypher starts.)

442
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:44,419
Why is he going first?

443
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,019
He's a lunatic.

444
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,289
- He's insane. - Let's go.

445
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:50,960
It looks like he's channeling a spirit.

446
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,730
Will he go again?

447
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,370
- JP shouldn't be attacked. - He's incredible.

448
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,339
- He's scary. - Let's go.

449
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,369
- Yes. - Let's go.

450
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,908
Armor on my chest, got them, Drop all your nonsense

451
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,369
There's been no change in my position

452
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,279
But wait for me once more like you did in the beginning

453
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
It's all the same

454
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:08,549
- HAON needs to be targeted. - I'm tired and I need a break

455
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,508
My brain might be traumatized by AI, these phonies

456
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,048
Running around this place every day

457
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,518
These jerks crawl around

458
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,949
- And pain me - I can only laugh.

459
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,018
I don't care, I spread my arms without a word

460
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,389
Now, get you out of my sight

461
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,589
(JP chooses HAON.)

462
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,629
Let's go.

463
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,929
Let's go.

464
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,299
What is he going to do? Seriously.

465
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,269
Let's go.

466
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:31,839
Yes, I got it, all that

467
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,999
Judgments repeat themselves

468
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,339
Who cares? Why are you pretending to be a teacher?

469
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,668
Take this, I get it I'm the only one who can spit it out

470
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,239
Now, you mad, I mad, we mad

471
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,908
I surpass you and you try to strike me down

472
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,479
I did it, but you can't

473
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,048
You punks made rap an easy game

474
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:45,148
And my quality is a move that shoots down Ubi

475
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,878
It's like the Harlem Shake, I'm pulling people in

476
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,418
I'm the surfer boy with no suffering

477
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,518
Not a single medal even though it's a sport

478
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,619
Dreaming and touring

479
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,258
I was up high when I opened my eyes

480
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,489
Although I'm not a Taoist

481
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,528
I contract space and float in real life

482
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:57,799
That's what I'm doing

483
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,129
(HAON chooses Kaogaii.)

484
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,500
- Let's go. - Let's go.

485
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm a zombie.

486
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,440
Let's go.

487
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
He really is a zombie.

488
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,849
It has been years since I wanted to do intense rapping

489
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,408
It feels like time has stopped

490
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,878
Rappers who talk big are like Yeong Cheol

491
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,648
When I get angry about it, I'm like Myung Hyung Man

492
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:20,678
I want stimulation

493
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,849
- This is bad. HAON is cornered. - I want insane kind of fun

494
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,219
That'll make me want to bet my livelihood and money

495
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,859
- I think we're cornered. - I want my eyes to go crazy

496
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,319
- But they get deliveries, not beats - He shouldn't be messed with.

497
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,459
The hip-hop scene is no fun

498
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,128
Give the hustling to the dogs because you'll waste your energy

499
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,658
You pretend to be a celebrity and babble

500
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,359
So the public gets to be the judge

501
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,999
Since when did we become wary?

502
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,528
The Korean character became hip-hop

503
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,168
They want rappers to rap only, Okay, I'll rap only

504
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,039
So listeners, shut it now and listen only

505
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,009
Let's go.

506
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,210
(Kaogaii chooses HAON.)

507
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
I knew that this would happen.

508
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,549
- Let's go. - Don't.

509
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,820
They're on fire.

510
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,689
Walk like this, rappers who can't take a step

511
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,619
I'm sleepwalking, you arrogant fool

512
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,788
- The lives of the babies - That punk is...

513
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:58,989
- Who can't rap depend on that - so talented.

514
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,628
My fuel is permanent, my goal is the moon, so make it your dream

515
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,158
Now, the mode is on and it's wild inside the venue

516
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,429
Everyone's European except for some

517
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,528
He's so talented.

518
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,729
We different, different

519
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,969
- I stick to the basics, I overspend - He's good.

520
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,798
My keyboard and I have a symbiotic relationship

521
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,169
I use checks as a memo pad

522
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,439
Youngins on the top floor

523
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,239
My flow is supreme, so call all 100

524
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,669
I spit out such verses with a hunch

525
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,880
You walk slowly while I march forward, Pablo

526
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,108
(HAON chooses Boi B.)

527
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,118
- He did well. - Boi B.

528
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,578
Versace out, Nike in

529
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,389
Even if it's free, I don't want that Chrome Hearts necklace

530
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,449
- When everyone raps the same - Having a faceoff is the only way.

531
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,819
I wear techwear on TV and give a stunning performance

532
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,889
I came and saw, you already know what comes next

533
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,328
Friends and foes are two sides of a coin

534
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,358
It's like a two-faced fate.

535
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,528
- No face, no name - He's really talented.

536
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,429
Think of me as the recorded Lee Chun Soo

537
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,999
The ball that comes across my feet shuts it and goes forward

538
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,700
They're like the back of Maldini's head, kicking

539
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,068
You don't have to know my face and name

540
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,809
This is "PENTOXIC," "Gun Rap" I listened and learned

541
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,339
Watch your back and your freaking neck

542
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,650
- Give it to JP. - Please.

543
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,319
(Which leader will Boi B choose?)

544
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,219
- Who will it be? - Take out that AI.

545
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,819
Make JP run out of verses.

546
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,659
(Boi B chooses HAON.)

547
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,259
- That's cruel. - Let's go.

548
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's go.

549
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,410
He has no verses.

550
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,579
He needs to go.

551
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,210
Oh, no.

552
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,410
- I don't remember. - Okay.

553
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,949
- I don't remember. - Okay.

554
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,750
- You did well. - Well done, HAON.

555
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,119
- Well done. - Well done.

556
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,759
- Well done. - You were so cool.

557
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,289
We made good memories.

558
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,788
- You did well. - You're something else.

559
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,130
He beat half of the leaders.

560
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,399
Well done. I acknowledge him. He's incredible.

561
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,670
He's really good.

562
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,469
- Well done. - Seriously.

563
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,538
- The leader of Block Three, - You did an amazing job.

564
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,268
- HAON, is eliminated. - Well done.

565
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,338
Thank you for your hard work. You did so well.

566
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,579
- Well done. - I couldn't remember my verses.

567
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,108
- No, HAON. You did well. - No.

568
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,409
- You did so well. - Well done.

569
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,379
- You did so well. - You did what you needed to do.

570
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
You did more than that.

571
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:07,619
My head went blank after the consecutive attacks.

572
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,149
But I really liked that.

573
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,359
Until the end,

574
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,730
my teammates rooted for me.

575
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,129
(Block 3 cheered HAON on with enthusiasm in every round.)

576
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,868
- It's okay. You can do it. - Let's go.

577
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:23,900
I believe in you.

578
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,970
It's time to drink water.

579
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,970
You did well.

580
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,910
- You held out well. - You held out well.

581
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,838
I could sense...

582
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,609
that they were doing their best to put my mind at ease.

583
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,049
So I could truly enjoy myself on the stage.

584
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:38,849
Well done.

585
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,849
I got attacked like this toward the end.

586
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,250
This is insanely hard. It makes no sense.

587
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,059
HAON did well...

588
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,588
in a calm and stable manner.

589
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,029
I think he did his part.

590
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,969
HAON did what he needed to do.

591
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,669
I think he brought the best result for the block.

592
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,799
I'm very satisfied.

593
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,910
(Since the start of the leaders' Infinite Cypher)

594
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,849
I thought it'd end after one round.

595
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,750
They've rapped for almost an hour.

596
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,289
It makes no sense.

597
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,858
Do you think this is right?

598
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,160
This game is impossible.

599
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,499
This has gone on for over an hour, right?

600
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,429
This really is the Infinite Cypher.

601
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,869
(Only the leaders of Blocks 4, 5, and 6 remain.)

602
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,470
This marathon of a game makes no sense.

603
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,739
Each person did at least ten verses.

604
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,739
It has to be more than 10. I think they did 20 verses each.

605
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm shocked that they have ten verses.

606
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,479
I just thought of four more verses.

607
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,609
- Really? - No cheers are needed.

608
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,250
You were insanely cool. Seriously. You're the best.

609
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,819
How did they memorize all the verses?

610
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,618
- Kaogaii is the best. - He's cool. He's really cool.

611
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,490
Kaogaii, we'll work hard.

612
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,758
We'll work really hard.

613
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,929
- Kaogaii is the best. - We'll work hard.

614
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,429
- He's so cool. - Okay. Let's go.

615
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,499
Just enjoy yourself from now on.

616
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,200
- I used up too many verses. - Yes.

617
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,469
In the beginning, other leaders used up many of their verses...

618
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,328
- as they went back and forth. - That's right.

619
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,700
- I was lucky. - That's right.

620
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,839
Boi B has saved up his verses so far.

621
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,910
He really has a sly side.

622
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,048
Boi B, rumor has it that you're out of verses.

623
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,410
- Really? Says who? - Geegooin.

624
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,980
He isn't the brain of your block.

625
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,419
That made my passion burn brightly.

626
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,358
Until HAON's elimination, I had a bit of a strategy.

627
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,489
It's raining, now no cap, We dance slow

628
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,700
I pretended to be relaxed.

629
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,730
"If you give me the microphone, I'll give it right back."

630
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,240
On the inside, I was intimidated to death.

631
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,599
But Kaogaii's provocation...

632
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,569
made my blood boil.

633
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,838
- Let's go! Boi B, let's go! - Let's go!

634
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,079
- Let's go! - Let's go!

635
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,449
JP!

636
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,149
- JP. - JP, let's go!

637
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,219
You're doing an amazing job.

638
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,250
Start.

639
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,219
- Hey! - He's going first again. Darn.

640
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,359
- Go ahead. - Do everything you want to do.

641
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,828
There's no reason to be picky now, The lower I go

642
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,328
The closer I get to the small star

643
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,499
- Loving you, the one and only - What a crazy man.

644
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,868
It'll be hard, but we must jump over the wall

645
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,399
Feels like everything is gifted or granted

646
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,568
I swear it's switching the functions Exploring like Martians

647
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,739
Speaking of Martians I'll pass this joint to MRSHLL

648
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,209
He's the star of this song, When everyone is still, let's go

649
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,338
Something's going wrong, yes

650
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,279
I'd raise the white flag.

651
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,079
- Let's go. - Yes.

652
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,450
Let's go.

653
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,189
Big man, big boy, big shot

654
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,258
If you call me a cherry boy, you need your eyes checked

655
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,389
I'm popular because I can rap well

656
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,489
Had hip-hop gone to gutters, I would've been poor all my life

657
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,528
So just get lost, Why are you trying to be logical?

658
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,598
You only showed your unseriousness in an attempt to appear clever

659
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,629
Until when will you chase the issues

660
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,630
- And gratify yourself? - He's good.

661
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,669
You'll just become a meme to the trashy YouTubers

662
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,939
Why do you make money out of my diss track?

663
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,008
HOLIC and SHONG.K, run before I rip off your masks

664
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:51,108
Most of the fans in the venue are women

665
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,709
Come and feel the difference

666
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,410
Hip-hop isn't for you, so use toilet paper, cherry boy

667
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,779
(Kaogaii chooses Boi B.)

668
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,318
Karl Kani and True Religion hang low under the hips

669
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,518
Middle-aged women, tsk, and the veins bulge in my neck

670
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,889
The only hip-hop kid of Inha University High School

671
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,258
I now make more money than the one who was on "Inkigayo"

672
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,868
Independence Day, TPM, be humble

673
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,999
Bruce Wayne's lifestyle

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,299
Bruce Willis' hairstyle

675
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,368
(Boi B chooses Kaogaii.)

676
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,879
Perhaps this is my first step

677
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,979
New birthday, it really is time to make money

678
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,949
I make a promise after putting my love on a bus

679
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,219
I'll never let go, I'm honey, money is a swarm of bees

680
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,919
I'll never forget the 30-dollar performance

681
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,149
- A mention on HIPHOPLE - I get it with Boi B,

682
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,389
- Is a cause for a get-together - but why does he still have verses?

683
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,318
When the world turns on you, stick it in

684
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,319
Then comes the good part

685
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,029
Let's go, Boi B. One more time.

686
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,358
Hey.

687
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,129
Now, who's hot, who's not?

688
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,268
There are too many people with two jobs

689
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,098
Your CEO is a man with a two-digit IQ

690
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,239
Who's obsessed

691
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,169
- With redeemed investments - I'm glad it's between them.

692
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,838
I don't want to shake hands with you

693
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,909
Get out of here with your team

694
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,909
(Get out of here with your team)

695
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,879
RTPW, my squad

696
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,308
We're here to blow up the place like a radioactive matter

697
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,879
How does it feel? I have no gimmicks

698
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,348
More than anyone, I have no limits

699
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,489
If you understood, you all don't mess around with me

700
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,358
Although I'm no Nucksal, I'm infinite

701
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,318
- B, I, G to B, O, I, B - He's so good.

702
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,729
More dangerous than a K-9 gunner

703
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,929
Higher than what, underground mind

704
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,529
You know what it is

705
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,599
He's really good.

706
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,670
Let's go!

707
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,439
- Hey. - Hey.

708
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,309
- Hey. - Is this beat coming to an end?

709
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,009
Good going.

710
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,318
Make no mistake, my paychecks don't come

711
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,348
From your tax money

712
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,889
Don't tell me what to do

713
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,459
I don't mess around because I need my fans

714
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,618
Even when the lights go out, Even when the pandemic hits

715
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,729
I continue to burn, nice

716
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,899
You pray that I'd roll over and die

717
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,028
- But I'm still kicking - Hey.

718
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:56,528
What will you do? Call over the lunatics who love comparing

719
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,298
And haters

720
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,298
When I swear at your dad and do an eating show

721
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,268
Your dad gets a paycheck

722
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:06,839
- RAP: PUBLIC is so much fun - He's a total zombie.

723
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,309
That was a mess.

724
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,750
- Let's go! - I still managed to do it.

725
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,150
Yes.

726
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,848
It counts.

727
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,950
He did it.

728
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,719
- He did it. - He did it.

729
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,190
- He survived. - I can't believe he survived.

730
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,859
He held out well.

731
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,729
How did they hold out so far?

732
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,229
Everyone is incredible.

733
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,038
- They're monsters. - My goodness.

734
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:37,170
(The 2nd beat of Round 6 plays.)

735
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,880
JP is like a factory of lyrics.

736
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,420
No! Please.

737
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,720
Shall I change things up this time?

738
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,189
- Will you take me out this time? - All right.

739
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,459
Spit the bar tight

740
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,129
- There isn't much I have - Is it a 2-on-1 match?

741
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,828
- Most wanted a black collar on me - It's a 2-on-1 match.

742
00:25:57,829 --> 00:25:58,929
You know what it is

743
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,358
- Dress warmly before coldness hits - He's a lunatic.

744
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,768
It's definitely colder, but homie, I ain't gon die before you, yes

745
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,499
Long style in my baby

746
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,608
Feel them chemicals going inside your body

747
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,439
I mean, can you even manage the pain that I'm having?

748
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,578
Numerous thoughts

749
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,538
- I want for my soul at the moment - How big is his brain?

750
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,449
Let me serve you something good for tonight

751
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,318
(JP chooses Kaogaii.)

752
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,680
I acknowledge JP's talent.

753
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,318
I acknowledge JP's talent.

754
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,249
I'd acknowledge it even if he stops now.

755
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,460
- I'm JP's fanboy. - He's completely insane.

756
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,659
My city bag never gets

757
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,328
I haven't started yet. It was an ad-lib.

758
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:34,599
My city bag never gets

759
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,139
- Hey. - Hey.

760
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
- Hey. - Hey.

761
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:44,740
- No, there's time. I'll begin. - No.

762
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,909
My city bag never gets empty

763
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,179
- Bring Yamaha, you punk - No.

764
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,479
Front wheels like taekwondo

765
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,749
Sexy like my clothes

766
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,078
- Korean flag in the back - It's nice.

767
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,380
Front and back... Darn it!

768
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:59,919
(The leader of Block 6, Kaogaii, is eliminated.)

769
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,659
The leader of Block Six,

770
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,429
- Kaogaii, is eliminated. - You did well.

771
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,200
Yes.

772
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,029
Darn it.

773
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,500
He did so well.

774
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,240
- You worked hard. - Kaogaii, you're cool.

775
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,009
I wanted to do it no matter what.

776
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,779
My daughter is 24 weeks old.

777
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,380
(Kaogaii became a father.)

778
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,650
She'll know that her dad is a hardworking man...

779
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,589
when she watches this material.

780
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,588
It was a big motivation.

781
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,258
I thought, "He's doing this with gritted teeth."

782
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:41,500
He showed the desperation to survive no matter what.

783
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,368
Kaogaii...

784
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,439
was the most fatherly one. Seriously.

785
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,939
So many leaders got eliminated.

786
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,809
Everyone is incredible.

787
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,739
- Why did I work so hard? - You're nearly there.

788
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,538
You're nearly there.

789
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,909
- You've shown us enough coolness. - Would you give me water?

790
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,479
- Hurry up and bring water. - Here you go.

791
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,719
- My goodness. - Water, please.

792
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,749
Thank you.

793
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,989
- You're sweating so much. - Seriously.

794
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,258
- I don't care about the result. - What will you do?

795
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,889
- You're already the best. For real. - Thank you.

796
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,389
They're running over to open his water bottle.

797
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,429
JP is unbelievable.

798
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,459
He's standing firm.

799
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,058
I bet he has at least ten more verses.

800
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,729
- Yes. Definitely. - Yes.

801
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,239
But Boi B didn't get chosen much in the beginning.

802
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,469
- He probably has more ammo. - Yes, he probably does.

803
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,839
I don't know about JP.

804
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,239
JP, how many verses remain?

805
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,710
Not many.

806
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,008
It's almost over, so relax.

807
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,049
Relax.

808
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,578
I was quite nervous...

809
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:37,190
because Boi B didn't use up his verses.

810
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,659
I thought, "It won't be easy."

811
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,419
(From Round 1, he went 1st.)

812
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,200
(Then JP continued to go first afterward.)

813
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,929
It was a bit scary.

814
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,069
I couldn't think of the verses.

815
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:53,068
It's the final round.

816
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:54,568
An experienced rapper versus a rising rapper.

817
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:55,970
- Seriously. - Let's go.

818
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,038
- Ready. - Let's go.

819
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,909
- Good luck. - Boi B, you got this.

820
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,909
- Let's go, Boi B. - Let's go.

821
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,879
- JP! - You're the best!

822
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,380
- Let's go! - This is insane!

823
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:10,049
(The last round of Infinite Cypher, Block 4's Boi B versus Block 5's JP)

824
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:13,159
I wanted to have a good match.

825
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,589
This is the beginning of a real game.

826
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:16,789
Bring it on.

827
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,899
Start.

828
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,599
- Yes, let's go. - Good luck.

829
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,000
JP wouldn't have many verses left.

830
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I'll go first.

831
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,808
Ball so hard that Hwang In Beom can get a through pass

832
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:33,838
That's crazy

833
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,209
- A label we made to do what we want - Boi B must be more relaxed.

834
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,278
We're TEAMPLAY

835
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,018
I'm sorry to cut you off

836
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,219
But I can't stop until I become a world-class rapper

837
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,818
I came, I saw, I what, I have a solid foundation

838
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,959
Focus, everyone, You'll find out now

839
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,819
About the difference of our heights, not the distances, hold up

840
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,858
Do you know "Squid Game?"

841
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:50,990
Do you know Zombie?

842
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,258
Do you know BTS?

843
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,460
Do you know Gangnam?

844
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:56,298
After purchasing my car, Carnival

845
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,499
I'm back by popular demand

846
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,839
What? Let's go

847
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,439
- There it comes. - Let's go.

848
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Let's go

849
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:06,808
Yes, set it on fire

850
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,239
Bring all of your friends

851
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,909
I don't care about anything, but spending my time

852
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,679
Or shedding my tears on something divine

853
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,219
I dreamed of a perfect life, but that dream is over

854
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,389
It was over, but I'm in right now

855
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,319
Hit me up on FaceTime or something, anything is possible, we're on this

856
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,419
Chilling nonstop with just this

857
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,129
Chilling on top of the biggest peak

858
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,328
Another me is spitting it out, I'm just going for it

859
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:27,359
What on earth is up with this?

860
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,568
B-O-I-B, the hooligan's vibe goes like this

861
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:34,239
That fool gets turned down at the door like this

862
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,709
Give me a truckful of dummies

863
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,669
Beating them up will be easy

864
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,078
My lines don't need quantizing

865
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,778
- His breathing control is insane. - I don't care about your timeline

866
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,709
Krump it like Woo Fam, let's get back to me now

867
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,848
H4rdyape, feel like this?

868
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,618
Forty-eight, mash up the deck like this

869
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,319
We'll be killing the 140 kings like this

870
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,349
I don't care about sober tricks like this

871
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,989
- Boi B! - Yes!

872
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,619
- Let's go, JP. - You can do it.

873
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,298
Shawty, yes, we've got to have some time

874
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,528
I ain't lying tonight, baby

875
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,268
I only try to get your mind, be half of me

876
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,739
- I still don't know how you feel - What is this?

877
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,038
I reckon that you always think about me

878
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,308
Then there's another guy, yes

879
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,808
Stop making up excuses, we don't have much time for this

880
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,278
- You're the selfish one - He's doomed. What will he do?

881
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,479
There's no us anymore

882
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,308
I turned into a heavy smoker now, It's hurting my torso

883
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,919
But I'm not scared, and shots fired like GoPro

884
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,119
At least today, I'm a bad guy

885
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,720
So turn up the bass

886
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,819
- Well done. - Hey.

887
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:27,990
That was cool.

888
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,258
This is it for me. Thank you.

889
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,930
(Boi B eliminates himself out of the match.)

890
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,808
- You won. That was crazy. - That was crazy.

891
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,140
- Gosh, JP! - That was insane!

892
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,240
- That was crazy. - Oh, my.

893
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,609
- Hey, who are you? - That was crazy.

894
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,349
Gosh, that was so cool.

895
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,149
- The leader of Block Four, - Well done.

896
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,848
- You did more than enough. - Boi B, is out.

897
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,288
- That was crazy. - You did more than enough.

898
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,858
- That was so cool. - You pulled more than your weight.

899
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,220
- We're in second place. - My head hurts.

900
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,859
- That was crazy. - It was insane.

901
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:04,930
How can anyone beat him at this?

902
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,199
- Well done. Look at him. - The final winner...

903
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,298
- is the leader of Block Five, JP. - My gosh, it felt so good.

904
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,969
- My gosh, that was incredible. - Gosh, it was crazy.

905
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,568
- Gosh, it was crazy. - This is a legendary day for you.

906
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:17,808
- Seriously. It's a historical day. - It is.

907
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,940
He was probably writing the lines during the match.

908
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,049
He must have been writing the lines and rapping at the same time.

909
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,210
Here's how I felt about JP.

910
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,220
He made me wonder, "Am I battling it against AlphaGo?"

911
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,149
He could create verses infinitely.

912
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,720
He was the epitome of the Infinite Cypher in human form.

913
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,329
I thought that keep battling against him was pointless.

914
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:39,559
To be honest, I could have kept going infinitely.

915
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,499
After listening to the beat, I could just think for a bit.

916
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,839
I was able to keep rapping on and on.

917
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,939
I had to give it to him.

918
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,740
JP owned this stage today.

919
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,709
He represents the Infinite Cypher.

920
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,009
He's the Infinite Cypher in human form.

921
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,649
I will now announce the amount of Block Money...

922
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,420
each block obtained.

923
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:02,018
- We must have the most money. - Right.

924
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:04,849
I don't think Block Eight will have any money.

925
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,490
We're probably penniless, right?

926
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:09,029
Eighth place of the Infinite Cypher.

927
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:11,730
The Block Money Block Eight obtained...

928
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,629
(Block 8 obtains 2,000 dollars as their Block Money.)

929
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,700
- It's 2,000 dollars. - It's 2,000 dollars.

930
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,808
Well, it's hard to tell if that's a lot or not.

931
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,009
I don't know how much more the other blocks will get.

932
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,279
I felt bad for my block.

933
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,009
I was disappointed.

934
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,779
Seventh place of the Infinite Cypher.

935
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,279
The Block Money Block One obtained...

936
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,220
Let's see.

937
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:38,919
- It's 3,000 dollars. - I see 3,000 dollars.

938
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
(Block 1 obtains 3,000 dollars as their Block Money.)

939
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,619
- I got 3,000 dollars. - It's 3,000 dollars.

940
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:43,789
It's 3,000 dollars.

941
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:44,789
- It's going up by 1,000 dollars. - By 1,000 dollars.

942
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,730
- So it's 3,000 dollars. - They'll get extra 1,000 dollars.

943
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,930
Sixth place of the Infinite Cypher...

944
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,368
Fifth place...

945
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:53,000
Fourth place... Third place... Second place...

946
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,439
(Block 2, 6th place: 4,000 dollars)

947
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,669
(Block 7, 5th place: 5,000 dollars)

948
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,808
(Block 3, 4th place: 6,000 dollars)

949
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:57,868
(Block 6, 3rd place: 7,000 dollars)

950
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,910
(Block 4, 2nd place: 8,000 dollars)

951
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,849
- Give us a bit more. - This is nice.

952
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,650
Lucky seven, baby.

953
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,518
Boi B. Thanks to you, we're rich.

954
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,920
Let's buy some meat with that.

955
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,429
First place of the Infinite Cypher.

956
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,190
The Block Money Block Five obtained...

957
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,400
It must be either 10,000 dollars or 9,000 dollars.

958
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,058
What if it's 20,000 dollars?

959
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,130
No way.

960
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,399
Give them 10,000 dollars.

961
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,468
(Block 5 obtains 10,000 dollars as their Block Money.)

962
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,400
- Yes, it was 10,000 dollars. - It's 10,000 dollars.

963
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,469
- You got my respect. - My gosh.

964
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,940
My gosh, it's 10,000 dollars.

965
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,509
- You earned it. - Yes.

966
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,849
- It's yours. - It's yours.

967
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,579
Every block has received their first sum of the Block Money.

968
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,219
You did well. I mean it.

969
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
Young Shin.

970
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:49,189
You were crazy today.

971
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,929
- Hey, you killed it. - Seriously.

972
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,659
Well done. I mean it.

973
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,360
Great job.

974
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:55,899
Good job.

975
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,929
- You had the toughest job. - Well done.

976
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:00,139
My gosh, it was really fun, though.

977
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,000
This Block Money is so precious.

978
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,570
I'm so glad we recruited you.

979
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,639
It's a decision I'll never regret.

980
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,049
To be honest, I couldn't believe I actually experienced...

981
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,649
all of that today. That's how surreal it felt for me.

982
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,848
You could go around the world,

983
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,049
but you'd never see anything like this.

984
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,118
I thought this was on another level.

985
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,218
It was shocking.

986
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,459
I was in awe.

987
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,488
I had the biggest dopamine rush ever.

988
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,989
(The duration of the Infinite Cypher was 78 minutes.)

989
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,159
(The first match to obtain the Block Money)

990
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:33,400
(The leaders did their best to put on a great performance.)

991
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,138
When they were battling it out on stage,

992
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,539
I could feel their passion. My heart warmed up.

993
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,839
None of them backed down.

994
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,980
They tried their best to survive the match.

995
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,650
When I saw how determined they were to win,

996
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:54,159
I got a new sense of respect for them.

997
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,059
(During the Infinite Cypher, 88 verses were performed in total.)

998
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,629
Gosh, if I were battling it out,

999
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,030
my legs would've gone weak and I would've passed out.

1000
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,360
To be honest, I got a reality check.

1001
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,968
I thought, "That's the level they're all competing on."

1002
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,269
"I need to be as good as them."

1003
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,299
It made me wonder, "Am I as ready as they are?"

1004
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,710
I wanted to say that it was like watching the cream of the crop.

1005
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,339
- Well done. - Great job!

1006
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,308
- Well done, Fleeky Bang. - You were the best.

1007
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,710
- Hey, who are you? - That was crazy.

1008
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,249
Well done. You killed it.

1009
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,119
- Oh, my. - You were great. You did your job.

1010
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,419
The Infinite Cypher...

1011
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,558
also gave us a chance...

1012
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,860
to bond more strongly together, not just the Block Money.

1013
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,428
I was touched by all of the artists.

1014
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:34,559
I think Korea has the best rappers in the world.

1015
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,170
This is the one and only society you establish with rap,

1016
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,769
RAP: PUBLIC.

1017
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,308
Now that you have formed your own block...

1018
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:47,078
whom you will fight together in this society,

1019
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,110
you are now fully ready.

1020
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,780
You will now continue your journey...

1021
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,519
as one to become the final victors.

1022
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,119
The journey will begin...

1023
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,159
in the Village of RAP: PUBLIC. Please enter the Village now.

1024
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,529
The first thing that came to my mind was,

1025
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,929
"It's finally starting."

1026
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,639
I won't even try to predict the future battles.

1027
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,309
They won't be what I have in mind anyway.

1028
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,909
I'll just participate with my instincts every moment.

1029
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,289
- Oh, my gosh. - Gosh.

1030
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,189
It looks like a city.

1031
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,388
I can't believe this.

1032
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,519
This is fascinating.

1033
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,029
This is crazy.

1034
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,328
They really created a village.

1035
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,699
It's a dystopia.

1036
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,929
- What's this? - My gosh.

1037
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,170
I'm going crazy.

1038
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,939
- Oh, my. - It looks like a real village.

1039
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,009
(Each block...)

1040
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,809
(gets their own area with a square in the center.)

1041
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,449
- This is us. - I see. Block Eight.

1042
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,650
I guess we can hook something here.

1043
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,948
- Right. - What's this?

1044
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,988
Maybe, it happens at night.

1045
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,989
I see. Maybe, they have to hang something at night and run away.

1046
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,159
Oh, no. What do we do then?

1047
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,260
What could we do? We'll just have to kill them.

1048
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,429
Gosh, Block One is here.

1049
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,199
- I see. So this is our block. - Look at this.

1050
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,300
(Conference room)

1051
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,639
- The strategy board. - We can use it to strategize.

1052
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,539
Gosh, this is our conference room.

1053
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,639
(Meanwhile, this grabs Block 8's eyes.)

1054
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,308
Red Bull drinks are in the fridge.

1055
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,538
There's a microwave too.

1056
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,650
Red Bull!

1057
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,808
- Oh, my! - Oh, my!

1058
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,880
(Seeing the cans excites them.)

1059
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,219
Hey.

1060
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,320
The sleeping area looks pretty nice.

1061
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,260
Gosh, we can sleep in here too.

1062
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,928
This place looks great. I bet I will get a good night's sleep here.

1063
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:43,929
I'll sleep here like a baby.

1064
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,730
Oh, my gosh.

1065
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,428
Oh, my gosh.

1066
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,760
Oh, my gosh.

1067
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:51,429
(Block 5)

1068
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,699
There's money.

1069
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,340
That's our 10,000 dollars.

1070
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,638
I see. That's how we store our money.

1071
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,769
(The safe will store the Block Money each block has obtained.)

1072
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,039
Look.

1073
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,138
Hey, there's cash here.

1074
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,210
- I see. We'll get to see the cash. - You won it from the cypher.

1075
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,518
My gosh, HAON brought us the cash. You know?

1076
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,289
- Oh, my. - Yes.

1077
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,750
Think about it. Other people could try to steal it.

1078
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,959
- I'll hold onto it. - You keep it.

1079
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's put it in the room.

1080
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:15,989
(Come here, Block Money.)

1081
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,929
Look at you, Money Man.

1082
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,599
Money Man.

1083
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,300
Hey, there's pork belly. It's for real.

1084
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,698
- Are you serious? - They said they'd grill meat.

1085
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,539
- There's the Beef Zone. - What's the Beef Zone?

1086
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:32,839
We'll grill meat here.

1087
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,479
For real? We'll grill meat here?

1088
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,279
I want to go to the Beef Zone.

1089
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,909
I want to go to the Meat Zone.

1090
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,449
The Beef Zone?

1091
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,078
- Hey. - What's that?

1092
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,618
- Here's what I think. - The loser might have to jump off.

1093
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,788
No. Here's what it is. I bet we have to call out...

1094
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:46,919
- someone you want to battle. - Wait.

1095
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,058
- You can hear everything. - "You come out."

1096
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,159
- "You come out." - We might lose.

1097
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,030
- I see. - We'll call them out?

1098
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,829
I really thought we would be grilling meat for real.

1099
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,800
Gosh, no. Beef could also mean "fight."

1100
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,129
It has the same spelling?

1101
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,538
- I see. Here? - Yes.

1102
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:03,670
(What will happen right here in the Beef Zone?)

1103
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,210
Did you go over there?

1104
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,380
- Hey, the door is open. Kyle. - Yes.

1105
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,679
(A mysterious space attracts the rappers' attention.)

1106
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,750
Kyle.

1107
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,380
(Choice Block)

1108
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:19,360
(The name plates of the rappers from each block fill the wall.)

1109
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,760
Gosh, what's all this?

1110
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,658
You know what? I'm getting a feeling...

1111
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,799
a lot of things will happen here.

1112
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,368
"I'll pick COCONA."

1113
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:31,800
Like this. I think we'll have to pick someone.

1114
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,000
It looks like we're in for a rough ride.

1115
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,510
This is the bar.

1116
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,138
- I see. - They've got Jack Daniel's here.

1117
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,678
- Gosh, what's this? - That's it.

1118
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,909
- Goodness. - It looks like a real bar.

1119
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,909
It's a real bar.

1120
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,579
Right. They put a lot of effort in the set.

1121
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,049
Oh, my.

1122
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,820
I knew it. Jack Daniel's and highballs.

1123
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,359
People will drink here,

1124
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,619
- and we'll get to watch them fight. - Right.

1125
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,690
- Right? - I bet we'll see that.

1126
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,030
People will act so drunk.

1127
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,730
What's in here?

1128
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,899
I see.

1129
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,429
(There's another space tucked away in the corner of the Village.)

1130
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,569
They want us to gather with other rappers and betray our own.

1131
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,169
(Lounge)

1132
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,939
We can bring rappers from another block...

1133
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,739
and have a meeting or something.

1134
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,078
All right, everyone. Let's gather around.

1135
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,049
- Yes. - Let's review the rules together.

1136
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,218
(The book lists all the rules the participants have to follow.)

1137
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,319
Sit down.

1138
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,090
All right, we must follow rules here.

1139
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,960
"We must comply with the guidance from the organizer."

1140
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,558
"The Block Money can only be used on the show."

1141
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,659
"Stealing the Block Money is prohibited."

1142
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,189
"You can only drink alcohol..."

1143
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,499
"during the designated times by the organizer."

1144
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,360
- I see. - "You can't drink excessively."

1145
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,230
- So... - That one...

1146
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,968
- He's trying to steal the money. - Who's that?

1147
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:42,609
Oh, my gosh.

1148
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,639
(A mysterious hand tries to steal Block 3's Block Money.)

1149
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,078
- It's Owen. - Let's catch the thief.

1150
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,110
I guess that won't work.

1151
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
- Gosh. - Let's catch the thief.

1152
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,579
Owen is already holding the alcohol bottle.

1153
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,888
(He ought to read the rulebook thoroughly.)

1154
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,589
(Meanwhile, the other rappers are reading the rulebook closely.)

1155
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,789
"Physical violence is prohibited."

1156
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,419
What's prohibited?"

1157
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,558
- Physical violence. - Violence.

1158
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,659
I see. Physical violence?

1159
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,590
Hey, it says you can drop out too.

1160
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,359
"If you wish to drop out, you need consent..."

1161
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,428
"from at least half of your block, yourself included."

1162
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:11,169
But what does that mean? "Drop out?"

1163
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,328
- It's like quitting. - "I'm done."

1164
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,638
"Darn it. It's too much. I can't do it."

1165
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,138
- "I'm done." - You can quit if you want.

1166
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:16,139
I see.

1167
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,880
"In this society, there are two types of matches."

1168
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,210
- "Block Matches." - Great.

1169
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,009
"It takes place once every two days."

1170
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,379
"It's a main rap event where a block goes up against another block."

1171
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,348
So if we lose the match, someone will get eliminated.

1172
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,749
- Okay. - But if we win,

1173
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,948
we'll win the Block Money.

1174
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,690
- All of us will survive. - All of us can survive.

1175
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,859
So someone could get eliminated. Gosh, it's hitting me now.

1176
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,058
- I'm getting nervous now. - Right.

1177
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,029
- There's the Beef Challenge. - What's that?

1178
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,359
"It's a secondary match,"

1179
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,699
"and everyone can participate freely whenever they want."

1180
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,599
"You can single out a rapper and release a diss track."

1181
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:49,038
"If the singled out rapper or block returns the diss track,"

1182
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,339
"the rappers..."

1183
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,909
"from the rest of the blocks will vote to determine the winner."

1184
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,509
Okay.

1185
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,079
Each block has a weakling.

1186
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,948
We can just pick those rappers and destroy them.

1187
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,819
I sort of ran the scenario in my head.

1188
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,618
As I was reading it, I understood what it meant to do.

1189
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,159
I thought it was going to be intense.

1190
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,959
By the way, JTONG has this crazy intense vibe.

1191
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,059
- Right? - I agree.

1192
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,459
He doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or anything.

1193
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,260
But when he talks, it's just so different.

1194
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:15,529
- "Right." - Oh, my.

1195
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,129
He's got bright, shiny eyes.

1196
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,799
I was next to him during the Infinite Cypher.

1197
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,469
So I saw him.

1198
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,539
He had his collar up like this.

1199
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,710
- Right. - Like this.

1200
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:27,440
He sat down alone and was reading the rulebook alone.

1201
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,279
"Which rapper should I destroy today?"

1202
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,380
That's how it looked.

1203
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,349
He reminds me of Dracula with his hair slicked down too.

1204
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,489
Gosh, there's a walkie-talkie too.

1205
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,929
Hey. Can you hear me?

1206
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,400
It was fascinating.

1207
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,500
I prefer the top bunk beds. Who here hates top bunk beds?

1208
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,799
- I hate it because I'm fat. - Then...

1209
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,500
- Let's pair up. I'll take the top. - Sure.

1210
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,169
- It's all yours. - Okay.

1211
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,769
It feels so open here. I like it here.

1212
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,280
I took the top bunk bed when I was growing up too.

1213
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,709
So it brought me old memories.

1214
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,679
All kinds of things crossed my mind.

1215
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,279
- The mirrors are here for a reason. - I'm curious.

1216
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,779
We can use the mirrors to keep each other in check.

1217
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,920
(The strategy board is reflected in the mirror.)

1218
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,590
I see. We can see it too.

1219
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,360
(To inspect the rest of the mirrors, skyminhyuk sets out.)

1220
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,999
The other blocks didn't write anything on the board yet.

1221
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,099
- Shall we erase ours? - Let's do that.

1222
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,038
- We can sort of remember this much. - Yes.

1223
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,368
But our board is more covered up than other boards.

1224
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,538
They have to come all the way here to look at ours.

1225
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:33,909
Our location is pretty good.

1226
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,349
- It's a great location. - We can see Block Three's board.

1227
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,980
- Right. - Look.

1228
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,719
Then they must be able to see us too.

1229
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:42,449
But they can't see our board.

1230
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,218
You know what I think? I bet for Block Five,

1231
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:48,859
the strategy might be "every man for himself."

1232
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,860
But JP is really smart.

1233
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,730
It seems whatever Khundi Panda is lacking, JP can cover him.

1234
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,530
So JP is really good at balancing out the block.

1235
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,499
On top of that, he's on cloud nine.

1236
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,038
He's excited...

1237
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,569
- after the Infinite Cypher. - Right.

1238
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,868
- Right. - I wanted to tell him to calm down,

1239
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,070
but I thought against it.

1240
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,480
I thought I shouldn't go out of my way to give advice.

1241
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:08,779
We've got to drop some lines. You know?

1242
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,578
It's been so long since we last dropped them.

1243
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,178
So I bet they'll get us out there...

1244
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,179
Gosh, you're such a rapper.

1245
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,618
(Impressed)

1246
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:16,448
- Right. - He said, "drop the lines."

1247
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:18,219
I thought you would want to drop the lines.

1248
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:19,960
I was talking about you.

1249
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,788
How should I put it? Personally,

1250
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,459
I like taking this management role like an owner of a club.

1251
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
- Great. - I do.

1252
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:27,329
- Club owners are usually rich. - I like this role.

1253
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,969
We just don't need Block Five to come against us.

1254
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:33,799
I don't think having a lot of people on our block will be an advantage.

1255
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,939
Instead of having two fillers,

1256
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,268
it's better to have a small block, but with impressive talents.

1257
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,839
If we don't lose, we won't get eliminated.

1258
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,808
I couldn't care less about getting eliminated.

1259
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,279
- I just hate losing. - Right.

1260
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,819
Getting eliminated first would be really miserable.

1261
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,979
- Right. - Miserable?

1262
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,919
I would be more furious than miserable.

1263
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,018
If I'm going to get eliminated,

1264
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,118
I'd rather get eliminated on my first day.

1265
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,259
All right. You all heard him, right? If we...

1266
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,518
If someone has to be eliminated?

1267
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,360
So we all know whom to vote for.

1268
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,229
But we're a strong block. They won't come after us.

1269
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,098
(Block 7)

1270
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:04,429
What's this?

1271
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
A list of potential matches?

1272
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:08,239
We can look at this to decide whom we'll battle against.

1273
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,369
Where are you, Marv?

1274
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,609
You look so handsome.

1275
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,840
Thank you.

1276
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,779
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1277
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,849
You're welcome.

1278
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,150
- He looks like a thief. - What on earth?

1279
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,880
He looks so scary.

1280
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:22,820
- Foggyatthebottom. You look scary. - Hey.

1281
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,189
I wanted to look cute, so I tied my hair on both sides.

1282
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,589
- Really? - Come on, now.

1283
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,288
Why do I look so fat in the picture?

1284
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,489
Gosh, you have a double chin.

1285
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,059
I have one too.

1286
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,198
But you were able to cover it up with your beard and hair.

1287
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:36,499
Right. That's the way to go.

1288
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,400
That's my secret.

1289
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,368
By the way, why did my picture come out like this?

1290
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,369
You look sick.

1291
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:43,769
I don't see yukon on the board.

1292
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,510
Where's yukon?

1293
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,139
It probably got mixed up.

1294
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,909
Where's yukon?

1295
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,849
Who's yukon?

1296
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,449
Darn it.

1297
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,289
Hey.

1298
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,388
I'll switch over to a different block.

1299
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:02,019
I'm sorry. I made a huge mistake.

1300
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,659
It's on the bottom.

1301
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,288
- Yes. - Come here.

1302
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,800
(Thanks to Loopy, yukon's picture is with the block now.)

1303
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,328
Someone must have taken it off to put him here.

1304
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:09,929
(When Block 2 was becoming one...)

1305
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,670
(Block 1)

1306
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,369
How are we going to survive?

1307
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,538
Gosh, let me be super honest.

1308
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,308
I had never been interested all my life...

1309
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,709
in making smart moves and getting in people's heads.

1310
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,209
- Same here. - We're the weakest.

1311
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,209
Right. In a way, we are.

1312
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,519
The young guys like JEFFERY WHITE...

1313
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,149
are really good at reading the games.

1314
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,920
So we have to choose the right ally.

1315
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,488
Did you study at Yonsei University?

1316
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:36,158
- What? Really? - Yes.

1317
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,229
That's impressive.

1318
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,558
What did you major in Yonsei University?

1319
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,629
My major was physical education. I used to be a swimmer.

1320
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,570
(Everyone is impressed by the unexpected background.)

1321
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,669
It's a bummer we can't use any physical violence here.

1322
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,239
Right. If we could, you could have totally done the butterfly stroke.

1323
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:49,808
- Like this. - That's it.

1324
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:51,969
You could've done the backstroke or the butterfly stroke.

1325
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,480
You could've ended them.

1326
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,509
Gosh, this is annoying.

1327
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,909
By the way, each block has a weakling.

1328
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,849
- Block Six has JOONIE. - Yes.

1329
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,219
Okay.

1330
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:05,618
I see a lot of weak ones in Block Eight.

1331
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,319
(gamma, Hippie Kunda, Drain K, Daniel Jikal, LEO...)

1332
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,360
Everyone.

1333
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:12,488
So people who didn't start out as rappers...

1334
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,699
BBULKUP and JOONIE.

1335
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,328
JOONIE...

1336
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,928
- She's in an idol group. - I see.

1337
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,729
Personally, she was the worst out of 60 rappers here.

1338
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,868
You know what I think?

1339
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:21,739
We have to consider the block, not just the rapper.

1340
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:24,468
Right. Let's say a rapper gets called out.

1341
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,738
There will be payback.

1342
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,209
"Did you come after JOONIE?"

1343
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,609
(Did you come after JOONIE?)

1344
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,678
"You come out."

1345
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:30,709
(I'll protect Block 6 no matter what.)

1346
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,650
(Block 6)

1347
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,820
Sir, DAMUNI is a bit scary.

1348
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,719
- DAMINI? - Why?

1349
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:45,159
(She wanted to get to know DAMINI.)

1350
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,329
I want to get to know her, but I don't know how to approach her.

1351
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,499
- You don't like her? - No, it's not that.

1352
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,570
Just slap her.

1353
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,139
What? Who are you talking about?

1354
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,308
DAMUNI is a bit scary.

1355
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,940
- Who? - DAMUNI.

1356
00:48:58,039 --> 00:48:59,110
Who is DAMUNI?

1357
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:00,479
- Are you talking about DAMINI? - DAMINI.

1358
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,738
- DAMINI. - It was scary.

1359
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,480
It was like a gang.

1360
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:06,820
I felt reassured, and I liked it.

1361
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,959
- Members of RAP: PUBLIC, - What is this?

1362
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,428
Please gather at the arena.

1363
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:19,190
- Okay. - Let's go.

1364
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,698
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1365
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:23,699
- Let's go. - Go.

1366
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,070
Let's get it.

1367
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:26,969
Arena.

1368
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,099
I'm curious. I want them to tell us quickly.

1369
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,469
I'm excited.

1370
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,210
I'm suddenly nervous.

1371
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,679
Members of RAP: PUBLIC,

1372
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,348
you have so far gone through the process of checking your weapons...

1373
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,788
and formed blocks, which are group units...

1374
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,489
in this society.

1375
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:49,118
From now on,

1376
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,829
you have the ultimate goal...

1377
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:53,229
of taking over RAP: PUBLIC...

1378
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,400
by competing with other blocks.

1379
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,429
Everyone came to win and get the prize money.

1380
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,840
We have to work for that.

1381
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,239
Before getting into the competition, there are two types...

1382
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,340
of matches in RAP: PUBLIC.

1383
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:07,610
Two types.

1384
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:10,449
First is the Block Match.

1385
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,480
Block Match.

1386
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,578
Block Matches are the main matches...

1387
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:16,750
in which blocks compete with each other.

1388
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,889
The block can earn Block Money...

1389
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:21,289
once they win in the Block Match.

1390
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,928
You can take the accumulated Block Money...

1391
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,360
as your prize money.

1392
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,929
It's team versus team, or block versus block.

1393
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,268
"This is how strong our team is."

1394
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:33,699
It's where you show off your main weapons.

1395
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,768
This is why we came here.

1396
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:39,469
Also, all the members of the block that won the match...

1397
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,110
will survive.

1398
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,379
The survival of all members will be the greatest benefit...

1399
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,579
that lets you maintain your block's power.

1400
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,019
We heard that there is a possibility that everyone can survive.

1401
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,819
I should do my best so no one gets eliminated.

1402
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,058
I should do things that I'm not good at as well.

1403
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:58,360
I would need to win no matter what in order to survive.

1404
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,099
The second type of match is called Beef Challenge.

1405
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,238
Beef Challenge is a sub-match...

1406
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:08,369
that anyone can participate in.

1407
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,308
In this match, you can take other block's Block Money...

1408
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:13,678
by dissing the block.

1409
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,578
In order to earn more Block Money,

1410
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,010
you must make use of Beef Challenge.

1411
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,149
Isn't this a fight club?

1412
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,150
You have to do it with the thought that you're crushing a loser.

1413
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,090
What was that?

1414
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,488
The rapper who took on the Beef Challenge...

1415
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,829
is this rapper.

1416
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,030
This is crazy.

1417
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,670
The rapper who was pointed out is this rapper.

1418
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,999
We were in second place before,

1419
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,698
so I thought blocks with less Block Money...

1420
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,638
would challenge us a lot.

1421
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:46,780
Isn't this a chance to get free Block Money?

1422
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,879
If the main match doesn't turn out well,

1423
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,049
I should earn some Block Money through the Beef Challenge.

1424
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,819
Only the last block that survives until the end...

1425
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,549
after the matches...

1426
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,190
will take the accumulated prize money and take over RAP: PUBLIC.

1427
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,388
Before starting the competition,

1428
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:07,130
there is an important rule of this society that you must know.

1429
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,799
The leader of a block always survives.

1430
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,939
However, if the majority of members agree,

1431
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,469
the leader can be replaced.

1432
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,809
What is this?

1433
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,650
- This was what it was. - It says "Replace Leader."

1434
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,010
It's on everyone.

1435
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,820
Goodness. We should use our brains a lot.

1436
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,078
Being a leader is always a benefit.

1437
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,089
You never get eliminated.

1438
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,788
- The ultimate shield. - You're not going home?

1439
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:33,089
Right. You won't get eliminated.

1440
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,259
Hold it tight.

1441
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,389
He won't get eliminated.

1442
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,529
Should we replace him?

1443
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,230
Okay. I'm ready.

1444
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,499
Block x's leader...

1445
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,230
- was replaced by x. - The leader was replaced?

1446
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,468
I don't know why we're replacing the leader.

1447
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:45,570
You don't? Didn't you want it?

1448
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:51,469
Also, the opportunity to recruit rappers from other blocks is open.

1449
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,178
No way.

1450
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:57,649
Rapper x of Block x was recruited to Block x.

1451
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,679
What?

1452
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,920
(Rapper x of Block x was recruited to Block x.)

1453
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,619
Rapper x of Block x was recruited to Block x.

1454
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,448
- Let's hurry. We don't have time. - We don't have time.

1455
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:06,420
- Let's go. - Let's just talk among ourselves.

1456
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,658
We have to do it now.

1457
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:08,659
We have two minutes left.

1458
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,889
As rappers move between blocks through recruitment,

1459
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,969
the power of the block will also change.

1460
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,440
We have to be very careful.

1461
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,569
When I heard "member recruitment,"

1462
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,439
I thought the hidden main event was revealed.

1463
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,609
So people who wanted to go to other blocks...

1464
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,610
will reveal their true intentions.

1465
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,448
Depending on how you use these rules,

1466
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:36,689
they can either strengthen the block...

1467
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,920
or cause a crisis.

1468
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:42,618
The fate of your block lies on your hands.

1469
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,658
If a crack is made...

1470
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:47,929
and that crack causes the crust to move,

1471
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,400
there will surely be an earthquake.

1472
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,369
The first Block Match will be revealed.

1473
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What is it?

1474
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,570
- It might have a grand name again. - It might.

1475
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,039
I can't imagine what it'll be.

1476
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:05,010
I felt nervous from then on.

1477
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,849
Let's go.

1478
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,789
The first Block Match...

1479
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,489
is Block Breaker.

1480
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:17,889
Block Breaker?

1481
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,860
What is that? Block Breaker?

1482
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,699
What do you break and how?

1483
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,000
Are we going to break down a house?

1484
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,599
In Block Breaker,

1485
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,598
each block will battle with another block...

1486
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,968
and pull down all the members...

1487
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:32,340
in that block.

1488
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,139
We have to defeat them all?

1489
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:36,309
- That would be hard. - Right.

1490
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:40,679
The rules of Block Breaker are as follows.

1491
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,650
In each round, each block...

1492
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,919
will send out one member...

1493
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,360
for a 1-on-1 rap battle.

1494
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,599
I thought it was a rap battle.

1495
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,799
The rapper that wins...

1496
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,839
can keep participating in more battles.

1497
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,569
The rapper that loses will be...

1498
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,239
immediately excluded from the match.

1499
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,479
Okay.

1500
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,779
That means, it is possible...

1501
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,509
for one rapper to wipe out...

1502
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,380
all the members of the opponent block.

1503
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,819
Nice. This is fun.

1504
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,288
Do you want to be the hero, Kyle?

1505
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,289
I do want that.

1506
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,559
We need to plan our strategy well.

1507
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,289
The order will be important.

1508
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:24,789
How do you decide who wins or loses?

1509
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,828
The block that wins or loses...

1510
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,599
will be determined by the votes of the other blocks.

1511
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:32,529
That's a relief.

1512
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,670
That's fair.

1513
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,670
When all the members of a block lose,

1514
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,710
the match ends.

1515
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,110
It's a game where our block has to destroy the other block.

1516
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,919
If things go bad, we might keep losing one after the other...

1517
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,980
like a domino.

1518
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,250
I could become a hero if it goes well.

1519
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,760
I'll go out alone and wipe them all.

1520
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,289
This will be really fun.

1521
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,529
I'll settle them all.

1522
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,558
- Okay. - What?

1523
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,630
I'll trust you.

1524
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:06,900
The Block Money you can earn...

1525
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,969
by winning in this Block Match...

1526
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:14,178
is 10,000 dollars.

1527
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,510
- Gosh. - Ten thousand dollars?

1528
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,079
That's a lot.

1529
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:19,249
We have to earn the Block Money. We have to.

1530
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,018
Earning the Block Money is also nice,

1531
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:23,819
but the best scenario would be to win...

1532
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,019
so that no one gets eliminated.

1533
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,988
This is how the matches will be arranged.

1534
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:31,289
The block that received the most votes...

1535
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,928
as the weakest block...

1536
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:36,530
will choose their opponent first.

1537
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,900
They have a benefit.

1538
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:41,269
Isn't it them?

1539
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,469
They're going to choose first.

1540
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:46,269
So I think Block Eight is going to choose first.

1541
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,779
Before the Block Match begins,

1542
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,249
each block should choose a block...

1543
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,719
they think is the weakest.

1544
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,989
Suddenly?

1545
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,460
The weakest?

1546
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,260
Which one is the weakest team?

1547
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,130
I think we know.

1548
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:14,739
If we think about it objectively...

1549
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:18,809
Shouldn't we discuss it?

1550
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,780
Isn't it decided?

1551
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,340
It can't be helped. You should drop out if you're weak.

1552
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,448
They didn't point us out directly,

1553
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:34,719
but I could totally feel it.

1554
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,860
We will begin pointing out the weakest block.

1555
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,829
We choose Block Eight.

1556
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,069
It's because they didn't leave a strong impression.

1557
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,598
We also chose Block Eight.

1558
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:50,209
I remember it as the block that lost first in Infinite Cypher.

1559
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,408
We chose Block Eight.

1560
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,808
We also chose Block Eight.

1561
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,209
We chose Block Eight.

1562
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,049
We chose Block Eight.

1563
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,549
We chose Block Eight.

1564
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,380
Putting all the missions aside,

1565
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,619
we chose them because they obviously looked weak.

1566
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:11,059
Kaogaii. Did he have to say that?

1567
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,659
He's so darn mean.

1568
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,929
Gosh, his character.

1569
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:19,630
Couldn't you have talked like other people?

1570
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:22,570
It was obvious.

1571
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,170
You also...

1572
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:26,839
If you had to choose,

1573
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,309
which block would you choose?

1574
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,550
Hold on.

1575
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,480
I'm embarrassed and annoyed.

1576
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,150
I was annoyed.

1577
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,760
I'm curious which block Block Eight will choose.

1578
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
What will it be?

1579
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:44,629
We chose Block Four.

1580
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,030
We chose Block Four.

1581
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:49,630
The second last block.

1582
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,170
We chose them because we thought it was doable.

1583
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,869
Darn.

1584
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,840
He said we're doable.

1585
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,409
I somehow knew they'd choose us.

1586
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:00,840
To the Beef Zone right away.

1587
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,179
I think Block Four would feel really insulted too.

1588
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:07,619
(What will be the result of Block Breaker?)

1589
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:10,888
Block Eight, which was chosen as the weakest block...

1590
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:12,920
by the majority of blocks,

1591
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:17,530
can choose your opposing block.

1592
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,230
Everyone pointed us out as the weakest block.

1593
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:22,629
It felt like saying, "Did you just say I was weak?"

1594
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,029
"Come on out."

1595
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,429
It didn't feel so bad.

1596
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,839
It would be us two.

1597
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,839
- Us. - It would be us.

1598
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,070
I can't hide my smile.

1599
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:34,010
No. You never know.

1600
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,380
Choose us.

1601
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:40,449
Block Eight chose us as the weakest block.

1602
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,618
It was done. I had a feeling...

1603
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:44,690
(I had a feeling that they would choose our block.)

1604
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,018
Block Four is having it easy.

1605
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:48,190
Block Four is having it easy.

1606
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,788
They should've chosen us.

1607
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:52,429
But it would've been so easy if Block Eight chose us.

1608
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,399
This is hard.

1609
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,459
I can't really decide,

1610
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,130
but I'm leaning toward choosing Block Six.

1611
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,300
Wait.

1612
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,809
In Block Six,

1613
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,908
Kaogaii is the leader,

1614
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:07,539
but he used up all his verses in Infinite Cypher.

1615
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:09,239
That block seems fine too.

1616
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,050
They also provoked us.

1617
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,009
(We chose them...)

1618
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,619
(because they looked weak.)

1619
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:22,118
I thought there was a high possibility that they would give...

1620
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,259
Block Eight the chance to choose their opponent first.

1621
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,428
So I thought I should annoy them...

1622
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:28,699
so they would choose us out of anger.

1623
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,199
Block Four, hands up.

1624
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,699
Please conclude your discussion, Block Eight.

1625
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:37,268
Block Six, hands.

1626
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:38,738
- I'm neutral. - Block Six, hands.

1627
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:41,539
Block Eight is discussing very seriously.

1628
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,238
- Right. - If it's us,

1629
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,150
they wouldn't be discussing like that.

1630
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,079
I hope they will choose us.

1631
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:53,650
Block Eight's leader, please point out your opponent block.

1632
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,420
Let it be us.

1633
01:00:57,289 --> 01:01:00,658
We chose Block Six.

1634
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:01,960
(We chose Block 6 as our opponent.)

1635
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:06,170
(Block 8 and Block 6 will have a match.)

1636
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:08,300
They're happy about it.

1637
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:11,710
Goodness.

1638
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,409
It worked.

1639
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,639
I was so thankful.

1640
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,909
We'll enjoy the 10,000 dollars. Thank you.

1641
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,949
- Darn. - Gosh.

1642
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,419
It would be legendary if Block Eight wins after this.

1643
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,719
Then Block Four will decide their opponent.

1644
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,989
Which block should we choose?

1645
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,230
Block Five.

1646
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,929
It's doable.

1647
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:35,360
But there's JP.

1648
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,730
This isn't about how many verses you have.

1649
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,070
Block Four is quite strong.

1650
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,469
No block is easy now.

1651
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,570
- Which do you think they'll choose? - Here.

1652
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,439
We'll choose Block Five.

1653
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,509
(Block 4 and Block 5 will have a match.)

1654
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,409
- What? - They're going the hard way.

1655
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,750
We won't lose. Good luck.

1656
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,079
It's so scary.

1657
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:56,819
We don't know how this will end.

1658
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,119
This would be interesting.

1659
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,619
Among the four blocks without opponents,

1660
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:06,360
the block with the least amount of Block Money...

1661
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,699
will start choosing the opponent.

1662
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,198
Then... Oh, it's not us.

1663
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,038
The block with the least amount of Block Money is Block One.

1664
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,570
Hey, we can do it.

1665
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,308
We're all the same rappers.

1666
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:20,510
- Darn. We have to win anyway. - Of course.

1667
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,109
They would choose us, right?

1668
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,579
- They would choose us. - Right.

1669
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,678
I'm curious.

1670
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:28,780
We'll choose Block Seven.

1671
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:31,319
(Block 1 and Block 7 will have a match.)

1672
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,249
I think we'll have to step on them.

1673
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,460
They bluff too much.

1674
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,989
We'll crush them all. Let's do this.

1675
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:47,000
- Fights are so fun to watch. - That's right.

1676
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:48,670
He cursed all of a sudden.

1677
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,670
We have two blocks left now.

1678
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,908
Block 2 and Block 3 will automatically have a match.

1679
01:02:58,909 --> 01:02:59,949
(Block 2 and Block 3 will automatically have a match.)

1680
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,150
That's the main match.

1681
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:04,519
That would be fun.

1682
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:08,260
The first Block Match,

1683
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:12,360
Block Breaker. All the matches have been arranged.

1684
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:17,670
In a moment, the first match where your survival in this society...

1685
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:19,969
is at stake will begin.

1686
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,239
(Block Breaker)

1687
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,849
(Block Breaker)

1688
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,518
They gave us such a mission?

1689
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,579
Goodness.

1690
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,989
But it really won't be easy.

1691
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,288
We're given one phone each.

1692
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,518
For the lyrics.

1693
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,859
- This isn't... - My goodness.

1694
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,530
(They start practicing for the first match.)

1695
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,429
(Block 1 versus Block 7)

1696
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,730
But Fleeky Bang...

1697
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:54,739
used up many verses last time.

1698
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,538
If either one of you has to go,

1699
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:59,840
- why don't we let him go? - That would be good for me.

1700
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,010
I think...

1701
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,979
- Fleeky Bang will come last. - Fleeky Bang will come last.

1702
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,079
I think the members would have told him to do so.

1703
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,280
To be considerate of him.

1704
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,988
(Block 4 versus Block 5)

1705
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:12,819
(Block 4)

1706
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,058
Hash Swan could go later.

1707
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,429
Mckdaddy could be in the middle.

1708
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:20,289
I could defeat JP...

1709
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,929
- and Luci Gang. - Why don't you get them all?

1710
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,229
Will you go last?

1711
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,099
Yes. I'll go last.

1712
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,969
Would they be weak?

1713
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:31,638
I'm not sure about the others except for Boi B.

1714
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:34,809
I honestly don't know if Boi B would be strong.

1715
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,308
I don't think he'd go with the beat.

1716
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:38,808
- He went overtone last time. - That's right.

1717
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:41,149
We'll defeat at least four.

1718
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,980
It's the three that are the problem.

1719
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,218
Who are the three? Boi B, SINCE, and PUNCHNELLO?

1720
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:47,760
- Yes. - That's right.

1721
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,719
- Who are you against? - Us?

1722
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,090
With the easy ones.

1723
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,129
I see.

1724
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,999
- We don't know about them. - Easy 10,000 dollars.

1725
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,030
We should see how it goes.

1726
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,198
We had our guard down.

1727
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:00,599
Why not? It was Block Eight.

1728
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:03,070
(Block 8 versus Block 6)

1729
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:06,110
When we play the 1st one, those who ticked number 1...

1730
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:09,209
- can quickly try it out. - That's a nice idea.

1731
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,979
We can choose the best one.

1732
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,749
Yes. One time, in my head, I said I wanted to go

1733
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,149
Looked down upon for being childish

1734
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,348
Shocked from

1735
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:18,618
Never make that feel like I'm fighting another war

1736
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:19,649
We don't stop

1737
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,288
Waiting, no worries because I can do it

1738
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,489
Isn't he recording this?

1739
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:28,058
Okay, fine.

1740
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,159
We don't mind.

1741
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:32,730
I think they'll get shocked if we go with our spirit.

1742
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,098
We have more experience. They don't have experience.

1743
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,439
- I don't know about Bizzy either. - He doesn't have more verses.

1744
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,369
Gamma isn't powerful on live stages.

1745
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:42,780
(Block 2 versus Block 3)

1746
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,649
If Loopy comes out first,

1747
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,249
we can go against that too.

1748
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,678
But if he comes out at the end, we can wait until he's out of verses...

1749
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:50,819
and let out someone who is good toward the end.

1750
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,618
If someone goes against Loopy and loses,

1751
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:55,719
I think people will continue with that flow.

1752
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,158
Saying, "That's Loopy, of course."

1753
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:58,589
That's true.

1754
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,590
It's okay. We can win.

1755
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,530
I'm not confident that I will lose.

1756
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,070
- For real. - Okay.

1757
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:08,669
- Can you be louder than this? - Yes.

1758
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,569
- It's a battle. - Right.

1759
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:14,038
So the voice matters.

1760
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,110
We have to be powerful.

1761
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,010
Your eyes.

1762
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:18,749
You should glare.

1763
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,908
In case you don't want it

1764
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,750
- I don't give a darn - Good.

1765
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,019
All leaders,

1766
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:31,658
please gather at the Choice Block...

1767
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:33,329
- at the arena. - I'll be back.

1768
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,730
See you.

1769
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,760
Let's do this.

1770
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,469
- We're going through here? - Yes.

1771
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:42,239
You're doing well, right?

1772
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,509
Pull it.

1773
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,639
(Choice Block)

1774
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,039
There will be something only leaders will do.

1775
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,079
What would it be? I can't tell.

1776
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,848
- Are we locked up? - What?

1777
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,149
Now,

1778
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,718
we begin the never-ending arm wrestle.

1779
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,749
- It's perfect. - Suddenly?

1780
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,788
It's perfect.

1781
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:02,059
What are we going to do?

1782
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,690
- What is that? - That's not right.

1783
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:12,069
- Choose the candidate? - That's not right.

1784
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,339
The member who will be eliminated if my block loses?

1785
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,170
- I never thought about this. - This is too much.

1786
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,570
This is why I didn't want to be a leader.

1787
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:22,538
I did guess this moment would come, but it really did.

1788
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,678
If the block loses,

1789
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:24,948
the person we decide...

1790
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:26,348
- gets eliminated? - We'll have a death match.

1791
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:28,078
We'll have a deathmatch.

1792
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,819
- It's not an immediate elimination. - It's not.

1793
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,618
Then we could choose a really strong one.

1794
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:32,848
(If you lose, the 3 candidates will participate in a deathmatch.)

1795
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,819
They're making us do something we hate the most.

1796
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,288
I would feel so sorry for that person.

1797
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:40,589
I knew there would be a time that we would play an evil role.

1798
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:41,630
Darn.

1799
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,468
(Please submit 3 candidates to the Choice Block within 30 minutes.)

1800
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:48,638
If we have 30 minutes, can we go out now?

1801
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:50,539
- Within 30 minutes? - Then,

1802
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,968
does it mean we can either discuss or decide by ourselves?

1803
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,009
I think it's up to us.

1804
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,139
(I think it's up to the leader.)

1805
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,379
It's here.

1806
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,250
We can't avoid it...

1807
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:00,920
since we're here in this village.

1808
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,149
Whether we could talk about this...

1809
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,820
or discuss with them were up to us.

1810
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:08,059
So I had so many thoughts.

1811
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,888
I knew this was coming.

1812
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:15,960
(The leaders return to their blocks.)

1813
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:17,568
So...

1814
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:18,600
(Block 1)

1815
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:21,140
- Why are you smiling? - You should all gather.

1816
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,439
What is it?

1817
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:25,840
- What's going on? - It's very...

1818
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,938
- It's very bad. - What is it?

1819
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,109
It's very bad?

1820
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,380
If we lose,

1821
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:33,550
the leader will have to choose...

1822
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,550
three people to be eliminated...

1823
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,020
within the next 30 minutes.

1824
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,619
- Three people? - Three people.

1825
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,318
The three will have a deathmatch.

1826
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,420
If they lose again, they should go home.

1827
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:45,889
I'm thinking of choosing...

1828
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,799
based on the verses you have...

1829
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,100
and the order.

1830
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,769
I also thought...

1831
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,339
about whether I should let those people know right now,

1832
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,569
but it will put a mental strain on them.

1833
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:58,210
I don't think it's good.

1834
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,739
So I'll just make a decision on my own.

1835
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,439
- Okay. - That's all I can say. Okay?

1836
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,909
Okay.

1837
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,419
If we win, we don't have to care about it anyway. It doesn't matter.

1838
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,449
That's why we should win.

1839
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,949
If we lose, three of us might be eliminated.

1840
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,720
Let's win no matter what.

1841
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,988
The three of them should have a deathmatch?

1842
01:09:16,989 --> 01:09:18,858
Yes. All three. But only when we lose.

1843
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:21,259
You should make a decision since you're the leader.

1844
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,198
- It's hard. - Actually,

1845
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,599
the leader doesn't get eliminated.

1846
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,029
You should take on that level of responsibility, at least.

1847
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,568
Let's win.

1848
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,938
- Let me think by myself first. - Follow your heart.

1849
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,439
You should practice for now.

1850
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:33,010
Follow your heart. It's okay.

1851
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:34,779
- You can do it. - You got this.

1852
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,909
What did you do?

1853
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:42,020
We just talked.

1854
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:44,420
We'll eat dinner first.

1855
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,519
- You don't look so happy. - Now...

1856
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,189
- Are you okay? - It's decided.

1857
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,119
They usually pick three.

1858
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,489
Honestly, I don't feel guilty at all.

1859
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:53,989
You've already decided, haven't you?

1860
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,670
Honestly, I know who I'll eliminate without hesitation.

1861
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:02,769
I thought I didn't need to tell my teammates about it.

1862
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:05,439
There's nothing to be gained by saying it.

1863
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:07,710
So I thought I shouldn't say it.

1864
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:10,539
KHAN.

1865
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,209
Come here.

1866
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,750
(Loopy, the leader of Block 2 quietly calls KHAN.)

1867
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:16,279
Let's take a seat here.

1868
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:19,819
The leader should choose three candidates to be eliminated.

1869
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,289
I already have them in my mind.

1870
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,960
But I'm not going to tell them in advance...

1871
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,829
because it might make them nervous.

1872
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,699
Loopy told me...

1873
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,969
that we should win no matter what it takes...

1874
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,840
for the candidates to be eliminated.

1875
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,038
I'm not going to be eliminated,

1876
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:41,608
so I'm going to rap on the beat...

1877
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:43,479
you're not confident in.

1878
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,710
I wrote my name to rap in the later part.

1879
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,050
- Okay. - Before the match,

1880
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:51,648
I thought the benefit of not being eliminated...

1881
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:53,590
is a huge gift.

1882
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,788
I thought I would produce the result worthy of the benefit...

1883
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:58,359
with my own hands.

1884
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,359
I didn't want to put them under pressure.

1885
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:03,130
That's what I thought.

1886
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:06,398
Can we talk for a moment?

1887
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:07,399
(Block 3)

1888
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,800
- Should we talk here? - Yes.

1889
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,108
If we lose,

1890
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:15,309
I should choose three candidates from our team to be eliminated.

1891
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,840
The three of them will have a deathmatch.

1892
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:19,078
I need to submit three names...

1893
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:21,379
in 30 minutes.

1894
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,179
- You should submit them beforehand? - Yes.

1895
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,750
Darn it. Beforehand?

1896
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:30,489
I started to get nervous for the first time hearing this.

1897
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:31,988
I also sweated for the first time there.

1898
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:33,028
Yes. I'm so nervous.

1899
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:34,188
But who would say,

1900
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,358
"Put my name on the list?"

1901
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:37,930
The fact that I should decide in advance is...

1902
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,470
HAON seemed to have many thoughts.

1903
01:11:45,109 --> 01:11:46,269
It was a little frustrating.

1904
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:47,909
I wish I could become a candidate.

1905
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,880
Please survive.

1906
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:57,220
Okay.

1907
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:00,789
As long as I'm in Block Four,

1908
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,619
I won't let any of us be eliminated.

1909
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,989
At the end of the day, what's important is to win.

1910
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:12,529
I want to make a situation where we will win no matter what.

1911
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:16,569
Let's practice individually and have a meeting. Okay?

1912
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:18,909
I'll try it.

1913
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,238
(Before the first Block Match, )

1914
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,850
(they're practicing everywhere in the Village.)

1915
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,449
Oh, my gosh.

1916
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,260
Members of RAP: PUBLIC.

1917
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:41,129
Soon, the first Block Match...

1918
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,560
- Let's go! - will begin shortly.

1919
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:46,100
Please come to the arena.

1920
01:12:46,899 --> 01:12:48,198
- Let's trust one another and go. - Okay.

1921
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:50,340
- In 1, 2, 3, we got this! - In 1, 2, 3, we got this!

1922
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:55,839
My legs are shaking.

1923
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,909
Let's go.

1924
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,579
There's nothing we can't do.

1925
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,319
I'm suddenly so nervous.

1926
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:05,949
Smile.

1927
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,590
We should smile.

1928
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,420
Am I shaking?

1929
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,819
I'm nervous now.

1930
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,329
Me too.

1931
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:22,170
The first Block Match...

1932
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,470
where your survival will be decided for the first time.

1933
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,270
Let's begin the Block Breaker.

1934
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:30,640
- We got this. - Yes!

1935
01:13:34,579 --> 01:13:36,449
We should really start the fight now.

1936
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,220
I'll keep fighting until I win.

1937
01:13:38,489 --> 01:13:39,489
We should win no matter what.

1938
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,319
Our team will win.

1939
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,060
Block 8 and Block 6...

1940
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,659
will proceed with a match.

1941
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,899
- Go to the stage. - Yes, sir.

1942
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:52,068
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1943
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:53,670
Good luck.

1944
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:57,569
(Block Breaker, Block 8 versus Block 6)

1945
01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,539
How many of your verses...

1946
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:03,680
fit the beat?

1947
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,210
- Me? I have 2. - Just 2?

1948
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:07,550
Out of 20?

1949
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:10,750
Yes. I can do them all, but I honestly don't want to do it.

1950
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:12,489
(I honestly don't want to do it.)

1951
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,589
I used many of my verses in the Infinite Cypher.

1952
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,089
So there's no reason for me to do that.

1953
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:20,460
The others can do it.

1954
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,800
I'm going to trust my teammates.

1955
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,068
I agree.

1956
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:27,270
Kaogaii...

1957
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,069
used a lot of his verses...

1958
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,810
and earned money, which makes me trust him more.

1959
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:34,739
Anyway, Kaogaii showed us something as the leader.

1960
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:37,909
So his words...

1961
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:39,179
still carry weight.

1962
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,649
Watching his cypher,

1963
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:45,519
I could tell he was determined to show something as the leader,

1964
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,090
which touched my heart.

1965
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,890
It made me think I could trust and follow him.

1966
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,689
You used many verses before...

1967
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:54,799
and did so well. So you can have a break this time.

1968
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,828
Anyway, each of us should rap...

1969
01:14:56,829 --> 01:14:58,068
at least twice.

1970
01:14:58,069 --> 01:14:59,329
So skip a turn and do it on the next turn.

1971
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,939
In Block Six in the Village,

1972
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,810
I can do whatever I want. They do whatever I tell them to do.

1973
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,038
It's going to be fun. It will go as I want.

1974
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:11,609
I thought about it.

1975
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,250
It's going to be very hectic during the battle.

1976
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:16,719
The first beat is very important.

1977
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,779
When it plays,

1978
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,049
if you think it's yours,

1979
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,390
grab the mic without hesitation.

1980
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,618
Rank the tracks you prepared for...

1981
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,890
and play beats in that order to crush your opponent over and over.

1982
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,930
The thought of losing to them?

1983
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,829
I had none of it.

1984
01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:31,670
Shall we start with number one...

1985
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:33,970
- and check the verses? - Is this the loudest?

1986
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,868
Just eight bars.

1987
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:38,868
Hey, why are you acting cool? Hey, why are you looking down?

1988
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:42,709
Hey, do I look like a loser just because I'm skinny, idiots?

1989
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,779
It goes well with the track.

1990
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,978
I don't know what to do with number two...

1991
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:48,350
No one will choose it.

1992
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,318
Cut it, my rap is fire

1993
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:54,149
I make money like it's my habit

1994
01:15:54,289 --> 01:15:55,390
- Okay. - Is it number two?

1995
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:59,858
Okay. I'll do number two.

1996
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:00,890
Number three.

1997
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:03,099
After "Show Me the Money" ended

1998
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,198
I came home completely drunk

1999
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,069
- How about number ten? - What do we do with this?

2000
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,398
Hey, man, it's hot, even if it gets hotter, I'm okay

2001
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,938
It's nice. I think you can rap while doing something like this.

2002
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:14,170
Don't act like that

2003
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,679
- It's good. - I double it

2004
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,840
- This one. What number is this? - Ten.

2005
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:19,380
- Number 10. - Number 10.

2006
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:21,079
He's so reliable.

2007
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,679
Geegooin...

2008
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,788
had many verses...

2009
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,189
that fit the beat.

2010
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:28,989
I'm confident in number seven.

2011
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:30,760
Wait. Am I doing number 11 then?

2012
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,028
I think it's better for you to do that.

2013
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:33,589
I can't do number 17.

2014
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,060
Hold on. Let me try it.

2015
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,300
Isn't it too many for you?

2016
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:38,430
Gosh, there's so much pressure.

2017
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,300
I think you should rap in the later part.

2018
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,038
Anyway,

2019
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:43,769
- I can rap on most of the tracks. - Right.

2020
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,569
Let's make the other team use up their verses...

2021
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,238
- before you go. - I'll go after that.

2022
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:48,810
That could be our plan.

2023
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:52,978
Geegooin was the most reliable.

2024
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:55,648
I can tell he has a lot of experience.

2025
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:56,979
He possesses extraordinary skills.

2026
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,750
I thought he would survive until the end with me.

2027
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:02,289
Can we talk just the two of us?

2028
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,590
In the lounge.

2029
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,059
I was going to plan it and move...

2030
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,930
by myself.

2031
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,969
But I thought I needed someone who could certainly help me.

2032
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,028
(Lounge)

2033
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:14,130
I went to the Choice Block.

2034
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:16,069
When we lose the battle,

2035
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:17,939
I should write the names of three candidates...

2036
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,710
to be eliminated and submit it in five minutes.

2037
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:22,238
I have these people in mind.

2038
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,939
JOONIE, Kohway, and KOALA.

2039
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,909
I have no choice.

2040
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:27,879
But they won't be eliminated right away. There's a deathmatch.

2041
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,920
But if you think about it,

2042
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:32,788
they could survive the deathmatch and come back.

2043
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:34,818
So I could choose Gwang Il or O'Domar.

2044
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:37,060
I thought it'd be better to discuss it just with you.

2045
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:39,060
- What are you doing? - I'll tell him.

2046
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:41,930
What are you doing?

2047
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,528
- What are you doing? - I'll let you know when I'm done.

2048
01:17:45,529 --> 01:17:46,770
- Okay. - I'll tell you later.

2049
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,369
I want only you to know.

2050
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,409
I'm quick-witted.

2051
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:56,438
I'm quick-witted, so when I found out...

2052
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:59,210
two important members were not around,

2053
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,319
I figured they would be somewhere else.

2054
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,420
I heard them talking.

2055
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:07,520
So I asked what they were talking about.

2056
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:09,689
I asked persistently.

2057
01:18:12,829 --> 01:18:13,959
- What were you talking about? - Sorry?

2058
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,029
What were you talking about?

2059
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,829
O'Domar asked me...

2060
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:19,869
what we were talking about.

2061
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,669
If I don't say anything,

2062
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,739
he will think I might abandon him someday.

2063
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,469
He might think this way.

2064
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:28,639
We have to write three elimination candidates for the deathmatch.

2065
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,779
So I wrote KOALA, Kohway, and JOONIE.

2066
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:34,879
He told me the names he wrote.

2067
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,919
But I couldn't trust him completely.

2068
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,649
The elimination candidate...

2069
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,619
I don't know who I'll write.

2070
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,459
I heard them practice and eavesdropped on them.

2071
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,429
- Block Eight? - Yes.

2072
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,929
(Earlier at the square)

2073
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:54,868
You can tell me you want to break free

2074
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:57,699
No answer is needed, There is no way

2075
01:18:57,939 --> 01:18:59,670
- Goodness. - Nice.

2076
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:03,609
I don't know who it was, but he was so bad.

2077
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:04,979
Was he bad?

2078
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,709
It was to the point...

2079
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:09,249
I wouldn't rap and just drop out.

2080
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,119
Gwang Il can beat five people easily.

2081
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,419
I hope that happens.

2082
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,789
Gwang Il can certainly do that.

2083
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,019
Block Eight is the team everyone thinks is the weakest.

2084
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,960
It'll be fun and worth a try.

2085
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,460
Goodbye.

2086
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:24,659
We are being looked down upon.

2087
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:28,300
(We chose them because they obviously looked weak.)

2088
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:31,569
Hearing it in my face wasn't pleasant at all.

2089
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:35,439
He criticized my team simply because I failed.

2090
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:38,680
(During the Infinite Cypher)

2091
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:40,880
Yes

2092
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:42,279
(This isn't going to work.)

2093
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:46,188
(gamma is dead.)

2094
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:49,019
It can't be helped. Our leader ranked bottom.

2095
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,420
I would've chosen our team as well.

2096
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:53,930
(During the Mask Off)

2097
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,658
Take off the losing rapper, Rapper Two's mask.

2098
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:58,000
(Drain K lost with 3 votes.)

2099
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,569
(Bizzy lost with 3 votes.)

2100
01:19:59,729 --> 01:20:01,369
(Churry lost with 4 votes.)

2101
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:02,699
(He's an SNU student.)

2102
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:04,739
(During the Block Formation)

2103
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:09,078
(LEO was the last one remaining out of the 60 rappers.)

2104
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:11,079
Come here. Let's go together.

2105
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:13,810
They're a bit weak, aren't they?

2106
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,850
Block Eight is just right to be beaten.

2107
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,920
What we've shown until now...

2108
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,188
was disappointing.

2109
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:23,259
Thinking about it like this is a bit annoying.

2110
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:26,390
But it's true our block is the weakest.

2111
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,198
Let's gather.

2112
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,658
We should talk and decide which beat to start,

2113
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,129
then practice right away.

2114
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,228
- Okay. - Focus on your stuff.

2115
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:36,299
Our strategy is to handle rappers who do a lot of verses...

2116
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,640
when they suddenly step up.

2117
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,538
After breaking all my limbs

2118
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:42,839
Stretch or cut two legs, cut it to my taste

2119
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,238
It's not a fake format

2120
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,778
- This is a killer. - Anyone else on the third beat?

2121
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:47,109
- No. - Okay, next.

2122
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,948
I can't think of many verses no matter what.

2123
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:52,049
- Who took the third beat? - I did.

2124
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,549
Do you have one? Try it.

2125
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,920
Tell me objectively, okay?

2126
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,788
I'm an eight-ton truck with a broken steering wheel

2127
01:20:57,789 --> 01:20:59,858
Plus a train only racing forward with a broken brake

2128
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:01,629
Our situation is completely different

2129
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,560
Players only, and the players enter

2130
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:07,099
- I think Hippie Kunda's is better. - Okay.

2131
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,269
- Okay. Decide quickly. - Then...

2132
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,699
- Okay. - I deleted my lyrics.

2133
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,810
Did someone prepare for the second beat?

2134
01:21:12,109 --> 01:21:13,509
I did.

2135
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:15,978
- What about the fourth beat? - The fourth beat?

2136
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:17,238
I can do the eighth beat too.

2137
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,709
Remember clearly where we started from

2138
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:20,879
Look around

2139
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,648
- Those eliminated are the legends - Unbelievable.

2140
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:24,849
They rely on me at the end of the road

2141
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:25,948
It's a perfect match with the beat.

2142
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:27,948
You can beat four at the least.

2143
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:31,259
There are so many nasty beats Hippie Kunda can do.

2144
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,729
Hippie Kunda should take all the beats.

2145
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:36,059
Hippie Kunda wrote verses...

2146
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,429
that were good matches to the beats.

2147
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:40,199
Hippie Kunda had many verses.

2148
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:42,500
She'll probably carry the team.

2149
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:44,939
The leaders of all blocks,

2150
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,809
I'll take the 17th and 19th beats.

2151
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:49,180
Please gather at the Choice Block.

2152
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:51,010
This seems doable.

2153
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:54,510
(Choice Block)

2154
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,749
- What? - This is so wrong.

2155
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,889
We pick elimination candidates from our team if we lose?

2156
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,760
This is going too far.

2157
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:04,589
(After the announcement, gamma returns.)

2158
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,259
It's my time now, what do you think?

2159
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,658
Listen to my sound, and what now?

2160
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:10,158
- Keep looking at me - Does everyone have a verse?

2161
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,198
- First off... - I'm ready, send in the weapon

2162
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:14,698
I couldn't decide whether...

2163
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:16,270
to tell them or not.

2164
01:22:16,539 --> 01:22:18,538
All your verses are amazing, Daniel.

2165
01:22:18,539 --> 01:22:19,639
- Nice. - They are crazy good.

2166
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,709
No.

2167
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:22,809
Daniel Jikal can do a lot of verses.

2168
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:25,180
He made ones for the beats we didn't choose.

2169
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,948
Why did they gather you?

2170
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:28,420
(Why did they gather you?)

2171
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:30,880
Well...

2172
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,318
It's important to know why they gathered the leaders.

2173
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:37,688
He's right. What was the reason?

2174
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:39,430
(Sighing)

2175
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:42,130
Did you choose elimination candidates for when we lose?

2176
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:47,129
Yes. I wasn't sure if I should tell you or not.

2177
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,938
We need to choose elimination candidates.

2178
01:22:48,939 --> 01:22:51,038
- I see. - Oh, darn.

2179
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:52,738
It's three people, but here's what's important.

2180
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,769
Win, and nobody will get eliminated.

2181
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,038
- We just have to win. - I get it.

2182
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,549
I understand.

2183
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:01,408
Gamma lost a bit of my trust right then.

2184
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,250
His leadership was...

2185
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:04,920
quite disappointing.

2186
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,130
I'll be back from a smoke break.

2187
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:16,198
In the worst-case scenario, if all of our team members lose,

2188
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:20,130
I'll choose the candidates who can do better in the next mission...

2189
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,369
as the standard.

2190
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,799
I'm anxious.

2191
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,609
But let's do our best.

2192
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,210
I want to prove myself in this mission.

2193
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,408
Copy my talent

2194
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:34,478
It'll be great to paint a picture of turning the tables...

2195
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,649
with our underdog aspects.

2196
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,849
Block 8 and Block 6...

2197
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:41,149
will proceed with a match.

2198
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,419
(Block Breaker: Block 8 versus Block 6)

2199
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,489
Gosh.

2200
01:23:44,989 --> 01:23:46,788
- Goodness. - Yes.

2201
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:48,259
- The called blocks, - Let's go.

2202
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,430
- please come up to the stage. - Okay.

2203
01:23:50,729 --> 01:23:51,729
Let's go.

2204
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,329
- Let's go. - Good luck.

2205
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,500
You were happy earlier, right?

2206
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:00,270
Let's see your faces ten minutes later.

2207
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,179
- How feisty. - Ten minutes later!

2208
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,408
- Ten minutes later! - Ten minutes later!

2209
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:08,078
- Ten minutes later! - Just one ten minutes

2210
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:11,279
It doesn't take ten minutes to end losers.

2211
01:24:13,789 --> 01:24:16,459
- He's acting cool. - Kaogaii is funny.

2212
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,488
This will be interesting.

2213
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:18,560
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2214
01:24:19,989 --> 01:24:22,199
- Eight! - Eight!

2215
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,869
This will be bloody. I'm excited.

2216
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,868
Block Eight will get beaten badly.

2217
01:24:28,869 --> 01:24:30,438
They're the weakest of the bunch.

2218
01:24:30,439 --> 01:24:32,869
I think Block Six will win easily.

2219
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:41,778
The Block Match between Block 8 and Block 6 will begin.

2220
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:43,318
- Yes. - Yes.

2221
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:46,519
- Let's go. - Yes.

2222
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,689
This will be fun.

2223
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,818
Who'll go first? I'm curious.

2224
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:51,589
The first will be a race.

2225
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:52,659
Ready.

2226
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:54,159
Here they go.

2227
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,960
- Right away. - I'm getting nervous.

2228
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:57,930
- Start. - Let's go.

2229
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:01,130
Let's go.

2230
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,970
Let's go.

2231
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,438
Yes, Hippie Kunda.

2232
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,578
- How cool. - That was courageous.

2233
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:10,608
Hey

2234
01:25:10,609 --> 01:25:13,349
- Hey - Hey

2235
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,279
- Hey - I'll go.

2236
01:25:15,649 --> 01:25:17,049
Procrustes' bed

2237
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,849
I'm tied up on this banister

2238
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,719
After breaking all my limbs

2239
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,089
Stretch or cut two legs, cut it to my taste

2240
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,259
Press, but I don't hesitate

2241
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,288
- We'll win. - A collar is useless

2242
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:26,289
Born a hunting dog

2243
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,959
Bark like one and fight back

2244
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,499
So don't you worry one bit

2245
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,828
Dog player like that

2246
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:34,068
- Don't lose it my pace, I'm fine - Beat her.

2247
01:25:34,069 --> 01:25:35,769
Okay, that's what I say

2248
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,269
But why are you all impatient?

2249
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,299
Dominated by doubt

2250
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,438
- Always having a flat tension - Her tone isn't in sync.

2251
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:41,238
The eyes before me tire me out, so what?

2252
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:43,309
Even if I turn my back on fighting early on

2253
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,978
- I swing the knife if given - She can do better.

2254
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:47,049
Not wanting my team behind my back to see my expression

2255
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,879
It's the ugliest side of things

2256
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,880
It disarmed

2257
01:25:49,881 --> 01:25:51,219
- My last bastion, go on - She's tired.

2258
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,149
I'm actually having a lot of fun

2259
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:56,289
- Yes. - Yes.

2260
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,129
- Let's go. - Here he comes.

2261
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:00,488
- Hey. - Let's go.

2262
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,028
- Here he comes. - Hey.

2263
01:26:02,029 --> 01:26:04,828
- Jo Gwang Il. - Let's go.

2264
01:26:04,829 --> 01:26:07,169
- It's already fun. - How fast will you be?

2265
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:08,669
- Yes - Get them.

2266
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,738
Different from those guys

2267
01:26:09,739 --> 01:26:11,599
I only used the cheat key called skills

2268
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,139
This time last year, Jo Gwang Il got edited out

2269
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,938
I was amazing at creating myself

2270
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:16,009
So all those who followed me

2271
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,339
- Nodded - His sound is different.

2272
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,709
I invested everything into my tongue with just the potential

2273
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,608
Without money and greed for money

2274
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:22,219
I bark like a dog until the owner called rap comes

2275
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,519
It eventually came, and I left after swallowing the dog

2276
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,089
Relax, shut it, beat anything that comes

2277
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:28,019
My tongue is a plunger unclogging the clogged-up match

2278
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,688
Come at me if I'm an eyesore and you're discontent

2279
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:31,719
The rule is simple, so let's battle it out without your popularity

2280
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,658
Walk that long distance, whatever you do

2281
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:35,358
I'm on a roll, and it'll only get better

2282
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:37,259
Paddle and enjoy scuba, I don't need the money rolling in

2283
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,228
Dispose of the money except for what I need for a pack of Marlboro Gold

2284
01:26:39,229 --> 01:26:40,828
- The bloody war is over - He's extraordinary.

2285
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,599
The honor I mentioned is the debt I need to be paid now

2286
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,339
The doubters who called me a fool, gather around

2287
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,909
The drinks will be on me this time, I'm feeling raw right now

2288
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,108
You killed it.

2289
01:26:51,109 --> 01:26:52,849
He's not an easy opponent.

2290
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,879
It'll be unanimous.

2291
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,078
It was incredibly fast.

2292
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:58,319
He was intense from the start.

2293
01:26:58,689 --> 01:27:00,749
(The voting begins.)

2294
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,720
- Vote. - I'm done.

2295
01:27:03,989 --> 01:27:06,359
- It's obvious. - Let's go.

2296
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,028
(The voting is closed.)

2297
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:09,500
- Okay. - Please.

2298
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,270
The result of the vote will be revealed.

2299
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:16,970
The strongest rapper from Block Six stepped out from the start.

2300
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:21,408
This is nerve-racking.

2301
01:27:21,409 --> 01:27:22,778
I know, right? I'm anxious.

2302
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,108
If Block Eight loses again,

2303
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:27,350
the whole team could go down.

2304
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,778
(Block Breaker)

2305
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:31,149
It's 8 to 7.

2306
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,449
Block Six has one less rapper.

2307
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,358
(Block 8, Block 6)

2308
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:39,589
Okay. The names aren't popping up.

2309
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,129
Like this?

2310
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,529
So this is how the result is revealed.

2311
01:27:47,369 --> 01:27:49,538
- Goodness. - Gosh.

2312
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:52,770
- Nice. - Nice.

2313
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:54,038
Thank you.

2314
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:55,938
- Jo Gwang Il. - Good.

2315
01:27:55,939 --> 01:27:57,009
Thanks for your efforts.

2316
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,210
You went through a lot.

2317
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,350
Rip it off!

2318
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:00,750
It's all right.

2319
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,948
Good work. Yes!

2320
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:04,420
He's a gentleman.

2321
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:05,889
Yes! Jo Gwang Il!

2322
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,649
(Block Breaker)

2323
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,460
He's cool.

2324
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:12,629
- I think I was too rushed. - No, but...

2325
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,858
you didn't lose because you were bad.

2326
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:15,529
They started with their best candidate.

2327
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,299
It was the opposite of what I said.

2328
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,028
I thought Hippie Kunda would beat everyone.

2329
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:20,029
But she lost immediately.

2330
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:21,770
Don't you think Jo Gwang Il will beat everyone?

2331
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,409
He's so reliable.

2332
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:26,640
Seriously.

2333
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:28,569
Maybe I won't need to rap.

2334
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:31,309
- You should prepare to. - Okay.

2335
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:33,309
For how long are you going to freeload?

2336
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:36,520
Okay. I feel bad being a freeload. I practiced too.

2337
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,449
It's fun to watch.

2338
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:40,289
Right? I don't want to battle.

2339
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,189
But this is crazy. It's amazing.

2340
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,359
It's unbelievable. He's so smart.

2341
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:46,960
- It's amazing. - How did he...

2342
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,630
Please play beat number 1.

2343
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:52,270
- Please play beat number 1. - I'll go.

2344
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:53,829
Okay, Drain K.

2345
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:55,569
Be confident.

2346
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,999
- Gwang Il, let's go. - Let's go!

2347
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,939
- Hey, go! - Hey.

2348
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,778
Nibbling at my feet with their tongues, like doctor fish

2349
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:05,478
They're living off the crumbs of my success

2350
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:07,009
Yes, that's what you call me, I'm Chopper

2351
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:08,648
Hashtag bubbles and fizz all at once

2352
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:10,679
I'm different from them desperately trying to boil

2353
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,419
I study again and again, My rap itself is too good

2354
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,948
Character and comedy are taking over more than rap these days

2355
01:29:13,949 --> 01:29:15,719
That sleek body has become the talk of the town once again

2356
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,618
I'm the waxing shop to reveal those rumors

2357
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:19,828
- This is good. - What you need to do is

2358
01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:22,198
Put them in a fish farm and eat the bastards

2359
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:24,100
You don't like it because they're too difficult, and the accent?

2360
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:27,198
Rapping that's out of trend, Shouting Arirang

2361
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,100
If you stay calm and keep the beat, it'll be okay.

2362
01:29:29,869 --> 01:29:33,209
"BJ's on the Scene" will interview you if they exist, right?

2363
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,810
The doctor fish are waiting for me to put my feet in as there's no food

2364
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,649
Take revenge for your team.

2365
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,279
Revenge Round!

2366
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:51,188
Tighten the belt like when doing back-to-back

2367
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:53,059
I wait in the back and when my turn comes

2368
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,629
I pray to take them all down, No mercy like Batman

2369
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:58,158
I became captivated by the rap I heard in my dad's car

2370
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,799
I'm rapping now, All the embarrassing moments

2371
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,568
Have become my foundation

2372
01:30:01,569 --> 01:30:02,799
And here I stand today proudly

2373
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,599
The ambiguous past has been settled

2374
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,169
Now it's time to receive my pay

2375
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:08,408
Can't match my worth with a mediocre amount

2376
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:10,139
I'll take a little bit of fame and money

2377
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,579
Hippie rides with it, get, set, money, go

2378
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:15,520
Put cash in my pockets like a working holiday

2379
01:30:15,779 --> 01:30:17,549
You're not a rapper, You're a singer

2380
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,249
If you want to do hip-hop, watch us carefully

2381
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,049
Trap boom bap, both show up

2382
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,589
If you're scared, just pour some drinks

2383
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:23,618
Our first rule

2384
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:25,959
Take everyone down from Block Six

2385
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,800
Our second rule is to say goodbye after taking them down

2386
01:30:28,859 --> 01:30:29,929
(Goodbye.)

2387
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:32,170
- Goodbye! - Bye!

2388
01:30:34,569 --> 01:30:36,699
- He's angry. - He's so good.

2389
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,399
It's nice.

2390
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:42,180
- He's cool! - He did well.

2391
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:44,880
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh!

2392
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,380
Did we lose?

2393
01:30:46,449 --> 01:30:48,609
I'm getting fiery. I'm angry.

2394
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,449
(The voting begins.)

2395
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,719
It's hard to predict the result.

2396
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,750
He's very angry.

2397
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:57,089
He did great without being discouraged.

2398
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:58,090
He's amazing.

2399
01:30:58,091 --> 01:30:59,929
He chose the beat.

2400
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:01,329
But he lost control.

2401
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:03,959
Rap is all about the energy. It feels like we lost.

2402
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,960
Yes, I agree.

2403
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,100
(The voting is closed.)

2404
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,170
The result of the voting will be revealed.

2405
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:18,279
One vote?

2406
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,020
(Drain K wins with 44 votes, and Jo Gwang Il loses with 1 vote.)

2407
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:25,589
(Drain K of Block 8 wins.)

2408
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:27,189
Yes, sir.

2409
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:30,318
Hey, 99' Nasty Kidz we never die.

2410
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,960
We never die!

2411
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,130
- May I touch you? - Yes.

2412
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:42,899
(Jo Gwang Il is eliminated.)

2413
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:44,300
He's so sexy.

2414
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:46,140
That was cool.

2415
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,209
This was honestly heartwarming.

2416
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:49,810
He took revenge for his team.

2417
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,109
He's so cool.

2418
01:31:53,449 --> 01:31:54,750
- You did well. - Good job.

2419
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:56,549
- Thanks for your efforts. - Thanks for your efforts.

2420
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,149
- I'm sorry. - You did well.

2421
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:02,149
- You did well. - This is all about energy.

2422
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,318
- It's like a penalty shootout. - It's amazing.

2423
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:05,390
It's so fun.

2424
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:07,890
DJ, drop that beat right now.

2425
01:32:10,029 --> 01:32:11,659
What's with this man?

2426
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,930
He's now confident.

2427
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,470
Let's go!

2428
01:32:20,109 --> 01:32:21,408
I tell them to ruin all your business

2429
01:32:21,409 --> 01:32:24,039
Everyone's the same, The expected value is all billions

2430
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:27,278
Capping, At least I don't borrow raps

2431
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:28,849
I'm fed up with their tongues

2432
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:30,449
They got pricked by their own tongue

2433
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:32,448
Nuol said we're all going to change

2434
01:32:32,449 --> 01:32:34,019
Watch the following year

2435
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,459
They'll be at this level, and we'll leave at this level

2436
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,089
I'm an anorexia patient, so I can't be measured

2437
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,528
Instead of worrying about others, take care of my own family

2438
01:32:39,529 --> 01:32:40,859
- Who's going to volunteer? - Who's going on the stage?

2439
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:42,158
- Are you going? - No matter how much I earn

2440
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,259
I won't abandon my friends for success

2441
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:44,629
You've faded completely

2442
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,828
The beginning and the end are important

2443
01:32:45,829 --> 01:32:46,999
- Go and rap on his face. - Fight of taking and being taken

2444
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,728
I survive at a place like a jungle

2445
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,569
Get more and save more in my bank account

2446
01:32:50,939 --> 01:32:52,670
Lift up the me of tomorrow

2447
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:56,079
Darn it. Why is he so good at this?

2448
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:58,180
He's coming.

2449
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:00,680
- You can do it! - Yes!

2450
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:03,750
- O'Domar. - I'm curious.

2451
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:05,649
O'Domar, let's go.

2452
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,349
These days, trends change so quickly

2453
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:09,259
They change almost every day, When discussing the elimination

2454
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,818
Of players or when they need to find excuses for themselves

2455
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:14,389
People blame consumer habits

2456
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:16,358
I, too, was once no different from them

2457
01:33:16,359 --> 01:33:18,499
My position in the field in pursuit of the essence, is glory

2458
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,569
As much as the era has changed

2459
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:24,239
- Oh, no. - Rap check

2460
01:33:24,539 --> 01:33:26,670
- We won. - It is a sin for us

2461
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:30,140
- That's too bad. - Oh, no.

2462
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,510
Darn it. We messed it up.

2463
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,380
Darn it. What should we do?

2464
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:38,649
- He was stable at first. - Too bad.

2465
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:40,649
What should he do?

2466
01:33:40,819 --> 01:33:42,149
(The voting begins.)

2467
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,519
He'll win again.

2468
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,389
Block Eight is leading their way.

2469
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:46,560
This is unexpected.

2470
01:33:48,659 --> 01:33:50,560
He won two battles?

2471
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:52,159
I think O'Domar did well too.

2472
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,430
Too bad for O'Domar.

2473
01:33:53,529 --> 01:33:54,599
It's okay.

2474
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,899
We still have five rappers.

2475
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:58,868
Anyone who messes with 99' Nasty Kidz, will be...

2476
01:33:58,869 --> 01:34:01,469
- taken down. - He's doing what he said.

2477
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,809
If Block 6 loses, they'll be embarrassed.

2478
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:04,810
If he didn't make a mistake...

2479
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,550
(The voting is closed.)

2480
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:16,118
(Drain K wins with 39 votes, and O'Domar loses with 6 votes.)

2481
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:17,658
(Drain K of Block 8 wins.)

2482
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:21,260
- Block 8! - Let's go, Block 8!

2483
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:24,199
What's going on with Block 8?

2484
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:25,560
He won twice. This is amazing.

2485
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:28,569
If he's won against two people, he's really performing well.

2486
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:30,469
Our energy is so strong.

2487
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:31,739
I think we can win this.

2488
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:33,140
My goodness.

2489
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:35,509
- It's okay. - You did well.

2490
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:37,079
- Put your head up! - Put your head up!

2491
01:34:37,109 --> 01:34:38,680
- You did well! - This happens sometimes.

2492
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:40,210
It's unpredictable.

2493
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,279
The uprising of the underdog.

2494
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,750
It's dangerous for them. They lost two players.

2495
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:46,250
His energy is thriving.

2496
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:48,619
But it'll end here. I'm bored.

2497
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:50,390
Don't worry. We didn't lose yet.

2498
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:53,930
Beat 15, drop the beat.

2499
01:34:57,229 --> 01:35:00,199
- Whose beat is this? - It was Gwang Il's.

2500
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,769
- Shall I go? - Wait.

2501
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:09,639
Witch I ride up, She told me I'm so fire

2502
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,879
I don't do anything uncool

2503
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,079
I load something really hot on my tongue

2504
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:17,749
Cowards, I go up high without pills

2505
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,448
I just want to see your college

2506
01:35:19,449 --> 01:35:21,488
- If that really helps - I'm already bored.

2507
01:35:21,489 --> 01:35:23,288
Mess your personal policy

2508
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:25,389
Is speaking fast all that matters? Think about it

2509
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:27,228
It's not a TikTok challenge

2510
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:29,028
- We walk again - Shall I go?

2511
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:30,129
Okay. You can go.

2512
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:32,469
The arsonist, Double 9 burn it up

2513
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:34,769
Need 911, call 911

2514
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,569
Call 911

2515
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,270
I think he used all his lives.

2516
01:35:41,539 --> 01:35:42,909
This is hard.

2517
01:35:42,939 --> 01:35:44,239
Block Six can beat that.

2518
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,590
She's coming out with great energy.

2519
01:35:56,359 --> 01:35:58,060
Why is it JOONIE? Did she volunteer?

2520
01:35:58,289 --> 01:35:59,930
- I don't know. JOONIE. - Hit him with your rap!

2521
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,659
Let's go!

2522
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:04,759
- I don't think she can beat this. - Yes.

2523
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:08,028
Gone sipping we ain't tripping just going to whip it up in here

2524
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:11,068
Go tell your friends 2024 is going to be my year

2525
01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:12,368
- Good. - It's enough

2526
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:14,509
Just with my mom's nagging

2527
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:17,809
My existence alone is more than enough for you

2528
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:21,108
You'll probably laugh at me, asking who I am but let me tell you this

2529
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:22,519
- Like someone else - She's good.

2530
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,778
No matter how much you try to hide, it's all within my palm

2531
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:25,850
She's good.

2532
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:27,589
My room is dirty but my personality is clean

2533
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,289
I'm always satisfied

2534
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,989
Did she mess it up? It seems so, right?

2535
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:37,728
You don't even need this witch rap

2536
01:36:37,729 --> 01:36:38,959
Who the heck are you?

2537
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,669
You don't even need this witch rap

2538
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,869
Who the heck are you?

2539
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,869
- Block Eight? - "Who the heck are you?"

2540
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,538
Gone sipping, we ain't tripping just going to whip it up in here

2541
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:49,309
- Is it freestyle? - You don't even need this rap

2542
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:51,038
In all the fears

2543
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:52,609
Super, who the heck are you?

2544
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,210
Get the heck out of here

2545
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:57,949
Stop now. Yes. Okay.

2546
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:01,250
- He's angry. - You did well.

2547
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:02,619
She's strong.

2548
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:05,019
I'm sorry.

2549
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,760
What? She acts polite all of a sudden.

2550
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:09,500
She swore so many times and became polite in the end.

2551
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:12,130
(The voting begins.)

2552
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,129
- Who should I choose? - It's iffy.

2553
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:16,038
Drain K's performance was good, and he didn't mess anything up.

2554
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:17,839
- Triple kill? - In my point of view,

2555
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,898
she might win this.

2556
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,010
You go, girl.

2557
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:21,710
No one can tell.

2558
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,510
The result of the vote will be revealed.

2559
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:25,079
How will it turn out?

2560
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:26,510
Oh, my goodness.

2561
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:32,319
She was energetic.

2562
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:34,890
Let's go!

2563
01:37:37,789 --> 01:37:40,430
(Drain K wins with 33 votes, and JOONIE loses with 12 votes.)

2564
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:46,470
- Drain K. - I got it.

2565
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,199
It's okay.

2566
01:37:49,569 --> 01:37:51,799
She did well. She was doing great.

2567
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,310
- She had the courage. - Yes.

2568
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:55,170
I think she was awesome.

2569
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:57,738
(JOONIE is eliminated.)

2570
01:37:57,739 --> 01:37:59,778
- Gosh, it's a triple kill. - Triple kill.

2571
01:37:59,779 --> 01:38:01,679
Go, quadra kill. Let's do penta kill.

2572
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,880
Do whatever you want.

2573
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:05,849
- He has the momentum. - Yes.

2574
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,118
His performance has started.

2575
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,319
- No one can stop him. - Yes.

2576
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,959
No, but Block Six can't lose here.

2577
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,729
- Look who is left. - Exactly.

2578
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:14,658
They're all strong people.

2579
01:38:14,659 --> 01:38:16,198
Yes, all four of them are professionals.

2580
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:18,358
But who else in Block Eight can rap like them?

2581
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:20,829
- Kohway, are you going out? - I'll go if the BPM is about right.

2582
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:23,038
What I find disappointing is...

2583
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:24,839
when he's acting like that,

2584
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,608
you just need to go for it.

2585
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,470
But we just go on stage and rap.

2586
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:30,140
Then nothing will work out.

2587
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:32,709
- Beat number 16. - Okay. This is it.

2588
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:33,850
Let's go.

2589
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:39,850
- Don't be too excited. - Yes, I'll calm down.

2590
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:43,358
That jerk is doomed.

2591
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:44,688
You talk too much, nobody my coach

2592
01:38:44,689 --> 01:38:47,028
Can tell them all face-to-face, That's not even a punch

2593
01:38:47,029 --> 01:38:48,728
An idiotic squad, trying to keep struggling

2594
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:50,929
- Whatever I don't approach - Why is he so good in every beat?

2595
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:52,698
Harry, you take a goofy ridiculous trophy

2596
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:54,368
Ceiling is my only comfy eye spot

2597
01:38:54,369 --> 01:38:55,999
- All his raps are the same. - Ceiling is my only comfy eye spot

2598
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,339
- Spot! - Spot!

2599
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:58,340
Without the lady

2600
01:38:58,341 --> 01:38:59,639
You all already know our team's chemistry

2601
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,368
But we never do marry

2602
01:39:01,369 --> 01:39:02,639
I made it all panics

2603
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,339
Payback like Merchant of Venice

2604
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,909
He's crazy.

2605
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:09,108
It's boring. I memorized all his flow.

2606
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:12,050
Go ruin yourself, Now get it

2607
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:13,549
Go ruin yourself now

2608
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:14,818
- For real? - Get it

2609
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:15,819
Are you confident?

2610
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,859
- Yes, you did well. - Let's go!

2611
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,299
- Oh, my. - My goodness!

2612
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,568
Hey.

2613
01:39:26,569 --> 01:39:28,329
Kohway, let's go!

2614
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,738
Step by, step by, step by step

2615
01:39:33,739 --> 01:39:34,969
Just like that

2616
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,339
Chances are flooding in when I rap

2617
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:38,238
- This is it. - Calm down

2618
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,210
Won, yen, dollar, everything rolling up like pasta

2619
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:44,448
I spit fire, I burn you up the rhythm

2620
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:46,188
You don't understand my work

2621
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:47,889
If you feel uncomfortable, then you're jealous

2622
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:48,948
Do you want to know the history?

2623
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:50,890
- He's so good. - Check my Instagram, pal

2624
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:55,188
I keep going on, Where is my next location?

2625
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:57,199
- He's so charismatic. - Just go for it

2626
01:39:57,529 --> 01:40:00,629
They say no no no, I just go go go

2627
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:01,769
Because I'm something baby

2628
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:03,640
Smart like Solomon

2629
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,369
Say no no no?

2630
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,538
- I say ololo - Ololo!

2631
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:10,078
Do what you need to do, Is that difficult?

2632
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:11,778
- I like his vibe. - Hey, do what you need...

2633
01:40:11,779 --> 01:40:13,710
Hey. Do what you need to do.

2634
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:15,079
Is that difficult?

2635
01:40:17,149 --> 01:40:18,249
Put your hands up!

2636
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,519
- Hey! - Yes!

2637
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,449
This is how you should rap.

2638
01:40:22,819 --> 01:40:25,618
- Let's go! - Kohway all the way.

2639
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:27,728
- You nailed it. - Yes, sir.

2640
01:40:27,729 --> 01:40:29,229
- You nailed it. - Kill that. Kill.

2641
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:30,728
It's over.

2642
01:40:30,729 --> 01:40:32,999
- You did it. - It's over.

2643
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,328
- He's awesome. - He flipped it. Nice.

2644
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:36,869
This is fun.

2645
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,770
I danced with my tired body.

2646
01:40:41,409 --> 01:40:42,609
We need to vote.

2647
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,979
- If only the order had changed. - Exactly.

2648
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:49,050
Okay, the energy is on our side now.

2649
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,880
We did it. It's on us now.

2650
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:53,188
(The voting is closed.)

2651
01:40:53,189 --> 01:40:55,090
The result of the vote will be revealed.

2652
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,829
One vote. That's crazy.

2653
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:02,488
Darn.

2654
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,858
My goodness.

2655
01:41:03,859 --> 01:41:05,159
(Drain K loses with 1 vote, and Kohway wins with 44 votes.)

2656
01:41:05,329 --> 01:41:07,099
(Kohway of Block 6 wins.)

2657
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:08,170
PUNCHNELLO.

2658
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:10,340
Oh, it's only me.

2659
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,738
- I see you. - PUNCHNELLO.

2660
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:14,209
Please remove his nametag.

2661
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:15,509
- You did so well. - I'm sorry.

2662
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:17,439
- No, please. - I was too excited.

2663
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:19,510
Thanks for your efforts.

2664
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,149
I didn't know I'd rap so much.

2665
01:41:22,979 --> 01:41:25,948
You were the coolest you've been in almost four years.

2666
01:41:25,949 --> 01:41:27,889
- You're amazing. - Well done.

2667
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:30,390
You won three battles.

2668
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:32,288
He did very well.

2669
01:41:32,289 --> 01:41:33,728
He did his job.

2670
01:41:33,729 --> 01:41:35,689
(Drain K is eliminated.)

2671
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,260
We'll continue the match.

2672
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:40,728
I'll choose beat number five.

2673
01:41:40,729 --> 01:41:42,130
- Let's go. - Darn.

2674
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:44,699
- Who is in charge of number five? - I can do it.

2675
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:46,568
The rescuer is on the way.

2676
01:41:46,569 --> 01:41:48,439
No choice. I should handle this.

2677
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,939
They only have losers left.

2678
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:52,079
Drop the beat.

2679
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:55,109
Let's go!

2680
01:41:55,909 --> 01:41:57,649
- Kohway! - It's already good.

2681
01:41:59,319 --> 01:42:00,818
Keep running, keep fighting in a frontline

2682
01:42:00,819 --> 01:42:02,648
I'm alone when I look at the top, bottom, and on my sides

2683
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,259
I know this is a matter of time

2684
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,589
Keep going until it works out, one against a hundred, so what?

2685
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:08,358
Ain't nobody can do it like me

2686
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:09,999
Fresh young Asian, Yes, that's me

2687
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,759
Energy, spread the energy

2688
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,469
Scarboy is better than your gang

2689
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:15,228
Next, continue, Don taya

2690
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:17,038
It's hot 365, like fire

2691
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:18,469
Go straight, my Air Force One

2692
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:21,270
Walk the bottom and stake your life, That's what's up

2693
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,010
- Yes! - That's what's up

2694
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:25,608
Let's go!

2695
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:27,180
- Yes, let's go! - I'm curious.

2696
01:42:31,149 --> 01:42:34,648
I like it random table, Flex, this is my attitude

2697
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:38,158
Everyone, gather up, ganggangsullae, I continue the tradition

2698
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,658
Gather the wealth, There are no fluctuations

2699
01:42:40,659 --> 01:42:42,898
- I sweep everything with my brother - He's very good.

2700
01:42:42,899 --> 01:42:46,369
Okay, I'm done, Suddenly a volleyball falls

2701
01:42:47,899 --> 01:42:49,499
Single lady around me

2702
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,868
I'm enjoying every day

2703
01:42:50,869 --> 01:42:53,868
Call them here, hurry

2704
01:42:53,869 --> 01:42:56,339
Sally, run from my L.A.

2705
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:57,408
This is risky.

2706
01:42:57,409 --> 01:43:00,680
Okay, I'm done, Suddenly a volleyball falls

2707
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:08,719
This is fun.

2708
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:09,960
Too easy.

2709
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,220
Our youngest is this good.

2710
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,729
He's a minor.

2711
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,229
It's okay.

2712
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,799
- He's so good. - I don't know who to vote.

2713
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,328
I don't know who to vote.

2714
01:43:20,329 --> 01:43:21,600
- This is hard. - It's iffy.

2715
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:22,769
(The voting begins.)

2716
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:25,269
I should vote following the vibe.

2717
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:27,069
- Are you thinking hard? - Yes.

2718
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:28,310
I really can't tell the result.

2719
01:43:28,539 --> 01:43:30,840
- This is difficult. - It's hard.

2720
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:32,180
Everyone is so good.

2721
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,278
I made up my mind.

2722
01:43:34,279 --> 01:43:36,750
(The voting is closed.)

2723
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:39,749
- I can't predict. - Honestly, they're at risk.

2724
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,890
They only have Kaogaii left.

2725
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,889
Drum roll.

2726
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:46,118
It's already 6 versus 4.

2727
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:47,430
I think it'll be neck and neck.

2728
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,028
How will it turn out?

2729
01:43:49,029 --> 01:43:50,559
(The result of the vote will be revealed.)

2730
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,858
- My goodness. - We can't predict.

2731
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,099
- The results are similar. - My gosh.

2732
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,939
- Oh, my. - Is it a draw? Who won?

2733
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,270
How will it turn out?

2734
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:00,669
Oh, my.

2735
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:02,310
(KP wins with 27 votes, and Kohway loses with 18 votes.)

2736
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:04,509
- KP! - Block Eight!

2737
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:05,608
- It's okay. - Okay.

2738
01:44:05,609 --> 01:44:08,408
- It was close. - Oh, my gosh.

2739
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:09,818
The match is really intense.

2740
01:44:09,819 --> 01:44:11,078
I didn't know it would be this intense.

2741
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:12,849
- You did well. - Thanks for your efforts.

2742
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:15,350
- It's okay. You did very well. - I underestimated him.

2743
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:16,519
KP.

2744
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,559
He's charismatic.

2745
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,158
KP raps deliciously.

2746
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:21,430
He belongs to the stage.

2747
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,789
Three people?

2748
01:44:23,329 --> 01:44:24,430
Six versus three.

2749
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:27,430
Kaogaii, ten minutes is over.

2750
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,069
So what?

2751
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:32,770
It's so annoying.

2752
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,739
If you could play beat number six, I'll appreciate it.

2753
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,549
- Me. - Okay. Let's go.

2754
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:43,250
- Let's go. - Go kill them, KP.

2755
01:44:47,989 --> 01:44:50,189
His movements are light.

2756
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,459
I put oil day and night

2757
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,929
Rather than saving it and letting it go to waste

2758
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:02,299
I'm unsure of my path

2759
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:04,339
- But I don't go back like you - His rap is delicious.

2760
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,269
Every moment is force, Buy for survival

2761
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:08,139
I pour everything to win

2762
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:09,778
Get the money quickly, gather it up

2763
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:11,978
Capitalism, I'll take everything

2764
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:14,148
Don't try to run away, Shut it and see

2765
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:15,578
Stop talking, you liar

2766
01:45:15,579 --> 01:45:16,919
- Yes. - Don't talk back at me

2767
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,749
After this stage, you'll be the follower

2768
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,519
Yes, ignore the hater

2769
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,948
Get your pay and sleep

2770
01:45:21,949 --> 01:45:23,658
- I got no pension - He doesn't even have haters.

2771
01:45:23,659 --> 01:45:26,060
No matter how much you criticize, I won't be defeated

2772
01:45:28,329 --> 01:45:30,130
- He's good. - My goodness.

2773
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:31,430
- You can do it. - Let's go.

2774
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:32,728
- Let's go, KOALA. - Let's go!

2775
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:34,228
- KOALA! - Rip the stage!

2776
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:35,430
- Let's go! - Yes, sir!

2777
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,868
Get the homies, have a sit-down

2778
01:45:38,869 --> 01:45:40,169
Beat down your eyes, get down

2779
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:43,109
- Gosh, KP isn't backing down. - Now, all of a sudden

2780
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:46,209
Like you're a gangster or something? Don't bluff around here

2781
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:48,049
We do it well when it's time for us, More concentrated

2782
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,818
You go around and turn me into a maniac

2783
01:45:49,819 --> 01:45:51,978
You're going to see more KO's than Tyson

2784
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:54,648
I'm an outlaw, just see and learn, Fill your bags

2785
01:45:54,649 --> 01:45:56,288
He's an eight but ten

2786
01:45:56,289 --> 01:45:57,988
You can't rap like this

2787
01:45:57,989 --> 01:46:00,459
Only play with 10s, Sipping on juice and gin

2788
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:02,188
I cook like Paik Jong Won, I get that though

2789
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,959
Money, power, respect, I get that though

2790
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,499
I'll make you polite

2791
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,398
Haters cross them out like tic-tac-toe

2792
01:46:07,399 --> 01:46:09,368
Like KOALA

2793
01:46:09,369 --> 01:46:11,139
Be stay, rep L.A.

2794
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,698
- We don't care what they say - He looks like the black sheep.

2795
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:14,770
Spread California Love, like Pac n Dre

2796
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:17,340
- Yes! - Yes!

2797
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:19,340
- You did well. - Nice.

2798
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:21,550
I think you should go next.

2799
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:26,989
He's so cool. Tiger eyes.

2800
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:29,689
He doesn't back down in front of a man who's much older than him.

2801
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:31,220
Nothing can scare him at his age.

2802
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:33,729
KP is a high school student.

2803
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:35,390
(The voting begins.)

2804
01:46:35,829 --> 01:46:38,529
- Who should I choose? - This is hard.

2805
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:42,528
The flow was boring, but he's more relaxed.

2806
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:44,539
This is driving me crazy.

2807
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,439
(Block Breaker)

2808
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:48,810
How will the results turn out?

2809
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:52,210
The votes were more divided than expected.

2810
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,408
It's neck and neck.

2811
01:46:54,409 --> 01:46:55,750
They got a similar number of votes.

2812
01:46:56,979 --> 01:46:57,979
- Who will win? - What?

2813
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,050
(KP wins with 25 votes, and KOALA loses with 20 votes.)

2814
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,849
- Oh, my gosh. - Yes.

2815
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:03,719
- KP. - KP!

2816
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,118
- KP! - My goodness.

2817
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:07,528
- Oh, my gosh. - It's a five-vote difference.

2818
01:47:07,529 --> 01:47:09,028
It's a five-vote difference.

2819
01:47:09,029 --> 01:47:10,898
They only have two rappers left.

2820
01:47:10,899 --> 01:47:11,959
It's not going in our favor.

2821
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,869
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2822
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,398
- I'm sorry. - You did well.

2823
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:17,439
You were cool.

2824
01:47:18,569 --> 01:47:20,108
- Thanks for your efforts. - Oh, my gosh.

2825
01:47:20,109 --> 01:47:22,109
Is this really Block Eight?

2826
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:23,880
I think Block Eight will win.

2827
01:47:24,109 --> 01:47:25,909
I know. I think Block Eight will win.

2828
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,880
- Let's beat just the two of them. - Just the two of them.

2829
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:29,880
What's up, brother? You're the big brother.

2830
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,249
They have Kaogaii and Geegooin left.

2831
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:34,089
(Block 6 has only 2 members left.)

2832
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:36,319
This way, Block Eight might win.

2833
01:47:36,989 --> 01:47:38,890
All of its members are doing better than I expected.

2834
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,788
If there are 3 to 4 members left, it's worth trying.

2835
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:44,000
Right. It's hard to go against six opponents.

2836
01:47:44,899 --> 01:47:47,029
To be honest, all I thought inside was "We lost."

2837
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,970
I was dispirited, ruined, and ashamed.

2838
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:53,340
At the same time, I was reminded...

2839
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:56,109
of all the previous comments.

2840
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:01,310
Give me beat number 19 right now.

2841
01:48:02,449 --> 01:48:04,079
- Let's go! - He memorized it.

2842
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:05,849
- Number 19? - Number 19?

2843
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:07,420
- Can you do it? - Okay. I'm on it.

2844
01:48:21,899 --> 01:48:23,199
Where is he going?

2845
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:25,639
My everyday life is so distressed

2846
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:28,738
It's like Lousiana here, It's darn hot

2847
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:30,179
I want to get away now

2848
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,778
- Take me, hijack - You can do all of it.

2849
01:48:31,779 --> 01:48:34,709
Those punks are biting each other, I don't care what they do

2850
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:37,050
I don't give a dang

2851
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,250
I don't give a dang, man

2852
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,619
- Even when seen from afar - He has great showmanship.

2853
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:45,189
This land is too small for me

2854
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:46,389
His steps are light.

2855
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:48,959
So they dash into it no matter what

2856
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,299
But the result is the same

2857
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,328
Live as you like rather than paying attention to them

2858
01:48:53,329 --> 01:48:56,398
Be careful, The cell phone is on my hand every day

2859
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:57,999
- Seeing you - Look how he's confident.

2860
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,470
Makes me yawn

2861
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,269
Why are you living like that?

2862
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,809
Everything is hopeless

2863
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:04,478
You try to hide your stiff look

2864
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:06,239
But you fall into the water again, wait

2865
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:08,278
It gives me goosebumps. He must be crazy.

2866
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:09,608
He's so natural on stage.

2867
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:12,250
There's only one answer, Don't do something needless, no way

2868
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:13,649
Darn it

2869
01:49:13,819 --> 01:49:15,019
Way to go!

2870
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:17,220
- KP! - That punk is a total loony.

2871
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:19,859
I don't think it's easy to beat him.

2872
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:22,060
Geegooin!

2873
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:28,669
Cut it

2874
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,398
My rap is darn good

2875
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:31,669
Like a habit

2876
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,309
I'm darn good at making money

2877
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,669
Flex and go to the table

2878
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:36,309
Fly to the stage

2879
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:37,809
I fly

2880
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:40,009
Then I get the numbers the girls left

2881
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:41,509
I don't act my age

2882
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:43,108
There's always someone one step ahead of you

2883
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:44,549
I'm an egg yolk

2884
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:46,118
- He's good. - You're just a lunatic

2885
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:47,849
My throat feels sore as I smoke

2886
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:50,719
- Let's go! - Spit out spit or rap

2887
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,818
I feel like the Witcher

2888
01:49:52,819 --> 01:49:54,659
I slash with Geeralt's swordsmanship

2889
01:49:54,729 --> 01:49:55,889
My viewpoint now

2890
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,799
I feel like an omniscient author

2891
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,828
It's been long since I went mad

2892
01:49:59,829 --> 01:50:01,769
- Smoking became my habit - This is it.

2893
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:03,368
Take a picture, picture, picture

2894
01:50:03,369 --> 01:50:05,169
I'll shape V like BTS

2895
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:06,669
I was born in Juan-dong

2896
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:08,169
We're the next runners

2897
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,278
Rhythm Power Synergy

2898
01:50:10,279 --> 01:50:12,510
Right on DJ Ebony's beat

2899
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,379
Geegooin has appeared

2900
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,949
I rip off this track

2901
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,189
This is enough.

2902
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:23,020
I thought I didn't expect that.

2903
01:50:23,189 --> 01:50:24,289
He's good.

2904
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:25,858
It shows his experience.

2905
01:50:25,859 --> 01:50:27,630
You never know the result.

2906
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:29,789
(The voting begins.)

2907
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,029
I can't believe this.

2908
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,800
Can you believe it? Both of them were amazing.

2909
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:36,470
- This is hard. - It's hard to decide.

2910
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,038
(Sighing)

2911
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:40,538
- This is too hard. - It's too hard.

2912
01:50:40,539 --> 01:50:41,939
I can't decide.

2913
01:50:47,149 --> 01:50:49,149
It's neck and neck. This is so fun.

2914
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:53,818
(The result of the vote will be revealed.)

2915
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:54,819
What will be the result?

2916
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:56,350
Who will win this battle?

2917
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:58,659
Who's the winner?

2918
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,760
(KP loses with 16 votes, and Geegooin wins with 29 votes.)

2919
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:03,829
(Geegooin of Block 6 wins.)

2920
01:51:04,029 --> 01:51:05,260
Geegooin!

2921
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:08,100
- KP! - There's no big difference.

2922
01:51:11,899 --> 01:51:13,439
Honestly, KP did a good job.

2923
01:51:13,739 --> 01:51:14,810
I liked it very much.

2924
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:17,108
But Geegooin's level was that of a universe this time.

2925
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:18,439
- Good job. - KP.

2926
01:51:18,710 --> 01:51:20,949
- You were... - That was a great defense.

2927
01:51:20,979 --> 01:51:22,578
- Seriously. - It was terrific. I liked it.

2928
01:51:22,579 --> 01:51:23,619
It was wonderful.

2929
01:51:23,979 --> 01:51:25,380
You're darn awesome.

2930
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,919
- Water. - I need some water.

2931
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,219
- Water! - Where's the water?

2932
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:30,460
You were amazing. Breathe in slowly.

2933
01:51:31,689 --> 01:51:32,818
Which beat?

2934
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:33,829
Number seven.

2935
01:51:34,029 --> 01:51:35,060
Okay. Let's go.

2936
01:51:35,289 --> 01:51:36,960
We need to cheer him vigorously.

2937
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:39,328
Lucky seven. I'll go with number seven. Let's go.

2938
01:51:39,329 --> 01:51:41,398
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2939
01:51:41,399 --> 01:51:43,199
- Who is it? - Number seven, Daniel Jikal.

2940
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,299
Daniel Jikal? Daniel Jikal!

2941
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,669
This is your best beat.

2942
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:47,770
Geegooin!

2943
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:53,409
He's crazy. He slayed it.

2944
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:56,349
That's what I wanted to be

2945
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,078
I was from Incheon and I returned to college

2946
01:51:58,079 --> 01:51:59,849
Basic in 2008

2947
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,618
Beenzino in 2010

2948
01:52:01,619 --> 01:52:03,389
Back then I was running crazy

2949
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:04,988
In a rooftop house that costs 180 dollars a month

2950
01:52:04,989 --> 01:52:06,488
It was a freaky party for me

2951
01:52:06,489 --> 01:52:08,629
One day, one verse, I want feedback

2952
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:10,658
I gave up on my GPA, I was either drinking or rapping

2953
01:52:10,659 --> 01:52:13,398
Glaring was enough, SM58 worth 80 dollars was enough

2954
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:15,399
I wanted someone to say I was good, I didn't want money

2955
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,469
Go straight with a bulletproof vest on

2956
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:19,069
The background music is "Daechwita."

2957
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,938
I rap every day and record every day

2958
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:22,709
I rap every day and I rap every day

2959
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:24,478
I wanted a stage and fame every day

2960
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:25,979
I want more, I want more

2961
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:27,979
Jump

2962
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:32,050
- Jump, Block Eight - Let's go!

2963
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:33,789
Daniel Jikal!

2964
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:37,919
- Say, ay-yo! - Ay-yo!

2965
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:40,089
Say, ay-yo! One more time

2966
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:41,728
- Ay-yo! - Ay-yo!

2967
01:52:41,729 --> 01:52:43,500
- Ay-yo! - Ay-yo!

2968
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:44,630
All right.

2969
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,828
Hot player IP on fire

2970
01:52:48,829 --> 01:52:50,499
Fake, You're all HYBEst without a character

2971
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,169
I'm Tyson I earn a title, tearing off ears

2972
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:54,509
Keep barking on, Everyone knows you won't bite me

2973
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:55,769
Get it like this

2974
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:57,478
Who do you know dancing like me, Oh, my dance

2975
01:52:57,479 --> 01:52:59,339
I've been vibing since I was about five

2976
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,109
I've been vibing, I'm going online

2977
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:03,349
Ready to get it, That's when I live outside

2978
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:05,019
He's better than I thought.

2979
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,179
I've been getting 1, 2, 3

2980
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,619
Everybody wants to get on my thing, My gosh, I don't get it

2981
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,288
I am the best when I'm doing this

2982
01:53:11,289 --> 01:53:13,019
Everybody wants to get on my thing

2983
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:16,089
I've been feeling I'm one of a kind when I spit on the mic

2984
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:18,528
Ready to get it cause I been feeling like one of a kind I'm spitting this

2985
01:53:18,529 --> 01:53:20,328
Everybody got me getting it I'm running out of time

2986
01:53:20,329 --> 01:53:21,369
Cause I'm a, whoa

2987
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,869
- He was so good. - Daniel!

2988
01:53:27,239 --> 01:53:28,269
You were so cool.

2989
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:29,470
You won.

2990
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,809
- Geegooin is such a good player. - I know.

2991
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:33,479
Darn it. What was that?

2992
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:34,979
This is tough.

2993
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:37,350
This is so fun.

2994
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:40,850
This is insane. It's so fun that I don't want to do it.

2995
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:44,090
I can't do this. Everyone is so good.

2996
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:46,420
I wonder who won.

2997
01:53:48,029 --> 01:53:49,059
Who is the winner?

2998
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:50,259
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

2999
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,300
Who is it?

3000
01:53:56,699 --> 01:53:58,969
- Okay. - Let's go!

3001
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:01,169
- It's Geegooin! - Geegooin, let's go!

3002
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:03,978
- Oh, my goodness. - The winning rapper...

3003
01:54:03,979 --> 01:54:05,409
It's neck and neck again.

3004
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:08,249
This is why it's important...

3005
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,908
to send in a strong player in the end.

3006
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:11,220
They're ruined.

3007
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:12,549
- They have gamma, Bizzy, - Yes.

3008
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:14,549
Churry, LEO. That's all.

3009
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:16,050
- Right. - They're ruined.

3010
01:54:16,619 --> 01:54:18,090
Bizzy is the only one strong.

3011
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,629
- Good job. - You were great.

3012
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:22,090
We can do this.

3013
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:25,229
(Worried)

3014
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,369
I thought we were in big trouble.

3015
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,368
Among the cards left for us,

3016
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:31,939
I felt that we didn't have one...

3017
01:54:33,239 --> 01:54:34,470
to beat Geegooin.

3018
01:54:34,909 --> 01:54:36,639
(Geegooin of Block 6 is a starter again.)

3019
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,509
- Just do as you were born - His vocalization is so good.

3020
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:41,350
Let's not act, It's like "Screening Humanity"

3021
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,409
A model student with a vibe

3022
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:44,920
Becomes a teacher now

3023
01:54:45,319 --> 01:54:46,988
Showing how to succeed

3024
01:54:46,989 --> 01:54:48,319
Shut it and follow me

3025
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,159
Geegooin! Let's go!

3026
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:53,858
He went to Seoul National University.

3027
01:54:53,859 --> 01:54:55,129
I have high expectations.

3028
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,229
Churry, go take care of him.

3029
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:00,199
Punks with a bad rap speak out several verses

3030
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:02,068
Being capable of many things

3031
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:03,799
I donate my talent

3032
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,469
Punks with no self-objectification

3033
01:55:05,470 --> 01:55:07,010
This field has so many of them, That's the problem

3034
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,579
We won! This will do!

3035
01:55:13,409 --> 01:55:14,409
Right

3036
01:55:18,449 --> 01:55:19,750
This leaves us no choice.

3037
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:21,549
You know who to vote for.

3038
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:23,489
(The voting begins.)

3039
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,119
A Seogang University graduate beats an SNU graduate.

3040
01:55:27,689 --> 01:55:29,390
The result of the vote will be revealed.

3041
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,629
What's going on?

3042
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:36,970
(Churry loses with no votes, and Geegooin wins with 45 votes.)

3043
01:55:38,939 --> 01:55:40,739
(Geegooin of Block 6 won.)

3044
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:43,270
He slayed them all.

3045
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:48,448
It's 2 to 3 now.

3046
01:55:48,449 --> 01:55:49,709
Geoogooin has had three consecutive wins.

3047
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:50,880
I wonder if he can make four consecutive wins.

3048
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:53,049
(Geegooin of Block 6 does his 4th rap.)

3049
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:54,719
Why are you looking down on me?

3050
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:58,089
Do you think I'm a jerk as I'm skinny? You idiots

3051
01:55:58,090 --> 01:56:00,188
You don't know about my new ego

3052
01:56:00,189 --> 01:56:01,929
Here's a new one, Better than a white elephant

3053
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:03,659
Kill them all, It doesn't matter

3054
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:06,600
Darn.

3055
01:56:08,369 --> 01:56:09,369
Is no one going?

3056
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,500
No one's taking the mic.

3057
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,270
My gosh.

3058
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:14,639
- You don't have any verse? - No.

3059
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,810
- No? - Someone needs to take the mic.

3060
01:56:22,909 --> 01:56:24,119
Gamma!

3061
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:26,449
- gamma! - I'm getting a dopamine rush.

3062
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:27,850
The leader is on.

3063
01:56:28,819 --> 01:56:30,189
Show them what you got.

3064
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:31,789
Let's get it!

3065
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,288
Run away, You better run back

3066
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:36,828
You can never stop the comeback

3067
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:38,629
The notebook has my flow

3068
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:40,299
I check the mic phone

3069
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:41,828
I spread my wings like a butterfly

3070
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:43,698
Complete metamorphosis is my choice

3071
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:45,269
They can't come at me, They sit back

3072
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:47,109
Just play possum

3073
01:56:53,010 --> 01:56:54,049
- Yes, sir! - Yes!

3074
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:55,350
- We're ruined. - We're doomed.

3075
01:56:55,979 --> 01:56:57,550
Geegooin slays them all. This is insane.

3076
01:56:57,649 --> 01:57:00,020
- It's over. - Darn it.

3077
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:01,849
This is how to turn the tables.

3078
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:02,890
Geegooin scored it.

3079
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,789
That crazy Geegooin.

3080
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:07,060
This is insane. He's so sexy.

3081
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,760
The result of the vote will be revealed.

3082
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:14,800
It will be a landslide.

3083
01:57:15,369 --> 01:57:17,239
- I think it's a landslide. - Again?

3084
01:57:17,539 --> 01:57:18,600
He got all the votes.

3085
01:57:20,069 --> 01:57:21,309
Is it a landslide?

3086
01:57:21,310 --> 01:57:23,108
(gamma loses with no votes, and Geegooin wins with 45 votes.)

3087
01:57:23,109 --> 01:57:24,938
He had a clean win twice.

3088
01:57:24,939 --> 01:57:26,210
(Geegooin of Block 6 wins.)

3089
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,310
It's 2 versus 2 now.

3090
01:57:27,479 --> 01:57:28,979
He turned the tables.

3091
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:30,309
You did a good job.

3092
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:31,978
- You gave it a try. That's enough. - Right.

3093
01:57:31,979 --> 01:57:33,520
- It's better than doing nothing. - Should I have gone instead?

3094
01:57:34,449 --> 01:57:35,850
- Where did you go? - Geegooin.

3095
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:39,889
Take a deep breath first.

3096
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:41,389
They have two left. You can get them. Okay?

3097
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:43,289
They created a seat for him.

3098
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:45,228
- He needs it. - That's so funny.

3099
01:57:45,229 --> 01:57:46,329
He's not young anymore.

3100
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,300
I feel hot as I'm busy beating many people.

3101
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:51,368
Let's go with beat number 14.

3102
01:57:51,369 --> 01:57:52,640
(Shouting)

3103
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,369
- Let's go. - They're doomed.

3104
01:57:57,069 --> 01:57:59,578
- Hey! - Hey!

3105
01:57:59,579 --> 01:58:02,278
He's so full of confidence now.

3106
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:05,278
- Hey! - Hey!

3107
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:07,648
- Hey! - Hey!

3108
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:10,719
Man's not hot, I'm fine with getting hotter

3109
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,358
This beat is my style

3110
01:58:12,359 --> 01:58:14,059
I don't care about the trend

3111
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:16,059
Go, go, come, come

3112
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:17,658
If you don't know you have to, Everyone but you knows

3113
01:58:17,659 --> 01:58:19,099
My name is Geegooin

3114
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,999
Rhythm Power is the word that will shine me

3115
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,099
The dream team of Incheon

3116
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,839
They're ruined. No one can beat this.

3117
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:27,640
I aim at you with crazy energy and baseless courage, So do it right

3118
01:58:29,539 --> 01:58:32,038
- Geegooin, man! - Let's go!

3119
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:34,349
- Can he beat this? - LEO, let's go!

3120
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:35,408
That's him, right?

3121
01:58:35,409 --> 01:58:38,449
- No one chose him until the end. - Right.

3122
01:58:38,979 --> 01:58:39,979
Bam!

3123
01:58:41,789 --> 01:58:43,020
- You can do it! - LEO.

3124
01:58:44,289 --> 01:58:45,919
When I come through my flow wavy

3125
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,488
Why these boys acting so shady

3126
01:58:47,489 --> 01:58:49,658
I have no idea about the reason

3127
01:58:49,659 --> 01:58:50,929
Why they still hating

3128
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:52,599
Come in through the back door, Let me cook up a classic

3129
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,600
We're all strangers but excuse me

3130
01:58:53,601 --> 01:58:54,868
Why is that punk wearing slippers?

3131
01:58:54,869 --> 01:58:56,198
Because I look into the mirror

3132
01:58:56,199 --> 01:58:57,769
With a smile, bae

3133
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:59,198
Comment about me, I came for a battle

3134
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:00,938
I'm paid cheap but I win the battle

3135
01:59:00,939 --> 01:59:02,568
Don't doubt, I'm tough, I win the battle

3136
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:04,278
I came for a battle

3137
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:05,608
I'm never coming back

3138
01:59:05,609 --> 01:59:07,108
I'm not traveling back to the past

3139
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:09,349
At least to myself, Again to myself

3140
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:11,949
Put in the scenic, Came in it Taipei

3141
01:59:13,819 --> 01:59:14,889
LEO, let's go!

3142
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:17,289
- He was better than I thought. - Right.

3143
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:19,589
Gosh, this won't be enough.

3144
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:22,328
- I feel bad for him. - Geegooin is insane.

3145
01:59:22,329 --> 01:59:24,260
His live performance is unbelievable.

3146
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:26,099
Geegooin is so awesome.

3147
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,299
What the heck.

3148
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:29,229
The vote will be unanimous.

3149
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:32,939
(The result of the vote is revealed.)

3150
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:39,478
(LEO loses with 7 votes and Geegooin wins with 38 votes.)

3151
01:59:39,479 --> 01:59:40,649
(Geegooin of Block 6 wins.)

3152
01:59:41,079 --> 01:59:43,350
- This is crazy! - Eight.

3153
01:59:44,979 --> 01:59:46,720
He has turned the tables.

3154
01:59:46,819 --> 01:59:49,050
How can this happen?

3155
01:59:49,689 --> 01:59:51,259
(LEO is eliminated.)

3156
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:52,619
Only the last one is left.

3157
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:56,630
- Bizzy might make it. - Would Bizzy show them what he got?

3158
01:59:56,789 --> 02:00:00,429
The beat should be something I can make verses on.

3159
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,430
Gosh.

3160
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:03,769
- Who's the last one? - It's Bizzy.

3161
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:06,639
Even though Geegooin loses, Kaogaii will surely beat him.

3162
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:08,039
But the beat should match him.

3163
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:09,439
I'll try everything I can.

3164
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:12,609
- Have some water. - Okay.

3165
02:00:13,779 --> 02:00:14,949
I'll wipe your mouth.

3166
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:18,719
Goodness. Why is he doing that?

3167
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:21,489
- Sweet guy. - He's sweet.

3168
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:23,960
Gosh.

3169
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,390
I'll try number nine. Let's go.

3170
02:00:28,659 --> 02:00:31,199
- Hey - Here we go! It's a finish!

3171
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:35,499
I was crawling on the floor, but now I'm going to the top

3172
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:36,568
That's it!

3173
02:00:36,569 --> 02:00:39,000
No one can stop me since I'm Crayon Shin Chan

3174
02:00:39,869 --> 02:00:42,038
I will sweep you off

3175
02:00:42,039 --> 02:00:43,669
One person is not enough

3176
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:45,408
You need to get a number ticket

3177
02:00:45,409 --> 02:00:47,948
Then I'll make you a mad dog one by one

3178
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:49,179
Party

3179
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:52,219
Soju and beer by possessed Geegooin tastes good

3180
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:53,249
So please

3181
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:55,719
- He's excited. - Become my Rudolph

3182
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:57,389
It's not fun

3183
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:59,819
Santa Claus that goes on with style

3184
02:01:01,029 --> 02:01:02,960
He's so good.

3185
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,600
I don't think Bizzy has a verse that matches this beat.

3186
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,698
I was a bit flustered when I heard the trap beat.

3187
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:09,929
But I had to do it.

3188
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:12,739
I decided to make up even if I had to squeeze rap.

3189
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:15,470
- Is this 140? - Yes, 130 to 140.

3190
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:17,938
- Bizzy! - Let's go, Bizzy!

3191
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:19,239
He came to see!

3192
02:01:20,579 --> 02:01:21,579
Can he win?

3193
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:23,880
Hey

3194
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:26,180
- Please. - Here he comes.

3195
02:01:26,619 --> 02:01:28,448
Let's go back to that time

3196
02:01:28,449 --> 02:01:29,919
To the season everything felt curious

3197
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,618
A kid whose heart fluttered for the first snow

3198
02:01:31,619 --> 02:01:33,559
I ran after a butterfly

3199
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,158
Since when have I changed?

3200
02:01:35,159 --> 02:01:38,499
Let's go back to the time, Let me take it all back

3201
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,898
Music is my time machine

3202
02:01:39,899 --> 02:01:42,028
- Goodness. - I will go back to that time

3203
02:01:42,029 --> 02:01:45,438
Music is my time machine, It was way back

3204
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:47,238
Back to that time

3205
02:01:47,239 --> 02:01:48,469
Back to that season

3206
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:50,778
Take me back

3207
02:01:50,779 --> 02:01:51,909
It doesn't go with the beat.

3208
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:54,680
Take me back

3209
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,550
He finished the verse, though. That's awesome.

3210
02:01:59,649 --> 02:02:00,689
He's awesome, though.

3211
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,319
The beat didn't match.

3212
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:03,989
(The voting begins.)

3213
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:09,889
The choice of the beat...

3214
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:11,000
is really important here.

3215
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:14,229
(The voting is closed.)

3216
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:16,300
The result of the vote will be revealed.

3217
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:17,970
(Bizzy versus Geegooin)

3218
02:02:20,569 --> 02:02:22,839
(Bizzy loses with 9 votes, and Geegooin wins with 36 votes.)

3219
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,509
Geegooin is insane!

3220
02:02:24,510 --> 02:02:28,750
(Geegooin of Block 6 wins.)

3221
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,349
How many people did Geegooin beat?

3222
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:32,750
He beat six people.

3223
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,648
Honestly, Geegooin did it all by himself.

3224
02:02:35,649 --> 02:02:38,090
At first, I thought Block Eight would win.

3225
02:02:38,890 --> 02:02:39,960
You did a good job.

3226
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:42,789
- It was a good game, though. - You were great.

3227
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,899
- You're the best. I mean it. - I ruined it.

3228
02:02:46,659 --> 02:02:47,770
We'll toss you.

3229
02:02:48,029 --> 02:02:49,399
- Carry him. - In 1, 2, 3!

3230
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:58,108
Block Six won the first Block Breaker.

3231
02:02:58,109 --> 02:03:01,379
(Block 8 loses, and Block 6 wins.)

3232
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:02,709
My goodness.

3233
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:04,579
They turn on fire too?

3234
02:03:05,779 --> 02:03:07,948
- Yes! - You slayed it.

3235
02:03:07,949 --> 02:03:09,249
The winner isn't Block Six. It's Geegooin.

3236
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:10,289
That was insane.

3237
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:13,090
Geegooin is now Professor Geegooin.

3238
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,659
Yes. There's a reason why he's in Rhythm Power.

3239
02:03:15,789 --> 02:03:17,459
He came all the way from Bangsaneung.

3240
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:19,399
I felt huge respect for him.

3241
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:22,100
I felt so reassured.

3242
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,670
Thank you, and I love you.

3243
02:03:26,039 --> 02:03:27,398
- Thank you for your work. - Thank you for your work.

3244
02:03:27,399 --> 02:03:28,568
Well done.

3245
02:03:28,569 --> 02:03:30,068
We all gave a nice performance.

3246
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:32,438
- It was nice. - Nice.

3247
02:03:32,439 --> 02:03:33,778
KP, you're the best. You're crazy.

3248
02:03:33,779 --> 02:03:36,749
I felt very sorry. That was what I felt the most.

3249
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:38,350
It was a bummer.

3250
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:40,420
We were on a roll in the beginning.

3251
02:03:40,579 --> 02:03:43,189
I think it was neck and neck compared to what I expected.

3252
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:45,589
This time, everyone performed.

3253
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:48,289
So I thought we were not the weakest.

3254
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:51,259
It was a stunning come-from-behind victory.

3255
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:52,430
It was legendary.

3256
02:03:52,930 --> 02:03:54,398
This is fun.

3257
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:55,769
This is crazy.

3258
02:03:55,770 --> 02:03:57,068
Their spirit frightens me.

3259
02:03:57,069 --> 02:03:59,470
It was so fun because everyone was so good.

3260
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:00,938
I looked forward to every match.

3261
02:04:00,939 --> 02:04:03,409
I thought I'd get a dopamine rush again.

3262
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:06,839
(Owen seemed to have no motivation.)

3263
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,978
(If we lose today, I'll get eliminated.)

3264
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:09,979
(What's that?)

3265
02:04:09,979 --> 02:04:10,979
(Everyone was taken aback.)

3266
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:12,419
(It's an undesirable attitude.)

3267
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:13,520
(This one works with that beat too.)

3268
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:17,250
(But doing this is meaningless.)

3269
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:19,289
(I didn't feel comfortable.)

3270
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,188
(The first Block Match, Block Breaker, isn't over.)

3271
02:04:22,189 --> 02:04:23,189
(That's so cool.)

3272
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:25,728
(That's it.)

3273
02:04:25,729 --> 02:04:27,100
(That's so ill-mannered.)

3274
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:30,329
(The verse is too long.)

3275
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:32,139
(With blocks fighting a war of nerves, )

3276
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:34,810
(Block Breaker gets more intense.)

3277
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,509
(I'm scared.)

3278
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,608
You're a swindler

3279
02:04:38,609 --> 02:04:39,609
(It gives me goosebumps.)

3280
02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:40,639
(I'm confident.)

3281
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:41,649
(I wanted to show them.)

3282
02:04:41,810 --> 02:04:44,420
(A big match between Block 2 and Block 3 begins.)

3283
02:04:44,979 --> 02:04:46,380
(He's like a machine.)

3284
02:04:47,489 --> 02:04:48,519
(The voting...)

3285
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:49,749
(ended in a tie.)

3286
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:51,358
(We'll proceed with a rematch.)

3287
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:52,590
Darn it.

3288
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:55,259
(The first candidates for elimination are revealed.)

3289
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,260
(I felt sorry.)

3290
02:04:56,261 --> 02:04:57,288
(I failed as a leader.)

3291
02:04:57,289 --> 02:04:58,359
(The elimination candidates are...)

3292
02:04:58,859 --> 02:04:59,898
(What's the reason?)

3293
02:04:59,899 --> 02:05:00,899
(It's so cruel.)

3294
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:03,329
(There has been no hip-hop show like this in Korea.)
