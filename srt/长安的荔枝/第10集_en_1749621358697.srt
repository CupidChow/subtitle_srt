1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Double Hearing

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What do you think?

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You should try this.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Look for the master.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll give you one more.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
One more.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The rest, take care.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You again?

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Cousin, I'll show you how to make a pot of rice.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've told you many times.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't be so noisy outside.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Try it.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, I don't want to eat it.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I found the chicken feet in the fridge

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
when I was looking for tea this morning.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They haven't been changed yet.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why haven't they been changed yet?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What should we do with the workers?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let me tell you.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The nuclear power is not so strong recently.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The weather is hot and the fire is strong.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's already 10 o'clock.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Only the chicken feet can make the old man happy.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's happy?

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's happy.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's happy?

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then let's call him happy.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Or don't call him happy.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's talk about the old man.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He's a good man.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He should be happy.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's not a bad man.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The servants are busy with the operation.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The servants?

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How could there be a servant?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Didn't the transfer of the nuclear power

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
be approved?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That money...

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That money...

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Didn't you leave it at the beginning?

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Did I leave it?

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Even if I left it a little bit,

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I still have half the money

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
in the hands of the seller.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You also left it?

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're so lucky.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're so useful.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You were supposed to be a good man.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why did you take it?

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I... I...

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I just took half of it.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're so lucky.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You dare to eat meat in the eyes of the warehouse.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're not even a bad man.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've already calculated it.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I left the money for the seller.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's also enough to collect it today.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who would think

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
why the seller is so...

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're so smart.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're so stupid.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're so stupid.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't worry.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The scouts won't take it.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've already bought the amount of poison.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The seller is in the mud.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
With these tricks,

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the world will be in chaos.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll kill you in a moment.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're still working on this.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're still working on it.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're still working on it.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're still working on it.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're still working on it.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're still working on it.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm telling you,

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
no matter what,

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the most important thing

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that can be seen

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
is the nuclear power.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
After you wake up,

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you'll see

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that the seller is talking bad about me.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He's just looking at me.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Go to work.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're making me angry.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The day is the final day.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's the use of

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
giving me a divorce?

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Go to work.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're so stupid.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why are you so stupid?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're not worth it.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The most important thing

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that can be seen is the nuclear power.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hurry up.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I know that

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you're the real deal

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that I've been eating for years.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Old Brother,

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the contract went down.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Young Bro.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What more progress?

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss...

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Miss...

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,240
Miss!

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Master!

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
Master!

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
It's okay.

115
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,280
Sir,

116
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
you were supposed to boycottced the carriage?

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,060
Why you scared me down,

118
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,660
They used ice cream to seduce Li Zhiniang.

119
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
They wanted to blame you.

120
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,660
I knew it from the first bite.

121
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,260
Today's banquet is just a game.

122
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,060
How would they know that I'm Chang'an's matchmaker?

123
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm a game changer.

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,660
I'm a single-hand man.

125
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
What game do I have?

126
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,460
I can only say these wine.

127
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,860
They must be hungry tonight.

128
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,860
No!

129
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,060
It's too late.

130
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,660
I'm not a game changer.

131
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,460
I'm not a game changer.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,660
No!

133
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,060
It's too late.

134
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,460
I can't do anything.

135
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,060
Wedding challenge!

136
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,860
Blア О kle …

137
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,060
Keep calm!

138
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,660
Caine!

139
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Look over there!

140
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,660
No way you areassed!

141
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,760
She is so brave!

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,660
If you are in trouble ...

143
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
beloved countries!

144
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,660
Take this!

145
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,660
Hong Kong,

146
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,660
We have a wedding banquet left for us tonight!

147
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,260
We travel alone.

148
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
We live together and walk together

149
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ten, ten, ten, fifteen, sixteen,

150
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:30,260
fifteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty,

151
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:40,260
eighty.

152
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:50,260
I'm so confused.

153
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,260
I brought you some food.

154
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,260
You're getting more and more understanding.

155
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
How is it?

156
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,260
It's the smell of the wine I've been drinking.

157
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
This is the embroidery I brought today.

158
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Embroidery?

159
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,260
Look at the embroidery.

160
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Is the embroidery workshop a building?

161
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Do you see the side or the side?

162
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,260
I just brought one.

163
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Don't you know that uncle is also very good at this?

164
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
He can't be good at embroidery.

165
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
He doesn't know that you're in Lingnan.

166
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Then tell him.

167
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
We'll talk about it later.

168
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Your words are a bit too much.

169
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,260
I can't understand it.

170
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,260
I want to do a professional experiment.

171
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,260
I have to figure out what problems I have on the way.

172
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Aren't you just talking about soldiers?

173
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,260
What problems can you see?

174
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
I don't know the number of officials.

175
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
I don't know how to embroider.

176
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
I'm a famous scholar.

177
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
After the entrance and the exit,

178
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
I always take care of the accounts,

179
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,260
the warehouse, the shop, the jewelry.

180
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,260
What I can do is to calculate.

181
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I can also calculate what I can rely on.

182
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Don't calculate it first.

183
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
Let's eat first.

184
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
How can I rely on it?

185
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
I don't know.

186
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm a good-for-nothing.

187
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
But the money that Su Lao gave me before,

188
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,260
it's not enough.

189
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,260
Hua said it here.

190
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,260
I don't help you, it's not appropriate.

191
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Tell me.

192
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,260
How much is the money?

193
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,260
I've already suppressed the cost to the lowest.

194
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,260
It's still 2580 yuan.

195
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,260
It's my dream.

196
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Brother-in-law,

197
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,260
go and rest.

198
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,260
580 yuan.

199
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Comrade!

200
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
We're here!

201
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
We're here!

202
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Comrade!

203
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
We're here!

204
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Master Li.

205
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Su Lao.

206
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Why are you so anxious to see me?

207
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Last time,

208
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,260
didn't you say you were good at drinking tea for Li Nan?

209
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
You wanted to have a good time with me,

210
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,260
so you often saw Li Nan's true feelings.

211
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,260
I've prepared steamed pork for you today.

212
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
I'll take you to taste it.

213
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
It's my bad luck.

214
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,260
Let's go.

215
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Here.

216
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Pick a big one.

217
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
Try it.

218
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Here.

219
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Here.

220
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Such a strange thing.

221
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm sure that the baby girl will like it.

222
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Do you have a lucky charm?

223
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,260
This is a three-month-old wine.

224
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,260
We don't even eat it.

225
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Don't ask.

226
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Is it sour or not?

227
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
It's fresh.

228
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Fresh?

229
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Fresh?

230
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Fresh?

231
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Fresh?

232
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Actually, Li Zhi has four kinds of wine.

233
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Five thousand.

234
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Five thousand.

235
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
You made me feel bad.

236
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
I'm so upset.

237
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Be careful. I'll hit you on the head.

238
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
I'll hit you on the head.

239
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,260
You won't get upset.

240
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Master Su.

241
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,260
I'm using the double-layered cloth you gave me.

242
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
And the water-based method that Tong taught me.

243
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,260
First, use the three-month-old red water to wash the water.

244
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Put it in the jar and seal it.

245
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
The outside layer is cold water.

246
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Change it every half day.

247
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
So that the temperature inside the jar is not too high.

248
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
And it can keep the water-based.

249
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,260
So Li Zhi, who has been keeping it for four to six days,

250
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,260
is like a new one.

251
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,260
I didn't expect that my double-layered cloth is so beautiful.

252
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,260
Do you know that I'm now a new one?

253
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Okay, okay.

254
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Don't be too excited.

255
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Go back to work.

256
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Let's have fun.

257
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Master Su's gift is for me.

258
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Let's go.

259
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Li Zhi.

260
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
Tell me about your magic trick.

261
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,260
I want to do a transfer experiment.

262
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,260
At that time, Tong will provide me with 100 jin of three-month-old red water.

263
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,260
I want Master Su to buy me some horses and some horses.

264
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,260
And then I'll buy some grass-bending,

265
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
breaking ships and ice-diving.

266
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,260
I'll bring this double-layered cloth with me.

267
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,260
I'll open the horse together.

268
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,260
I'll show you how to do it.

269
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,260
I'll show you how to do it.

270
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
You can't use your horse power.

271
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Look at how far Li Zhi can go to break it.

272
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Then,

273
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
how many horses do you need?

274
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
How many horses do you need?

275
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,260
I need hundreds of horses.

276
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
I'll give you tens of horses.

277
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Forget it.

278
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,260
This is the four lines I drew.

279
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Look.

280
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,260
The first line is not connected.

281
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,260
The second line is the line that I drew.

282
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
The second line is the line that I drew.

283
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,260
This is a ancient line from the East.

284
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
From the Wuyuan?

285
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,260
From the Hengzhou, Hengzhou, Tanzhou, to Jiangling.

286
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,260
This is the closest line.

287
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,260
This is the third line.

288
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
The third line is not connected.

289
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,260
But after crossing the river,

290
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,260
we'll go to the north of the county,

291
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
to the Suzhou,

292
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,260
and then to the Jianghuai and Caoyun lines.

293
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Then we'll go to the Yellow River and the Ruoshui.

294
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
This is the fourth line.

295
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,260
The fourth line is directly from the Zhujiang River to the Zhenshui.

296
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
The Zhenshui passes through the Meiguang and the Erlu River.

297
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Then we'll go to the Changjiang and Shangsu.

298
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Then we'll go to the Han River and the Xiangzhou.

299
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Then we'll go to the Shangzhou.

300
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,260
There are various advantages of this four lines.

301
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
I don't want to be able to walk through it once.

302
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,180
I just want to know where can this

303
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,260
lichi get?

304
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,260
In the south,

305
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,260
there are a lot of good horses.

306
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
It's worth 13,000.

307
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
A good rider,

308
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
at least,

309
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
needs five horses.

310
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
The distance is so far.

311
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
What Qiu Hanyu said

312
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
can be not exceeding a horse's strength.

313
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,260
But you have to give more reward for your rider.

314
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Otherwise,

315
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,260
no one would like to do this for you.

316
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Plus,

317
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
the people eat,

318
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
the people use,

319
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
the horses eat,

320
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
the horses use,

321
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
the people who are in charge of the official family,

322
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,260
the people who are in charge of the water and the water,

323
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
the people who are in charge of the water,

324
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
the people who are in charge of the water and the water,

325
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
they are all in the same boat.

326
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
They are all in the same boat.

327
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
Yes.

328
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
Actually, I have calculated all these.

329
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Mr. Su,

330
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,260
you have been in the south for many years.

331
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
The price of the opening, the loss,

332
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
and the price of the foundation

333
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
must be much higher than mine.

334
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
So,

335
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
I want you to help me

336
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
to make some money.

337
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Then tell me,

338
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
how much money do you have now?

339
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,260
996 yuan.

340
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,260
996 yuan?

341
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Why does this number sound so familiar?

342
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,260
It's because you asked me to buy the money for you.

343
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
So,

344
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
you plan to put all these money

345
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
into the construction site?

346
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
You don't want them to

347
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,260
stay in your place for the rest of their lives?

348
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,260
I was thinking of taking the money back to Chang'an

349
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
and pay my rent first,

350
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,260
and then leave some for the little girl.

351
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
But,

352
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
if I don't get the money back,

353
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
I will die.

354
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
So, for the little girl,

355
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,260
I want to take the money back.

356
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,260
The numbers just now

357
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
were added together.

358
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,260
At least, it needs 3,000 yuan.

359
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,260
Try the money you just made.

360
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
It's over.

361
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
I have 996 yuan.

362
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
It's still 2,500 yuan.

363
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,260
80 yuan.

364
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
But this is my price.

365
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
I think

366
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
if you want to make money,

367
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
it's 2,500 yuan.

368
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Mr. Su, look at this.

369
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
I will run to the charity house

370
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
and get you three

371
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
common-sense cards.

372
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
I will give you free money.

373
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Can you

374
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
give me 2,500 yuan?

375
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
So,

376
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
the money

377
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,260
is your real magic trick.

378
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Miss Tong,

379
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
tell us about your trick.

380
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,260
It's different from other people.

381
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
Other people come to Li Zhiyuan

382
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
to take care of Dongyao.

383
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
It's similar to the servants

384
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,260
of our eyes.

385
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,260
But he is different.

386
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
He is the first official

387
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,260
who has ever been a farmer here.

388
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
He also helped us

389
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,260
to steal Li Zhiyuan's bad people.

390
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,260
He is 100-pound Li Zhiyuan.

391
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
Even if it's 300-pound,

392
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
I will give it to him.

393
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Mr. Li,

394
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
I thought

395
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,260
you would make Li Zhiyun

396
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,260
a good kid.

397
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
I didn't expect you

398
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
to do this.

399
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Since you are

400
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
so smart,

401
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
I promise you

402
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,260
that I will use your pure family

403
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
to exchange my baby.

404
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
Really?

405
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Yes.

406
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
But this time,

407
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
I need to

408
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
give more money to Zhiyuan.

409
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
I need 4 pairs of clothes.

410
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
How is it?

411
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
OK.

412
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
4 pairs of clothes.

413
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
4 pairs.

414
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Is the snacks tasty?

415
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
It's much better than the last time.

416
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
OK.

417
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,260
Enjoy.

418
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Here.

419
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
You are wearing the whole thing on purpose.

420
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,260
Where are you going?

421
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
I am going to the toilet.

422
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
Mr. Li.

423
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Mr. Li.

424
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
I want to see Mr. He.

425
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
He is a good person.

426
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
He is out of the house.

427
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
What about Mr. Zhao?

428
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
He went to the toilet.

429
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
When will they come back?

430
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
I don't know.

431
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260
The inspection is in the lake.

432
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
The customer doesn't ask for the money.

433
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
You can just ask for the money.

434
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Sir,

435
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
if you need anything,

436
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
tell me.

437
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
The check is not urgent.

438
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Do you need money for water?

439
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
You are joking.

440
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
There is no money for water.

441
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
Give me a bowl of water.

442
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
Come on.

443
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
Come on.

444
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Sir.

445
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
You should choose first.

446
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
How about a purple bamboo shoot?

447
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
Mr. Zheng.

448
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Purple bamboo shoot is a rare thing.

449
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
It's hard to find a purple bamboo shoot.

450
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
And the price is not good.

451
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
Then

452
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
this one.

453
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
The local western tea.

454
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
It's so expensive.

455
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
The boss said

456
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
we can't do the inspection.

457
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
We should keep the location.

458
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
It's not good.

459
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Come on.

460
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Sir.

461
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,260
I will leave if you are busy.

462
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
You are free.

463
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
I can give you some patience.

464
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Tell your boss

465
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
that it's a good idea to do business.

466
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Sir.

467
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Are you waiting for the man from the Temple?

468
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Come on.

469
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
There is a great place.

470
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Come on.

471
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Look here.

472
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
See how clear it is.

473
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
You are putting me in trouble.

474
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
This place is convenient for you

475
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
and convenient for me.

476
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
It's a good idea.

477
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
Sir.

478
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Sir.

479
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
Take your time.

480
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
This.

481
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
This.

482
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
You will see.

483
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
The chicken and fish soup is ready.

484
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
Amita

485
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,260
sent someone to send fish bone powder

486
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
to these chicken bones.

487
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
They are so fresh.

488
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Amita.

489
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
She is so kind.

490
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Really.

491
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
She has been living in the temple for a long time.

492
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
She is not afraid to care about the tofu chicken.

493
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,260
She is so kind and filial.

494
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Of course.

495
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
She is not a filial uncle.

496
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
You treat her like a son-in-law.

497
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
You treat her like a son-in-law.

498
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
You treat her like a son-in-law.

499
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
You are different.

500
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
The same.

501
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
This is not a good idea.

502
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
It's a good idea.

503
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Mr. He.

504
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
You are 100 years old.

505
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
You are so thin.

506
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
I am 100 years old.

507
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
I am so tired of seeing people.

508
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,260
I can't even move my legs.

509
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
I can't move my legs.

510
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
But I can see the chicken.

511
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I am so happy.

512
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
I am so happy.

513
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Please.

514
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Be careful.

515
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Be careful.

516
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,260
There is love.

517
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Thank you.

518
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Thank you.

519
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
So good.

520
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
She is so beautiful.

521
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Look at her.

522
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,260
She is so handsome.

523
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
She is so beautiful.

524
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,260
She can fight with me after she is full of strength.

525
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Come on.

526
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
I am coming.

527
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
I am coming.

528
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
I am coming.

529
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
I am coming.

530
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,260
This is...

531
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
This is...

532
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
This is...

533
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
This is a good idea.

534
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
Mr. He.

535
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
You are so clever.

536
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,260
I am here to eat.

537
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,260
But I can't use the food for Mr. Ji.

538
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,260
I have to respect him.

539
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Respect him.

540
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,260
I have bought the poison.

541
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,260
I will eat it in a few days.

542
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,260
I will eat it in a few days.

543
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Right?

544
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
I will learn to eat the food.

545
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,260
Otherwise, I will have to pay for the price.

546
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Yes.

547
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
I can eat the food.

548
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
What is the name of the rice?

549
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Don't eat the chicken.

550
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
It has been half a day.

551
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
It is not fresh.

552
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Look.

553
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,260
It is not fresh.

554
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
What do you mean?

555
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
The rice of the chicken is heavy, right?

556
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
The rice is also in the soup.

557
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
The rice is also in the soup.

558
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Right?

559
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,260
It can be hot from the outside.

560
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
The rice is also in the soup.

561
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,260
It is not fresh.

562
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
It is not fresh.

563
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
It is not fresh.

564
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Mr. Ji.

565
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
There are a few workers in the police station.

566
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
They are not done yet.

567
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,260
Look at the rice.

568
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,260
It is not fresh.

569
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Leave it to the servants.

570
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I will do it.

571
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
I will do it.

572
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,260
What are you doing?

573
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
I am in a good mood.

574
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,260
I want to feed the chicken.

575
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,260
I am in a good mood.

576
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I want to feed the chicken.

577
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Why are you so sad?

578
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Why do you not like my happiness?

579
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
Do you want me to take your 50 times?

580
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Do you want me to be happy?

581
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,260
I dare not.

582
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
I will feed the chicken today.

583
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Do you want it?

584
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
I am done.

585
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
I have been in a bad mood.

586
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
I have eaten the rice of the goose.

587
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,260
I have been in a bad mood.

588
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
I have eaten the rice of the goose.

589
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,260
I have been in a bad mood.

590
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,260
I have been in a bad mood.

591
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,260
I have eaten the rice of the goose.

592
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Have you come back from the He's Temple?

593
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Master Li,

594
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Don't be afraid.

595
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,260
He's Temple will not return today.

596
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
What about Uncle Zhao?

597
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
He is not coming back.

598
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
He is not coming back.

599
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
He is not coming back.

600
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Uncle Zhao.

601
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Isn't this Uncle Zhao?

602
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Isn't this Uncle Zhao?

603
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,260
I am the master of the holy seal.

604
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
You dare to lie to me?

605
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
Master of the holy seal.

606
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
I will go to see him.

607
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
You go.

608
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
You are going to be the master of the holy seal.

609
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
The whole army is silent.

610
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
The night is so late.

611
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
You took the rice.

612
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
You put the rice.

613
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,260
No one else is in the hands.

614
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,260
You are the master of the holy seal.

615
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
You...

616
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
You have made everyone...

617
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
I will kill you.

618
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,260
You are a bastard.

619
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
You bastard.

620
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Uncle Zhao.

621
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Master Li.

622
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Master Li.

623
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,260
The mirror is in the temple.

624
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
So what?

625
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
What's wrong?

626
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
I came here this time.

627
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,260
I want to ask you to open the four holy seals.

628
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
So that we can do something for the holy seal.

629
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
I see.

630
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
You lost it.

631
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
No.

632
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,260
I know that it is hard to do this.

633
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
I am not a master of the holy seal.

634
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
I have several more holy seals in my hand.

635
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
It is easier to do.

636
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,260
So...

637
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
The new holy seal...

638
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
It is in the tomb.

639
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,260
I found a holy girl named Tong.

640
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,260
She said that her holy seal is also a special one.

641
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,260
I heard that the most of the animals are animals.

642
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
I am the master of the holy seal.

643
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I am the only one who can do something for the holy seal.

644
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
It is easy.

645
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
I am the master of the holy seal.

646
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
This season,

647
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Tong is in the temple.

648
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,260
Master Li is in the temple.

649
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
No.

650
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
If there is a fire,

651
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,260
he can't go to the temple.

652
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
I hope it is convenient for him.

653
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Otherwise, he will be in trouble.

654
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
He will be in trouble.

655
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
What kind of a fire?

656
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,260
I have several unresolved soldiers in my house.

657
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I will send them to Master Li.

658
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
I will do it.

659
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
Master Zhao,

660
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,260
I want both the holy seal and the holy seal.

661
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
I want both the holy seal and the holy seal.

662
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
You know that

663
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
the holy seal is very long.

664
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,260
You don't have to use the fire.

665
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
I will go back to Chang'an anyway.

666
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
I will die here.

667
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Or in the last few months,

668
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
you let me live in pain.

669
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Or you kill me.

670
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
Come.

671
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Master Li.

672
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
You kill me.

673
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
I am the master of the holy seal.

674
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
I can see you in a misunderstanding.

675
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
Kill me.

676
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Why do you do this?

677
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
If you don't give me the holy seal,

678
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,260
then you let the holy seal come out and give me a piece of the holy seal.

679
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
The holy seal.

680
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
I know you are inside the holy seal.

681
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
Come out and see me.

682
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Now the holy seal is ordered to lead the man.

683
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
You are the holy seal of leading the man.

684
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
Can't you hear me?

685
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Come out and see me.

686
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Or in Chang'an,

687
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
there is a saying.

688
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
You still have a look.

689
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
I can't live.

690
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
No.

691
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
I can't live.

692
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,260
I will die wherever I am.

693
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
I will die wherever I am.

694
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
You can't die.

695
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
No.

696
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
I will die wherever I am.

697
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
This.

698
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
This.

699
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
This.

700
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
This.

701
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Wait for me.

702
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
I will come back.

703
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
There must be someone behind this.

704
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Give me a check.

705
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Check.

706
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
Master Li.

707
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
Master Li.

708
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Did you get it?

709
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Where did you get the poison?

710
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
The dog is not clear.

711
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Now the big trouble is even worse.

712
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
But he is still a coward.

713
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
How dare he attack me?

714
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
I don't know.

715
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Master Li.

716
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
The holy seal is here.

717
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,260
He wants to have four fours.

718
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,260
He is so arrogant.

719
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
He didn't get enough.

720
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
He won't give up.

721
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
Actually,

722
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,260
the ceremony was held on June 1st.

723
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
And it was the end.

724
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Besides, he came from Chang'an.

725
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
We don't know if he has anything

726
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
to do with it.

727
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
If he can't deal with it,

728
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
let the people in Yongxin

729
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,260
catch the pen and make a big article

730
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
in the court.

731
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
They are in the south.

732
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,260
It's hard to deal with it.

733
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Zhao.

734
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
I am so annoyed.

735
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,260
There is a horse-drawn cloud on the left.

736
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
There is a stone on the right.

737
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,260
Do you think the people are annoying?

738
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,260
I am so annoyed.

739
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
I am so annoyed.

740
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
This time,

741
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
he is so annoying.

742
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
He is so annoying.

743
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Make a big article.

744
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Let him make some money.

745
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
On June 1st,

746
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
we will take care of the people in Chang'an.

747
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
We will tie him up.

748
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
We will use the court's name

749
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,260
to calculate the accounts of the servants.

750
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
How many people are injured.

751
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
Let them get out of here.

752
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Isn't it better?

753
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Zhao.

754
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
Zhao.

755
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
I am not late.

756
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Go.

757
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,260
I am full of chicken.

758
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Go.

759
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
Go.

760
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Master,

761
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
it's cold.

762
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Uncle Zhao.

763
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Master Li.

764
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Yes.

765
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Four of the servants you want are ready.

766
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Thank you.

767
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Thank you.

768
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Kill him.

769
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Yes.

770
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Get ready.

771
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
You are so annoying.

772
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
You are so annoying.

773
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
It's not good to kill people.

774
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
If you die,

775
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
buy another one.

776
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
It's not good to die in the house.

777
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
Give me the key.

778
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
Yes.

779
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
I am leaving.

780
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Wait.

781
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Didn't you say that people are so annoying?

782
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
There is no one.

783
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
This servant takes away.

784
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Take a good look at this person.

785
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
This is a mute.

786
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
You are in the south.

787
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,260
There is a man around.

788
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,260
Run around.

789
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
He is alone.

790
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
He is so annoying.

791
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,260
He can't live without you.

792
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
I am sorry.

793
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
I can't live without you.

794
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
He can't live without you.

795
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Let me take him away.

796
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
Can you understand what I am saying?

797
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Do you have a name?

798
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
No.

799
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Then I will give you a name.

800
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
I will give you a name.

801
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Then you can call me.

802
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
I am a lawyer.

803
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Then you can call me Ali.

804
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
Ali.

805
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Ali.

806
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Ali.

807
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
You can follow me.

808
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Don't be afraid.

809
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
I won't hit you.

810
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
I won't hit you.

811
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Let's go.

812
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
I will put the lantern there.

813
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,260
Okay.

814
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
How much is this?

815
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Two bowls of rice.

816
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Two bowls?

817
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
My rice is like a bowl of rice.

818
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
One bowl is not short.

819
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
There are many filling.

820
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
The skin is thin.

821
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
The filling is thin.

822
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
You can eat a bowl of rice at once.

823
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Then give me half a bowl.

824
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
One bowl for one bowl.

825
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Give me two bowls.

826
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
No.

827
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
How can I eat half a bowl?

828
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
Didn't you say that the filling is full?

829
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Yes.

830
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Sit.

831
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
Sit.

832
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Come on, Ali.

833
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,260
We have to fill our stomachs first.

834
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
Then we can do something.

835
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
Sit.

836
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Wait for me here.

837
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Wait for me here.

838
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
Sit.

839
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
He is squatting.

840
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
He is squatting.

841
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
He is squatting.

842
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
He is listening to me.

843
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
You change this.

844
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
We will do something about the transfer of the interest.

845
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
You should wear a leather jacket.

846
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Mr. Lin, is it not done yet?

847
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,260
I finished eating.

848
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
You can eat.

849
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
You can do it.

850
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,260
Mr. Lin, please.

851
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
Be careful of your feet.

852
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Be careful of your feet.

853
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Mr. Lin, please.

854
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Four acupuncture points.

855
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Please have a look.

856
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,260
My master is so familiar.

857
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
He is so nice.

858
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
Mr. Li is a great man.

859
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,260
He is a man of the world.

860
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,260
That's good.

861
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,260
That's the four free acupuncture points.

862
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,260
You are so good at it.

863
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
You give me a good acupuncture point.

864
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,260
I will pay you a lot of money.

865
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,260
I have a lot of money.

866
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,260
I will pay you back.

867
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Thank you, Mr. Su.

868
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,260
I am so happy to have you.

869
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Mr. Li.

870
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Mr. Li.

871
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Come.

872
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Mr. Li.

873
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Tong.

874
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,260
This is what I gave you.

875
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
Here.

876
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,260
Here.

877
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
What?

878
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
It's not you.

879
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
Come here.

880
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,260
You come back.

881
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
This is for you.

882
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Is it a gift?

883
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
What?

884
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,260
You are not giving me 100 gold for three months.

885
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,260
It's a revenge.

886
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
You are talking business with me.

887
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
I have been drinking with you for a long time.

888
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,260
Last time, I didn't understand the style of you.

889
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
I apologize.

890
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,260
Tong is smart and smart.

891
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,260
He is a good man.

892
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
You are sorry.

893
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,260
But I am not going to forgive you.

894
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
Let's not talk about this.

895
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
Mr. Su.

896
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,260
Help me to talk about the opening of the road.

897
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,260
I will do my best to prepare for the experiment.

898
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
OK.

899
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
About the man and woman.

900
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
It's time for you to show your true colors.

901
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,260
I am afraid that Amita will be too deep in the end.

902
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,260
Is there a man in Li Nan who is not a good man?

903
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
I have accepted it.

904
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
I am a hero.

905
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,260
Is he a lost soul?

906
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Look.

907
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,260
I am Ma Guiyun.

908
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,260
I like horses in Chang'an.

909
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,260
There is a nickname Sa Qima.

910
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,260
Ma Heyi.

911
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,260
You are not Ma Guiyun?

912
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
You are Ma Guiyun.

913
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,260
You can't do anything about it.

914
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,260
I am in Li Nan's head.

915
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,260
But the red sky is gone.

916
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,260
The mood is in Chang'an.

917
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,260
Let people have a good time.

918
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,260
Who has touched my shoes?

919
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,260
I am not good at the end of the day.

920
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I just want to eat something delicious.

921
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,260
I am in a dream,

922
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,260
I am in the mountains and rivers.

923
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,260
I can't hear the sound of the wind.

924
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,260
I can't hear the sound of the wind.

925
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,260
I want to see the world of the world of the people.

926
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,260
But I only see a man crying.

927
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,260
A little bit.

928
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,260
We can't take it.

929
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:13,260
It's the Communist Party of the sky.

930
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,260
The wind is blowing.

931
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,260
I can't see the world.

932
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,260
I can't hear the sound of the wind.

933
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,260
I want to see the world of the people.

934
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,260
But I only see a man crying.

935
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,260
Before the Communist Party of the sky.

936
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:51,260
A little bit.

937
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,260
I can't hear the sound of the wind.

938
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,260
I can't hear the sound of the wind.

939
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,260
I want to see the world of the people.

940
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,260
But I only see a man crying.

941
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,260
I can't hear the sound of the wind.
