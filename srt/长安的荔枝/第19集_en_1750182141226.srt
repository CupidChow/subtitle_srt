00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
the

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,000
other

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ChenZheng are among the two leaders of the 701 delimiting fest is not your current revelation.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He will get you your farm, which will help you fulfill your dream of making.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
Eat.

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
I told you, no matter where you go,

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,960
you'll want to share your delicious food with me.

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,160
You'll also want to share your delicious food with me.

54
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
Eat.

55
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
Eat, son.

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,760
Eat.

57
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,360
Here.

58
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,760
Here.

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,600
You're not hungry?

60
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm not hungry.

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm going to use the stove to burn the firewood.

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,160
I remember his face when he was cooking soup.

63
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
This...

64
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,080
Next time, you'll make a pancake for me.

65
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,720
You know how to eat.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,680
Don't panic. Don't panic, uncle.

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
I came here to ask you about someone.

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,160
This is A Tu.

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,840
The two-starred one was the one you introduced to my grandpa, right?

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,160
Didn't you say

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,240
you don't want to mention the thing that year?

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,640
How did you ask?

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Because I heard that he's not dead.

74
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
Who said that?

75
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,960
The firewood, the stove, he's also burning the firewood.

76
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,240
If you're not honest,

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
I'll throw you down and see Luo Mo.

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
I really don't know.

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,720
Don't scare me.

80
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,640
Hurry up.

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,480
Uncle, don't listen to nonsense.

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,600
It's okay.

83
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,840
Uncle, if you can tell me,

84
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
I can give you a medical treatment.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,440
Here.

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
You have many chances to get a medical treatment.

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm here to ask my neighbor, Yuan Qingtang,

88
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
to ask him to take care of many things here.

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
What's his name?

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
His name is Zheng Han Dong.

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Zheng?

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
He's not even a few steps away from the business.

93
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
I'll take you there.

94
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
You don't have any money left.

95
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Thank you, brother.

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
How can you be so generous?

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
I'm A Tu.

98
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Okay.

99
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Uncle.

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
I have a good chance to make money recently.

101
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
You should consider it.

102
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
How can you say that?

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
You've cheated too many times.

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
There's always only one way to go.

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,440
You can say that you've cheated too many times.

106
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,440
There's always only one way to go.

107
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,440
You can say that you've had a good chance to make money recently.

108
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
You...

109
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
This is different.

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
This is absolutely reliable.

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
This is the second one.

112
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Here.

113
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Let me tell you something.

114
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,440
I've been working on something called the sea urchin.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
As long as you buy a urchin,

116
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
and the team will make money,

117
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
you'll have a share of the money.

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,440
The team will make money.

119
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Is it a bloodbath?

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
No way.

121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Do you know whose house this team is?

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Whose?

123
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
Sea urchin.

124
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,440
The biggest group of men in Nanyang is him.

125
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
He's like his family.

126
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,440
He won't lose money if the team makes money.

127
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,440
So you think it's worth buying a sea urchin?

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,440
If it's a sea urchin,

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
it's worth it.

130
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Yes.

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,440
But you can't just pick it up.

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,440
The outside world is already crazy.

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,440
I just have to make this money.

134
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
I don't need to work so hard here.

135
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
I can go back to the team and play with the team.

136
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm injured now.

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm so sorry.

138
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,440
The sea urchin is so hot.

139
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Who would want to make such a big money?

140
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Is this a tattoo?

141
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
It's for the lady.

142
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
This person is mysterious.

143
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Don't ask too much.

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
But make sure it's a tattoo.

145
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Isn't this your distant cousin?

146
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
You introduce him to me.

147
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,440
He's willing to buy this kind of sea urchin.

148
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
He'll make money.

149
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
He can't afford to split up.

150
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Then you'll be rich.

151
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
The old man doesn't have the face.

152
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
He can only make money.

153
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Don't do this fat hen.

154
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Whee !!!

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
So hot!

156
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Help me.

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
This trick was done by太陽.

158
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
And bass has TensorFlow.

159
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
I...

160
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I told you, I'm not dead.

161
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
After he's recovered,

162
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
he left.

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,880
I have nothing to do with that Jijie.

164
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
He didn't let me say that

165
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
I've seen him before.

166
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,200
He can't let others know that he's still alive.

167
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,800
He said

168
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,240
he was in danger.

169
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,600
Then you've never seen him before?

170
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Once.

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
He asked me

172
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,000
to give him some money

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,480
in the rain.

174
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,480
I helped him run away.

175
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
I've never seen him before.

176
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,440
When you saw him,

177
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
where were you?

178
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,040
In a small hotel.

179
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
You asked for it yourself?

180
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
I asked him.

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
In the years of Lingnan,

182
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,840
he's known so many people.

183
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
He's sold so much.

184
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,320
He can't tell the result.

185
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,200
We have no point.

186
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,320
He knows

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
the river and the river.

188
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,000
He's only in the yard.

189
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
I thought

190
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,920
that the river and the river

191
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
had several businesses.

192
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,520
But they were all taken away by the river and the river.

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,840
Do you think he's lucky?

194
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,560
He also wanted to find the map.

195
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,360
He wanted to find out

196
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,440
how his father was doing.

197
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,560
It's too deep.

198
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
It's useless to tell you.

199
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
It's not good for you.

200
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,840
It's not easy to find out.

201
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,560
He said that the hotel is called Shenming.

202
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,960
It's...

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,840
Du Kangli.

204
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,880
Where are you going?

205
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
To see Brother Jian.

206
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,680
Brother Jian.

207
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,760
Isn't this the warehouse?

208
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,680
Do you know what's in there?

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,920
What's the difference?

210
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,560
This warehouse is big.

211
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
It's a building on both sides.

212
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,520
It's like a bridge.

213
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,240
The warehouse is smaller than the one in Lingnan.

214
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,440
I only see this kind of warehouse in one place.

215
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,960
Where?

216
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,480
In the green garden.

217
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,840
A big fish tank came.

218
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,360
I saw it on the big lake.

219
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,000
If I'm not mistaken,

220
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,960
this should be the special shop

221
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,200
for the big fish tank.

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
It appeared on the side of the hotel.

223
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
It means that there was a big fish tank

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
who came to this hotel.

225
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
If you can find a big fish tank,

226
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
where is the place

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,480
where A Tu lives?

228
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Mr. Li.

229
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
This is the big fish tank.

230
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,320
It's almost at the edge of the city.

231
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,560
Almost no one lives here.

232
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,000
Let me have a look.

233
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,520
Mr. Li.

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
OK, let's see what's in here.

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,440
What do you say?

236
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,000
Look, he's not beautiful anymore

237
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,420
Who's that?

238
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,580
We're Huo has come

239
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,280
Do you have a needle?

240
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
Where's your master?

241
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,200
I went out secretly.

242
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Can't you see?

243
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
I can't see.

244
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,880
But I'm used to it.

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,800
Are you selling things?

246
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm missing a needle.

247
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,560
Well...

248
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,200
Yes.

249
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,840
Uncle Huo Lang,

250
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,360
he's carrying a lot of things.

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,960
He's going to take them.

252
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,760
He's going to buy them.

253
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,520
Come on.

254
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
He has a way. Wait a minute.

255
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,840
Take it.

256
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
He has a way. Come back soon.

257
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,400
Do you want to do embroidery?

258
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,880
I'm a girl.

259
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm almost as old as you.

260
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,040
I also learn embroidery.

261
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,240
Come on.

262
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,760
Look.

263
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,760
This is his embroidery.

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,120
I can't see.

265
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
Can I touch it?

266
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,240
Touch it.

267
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,400
Like this.

268
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,160
Touch it.

269
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,840
What's this embroidery?

270
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Okay.

271
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll take it.

272
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,080
It looks like a needle.

273
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
You know it too?

274
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,720
Actually, I've been learning embroidery.

275
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Although I can't see,

276
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,720
I can touch it too.

277
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,320
You're a good student.

278
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,320
Why do you say that?

279
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,040
You say that the touch of a blind person

280
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
is sensitive.

281
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
You can make things very delicate.

282
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,240
I see your fingers are so delicate.

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
You can learn this.

284
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,480
Really?

285
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,760
But I can't leave home.

286
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,200
Your grandmother doesn't let you learn it?

287
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,760
I don't have a grandmother.

288
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm just with a uncle.

289
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
I haven't mentioned it to him.

290
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Besides,

291
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
I won't want a blind person in the embroidery.

292
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Of course not.

293
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,080
Do you know Chang'an?

294
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
I heard that

295
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,680
that's where the blind people live.

296
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,400
Yes.

297
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,360
There are many famous

298
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,640
embroiderers in Chang'an.

299
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,560
They are all masters.

300
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,960
They embroider the patterns

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
like Dragon Wind and the City Wall,

302
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Qilin and Xianrui,

303
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
and Mu Dan and Zheng Yan.

304
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,480
They're good.

305
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
They're so good.

306
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,240
I can't think of these patterns.

307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,320
What did they do?

308
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,720
They used their heart.

309
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,560
They did something

310
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,720
that can be done

311
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,320
as long as you use your heart.

312
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,120
Besides your uncle,

313
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,400
do you have any other adults?

314
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,480
I can talk to them.

315
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,960
No.

316
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,920
Only me and my uncle are two people in our family.

317
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,680
So...

318
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,840
Are you the one who did it?

319
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,160
No.

320
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
I was born a blind person.

321
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,360
I've been wandering around

322
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,400
for a while.

323
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,160
I walked in here

324
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
in a muddle-headed manner.

325
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,960
My uncle gave me a piece of paper.

326
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,760
Then I told him about me.

327
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,280
He left me.

328
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
He's a good man.

329
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,280
Why did he call you?

330
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,600
I don't know.

331
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,200
Did he tell you about yourself?

332
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,200
No.

333
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,520
What?

334
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,360
They alas...

335
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,280
Do you know

336
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,200
why Leiden is so famous?

337
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,920
Of course.

338
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,480
So they don't really half-inaria itching

339
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
for him?

340
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,140
Sorry.

341
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
We can't realize when a child

342
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
is half-dead.

343
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,300
Maybe because of the rewinds.

344
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,880
Maybe cuz of being a girl.

345
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,360
And we can't...

346
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,280
Can we find him?

347
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,320
She...

348
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,240
Does she look special?

349
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,320
Special?

350
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,360
Yeah.

351
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,320
I can't see anything.

352
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
No one

353
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
You are this

354
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
This

355
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
You see this, I say

356
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
This is real

357
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Here it comes

358
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
This is real

359
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
It's not only real

360
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
What do you want?

361
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
This is real

362
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
You are in the secret cake

363
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Thank you

364
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Delicious

365
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
How much money do you really want?

366
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
No money, no money

367
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
How about it?

368
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
I should kill him

369
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
This little girl's uncle

370
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Said he was going to fish

371
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
He will come back in three days

372
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
This can't be so serious

373
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Then

374
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I will come back early

375
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Little girl said there are two outsiders to ask

376
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
I will definitely improve the situation

377
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
If you can't say it, you can run early

378
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Do you have a familiar embroidery method?

379
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Yes

380
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,320
But my past assistant is an embroidery

381
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
You have to be quiet

382
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Let's go

383
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Have you forgotten something?

384
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
No

385
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I am here to ask you

386
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Do you really want to go to the embroidery

387
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
I really want to go

388
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
But I have to wait for uncle to come back

389
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
And discuss with him

390
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
See, that's it

391
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
This uncle

392
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Known the owner of the embroidery

393
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
He can go back and ask

394
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
Whether the owner is willing to take you

395
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Really?

396
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Really

397
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Then I will visit you three days later

398
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,320
If your uncle comes back early

399
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Don't tell him about this

400
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
If things don't work out

401
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
What if he doesn't wake up

402
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
When this thing is settled

403
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
You give him another surprise, okay?

404
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Why are you so nice to me

405
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Didn't I say

406
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
I have a daughter and I am with you

407
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,320
How about this

408
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
I put my daughter's embroidery

409
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
This handkerchief

410
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
As our agreement, okay?

411
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Okay, then we will make a deal

412
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
I will make a deal

413
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Did you find out about A Tu

414
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,320
We have found his residence

415
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
We can confirm that he is not dead

416
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
What did I say

417
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
What did I say

418
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Have you seen him

419
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
I didn't see him

420
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
He said he went fishing

421
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Come back in three days

422
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
So can we find a solution

423
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
We are just waiting for A Xin

424
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I can definitely find

425
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Is it right, uncle

426
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
I never said anything wrong

427
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Okay

428
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Tonight

429
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
This A Jiu and A Hao

430
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
They two want to dance

431
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Then we can celebrate together

432
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Celebrate together

433
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Congratulations

434
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Congratulations

435
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Congratulations

436
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Congratulations

437
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Let's have a drink

438
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Uncle

439
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
I am not good at Chinese

440
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
I am good at Japanese

441
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
But I want to have a new drink

442
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I will drink a toast

443
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
I will give you a toast

444
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
A toast

445
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Cheers

446
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
I will drink a toast

447
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,320
We are all in the same boat

448
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,320
We are all busy with the transfer of interest

449
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,320
I have no chance to say thank you to you

450
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
It's really a shame

451
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
The transfer of interest

452
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
It concerns my family's life

453
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
I have to be patient

454
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
I have to be patient

455
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
So I can have a big sister

456
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
So

457
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,320
I am very grateful for your help

458
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
I am very grateful

459
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
One day, the interest will be transferred to Chang'an

460
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
I will not forget the great kindness of the people

461
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,320
The most important thing today is to wish A Jiu

462
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
And A Hao

463
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
And A Hao

464
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
A lot of children will come to the business

465
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Cheers

466
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Cheers

467
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Cheers

468
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Cheers

469
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Congratulations

470
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Uncle

471
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
I am very grateful

472
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Go

473
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Don't let people harm you

474
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
I am sorry

475
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
I met you

476
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
You are the best

477
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
You are the best

478
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
You are the best

479
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
You are the best

480
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
You are the best

481
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
You are the best

482
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
You are the best

483
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
You are the best

484
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
I have been thinking

485
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
I have never seen a person like you

486
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
who is so clean

487
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
like you

488
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
He said that if you are successful

489
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
You can have a good relationship

490
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
with your grandson

491
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
If you are successful

492
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
You can have a good relationship

493
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
with your grandson

494
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
At that time

495
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
I don't know

496
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
where is the heaven

497
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Here, this drink

498
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
I will drink with you

499
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Cheers

500
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Cheers

501
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
This wine

502
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
I am very strict

503
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Compared to the people

504
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
who are in the mirror

505
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
You are a big fool

506
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
I can't lie to you

507
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
when I am stupid

508
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
But you are stupid

509
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
You are

510
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
so smart

511
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
and determined

512
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
You are so smart

513
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
and smart

514
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Your talent

515
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
is so good

516
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
I

517
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
I don't know

518
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
how to behave

519
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
I don't know

520
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
I am a famous figure

521
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
I will only count

522
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
I am a famous figure

523
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
I don't know how to behave

524
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
I

525
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
tell you a secret

526
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
I am a famous figure

527
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
I am a famous figure

528
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
I just want to

529
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
I want to

530
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
look at a few clothes

531
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
You are so smart

532
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
and smart

533
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
But later

534
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
I smell

535
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
a smell of

536
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
a bitter taste

537
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
So I open my eyes

538
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
and decide to

539
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
make a mistake

540
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Don't laugh

541
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Don't

542
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
look down on me

543
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I will not

544
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Mr. Su

545
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
If you didn't

546
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
give me the money

547
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
I am afraid I will steal the money

548
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
I will put

549
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
your kindness

550
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
I will do it

551
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
I will do it

552
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I will do it

553
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I will do it

554
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,320
I will do it

555
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I will do it

556
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I will do it

557
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
I will do it

558
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I will do it

559
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I will do it

560
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I will do it

561
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
I will do it

562
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
I will do it

563
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I will do it

564
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I will do it

565
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I will do it

566
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
I will do it

567
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
I will do it

568
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
I will do it

569
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
I will do it

570
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
I will do it

571
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Together

572
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I will do it

573
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
I will do it

574
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
I will do it

575
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
I will do it

576
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
I will do it

577
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
I will do it

578
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
I will do it

579
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
I will do it

580
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
I will do it

581
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,320
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

582
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
I'm in a dream on this road

583
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Can't hear the sound of my crazy voice

584
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,320
I want to see the world of the Chinese people

585
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,320
But I only see a man

586
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,320
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

587
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,320
I'm in a dream on this road

588
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Can't hear the sound of my crazy voice

589
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I want to see the world of the Chinese people

590
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,320
But I only see a man

591
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,320
I want to see the world of the Chinese people

592
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
It's rare to see him so happy

593
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,320
He is a young man, I'm afraid it's because of the family

594
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Only when he is drunk can he be so relaxed

595
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
I'm so happy

596
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,320
The heart of this city is also complicated for us

597
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,320
I'm just worried about you and they're too close

598
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,320
What will happen if there is no disaster

599
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,320
No way, you won't harm me

600
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
He is different from others

601
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
I know he is sincere

602
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,320
I can see that he really wants to help you

603
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
But there are too many problems in this world

604
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
There are many things that he can't do

605
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
If that day comes

606
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,320
You still want to maintain this position

607
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
It's impossible

608
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Mr. Kong La, after three days

609
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
A Tuo can meet my brother-in-law

610
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,320
Then we can ask who is the one who left the sea

611
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,320
The matter of Qi Jinglu will be revealed

612
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Don't talk about three days

613
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
There are many hours and hours

614
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
A Tuo has been in the camp for many years

615
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
He is naturally not only staring at us

616
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,320
If he hears the wind, he won't be sick

617
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Remember, don't let Amita know about this

618
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
In case there is any unnecessary news

619
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Yes, yes

620
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Don't worry, I'm a good and safe man

621
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
If it's not for the mission

622
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,320
I will never approach Amita

623
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,320
And I will also tell my sister and brother-in-law

624
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Don't be so angry when you meet

625
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Please leave a message

626
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Wait for my good news

627
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Any place with light

628
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Mr. Kong will be gone

629
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
With light?

630
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Goodbye

631
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Mr. Kong

632
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Mr. Kong

633
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Mr. Zhao, why are you here?

634
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
What's the matter?

635
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,320
I've been looking at you for years

636
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
You are alone in this business

637
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,320
With those businessmen who are trying to force you

638
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,320
You earned a lot of money for your own safety

639
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
But you are a chess player

640
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
People think you are a man of heart

641
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
I am a chess player

642
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
I am a man of heart

643
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
I am a chess player

644
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
I am a chess player

645
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,320
And I don't know how to use blind ink

646
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Mr. Zhao is here to tell me this

647
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I just want to tell you

648
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
There is a chance

649
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I can change your destiny

650
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Amita?

651
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Or me?

652
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I am getting more and more confused

653
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Amita

654
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,720
Amita found out a true story.

655
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,320
Old things

656
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,320
used to steal a piece of the grass.

657
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,520
The tiger knew the wall

658
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,120
and drove it out of the building.

659
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,120
The tiger was on the sea and was on the sea.

660
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,920
Then it broke the old things' way of life.

661
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,920
How could the old things' work

662
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,320
not be a killer?

663
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,720
Now,

664
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Lee Shantou is looking for a man called A Tu.

665
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,920
This A Tu

666
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,320
used to be a former guest.

667
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,920
There was a miracle.

668
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,720
When the most powerful Aibun people

669
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,120
suddenly left 2,000 states,

670
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,720
A Tu was the one who was in charge.

671
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
The matter was just closed.

672
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Your father was in a deep state of life.

673
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,320
But now I remember

674
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,720
that he knew something in advance.

675
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
I'm going to tell A Tu today

676
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
that he knows A Tu.

677
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,320
Maybe

678
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,120
he will teach me.

679
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,320
A Tu in charge.

680
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,320
He's dead.

681
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,720
He knows A Tu.

682
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,920
A Tu was a former guest.

683
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
How could the old things

684
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
remember a famous person who died?

685
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,520
He said

686
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
that the mother was

687
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,920
a good friend of the Maitreya family.

688
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
The mother was a former guest.

689
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,920
And the most famous one,

690
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,520
he didn't know me at all.

691
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,920
There must be a reason behind it.

692
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
You mean

693
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
the old things have something to do with A Tu?

694
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,320
Yes.

695
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,120
So now,

696
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,320
who is the person who's going to be the master?

697
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Only A Tu.

698
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,520
I'm good at this.

699
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,120
A Tu can't be his master.

700
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,520
He must not be too strong.

701
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,720
I'm the master.

702
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,720
Why did you tell me this?

703
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,920
I know.

704
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,120
You're very kind to me.

705
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
I've never

706
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,920
ever been against his will.

707
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,520
I'm just trying to

708
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,720
make up for my own mistake.

709
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,520
But I still don't understand

710
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,320
why you told Amika

711
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,120
that you're going to be the master.

712
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,520
I saw you last time.

713
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,920
I know you care about

714
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
your father's past.

715
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
Now, who's going to be the master?

716
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,920
Who can take away

717
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
the truth?

718
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,920
Amika is going to be the master

719
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
and she must be strong.

720
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,920
Then the master

721
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,520
will be the master.

722
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,120
I'm afraid I'm going to be the master

723
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
today.

724
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,320
I can't wait to

725
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,320
wear the clothes.

726
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,120
But the master is a good man.

727
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Maybe

728
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,320
he's a good man.

729
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
But I can't

730
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,320
wear the clothes

731
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,320
that are good for my health.

732
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
I've said everything.

733
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
You can't do anything.

734
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
I'm leaving.

735
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,120
A Tu is going to be the master

736
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
in the next three days.

737
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,120
No one

738
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
will be faster

739
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
than the master in the next three days.

740
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
I'm leaving.

741
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Are you sure

742
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,320
your uncle is coming back today?

743
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Did he come back

744
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,520
in the past?

745
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
No.

746
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,120
When uncle comes back,

747
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,720
he'll prepare the food for a few days.

748
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,320
He won't come back late.

749
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,320
I'll prepare some food for you.

750
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,320
My brother-in-law

751
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,320
has been in A Tu's room for a day.

752
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
He didn't come back.

753
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,520
Will there be any trouble?

754
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
Will A Tu be taken away by the He Ci family?

755
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,720
Our informant sent news

756
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
that the He Ci family

757
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
is also guarding near the house.

758
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,720
It seems that the He Ci family

759
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,920
has gone through a storm.

760
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Where is A Tu?

761
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,320
Master Hang,

762
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
when we caught A Tu,

763
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,920
he just wanted to jump over the ship and escape.

764
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
He said that he had something to say

765
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
and he was suspicious.

766
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
You can't trust him.

767
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
A Tu.

768
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,120
I'm the daughter of the sea tiger.

769
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm the leader of the tiger business.

770
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,720
I'll take my credit card.

771
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
I won't harm you.

772
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,720
I just need you to tell me

773
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,520
the truth about the fire in the seven-storey building.

774
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,920
Your eyes are different from your aunt's.

775
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,920
I don't care what you're afraid of.

776
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Who are you afraid of?

777
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,320
As long as you tell the truth,

778
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
I can protect you.

779
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
I can give you money

780
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,920
and take you to the forestry.

781
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,520
I guarantee that you'll have a good life.

782
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,320
What else is there?

783
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,120
A Tu,

784
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,920
you just need to tell me

785
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,120
that my father's death was an accident

786
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,720
or a conspiracy.

787
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,120
A Tu,

788
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
go find a wolf.

789
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,720
Give him a wound.

790
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,920
And then burn some food.

791
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,120
A Tu,

792
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
you can tell me the conditions

793
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
you want.

794
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,520
As long as I can satisfy you,

795
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,920
I'll definitely agree.

796
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,120
We'll talk when you're done.

797
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,320
Don't let anyone disturb him.

798
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,520
Mr. Hao,

799
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,720
the person in the manor is also looking for A Tu.

800
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm afraid that

801
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
he's looking for A Tu too.

802
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,520
Why don't we give A Tu to He Si?

803
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
We'll ask him in person.

804
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,120
Because I want him to give me an answer.

805
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I've seen He Si.

806
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,720
He Si.

807
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
I've seen He Si.

808
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,720
He Si.

809
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
Just talk to him.

810
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,720
He Si.

811
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
I know you've been looking for A Tu.

812
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
That A Tu

813
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,120
is now in the Chamber of Commerce.

814
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,120
How did A Tu go to Amita?

815
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
It seems that Miss has some other ideas.

816
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,720
She wants to personally examine it.

817
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,720
I think I'll have to go to Amita.

818
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
I'll go to Amita.

819
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
I'll go to Amita.

820
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
I'll go to Amita.

821
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
I think I should

822
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,120
report this to the Bureau first.

823
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
I came to tell you that

824
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,120
I was worried that you might be suspicious

825
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,120
and that your parents might be suspicious.

826
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,120
Please tell me clearly

827
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,720
and don't blame Miss.

828
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
He Si.

829
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,720
I think he must be a woman.

830
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,720
It seems that he's coming.

831
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,320
He will come eventually.

832
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
Looks like he's coming.

833
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
He Si.

834
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,720
Police身?

835
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,720
He Si.

836
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,720
Yes.

837
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
Manorma has sent some messages that

838
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,720
they've beenepsling killed at Taicheng Bay

839
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
these days.

840
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,760
We know that

841
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
Amita?

842
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
I'm going to find her.

843
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
No.

844
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Amita must be on the line.

845
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
The fire suddenly started.

846
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
He You Guang must have come to attack the army.

847
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
He should be on the line.

848
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
He Tuo, Jing Jiang,

849
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
go to the meeting room and get the news.

850
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Yes.

851
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Don't protect Amita.

852
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Amita.

853
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Why is the clothes here?

854
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Jing Jiang.

855
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,120
I think the school is very rich.

856
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Why do you remember Amita so much?

857
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Da Wu.

858
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Look,

859
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
is this the mountain of the rain?

860
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
I never know.

861
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,120
I always thought you were the best.

862
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

863
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

864
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

865
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

866
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

867
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

868
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

869
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

870
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

871
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

872
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

873
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

874
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

875
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

876
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
I'm afraid you're the best.

877
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
The End
