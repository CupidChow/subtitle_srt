1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,500
And electrician

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
plane

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The End

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 1

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Miss, I'm Zhao Xilin.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm the colleague of Wang Ping.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Erlang is on the meeting.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Please wait a moment.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems that Wang Ping is here to see you.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wang Ping is a treasure that can be learned from me.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come here.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I just want to tell you something about me.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't want to be a guest.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Get out of here.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Get out of here.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are so rude.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Get out.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Get out.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Isn't this the Dali Temple of the capital of the capital?

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Erlang, Erlang.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What are you talking about?

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Erlang.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's go.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm done drinking tea.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I haven't gone to buy it yet.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is the tea that I brought from home.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please have a look.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I haven't seen you for years.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm so impressed by your gift.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Have you read the holy book?

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm so ashamed.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are so good at writing.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm so impressed by your life.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm so impressed by your life.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
When will you come today?

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm so impressed by your life.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have three questions for you.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Please tell me.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Good.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Good.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Good.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Good.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Only the quality.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Especially the quality of the witness.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
People who don't beg for life and harm.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
People who kill and punish people.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Punish people and people who are loyal.

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
People who are loyal and people who are loyal.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm so impressed by your life.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sir, please read this.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I didn't hear what you said.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm so sorry.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What is this?

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is the flower of my teacher.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where did you get this painting from?

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't know.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's so precious.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A few days ago,

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
a few days ago,

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I didn't take the painting.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I had no choice.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I changed this painting a few meters ago.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't give it to you today.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just want to keep it as a secret.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This painting is so beautiful.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Only a few years from now,

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can keep it for a few years.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If it's a painting,

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
it's so beautiful.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then you can hang it for me.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm so sorry.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Brother Zhang,

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
it's me.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How do I do this?

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Brother Zhang, please.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't move.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't move.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't move.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't move.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't move.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't move.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't move.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The chief of the security guard has already confessed.

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He said you put the painting in his memory.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If someone wants to find out,

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
they will sell it at a high price.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then you two will be separated.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now that the people are dirty,

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
what else can we say?

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Everyone is confused.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Everyone is confused.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Confused.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The chief of the security guard has already confessed.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He said he will sell it at a high price.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Open the door.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Who in your family

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
saw my uncle in the house?

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who?

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What?

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you know how filial your uncle is

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in the house?

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How much filial your uncle is?

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How much filial your uncle is?

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You almost said it to me.

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did you really not see it?

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or did you not see it?

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or did you not see it?

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I think you are with the old chef.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't be so careless.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I dare not.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What do you dare not?

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What do you dare not?

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I tell you.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It is not difficult to investigate this matter.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go and lock that spirit shadow.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to interrogate myself.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go.

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The spirit shadow

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
took that spirit shadow away.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why did you take the spirit shadow

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
with the spirit shadow?

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That spirit shadow is too greedy.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He told me to go to the hospital

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and take the blood test.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was so worried.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I took the spirit shadow

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and gave it to him.

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I told him on purpose

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that the spirit shadow is a fake.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He is unfilial.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
In this way,

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
his spirit shadow

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
will be destroyed.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He is unfilial.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In this way,

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
his spirit shadow

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
will be under our control.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Uncle Zhao.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We need to investigate this matter.

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Si Shi.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Amita is here to visit you.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Amita.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Uncle.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I heard that you are angry again.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
These servants.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know about the emperor.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't call them.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They really think I am a dream.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't be angry.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's bad for your health.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I know.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Why are you here today?

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I came to visit you.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I heard that

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Su Liang has decided to transfer the spirit shadow

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
to you.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I heard that he has chosen

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the knight and horse skin

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to be the experiment of the transfer of the spirit shadow.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you think

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
this spirit shadow

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
really has something on him?

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What kind of a stupid thing?

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You let them fool you?

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Su Liang likes to steal the most.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He likes to be small and big.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If he didn't make the right decision,

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
he would have lost his power.

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He wouldn't steal the money.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If the transfer of the spirit shadow is really a injury,

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't let him steal the money.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He just wants to take the risk

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and threaten me in the position of the Chamber of Commerce.

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I have to suppress him.

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I want to steal the spirit shadow.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Amita.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't touch the spirit shadow.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't let it enter Chang'an.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why?

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Think about it.

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If the new spirit shadow

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
really enters Chang'an,

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
after the victory of Chang'an,

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it feels good.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Of course, it will.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There was nothing wrong with it before.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How could I be the leader at that time?

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And Lingnan is the place

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
where the emperor Liu Fang came from.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The birds are not here to pull the string.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's because of this

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
that I can be the emperor of the earth here.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can be the emperor.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But if the spirit shadow really enters Chang'an,

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
it's different.

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Lingnan will become a piece of fat meat.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Then this place will be lively.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The people of this past

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
are all the great people of Chang'an.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm here.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Chong Qiliang is a shovel machine.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It eats a few miles.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And people from Chang'an

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
are all thieves.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
By then, they will not only steal our rice,

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but also live and die.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
By then,

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Lingnan is not the place

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
where we are born.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's the place where we die.

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's still a thought.

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I just wanted to steal the machine.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I didn't expect that the machine would be red.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It would hide the murder.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But Su Liang might not think of it.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He wants to move to the mall of Chang'an.

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He doesn't want to.

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes.

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you think he is capable of this?

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He is very good at moving.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He can handle it by himself.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And,

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Anmita,

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
remember what I said.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
In this world,

244
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's hard to do something.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's hard to destroy something.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Think about it.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What will happen if Li Shande is not busy?

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I know.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You are not hungry, husband?

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Would you like some water?

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can eat.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That old man

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
found me

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
about the money for the escape.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He got the evidence?

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Luckily, I was able to get the money

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and got Ling Yinggu out.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I gave him a letter of revenge.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I told him

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
he couldn't keep his eyes on it.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are smart, husband.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are not a man.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You are not a man.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He is a man.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How about we test him?

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Fine.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Sometimes,

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you are like a stupid pig.

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You are like a cow.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Sometimes,

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you are like a fox.

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You are like a fox.

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No matter how old you are,

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you will die.

276
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He can't see it.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He will say he saw it.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He will take this opportunity to beat him.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He is a man.

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He is a man of his own.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I am a little bit old.

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I am proud of him.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He took Ling Nan to his garden.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I didn't even see my little garden.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I often took some books

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
from the library.

287
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I heard it was a poor man.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Even if he doubts his husband,

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
he wouldn't dare to do anything to his husband.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If he had a husband,

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
he wouldn't even be able to write a letter.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He is not a man.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's true.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He is a man of his own.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He can recognize his own name.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That man

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
took his own family.

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He wouldn't even write a letter

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to a filial son.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He even gave himself a face.

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If you ask me to recite it,

302
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I will recite it for him.

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know what to do.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know it very well.

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I will be the only one who can do it.

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I will be the third.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Now you are so talented.

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You are so talented.

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I am not good at using talents.

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I am good at...

312
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Good at...

313
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I am so good at it.

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I am not good at using talents.

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You are so talented.

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You are so talented.

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You are so talented.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If you are good at it,

319
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you will be the best.

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You are so talented.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You are so talented.

322
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But you almost became

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the first guard in Linan.

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Even if you came to Chang'an,

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
you wouldn't be the official.

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If my father didn't stop you from going to Chang'an,

327
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
you would have been in the palace for a long time.

328
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I...

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I...

330
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Compared to you,

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I am not as good as you.

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I have never regretted staying with you.

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I have always been jealous of you.

334
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I am very happy.

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Have you finished your work?

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The stone that you dug was made.

338
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I gave it to him as a gift.

339
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He had to take Lin Yin and take the goods to his city.

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who told him to die?

341
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Who told him to die?

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Madam,

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
why don't you take the moon for a while?

344
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I want a big house.

345
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
These years,

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Amita has helped He You Guang to make business

347
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
with the business of the merchant merchant.

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What we are going to do next

349
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
is to understand Amita and He You Guang's relationship.

350
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
After the Great Fire,

351
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He You Guang is the greatest winner.

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He is the greatest winner.

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If it is really the same as we guessed,

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the death of the tiger is related to He You Guang.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Amita,

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the father who has been grateful for his father's kindness

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
is his own father,

358
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
he will definitely be separated from He You Guang.

359
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We can punish Amita

360
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
for all the crimes of He You Guang.

361
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can take him in,

362
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but I need a word.

363
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He You Guang and I said

364
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I came to the sea of death,

365
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I didn't interfere with his affairs.

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How can I not let him suspect me?

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A man takes a woman in,

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
maybe he doesn't need a word.

369
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A woman who is good at picking a woman.

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
A man and a woman?

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's just a play.

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In Chang'an Hotel,

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
you should have seen more of this kind of skill.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's time for you to show your true colors.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
No.

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm afraid Amita will be too deep in the end.

377
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Really, don't laugh.

378
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's okay if I fall for a sin of father and son.

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I just feel unfair to him.

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Then you don't want to see Amita anymore.

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You don't want to see me anymore?

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I admit that you are very attractive,

384
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
smart and you know how to understand.

385
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But Amita,

386
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you are so thoughtful and you know how to read.

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You won't let others know.

388
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think it's just right.

389
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's just that the work of the play

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
has been wasted for some days.

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm worried...

392
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You are so stubborn,

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and you are so thoughtful.

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm not.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
These days,

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Huayuoguang will be in the city.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Amita will also help you pick a game.

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You can take this opportunity

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to explain to her.

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Good shoes.

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Good shoes.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Good shoes.

404
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You have a pair of shoes.

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
How much?

406
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
One pair.

407
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
One pair?

408
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Here, this pair.

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Good shoes and comfortable.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Buy it for me.

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hurry up.

412
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's suitable for you.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's suitable for you.

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
One bowl of money.

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
One bowl of money.

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Is the business good?

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's okay.

419
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What is this?

420
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a barbecue.

421
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's a barbecue.

422
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Enjoy yourselves.

423
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
These days,

424
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I feel like a man.

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm just a man.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't have to take the risk.

427
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When I was killed by the ghost,

428
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I hated the God.

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I let myself be in a mess.

430
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Now, I'm fine.

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm getting closer to the truth.

432
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I have only one idea.

433
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Help my father take revenge.

434
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The grudge of the old man.

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But the grudge is on Mr. Qi.

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let Mr. Qi lose his memory.

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It hurts.

438
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Now,

439
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I need to move the fake Feng Xiu Huang's task.

440
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Mr. Qi has been in Chang'an for a long time.

441
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But he never had a girlfriend.

442
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
How do you know how to be a red woman?

443
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You look a little bad.

444
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know how to be a red woman.

445
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I take care of the relationship.

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I just don't like to be in a mess.

447
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You are so stubborn.

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Mr. Qi is a good girl.

449
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He is a good girl.

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't care.

451
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm getting a good girl.

452
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is he a mysterious computer?

453
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He is chasing me.

454
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Good.

455
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I tell you,

456
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Li Nan is the best in the whole business.

457
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The best in the horse racing is also a secret.

458
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Sometimes I think about Li Shande.

459
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Where can he go to find a horse?

460
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm worried about him.

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I've thought about it.

462
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll send him to the back door.

463
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm so worried about him.

464
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Mr. Li,

465
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
why don't you go back to your hometown to try it?

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm tired of him.

467
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I can't find a donkey without a horse.

468
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He really bullied us.

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What is a great wisdom?

470
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A great wisdom is a great fool.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
A true wisdom is a true fool.

472
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The more you look at it, the more you know it.

473
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You say I'm the wisdom.

474
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Who can understand?

475
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
No one can see it.

476
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Only I know it the best.

477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's all in my head.

478
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Good.

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Good.

480
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Good.

481
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Mr. Zhao.

482
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I feel like I've met these two.

483
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I didn't expect it to be so good.

484
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's a good thing.

485
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I like you.

486
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We're fine.

487
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Let's get to the point.

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Good.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I want to choose a thousand miles.

490
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I want to play with it.

491
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You're so good at riding a horse.

492
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I dare not say that.

493
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm Ma Guiyun.

494
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I like riding horses in Chang'an.

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I have a nickname.

496
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sa Qima.

497
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I can ride a horse.

498
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I ride six horses.

499
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Six horses?

500
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's great.

501
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It means we have a lot of luck today.

502
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You and Amita will go for a few days later.

503
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's okay.

504
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I have two more horses.

505
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I just cut off three of the horses' bones.

506
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You have to help me.

507
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I can do it.

508
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm thin now.

509
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Besides,

510
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
you're so handsome and handsome.

511
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not suitable for her.

512
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm hungry.

513
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Amita.

514
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Come back.

515
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Come back.

516
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Look at this.

517
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Come on.

518
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The whole leader is the best.

519
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Remember.

520
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
My one and only Amita.

521
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You're here all the way.

522
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Just listen to your father and the guests.

523
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Amita, let me introduce you to him.

524
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Ma Guiyun and Ma Langjun.

525
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Chang'an is here.

526
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He's a famous man.

527
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ma Langjun.

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I've seen him many times.

529
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
He's a good man.

530
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He's a good man.

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He's like a fairy.

532
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I've heard that

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
a girl is a flower.

534
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
A man is a father.

535
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
A man is a merchant.

536
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I thought it was three people.

537
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But it turns out it's one person.

538
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
If I ever see a girl,

539
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
her family will definitely be

540
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
a family in the south.

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
She's a good girl.

542
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I've heard that

543
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
a man is a merchant.

544
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I didn't expect that he's so young and handsome.

545
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't dare to say that.

546
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm not good at it.

547
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're so praiseworthy.

548
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
How about

549
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
we have a talk

550
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
at the seven-star dance party?

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What?

552
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's a coincidence.

553
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The Chamber of Commerce is busy.

554
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We can't change the date.

555
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Then tomorrow.

556
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

557
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Tomorrow is good.

558
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Okay.

559
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Then congratulations.

560
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Mr. Su,

561
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
how is the horse skin and the hand?

562
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
How did it go?

563
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm going to tell you something.

564
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Amita is a horse rider.

565
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
She's a good rider.

566
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Amita

567
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
stole your perfume before?

568
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yes.

569
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Then why did she steal the horse?

570
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What does she have to do with this?

571
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't forget that

572
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Amita's father is He Youguang.

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
If you really get rid of him,

574
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
then the wealth of the two women

575
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
won't come from the government.

576
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Can you think of a way

577
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to buy Amita a horse?

578
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Amita and I are in love.

579
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll give her Pei Xiaolian.

580
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
She'll treat me as a

581
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Huang Chu Lang who goes to see my mother.

582
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
She'll be more aggressive.

583
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Although this word is not used

584
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
accurately, it's simple.

585
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
How about I go?

586
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The saint is kind and kind.

587
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'll do something for the saint.

588
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's hard to say.

589
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay.

590
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But I want to remind you

591
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Amita is hard-hearted.

592
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
She's smart and bad.

593
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But she's very developed.

594
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's not easy to be smart.

595
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You should open your mouth

596
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and give her more horses.

597
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Even if she's beaten up,

598
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
she'll be able to do the special training.

599
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

600
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Okay.

601
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Let's go.

602
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The family is worth the price.

603
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's impossible for other families to carry it.

604
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes.

605
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Hangzhou.

606
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm fine.

607
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You've worked hard.

608
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This lady from the Tang family is looking for me.

609
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Hangzhou?

610
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm Li Zhixian from Chang'an.

611
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I want to ask Hangzhou for a pair of horses.

612
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So you're Li Zhixian.

613
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You've done a lot of things.

614
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I haven't found you an old man.

615
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You came to talk to me.

616
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm sorry about what happened before.

617
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm doing business for the saint.

618
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I can't do much about it.

619
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
To be honest,

620
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm going to buy 130 horses

621
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
from Hangzhou's public money.

622
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But I'm still working on it.

623
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
What a greedy man.

624
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The world is dark.

625
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But you're so lonely.

626
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You're so lucky.

627
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm not a greedy man.

628
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm a good man.

629
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I designed four routes.

630
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The first one is the most recent route

631
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
from the capital.

632
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The third one is the north way.

633
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The fourth one is the waterway.

634
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Each route has 15 turns.

635
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The four routes need 60 turns.

636
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Each turns needs a horse, a horse, a boat and a horse rider.

637
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So I need 130 horses.

638
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Even so,

639
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
it's enough to have 100 horses.

640
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Why do you need 130 horses?

641
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm just a little bit

642
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
too lazy to do it.

643
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You're right.

644
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I bought a pair of horses for the mall.

645
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But they're all on the way.

646
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
They can't come back soon.

647
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So I can't live with this.

648
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So you can't have all the horses on the way?

649
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The goods in Dao Gang are very popular.

650
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I can't get any more.

651
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I know you're a good man.

652
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So don't waste your time here.

653
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But there's something I need to tell you.

654
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I can accept the money,

655
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
but I can't pay the debt.

656
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We're all here to pay the debt.

657
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
If the money is not paid before the flower is in bloom,

658
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
then we can take it away.

659
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The price of the price is not good.

660
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm afraid it won't last long.

661
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Hang Shou,

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
the people in the plaza

663
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
need to take care of the plaza.

664
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Can I ask for forgiveness?

665
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
As Hang Shou, I need to think about the plaza.

666
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Even if I forgive them,

667
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
other leaders won't agree.

668
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I can guarantee that

669
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
they'll pay the debt after June.

670
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Is that okay?

671
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm afraid you don't know

672
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
if you can live in June.

673
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Hang Shou,

674
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you said that the plaza was paid before the flower was in bloom.

675
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If the flower is not paid,

676
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
can the money be paid later?

677
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Can I take the flower back to the plaza?

678
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Do you think you can save it?

679
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I can.

680
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I need to see.

681
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The flowers are in my hands.

682
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They can't be in vain.

683
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'll take it back to the plaza.

684
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What if they die?

685
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You can take the plaza.

686
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Can you take care of the plaza?

687
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I've promised you one thing.

688
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't be so stubborn.

689
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Send the plaza.

690
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yes.

691
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Mr. Li, please.

692
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I've taken the flower.

693
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Mr. Li, you're so selfish.

694
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You're so hard-working.

695
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You even care about the animals.

696
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't think this person

697
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
is as dangerous as the one that Mr. Li said.

698
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He's even a little silly.

699
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He's different from other officials.

700
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He's a big man.

701
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Maybe he's pretending.

702
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He's a little naughty.

703
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's a little clumsy.

704
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He's a little bit of a genius.

705
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
If someone tries his best to help him,

706
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
he'll be in trouble.

707
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Is this a new move?

708
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
No.

709
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's just a business.

710
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I can't take advantage of it.

711
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I can't take advantage of it.

712
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I can't take advantage of it.

713
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Why don't you eat and drink?

714
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You're wasting your time on the plaza.

715
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What are you eating?

716
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm just like a firework in the plaza.

717
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm just burning.

718
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Didn't you get the money to get the experiment?

719
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You're so generous.

720
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm a lawyer.

721
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't care about the long-term.

722
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm not a lawyer.

723
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm just a helping hand

724
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
with Mr. Su's son.

725
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's not easy for him to borrow my money.

726
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Amita stole it.

727
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Tong helped me to get the money.

728
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But Amita forced me to pay the debt.

729
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Amita?

730
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Are you worried about this woman?

731
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What do you mean?

732
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Do you know her?

733
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
No. It's not me. It's Ma Guiyun.

734
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The task she's going to do is to get Amita.

735
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm not telling you this.

736
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You said Amita stole your horse.

737
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
No.

738
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I've been to the plaza.

739
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I think it's He Youguang who lost Amita.

740
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't understand.

741
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
They're going to the plaza

742
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
with the money they've earned.

743
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Why can't they get the money?

744
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The opportunity to get Amita is

745
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the opportunity for the couple.

746
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The opportunity to get the woman is

747
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
the opportunity for others.

748
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The couple is in the capital in the south.

749
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's impossible to share it with others.

750
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't understand those things.

751
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't know the human affairs.

752
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I don't care about my business.

753
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'll go to He Youguang tomorrow.

754
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's useless if you go.

755
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
He just found a reason to fight with you.

756
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What should I do?

757
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I can't do anything without a horse.

758
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'll die if I come here.

759
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I need some money.

760
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Do you still have me?

761
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Who am I?

762
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm Ma Guiyun.

763
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'll help you

764
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
if I don't return the money.

765
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You don't believe me?

766
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'll let Amita

767
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
go to the plaza

768
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and get Amita's horse.

769
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll get Amita's horse.

770
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll get Amita's horse.

771
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let's eat.

772
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Now.

773
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Brother Guiyun,

774
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
please wait.

775
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You're so busy today.

776
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,800
We are very honored to meet you again.

777
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,400
We will be waiting for you.

778
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,600
Miss, please.

779
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,000
I don't like to be in the battle.

780
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,700
I never take part in the game of business.

781
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,800
But you've come from Chang'an.

782
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
If I didn't come here to tell you,

783
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,700
I'm afraid you would misunderstand me.

784
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,500
Thank you for your sincere words.

785
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,300
I know your temperament today.

786
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,300
I won't be able to be a hero in the future.

787
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,900
I didn't want to talk about some money today.

788
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,500
I just want to give you a gift.

789
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Guiyun, don't be so mean.

790
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,900
I want to give you an advice.

791
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,500
I heard that Li Zhishi is looking for a horse.

792
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,100
And the horse on the market is all taken by Miss.

793
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,500
My advice is...

794
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,700
give it to her.

795
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,700
You came today...

796
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,300
to be Li Zhishi's guest?

797
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,900
Of course not.

798
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Although I'm from Chang'an,

799
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
our history is different.

800
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
I'm lucky to have a son.

801
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,300
How can I be a guest for Li Zhishi?

802
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,100
I just live in the same room with him.

803
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,500
Sometimes, I find out that he's calculating Lingnan's account.

804
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,100
He's a Li Zhishi?

805
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
He wants to check Lingnan's account?

806
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,900
That's too self-conscious.

807
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Don't underestimate him.

808
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,900
I've seen a lot of people like him in Chang'an.

809
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,900
Usually, people are young.

810
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,100
They have a small right to do so.

811
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,500
They will become evil.

812
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,900
He went to the boat and got close to the boat.

813
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,700
He also checked Lingnan's account.

814
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,900
He's a good person.

815
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,300
He'll find out the problem no matter what.

816
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,900
Once he's caught,

817
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,900
I believe you don't want to be caught by such a person.

818
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,900
That's just a small thing.

819
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,900
You told me this...

820
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,900
to help me.

821
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,900
I was ordered by the right-hand man to lead Lingnan to the island.

822
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
I was also given a warm-hearted loan.

823
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
You're not an outsider.

824
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,900
I won't let you down.

825
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Since you don't like the enemy,

826
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
I won't bother you anymore.

827
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,900
I've ordered some food before you came.

828
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Enjoy your meal.

829
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,900
Goodbye.

830
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Push the light out.

831
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,900
Tomorrow...

832
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Jiayin!

833
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,900
Jiayin!

834
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Who's the one who's been making me a shoe?

835
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,900
I'm not good at playing football in the middle of the day.

836
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,900
I only want to try something good for him.

837
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,900
I'm in my dream on this road.

838
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,900
I can't hear the sound of my crazy boat.

839
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,900
I want to see the world of the world of the Chinese.

840
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,900
But I only see a man who's full of joy.

841
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,900
A little bit.

842
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,900
We can't take the risk.

843
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,900
We can't bear to see the world.

844
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,900
We can't see the world without the Chinese.

845
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,900
We can't see the world without the Chinese.

846
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,900
We can't take the risk.

847
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,900
We can't check the weather.

848
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,900
We can't take the risk.

849
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Before I need to wake up...
