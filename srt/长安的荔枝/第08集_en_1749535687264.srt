00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought it was a black cat.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It seems that it is a black cat.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I thought it was a black cat.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was the first time I saw a black cat.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was the first time I saw a black cat.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,200
иров

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,200
What the hell are you doing?

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Go and get to your house.

16
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,760
I'm your wife.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,800
Is there someone living in Y royal house?

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
That's right.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,800
That is her.

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,680
Now take care of this.

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Take this.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Your goods.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Very good.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Stop.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Go.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you the general?

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Go.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go.

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You just woke up.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sorry.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I just got a red-eyed general.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You have to see if you can get into your eyes.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is a small chicken head.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's big.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a leg-line claw.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's just...

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is it?

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Look at that chicken.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's too tall.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's very angry.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's very sensitive to the inside.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think it's a good thing.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's natural to be born in the heaven and earth.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's called a war.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a life-changing environment.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a kind of a war.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The inner heart is lost.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This kind of mental state

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
is a result of the Buddha's performance.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
His fierce and good-natured heart

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
has also developed into a good thing.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
When the situation is getting better,

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
instead of playing,

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
he is not allowed to go to war today.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then I will let him go to war.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't stand for three times.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Good.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Brother Lan.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Good.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll let you have a look today, okay?

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My general is now a food and drinker.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He is a good man.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll let you see how he can win three times.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Good.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Good.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The chicken is here.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The chicken is here.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The chicken is here.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He is a good man.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He is not a left-wing man.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He is a very good man.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A good man?

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, he is not.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He is more than a devil.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There is a horse.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You are also here.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's play together.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, no, no.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the first thing that matters.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The chicken is the right thing to do in the Fight Chicken Gang.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right?

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you so anxious for?

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's been a long time.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's okay.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No one is chasing you behind.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Someone is chasing you.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The right side is behind me.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am in a hurry to go back.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't say that the right side is the Noble Consort.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You have to wait for me to finish it, right?

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My Great General is in a hurry.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have to wait for him.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Come on.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's all done.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Fight Chicken Gang.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000

Good fight.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
As the master of the temple,

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
he is as talented as a king.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Grade one,

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
he will battle style.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000

taking great red light,

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
ENS is the Boris tears.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No Off Bliss.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Prophecy�.

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes!

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There's more!

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay!

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Come on!

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What's up?

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He Sishi! He Sishi!

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Today...

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Today, there's no opponent.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No one is going to fight.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you don't fight, you'll lose.

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You've won!

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're so generous!

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've said that before.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You have to play the full three.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll be here to find you.

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When will you play the full three?

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When will you go home?

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Look at me.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll add 15 cans.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go!

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000

Add the money!

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Add 15 cans!

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Add 15 cans!

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is there anyone else?

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll...

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll borrow your chicken.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Wait a minute.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The chicken has just been beaten.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's already defeated.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
My Hongkwan General

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
is not as good as the famous.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is a insult to my general.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The war is not about the high-ranking people.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's about the three-inch grassland.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The wild grassland is big.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If you're so angry,

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you can't beat the three-year-old.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can't fight against the wind.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The strong can't be defeated.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can't wear a horse-drawn jacket.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Although your Hongkwan is a bit fierce,

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it's because of your freedom of steel.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's no need for that.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You've said that for so long.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I haven't heard anything.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you going to fight?

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Fight!

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Fight!

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
One, two, three!

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Two, three!

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Four, five, six, seven, eight!

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
General,

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
why are you so noisy?

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Five, two, three,

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
five, six, seven, eight!

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Today,

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
we'll fight for three more rounds.

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We'll fight against the strong.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We'll fight against the strong.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We'll fight against the strong.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We'll fight against the strong.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Five, two, three,

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
five, six, seven, eight!

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll take the soul away.

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Son,

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll take the whole world

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
as a beast.

237
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll take the beast.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll take the beast.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll take the beast.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll take the beast.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
General,

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll take the beast.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Take the soul away.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't think I can make any choice.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
General!

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll take the beast.

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll take the beast.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll take the beast.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Enough.

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
General,

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
you've been well all the way.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't you want to fight with me?

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've been with you for a whole morning.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why are you looking for me?

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm not done yet.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well,

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
General Zhao,

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
go get the tablet.

259
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mr. He.

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mr. Zhao,

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I was wrong last time.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You have to recite it.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll test you.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Test you?

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Recite it.

266
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Recite it.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll read it.

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You look

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
like a cop or a minister.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're lucky.

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
are you?

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm a little hanging out with me.

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
from you

274
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
Goumen

275
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,680
what so arrogant do you want to eat today?

276
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,160
I

277
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,920
goareg e round

278
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,800
start early

279
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is not good.

281
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll buy one.

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Zhao,

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you have to do it again.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Liang.

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're so innocent.

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sit down.

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Sit down.

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sit down.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Sit down.

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Sit down.

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I...

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I...

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm Tian Li.

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm Yao.

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I...

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
have...

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
light...

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
on my hand.

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm so sorry.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm so sorry.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm done.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My words are so close.

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm so proud.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm so sorry.

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm so sorry.

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm so tired.

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm so sorry.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay.

310
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm so sorry.

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm so sorry.

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Report!

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Report!

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Report!

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Report!

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm so sorry.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You ran so fast.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Are you worried?

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We're in a hurry.

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We don't have to worry about the transaction.

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll ask that right-hand man

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to be the vice president.

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Right-hand man?

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:43,960
Fire

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,680
This sugar is sweet.

327
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,800
It's salty.

328
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,120
It's a long time to put it in your mouth.

329
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
It's all in my ears.

330
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,080
If it's true,

331
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
bring it up and let me see.

332
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,920
He's not a good man!

333
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,520
He's like a horse.

334
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
He's capable and intelligent.

335
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
He's a good man.

336
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
If he's true,

337
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,600
I should be in danger.

338
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,040
Why don't we finish our deal first?

339
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,440
He's not a good man.

340
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,560
The one on the right can't wait.

341
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,160
Let him wait!

342
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,160
He's not a good man.

343
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,720
We have a competition.

344
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll finish the task right away.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
He's divided into half a machine.

346
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,360
I'm afraid it's not enough.

347
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,440
I understand.

348
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,040
He's already in my mouth.

349
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,160
It's so hard to split into half a machine.

350
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,560
What's wrong with me?

351
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,720
Let's see.

352
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,400
Yes.

353
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,320
Brother Kun.

354
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,000
Let's go and see.

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Let's go and see.

356
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
It's true.

357
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,920
Yes.

358
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,040
It's not true.

359
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Blood.

360
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,400
Where's the man?

361
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,880
He's right around the corner.

362
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,860
Wake up, Ku Shui Bird!

363
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,600
Don't make me forget you're

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
the Nosnow!

365
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,860
You go before we...

366
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,860
What's the problem?

367
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I don't know.

368
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,860
In the south, there are insects in the four seasons.

369
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,860
I'm afraid the Shi people are infected by insects and get sick.

370
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,860
If we get in a hurry, we can't stop them.

371
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
What will happen?

372
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,860
Don't talk nonsense.

373
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Come and see.

374
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm afraid they're not coming.

375
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
I'm afraid they're coming.

376
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm afraid they're coming.

377
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Don't talk nonsense.

378
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,860
Come and see if they're your colleagues.

379
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,860
Guanyuan.

380
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Guanyuan.

381
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
I'm Guanyuan.

382
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
I'm Guanyuan.

383
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
No.

384
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
I'm not going back.

385
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
I really can't go back.

386
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:32,860
They're dead?

387
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,860
Dead?

388
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Why are they dead?

389
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
What's the problem again?

390
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,860
Liang.

391
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Tell me.

392
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,860
This is a secret letter from Youxiang.

393
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,860
You can't read it.

394
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,860
Is this the medical uniform?

395
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
Yes.

396
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Of course.

397
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,860
Hello, sir.

398
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Brother Guiyun.

399
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Brother Guiyun.

400
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Since that, I'll take my leave.

401
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,860
We'll be in Chang'an.

402
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,860
We'll be in the bar.

403
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
Bar?

404
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,860
I'll be in the back.

405
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
I'll be in the back.

406
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,860
Qing'er.

407
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
Where's the manager?

408
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,860
Where's the manager?

409
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,860
I got the medicine.

410
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,860
You're here.

411
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I didn't know you were here.

412
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,860
What's the matter with the woman in the bar?

413
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
She'll be here soon.

414
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,860
She needs the money to give her son the medicine.

415
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,860
What's the matter?

416
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
I'm here to fight.

417
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,860
I thought you wouldn't come out today.

418
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
I can't.

419
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,860
You're here to learn how to make flowers?

420
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
I'll buy you some.

421
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
Okay.

422
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,860
Come with me.

423
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Don't take the boat.

424
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Why do you need so many flowers?

425
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,860
I heard from the drug owner.

426
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,860
He's a good boy.

427
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,860
I know you're all good people.

428
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
You're all poor people.

429
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
My son is still alive.

430
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,860
It's not so great to see the world.

431
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,860
As long as I have one breath,

432
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,860
I'll do everything for my son.

433
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
You're done.

434
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm done.

435
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Forgive me and i'll burn you a little.

436
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,860
My son is dead.

437
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I'm washed by the bad water and have no place to catch him.

438
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:56,860
I did everything for your son.

439
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
I will.

440
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I will.

441
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
I will.

442
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,860
I don't know if it's good to eat it in a different way.

443
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,860
I have been eating a lot these past days.

444
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,860
This morning, I had a bowl of rice and meat soup.

445
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,860
I add more cold così.

446
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,860
Then配 low caste o damaged broth.

447
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,980
It was very有香

448
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
Her father ask.

449
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,860
The fruit that has been in the garden for a year

450
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
and can't be eaten

451
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,860
can't be rewarded.

452
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Is that good for Chang'an?

453
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,860
Or is it good for Lingnan?

454
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
I told him

455
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,860
that he was tired of seeing the four seasons

456
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
and he was looking at the long green.

457
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,860
The autumn and autumn colors are beautiful.

458
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
The winter and winter are bitter.

459
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,860
The spring and autumn are green.

460
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,860
That's the role of the world.

461
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,860
No matter how long the winter

462
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,860
and how long the Chang'an is,

463
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,860
the spring and autumn are as good as the spring and autumn.

464
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,860
That's the good of Chang'an.

465
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I think that's a little reasonable.

466
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,860
I'm just afraid that you are a great cultural heritage.

467
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
I'm just kidding.

468
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
How does he know that

469
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,860
this is the feeling of my show, the Spring and Autumn.

470
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,860
I'm just remembering it.

471
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Xiu, I missed the time to accompany you to the Spring and Autumn.

472
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,860
When the roses bloom,

473
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,860
I will surely not miss them again.

474
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,860
The Spring and Autumn are beautiful.

475
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,860
The spring and autumn are green.

476
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,860
That's the good of Chang'an.

477
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,860
I'm just kidding.

478
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,860
I'm just kidding.

479
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,860
I'm just kidding.

480
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,860
I'm just kidding.

481
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,860
I'm just kidding.

482
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,860
I've said before that the flowers and autumn are different.

483
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,860
I'm sure that I will be able to spend three hours in the spring.

484
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,860
I'll wait for him at this osmanthus tree.

485
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
Yes.

486
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Sir, the witness is here.

487
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Looks like your mission is done.

488
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
Yes.

489
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Guess what?

490
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
The first master of Chang'an,

491
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,860
the right-hand man who kills people with his sharp eyes.

492
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
He even got a heart attack.

493
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
He didn't even say a word.

494
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,860
He died.

495
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,860
Anyway, congratulations.

496
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Congratulations, sir.

497
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
I didn't expect that

498
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,860
a month ago, I was still a doctor at Chang'an.

499
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Within a month, I also experienced life and death.

500
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
I'm a rich man.

501
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Tomorrow, I can go back to Chang'an.

502
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Sir, this is a letter from the school.

503
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,860
This is the secret letter from the right-hand man who killed.

504
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
I'll give it to you.

505
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Have you read it?

506
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
No.

507
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
No, sir.

508
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
I know the rules.

509
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
I don't think I should read it.

510
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
I won't ask if I shouldn't.

511
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
I won't ask if I shouldn't.

512
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,860
I will forget the past when I go to the south.

513
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Sir, you are always welcome to help me.

514
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
I will be safe and sound.

515
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,860
I will be at Chang'an soon.

516
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,860
I will be at the best restaurant in Chang'an.

517
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
I will be at the best restaurant.

518
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
Please, sir.

519
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,860
When you return to Chang'an, you will be the official.

520
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,860
I don't want to be the official.

521
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
What's the problem?

522
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,860
We are officially one of the five kings.

523
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,860
You are noble and you are noble.

524
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,860
I don't want to be the official.

525
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
Don't be so strange.

526
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,860
I am just an old man.

527
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Although Chang'an is a famous city,

528
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,860
it is still a long way to go.

529
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,860
It is a long way to go.

530
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,860
It is hard to be a good man.

531
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,860
But it is your choice to return to Chang'an.

532
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,860
I don't think you should judge me.

533
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,860
I don't know why you are so biased towards the official.

534
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,860
I am biased because I know everything about the evil.

535
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,860
I am so biased that I am so proud of you.

536
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,860
I am afraid you are the one who is so proud of me.

537
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Mr. Kong Lang has been helping me for days.

538
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,860
I am grateful for your help.

539
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,860
But Mr. Kong Lang is the most important person in the world.

540
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,860
But I am sure no one knows what we are doing.

541
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,860
My father did something bad.

542
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,860
He was under pressure to commit suicide.

543
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,860
My brother and I are both in the same boat.

544
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,860
We are still in the same boat.

545
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
If I don't suffer from him,

546
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,860
I will be a prostitute in Chang'an.

547
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,860
I will not be able to get a cure for my life.

548
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,860
I didn't expect you to not believe in your father.

549
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Do you really think your father is guilty?

550
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
He is not guilty?

551
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,860
He was innocent back then.

552
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,860
He wanted to kill your father again.

553
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,860
He refused to stay with me.

554
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
He was angry with me again.

555
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
He wanted to send someone to kill him

556
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,860
and make him pay for his sins.

557
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
If that is the case,

558
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,860
why did the elders in the tribe

559
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
take me and my sister out of the political affairs?

560
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Because the political affairs team didn't want to offend Youxiang.

561
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
They did it for their own safety.

562
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
They didn't want to let you take care of the foundation business

563
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
that you are protecting.

564
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,860
They didn't want you and your sister to be involved.

565
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,860
They were too busy with the operation.

566
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,860
They just wanted to make sure that you and your father

567
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,860
were not involved in this.

568
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
They were too busy with the operation.

569
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
They didn't want to make a fool of you

570
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
and make you pay for your sins.

571
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Why should I believe you?

572
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,860
I was just trying to save your father

573
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
and sent someone to find him.

574
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
As far as I know,

575
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,860
your father died in Pingkang Fang's house near the fruit shop.

576
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
You are right.

577
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Stop talking.

578
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Your father was willing to spare you

579
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
but you look at him like this.

580
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,860
You are so blind that you are blind.

581
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,860
You are so blind.

582
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
You should go.

583
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,860
The seven tribes are well-off and well-off.

584
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
They are all well-off.

585
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,860
Prince,

586
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Mr. Guo Lang is listening.

587
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,580
Maybe,

588
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,860
when youジ程 return to the book London,

589
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,860
you can't handle Euphstatic.

590
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Let him know,

591
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
don't forget to say FUCKING D kişies,

592
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,860
don't talk like a troll to me!

593
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Old Xu Wo yet no matter what,

594
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,060
Don't listen to him.

595
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:33,700
No.

596
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,660
He's telling the truth.

597
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,060
That day,

598
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,220
I was making a fuss

599
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,020
about eating a healthy jade pendant.

600
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,340
And when I saw my sister making a fuss,

601
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,660
she gave it to me.

602
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,740
My aunt didn't say anything.

603
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,580
So I went out.

604
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,540
My aunt died

605
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,140
on the road full of jade pendant.

606
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,460
Jay.

607
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,900
Uncle.

608
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:45,940
Yes.

609
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,740
Drinks less.

610
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,320
Give me your medicine.

611
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,280
Get some rest early.

612
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,620
Jian Feng,

613
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,460
drink with me.

614
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,720
Okay?

615
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,440
Okay.

616
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,300
What are you doing?

617
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,140
ンダ

618
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,300
I walked all over the place

619
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,980
in Chang'an for a long time

620
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,100
I've watched manyahahaha

621
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,080
.

622
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,700
My life is expensive, but everyone cares about me.

623
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,920
Through my worship,

624
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,360
I料ed people in this world

625
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,960
only to have a wonderful life.

626
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,260
The love of people

627
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,200
is so precious.

628
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,440
I finally ought to

629
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,860
enjoy the filling all my life.

630
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,580
I want to drink.

631
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Brother-in-law, do you know what I've been through?

632
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
I've been through so much.

633
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I've been through so much.

634
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
I've been through so much.

635
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
I've been through so much.

636
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
I've been through so much.

637
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
I've been through so much.

638
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,580
I've been through so much that my father carried me around in the yard.

639
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
My father took a round and another round.

640
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
He took a round and another round.

641
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
In the end, I was tired.

642
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
I was lying down for half a night.

643
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
Later, I grew up.

644
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,580
I was very anxious.

645
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
I ordered my father to rent a house.

646
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,580
I knew that my father had all the money.

647
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
My father still didn't blame me.

648
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
I like to eat on the way to the Pingkang.

649
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
I eat a lot of food.

650
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
I eat a lot of food.

651
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,580
I eat a lot of food.

652
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,580
After I finished my work, I was 36th in the whole family.

653
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
My father must not want me to suffer.

654
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,580
He was in the military.

655
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Ping'er, why did you say that all of a sudden?

656
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
I was in danger.

657
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
I was in danger.

658
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
I hate my father.

659
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,580
He hurt us and we were taken to the city.

660
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
I hate him.

661
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
I hate him.

662
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
I know that today,

663
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
my father doesn't want to hurt us.

664
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
He is protecting me and my sister.

665
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I will not give up.

666
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
I will never be a person.

667
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Yainan,

668
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,580
all of you are going to die for your child.

669
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
Today,

670
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,580
I want to make a decision with you.

671
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,580
I was afraid that you would ask me why I left you.

672
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
But now I think about the fate of Witing.

673
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
I am afraid that I will leave.

674
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
I will be a little bit sad.

675
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Jianfang,

676
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
I think about it.

677
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,580
From now on,

678
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,580
I will not leave with you.

679
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
I will not leave either.

680
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,580
I will stay in Liannan.

681
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
I will hold my life.

682
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,580
The life of a soldier is a momentary process.

683
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
There is no shortcut.

684
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Only physical strength.

685
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Only the steel is soft, the weapon can be used to fight against thousands of people.

686
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
The heart is salty, the hand is hard.

687
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Now is the time for you to choose the fastest.

688
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
You have to think about the next step.

689
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
How can you repeat it?

690
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Qi Jinglong?

691
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
I want to search more evidence.

692
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
I want to do something.

693
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
I want to do something.

694
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
You have to move your right brain.

695
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,580
You are so smart.

696
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
Have I ever laughed?

697
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
I am so anxious.

698
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,580
I am so lucky.

699
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Let's try.

700
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,580
My dear brother.

701
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,580

702
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
My dear brother.

703
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,580

My father.

715
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
My father.

716
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,580
My father.

717
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
My father.

718
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,580
My father.

719
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
My father.

720
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,580
My father.

721
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,580
My father.

My father.

725

My father.

726
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,580
My father.

727
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,580
My father.

728
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,580
My father.

729
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580

My father.

732
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,580
My father.

733
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,580
My father.

734
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,580
