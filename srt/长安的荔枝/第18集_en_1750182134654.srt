1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Music

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:13,920
Nothing

3
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,840
A couple.

4
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,160
You wipe the sheets out.

5
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,000
Go with me.

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,800
They're so white.

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Take a look.

8
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,120
As you like.

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,160
Okay.

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Liang Yuan.

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Liang Yuan.

12
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Who are you?

13
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Who?

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Cui Lang, who just joined the Crown Prince's family.

15
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
What's your name?

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Come with me.

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Where are you going?

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
To see Mr. Cui and Mr. Cui Shi.

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
He just joined the Crown Prince's family.

20
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
You haven't seen him yet.

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Qinghe Cui Shi,

22
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
his wife is the Crown Prince's young master.

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
And the crown prince of the Crown Prince's family.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Go.

25
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I'll go with you.

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Go.

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
I won't go if I don't go.

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
You go.

29
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Liang Yuan.

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Since you're like this,

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
I'll go with you.

32
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
Zi Shan is really good.

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Jin Niang?

34
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Miss Zheng Xiao.

35
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Jin Niang is a official of the Qingyang.

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
She had a marriage with Shiyi.

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
What's wrong with her?

38
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
She's not feeling well.

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
She's just standing there.

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,160
She's been unwell for half a year.

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Mr. Cui's family is all right.

42
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
You're lucky.

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
But no one was there.

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
She was so broken.

45
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Even the crown prince's son

46
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
wanted to marry Dong Nan.

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Why did he leave?

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Half a year ago,

49
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Jin Niang's father was officially killed.

50
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
This...

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
He's still alive.

52
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
He's a good man.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
He's not married.

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Mr. Cui is a good man.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
He's a good man.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
How about I take care of you?

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Don't you worry that I'll be your wife?

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
You know it all.

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Even my parents' lives are not in vain.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
You should go.

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
So that others won't say anything.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,160
How about we go down the mountain with her?

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
No.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I mean,

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
we go down the mountain with her.

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
And when she sees us,

67
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
she'll be mad at us.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Yes.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Besides,

70
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,200
she's a woman who's been

71
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,160
expelled from the government.

72
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,160
She lost her family's dignity.

73
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
If she's been deported,

74
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
she won't be able to be thrown away.

75
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
You should go.

76
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
So that I can watch the scenery here.

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Please.

78
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Please.

79
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Please.

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
What's wrong?

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm sick.

82
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll help you up.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
What's wrong?

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm sick.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
I'll help you up.

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Give me the sachet.

87
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
I...

88
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
I...

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
I didn't mean that.

90
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Deng Tu Zi,

91
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
how could you make people think of me?

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
I...

93
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
I didn't mean it.

94
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
I...

95
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I...

96
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
I...

97
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
I'll give it to you.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
It's not a fake.

99
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Dragon brain.

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Shoxiang.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
It smells good.

102
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Here you go.

103
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Deng Tu Zi.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
You're going to be a firecracker.

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
You'll be on fire.

106
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
You can't do anything like this.

107
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
I'll carry you later.

108
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
We're in a water-saving relationship.

109
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
You don't have to risk it.

110
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
It's not risk.

111
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
It's dark.

112
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
We're all trapped.

113
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I'm going to slow down.

114
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Slow down.

115
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Slow down.

116
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
You put me down.

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
It's too dangerous.

118
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
The road is too far.

119
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
It doesn't mean that there's no way to go.

120
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
We'll take the road that leads to the corner.

121
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
We'll take a step.

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
We'll take a step.

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
We'll take a step.

124
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
We'll take a step.

125
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
I'll take you.

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll take you.

127
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I'll take you.

128
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
I'll carry you.

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
I won't let you go.

130
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Sir.

131
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
What's your name?

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
What's your name?

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
If you really fell down just now,

134
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
I don't even know when I died.

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
My name is Li.

136
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm from Liangyuan.

137
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I'm from Huanyan County.

138
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
You scared me.

139
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I thought you were from Wuxing.

140
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
No.

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
How old are you?

142
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I...

143
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm 20.

144
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
20?

145
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
You're so old-fashioned.

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Yes.

147
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm 40.

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
You're...

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
What's your name?

150
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll tell you later.

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
I'll call you later.

152
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I'll call you later.

153
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
By the way, Liangyuan.

154
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Were you scared when you went through the ghostly road?

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I was scared.

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Why?

157
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Two lives.

158
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
But you can't get down without me.

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
You said at night...

160
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
You said at night,

161
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,160
you were not killed by the ant.

162
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Right?

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Come on.

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Let's go.

165
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Why are you laughing?

166
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Nothing.

167
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
You're still laughing?

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
No, I'm thinking about something.

169
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
When I was a kid,

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I went to Chang'an to sell sheep.

171
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
The sheep...

172
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
The sheep was...

173
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
The sheep was...

174
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
The sheep was...

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
The sheep was in the ditch.

176
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
The sheep was in the ditch.

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
The sheep was in the ditch.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Then I flew to Chang'an.

179
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Then I flew to Chang'an.

180
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I was flying to Chang'an.

181
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Why do I think you're talking about me?

182
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Yes.

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
What?

184
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
What?

185
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
What are you calling me?

186
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I told you I'd tell you.

187
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
I'll tell you right away.

188
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
What are you calling me?

189
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm not here yet.

190
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
I'll be here soon.

191
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,120
Shi Xin!

192
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Shi Xin!

193
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Shi Xin!

194
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Shi Xin!

195
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Shi Xin!

196
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,760
Our team Kerna

197
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Curator

198
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
Program

199
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,120
Past

200
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,960
Process

201
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,160
훈

202
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,040
Jian

203
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
Han

204
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,280
Xi

205
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,920
Mi

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Kong

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm so happy.

208
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
The ugly words are in front of me.

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,400
We Hu Shao Chamber of Commerce have a rule.

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
If within 30 days,

211
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
the project doesn't have any recommendations,

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
the route will be withdrawn.

213
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,200
So you have to quickly eliminate the gap in the two days.

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,400
This is natural.

215
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm going to hurry and go.

216
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Thank you.

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's go.

218
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,200
Hurry up, Alzheimer's.

219
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll know without being beat.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
I've sent some great people,

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,900
like the best chef Lesi-ger,

222
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Guami Wu, your girl Jiribution.

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
That's what we should do.

224
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
That's what we should do.

225
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,900
After all, it's the royal family's duty to do it.

226
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Our ancestral house should be interesting.

227
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Don't worry.

228
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
When he's on the stage, I'll bring him back.

229
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,900
I'll find out such a big ancestral house.

230
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Yes, yes, yes.

231
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
I know I was wrong.

232
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
What are you doing?

233
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
I'm sorry for my teacher.

234
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,900
Such a good opportunity.

235
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Let this Li Shande have a big head.

236
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
What are you doing?

237
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Are you going to the old house?

238
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
The rain has run away.

239
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
You're thinking of the net.

240
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
There's a use.

241
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
It's over.

242
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Yes.

243
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Father.

244
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Amita.

245
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
What are you doing here?

246
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Let's go.

247
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Okay.

248
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Do something serious.

249
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Okay.

250
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Amita.

251
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
You're here.

252
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
It's my negligence.

253
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
I didn't expect Li Shande to think of such a way.

254
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,900
How long have you been with me?

255
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Ten years.

256
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
I remember when you just came back.

257
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
You were so tired.

258
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Your aunt died that year.

259
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,900
I thought of a way.

260
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
I wanted to get in touch with my brothers.

261
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,900
To have a peaceful life.

262
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
I can't do that.

263
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
I tried hard to get you out of it.

264
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
And you're the leader of the business.

265
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
And I...

266
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I took the money and sold it.

267
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I didn't do anything.

268
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I did everything for you.

269
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,900
I just want to cooperate with you.

270
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
We don't go out of the mountain.

271
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,900
We'll keep our good days.

272
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Now the military service is over.

273
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,900
We're waiting for him to be controlled.

274
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,900
But we have no money.

275
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Let Li Shande's little fat man.

276
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,900
He's always been with us.

277
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,900
He's always been with us.

278
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
But he's gone.

279
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
You're right.

280
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
I understand.

281
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
So I made a promise to you.

282
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,900
If he can't get a successful transfer,

283
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
he'll withdraw his money.

284
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
What if he gets it?

285
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Don't worry.

286
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
The insurance is only 11 days.

287
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
He'll be transferred on the way.

288
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
But it'll take 13 days.

289
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Unless he's a good man.

290
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Otherwise, it's impossible.

291
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Impossible?

292
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Impossible?

293
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Every time he says that,

294
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
he'll tell me something.

295
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Since he arrived in Lingnan,

296
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
he's been acting like a fool.

297
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
I'm asking you.

298
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Do you think I'm a fool?

299
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I'll keep an eye on Li Shande.

300
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
I'll let Su Liang be a good man.

301
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Amida.

302
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
I'll keep this promise.

303
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
I'll help you.

304
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
I'll help you.

305
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Amida.

306
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm angry with you.

307
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
You're a businessman.

308
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
And his face.

309
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
You're being fooled by others.

310
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Shut up.

311
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
I just want to know what the next plan is.

312
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
I'll think it over.

313
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
Don't worry.

314
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I'll be honest with you.

315
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
You're the most adored.

316
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
I'm not.

317
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
It's not that simple.

318
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
You're not adored.

319
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
It's not my business.

320
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
Li Shande is not a good man.

321
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
It's easy for a businessman to be a good man.

322
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,900
I don't think it's your business.

323
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,900
I'll scold you first.

324
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Do you think it's our own problem?

325
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
It's all my business for you.

326
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
It's all my business for you.

327
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Mr. Han.

328
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Okay.

329
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
You guys can go.

330
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Mr. Li.

331
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Let me introduce you.

332
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Mr. Wei, Mr. Zhao, Mr. Zhou.

333
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900
They're the chiefs of our business.

334
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,900
I heard that you're going to transfer Li Zhi to Chang'an.

335
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
They're interested.

336
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Mr. Li.

337
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Mr. Li.

338
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Chiefs.

339
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Mr. Li.

340
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Good morning.

341
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Mr. Li.

342
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,900
We're here to ask for our staff.

343
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
We're here to investigate.

344
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,900
We're here to work together.

345
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Please introduce yourself, Mr. Li.

346
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I've said it before.

347
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm not good at speaking.

348
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
I'm afraid I'll be too harsh on you.

349
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
A man from the ancient times.

350
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
He's a man of the heart.

351
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
He's a bit affectionate to his clients.

352
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
He's the chiefs' employee.

353
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
We can't be satisfied with his work.

354
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
As the general investor of the company,

355
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Mr. Li is in good company too.

356
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Mr. Su and Lan Yu

357
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
are in Li Zhi's company.

358
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
What else is there to cooperate?

359
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Mr. Li.

360
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
We're here to help Mr. Li.

361
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,860
to help Mr. Li

362
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,860
to take our

363
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Han city's project.

364
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,860
By the way,

365
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,860
look.

366
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,140
This tiger suit

367
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,900
is designed

368
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,340
by our Da Fu business.

369
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,820
Look at the color.

370
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,300
It's made of sugar.

371
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,220
If you can

372
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,340
report it to us

373
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,100
through Mr. Li's hand,

374
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,220
it's a waste.

375
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,820
No, I'm just a lucky man.

376
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,860
I...

377
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,140
I...

378
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,380
I don't need to

379
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,780
report it to you.

380
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,140
I don't need it.

381
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,620
Mr. Han,

382
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,340
this...

383
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Mr. Li

384
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,100
may have some

385
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,140
small misunderstandings

386
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,420
about our cooperation.

387
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,100
Why don't you

388
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,660
tell us?

389
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,900
The amount of stock

390
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,220
is three times the amount

391
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
of our tiger suit.

392
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,500
If Mr. Li doesn't cooperate,

393
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,540
I won't be able

394
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,180
to control the money.

395
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

396
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,940
we just took part in the plant-based project.

397
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,700
Now,

398
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,340
we're going to take the

399
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,540
capital-funded project

400
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,060
to collect the money

401
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,180
of the animals.

402
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,780
Is this also a capital-funded project?

403
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,940
Mr. Li is so brilliant.

404
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,780
This is the

405
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,340
thousand-year-old project

406
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,140
of the whole plant-based project.

407
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,260
The whole plant-based project

408
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,780
is all in this project.

409
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
Mr. Li is so brilliant.

410
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Look at the money

411
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,340
we've got from the people.

412
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,540
It's so happy.

413
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,180
If you eat the money,

414
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,340
you'll be so proud.

415
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

416
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,180
what's the use of

417
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,540
this double-layered thing?

418
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,020
This...

419
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,380
You're right.

420
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,140
It's used to transport the materials.

421
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,180
This is the price

422
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,460
of our Huoshang Chamber of Commerce.

423
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,220
This is the cost of

424
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,380
Mr. Li...

425
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
Mr. Li.

426
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,980
Mr. Li.

427
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,540
You have to pay

428
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,460
for Mr. Li's

429
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,740
national treasure.

430
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,020
Mr. Li, you're so hardworking.

431
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,580
No.

432
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
Mr. Li,

433
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,660
professional.

434
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,420
Tong.

435
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,580
Come on.

436
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,340
Tong, get up.

437
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,620
This...

438
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,580
Miss Tong.

439
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,860
Don't look at her age.

440
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,180
She's the head of the whole plant-based project.

441
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,740
She's the one who's going to take care of it.

442
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
She's a little bit

443
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,980
stubborn.

444
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,300
But she loves this project so much.

445
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,340
Look at the money

446
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,420
we've got from the whole plant-based project.

447
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,020
Look at the money we've got.

448
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,860
That's great.

449
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,420
She's a little bit temperamental.

450
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,460
Let's keep watching.

451
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,780
Mr. Li,

452
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,460
what's going on with the bamboo baskets over there?

453
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,060
These are all used by the workers

454
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,700
who just came here.

455
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,620
That's a little bit of a waste.

456
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,860
The bamboo baskets

457
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,340
should be the ones we've got on the boat.

458
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,820
There's no publicity.

459
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,180
They don't have any design.

460
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,620
It's useless.

461
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,100
Mr. Li, pick one.

462
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,820
Don't worry.

463
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,740
We'll provide all the bamboo baskets.

464
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,060
Right.

465
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,100
The most important thing is

466
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,820
that the name of the shopkeeper

467
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,300
must be written on the outside.

468
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,060
Is it the dream of Mr. Li?

469
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
What?

470
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,340
And the doctor who's going to take care of it.

471
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,300
The packaging of the bamboo basket

472
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,060
must be your style.

473
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,180
We'll make it up for Mr. Li.

474
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,060
It's useless.

475
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,020
We'll take care of it.

476
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,780
It's not a useless problem.

477
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,700
It's a efficient problem.

478
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,220
This... this bamboo basket

479
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,260
is not sweet enough.

480
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,220
It's sweeter with a little salt.

481
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,860
It's called salt.

482
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,700
Can we change the name?

483
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,940
We'll call it Da Fu Guo.

484
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,940
The name is very powerful.

485
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,380
The sales can be opened.

486
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,180
Find some poems with the headband.

487
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,380
Write some poems about Da Fu Guo.

488
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,700
It'll be popular.

489
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,540
How about this?

490
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,020
Can we change all these bamboo baskets

491
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,180
into red?

492
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,420
It's a good idea.

493
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Thank you.

494
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
And the horses.

495
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
What horses?

496
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,500
It's over.

497
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,900
If you keep going like this,

498
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,300
I'll be a salesman.

499
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,900
I'll be a salesman.

500
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,660
Or you'll want to see me as a salesman.

501
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,340
No, no.

502
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,140
Mr. Li, you're mistaken.

503
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,940
We're just talking about your idea.

504
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,540
We can discuss it.

505
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,460
Right?

506
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,220
We're all foreign companies

507
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,780
who are selling the goods.

508
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,860
You'll decide it.

509
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,260
But how to make it popular?

510
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,500
How to make it popular?

511
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,060
We're the ones who do it.

512
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,820
Yes.

513
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,780
Of course.

514
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,740
Mr. Li, you're a professional

515
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,620
and a talent.

516
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,420
You're a good example of our skill.

517
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,380
We understand.

518
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,900
We understand, right?

519
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,020
But if we don't have this skill,

520
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,060
we can't make money, right?

521
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,380
Right.

522
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,940
Mr. Wei,

523
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm not good at speaking.

524
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,380
But I'm not against it.

525
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,980
I know you're

526
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,220
the big master of the business.

527
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,620
But I'm just a business man.

528
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm afraid I can't cooperate

529
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,220
with the cooperation you said today.

530
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,260
Mr. Li, you're a good example.

531
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,020
You're a real business man.

532
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,380
I admire you.

533
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,420
You're welcome.

534
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,220
Mr. Li,

535
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,540
is your daughter

536
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,900
a embroiderer from Anrenfang?

537
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,140
This embroiderer is a famous

538
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,020
old man.

539
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,820
Do you know him?

540
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,980
Yes.

541
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,380
What a coincidence.

542
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,060
His cloth is a bit thick.

543
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,460
When he opened the business,

544
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,220
I even gave him the economic result.

545
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,580
If I withdraw the cloth,

546
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,540
and take this batch back,

547
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,940
will the old man

548
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,420
be a good example?

549
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,060
Mr. Li,

550
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,860
please reconsider

551
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,060
the cooperation

552
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,260
between you and me.

553
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,620
I'll go and bring a painting to Zhao Qingming.

554
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,700
My mother won't let me go.

555
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,100
Hangshou!

556
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,740
Your clothes

557
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,580
are expensive.

558
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,180
Li Shande,

559
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,860
do you still eat this?

560
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,020
Let's go somewhere else.

561
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,820
It smells so bad.

562
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,860
Hello, Dad.

563
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,580
I'm here to see you.

564
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,620
This...

565
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,580
Remember to clean up.

566
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,260
Come on.

567
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
Come on.

568
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,140
If they still ask you

569
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,500
for fails every time,

570
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,380
surely you'll promise

571
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,900
all your moves

572
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,620
will cool down.

573
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,300
Okay.

574
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,100
What is it?

575
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,060
Sit down.

576
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,300
My life is limited in these few不管ments.

577
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,180
You all good?

578
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,780
Leave me alone.

579
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,020
I failed today.

580
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,900
Thank you.

581
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,700
Listen to your dad.

582
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,740
If you argue with these ladies,

583
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,500
I'll take the opportunity

584
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,740
to convince them to lend their clothes to us

585
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,860
and fix our work.

586
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,700
I won't let you

587
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,500
have our clothes初心才.

588
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,780
There's the kind of Guys

589
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,340
that don't dare toxer

590
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,140
или break out this as a single bite.

591
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,620
It'sautism.

592
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,140
You're done for!

593
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,540
You've messed up everything!

594
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,540
Miss A-Tong,

595
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,260
these are all the important points from the elders.

596
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,660
I'm just doing the cleaning and cleaning.

597
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
It's all your fault.

598
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,860
This is my fault.

599
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,540
You're not the one to be fooled.

600
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,820
Li Shan De is the host of the transfer.

601
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,660
You need to ask him before you do anything.

602
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm here to supervise you.

603
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,140
Besides, this is not the money we're going to spend.

604
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,740
But Li Zhishan hasn't even started yet!

605
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,820
But he's already started!

606
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,540
I'll do everything he says.

607
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Got it?

608
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Okay.

609
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
I'll go tell Li Shan De right now!

610
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,420
Please!

611
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,700
Ask Li Shan De about these materials.

612
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,820
It'll take a few days to clean up.

613
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,980
I'll come back to check on you when you have time.

614
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
Okay.

615
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
I'll go now!

616
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,020
Go get a pair of suitcases and pair the roots!

617
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,020
Water...

618
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,620
Water!

619
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:12,700
Why isn't

620
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,740
Wait for him.

621
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,100
You two eat some green juice first.

622
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,700
Okay.

623
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,980
Zhao Ximing arranged this every week.

624
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,500
You beat him up.

625
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,460
How did you teach him?

626
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,820
Your teaching.

627
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,900
Zhao Ximing is the dog that's been playing with me.

628
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,540
Don't worry about me.

629
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,020
Don't worry about yourself.

630
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,340
He doesn't know why you helped me.

631
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,780
He still thanks me.

632
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,620
I beat him.

633
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,020
It's none of your business.

634
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,820
I have my own reasons.

635
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,100
Let me ask you.

636
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,740
Did your gap two days have been solved?

637
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,740
I didn't think so.

638
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,900
I just wanted to study.

639
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Every time I get a new order,

640
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,900
I think it'll be better.

641
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,740
You're a long-term person.

642
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,260
You're a good old man.

643
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,380
You can study if you want to.

644
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,860
Do you think the Holy Spirit wants to

645
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,180
get to Chang'an from Linnan?

646
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,300
It's an impossible task.

647
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,700
I'm afraid he doesn't know.

648
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,380
It's all because of the Holy Spirit.

649
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,860
I'm afraid it's a man who wants to get a good girl.

650
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,660
He's a coward.

651
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,340
He doesn't have to do it himself.

652
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,860
He's just a coward.

653
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,580
I don't dare to say it.

654
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,140
Look at you.

655
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,580
You're a coward.

656
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,780
But you're doing it for the sake of your life.

657
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,140
I've seen people who are doing it.

658
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,860
You're a teacher.

659
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,940
But you're a teacher.

660
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,500
You're the first one.

661
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,580
What kind of person are you?

662
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,100
Long-term people.

663
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,180
Young officials.

664
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,460
They're all living.

665
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,500
They're just like that.

666
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
But you can't do anything about it.

667
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,380
I'm just a stranger.

668
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,900
You're a lawyer.

669
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,620
You're a sweet person.

670
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,140
I'm a bitter person.

671
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,740
But why are you still a person who's bitter?

672
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,540
Because I'm alive.

673
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,140
That's it.

674
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,020
Even if you're a God,

675
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,380
you can't do what you want.

676
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,660
Maybe you're a little punished by the Holy Spirit.

677
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,380
Right?

678
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,740
You're in this world.

679
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,580
You're still not willing to do anything.

680
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,380
But you can't do anything.

681
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,460
You have to be warm-hearted and generous.

682
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,100
If you die, you'll be given the right to drink.

683
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,260
If you meet the King of the World,

684
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,180
you'll be able to remember him.

685
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,740
I've tried my best.

686
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,300
That's it.

687
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,940
What are you doing to send him off?

688
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,860
How much do you have?

689
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,460
You can do this.

690
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,540
I have 300 million.

691
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,260
150 million is a loan from Chang'an.

692
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,180
I've made a loan from Chang'an.

693
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,820
It's normal to pay for the loan.

694
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,980
Yes, it's normal for you.

695
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,420
You can keep the money.

696
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,620
You can buy any house in Lingnan.

697
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,460
You can buy anywhere.

698
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,780
But it's different to me.

699
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,180
I'm going to leave this house to my daughter.

700
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,980
This is my only thought.

701
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,580
I'm going to be broken by Li Zhi.

702
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,820
So I have to do this when I want to go back.

703
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,340
No matter how much I do this,

704
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,420
I won't let you go.

705
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,460
Why did you help me?

706
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,580
Because I saw you from above.

707
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:53,140
My father didn't want to do anything to protect me.

708
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,780
Nizh leaning against the back wall.

709
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,820
How did you come to him?

710
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,260
Sorry, I thought I was part of some contacted.

711
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,620
Hello.

712
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:21,580
Three of us went tointense workshops

713
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
to start talking and laughing.

714
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,660
What happened?

715
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,860
I saw everyone laughing.

716
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,980
Four of you, why did you find yourself as the real Hello?

717
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
He said he would come again.

718
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
He didn't see anything so sad.

719
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,980
He didn't know what to do.

720
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Now the bad guys are in the house.

721
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Be careful.

722
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,980
What? Amita beat the merchant?

723
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Yes.

724
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Amita is getting more and more unregulated.

725
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Auntie, if the killer didn't keep him by his side,

726
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,980
he would have given his father's sword to him.

727
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
He has it today.

728
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,980
He doesn't want to think about it.

729
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Ma Guiyun is chasing Amita recently.

730
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,980
What is he?

731
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,980
He is a stone with a strong impact.

732
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
He is chasing Amita.

733
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
He is a little self-conscious.

734
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
That's right.

735
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
He is a typical person.

736
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,980
I am worried about what trouble he will have.

737
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,980
What trouble?

738
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
He is a devil.

739
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,980
I have a plan.

740
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
You are wrong.

741
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Ma Guiyun is chasing Amita like Kong Xue Kaiping.

742
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,980
But Amita is not good at him.

743
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,980
I think he is doing something else.

744
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
He is not in a good mood.

745
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Let's arrange a young and charming girl.

746
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,980
A man chasing a woman.

747
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,980
A woman chasing a man.

748
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,980
We can take this opportunity to help him.

749
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,980
But Amita is not good at him.

750
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,980
She is blind.

751
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,980
She is blind.

752
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
I have one.

753
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Ma Langjin.

754
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Miss Lan Yu.

755
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,980
Ma Langjin.

756
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
You are not my hero.

757
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Are you disappointed?

758
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
No.

759
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,980
Miss Lan Yu knows that she is a hero today.

760
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,980
She is very good at acting.

761
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,980
She will be with the hero later.

762
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,980
She can be a good student.

763
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Miss Lan Yu.

764
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,980
Do you know that you are the hero?

765
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,980
I have been watching you for a long time.

766
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Unfortunately, you are like a wooden fish.

767
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,980
You are only my hero.

768
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,980
You are like a hero.

769
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
You are so good.

770
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,980
You can't disturb him.

771
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
You are so heartless.

772
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
I can't see it.

773
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
Now you are together.

774
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,980
You are so good.

775
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Mr. Gu.

776
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,980
You can be with the hero later.

777
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Don't be so emotional.

778
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,980
I am so happy.

779
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
I am so happy.

780
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
Mr. Zhao.

781
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Please.

782
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,980
Mr. Zhao is so worried about me.

783
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Today's banquet is just for the reunion of Miss Lan Yu and me.

784
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
It's not over yet.

785
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
It's just like that.

786
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Of course.

787
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Today, I want you to enjoy the joy of the banquet.

788
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Lan Yu.

789
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Get up.

790
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Get up.

791
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Mr. Zhao.

792
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,980
Are you lucky?

793
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,980
I think I am lucky.

794
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Be careful, Mr. Zhao.

795
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Mr. Ma.

796
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Miss Lan Yu.

797
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,980
You are so beautiful.

798
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Mr. Ma is so kind.

799
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,980
I don't know what else you are thinking about.

800
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,980
It's just a reunion of good friends.

801
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,980
You are so kind.

802
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,980
I am so kind.

803
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
I am so kind.

804
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
I don't have any guests.

805
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
Mr. Ma.

806
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I heard that there is a mountain in the city.

807
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,980
It's so beautiful and beautiful.

808
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,980
How about I stay with you tomorrow?

809
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
Lan Yu is so kind.

810
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,980
I can't help myself.

811
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Don't cry.

812
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Take your tears.

813
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,980
I am afraid of the tears.

814
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Is it the mountain of the clouds?

815
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Okay.

816
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Take your tears.

817
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
The mountain of the clouds.

818
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Be careful, Mr. Ma.

819
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
I am so happy.

820
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Qi Lang.

821
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Why do you have to be so hard to get rid of?

822
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Lan Yu is so beautiful.

823
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
But Qi Lang is so poor.

824
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
He is not done yet.

825
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
He is going to be so tired.

826
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
I can hide the red-meyed chicken.

827
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
I am so lucky.

828
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,980
I am sure that Mr. Zhao will be fine.

829
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
I don't know what he is doing.

830
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
I can't do anything.

831
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
I can only do something for him.

832
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,980
I have to see what he is doing.

833
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Qi Lang is so hard to get rid of.

834
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,980
He is so stubborn.

835
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
He is so hard to get rid of.

836
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
He is so stubborn.

837
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
He is so hard to get rid of.

838
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,980
We all have the same place to go.

839
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Goer.

840
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
You are too young.

841
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
You can't just look at the surface.

842
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,980
You can't just look at the surface.

843
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
You have to look back a few times.

844
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
Then you will know the result.

845
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,980
I am worried that Qi Lang is so stubborn.

846
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
He is so stubborn.

847
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,980
I really want to be treated like a person.

848
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,980
It is easier to be chased than to be chased.

849
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Love is a great thing.

850
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,980
Love is a fake.

851
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Love is a fake.

852
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
You are so young.

853
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
I am young but I am not stupid.

854
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,980
There are many women around me.

855
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Mr. Kong Lang is so into love.

856
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,980
Amita is so good at talking.

857
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,980
Today, I have a very good friend.

858
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
He is so good at talking.

859
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
I am so lucky.

860
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
I am so lucky.

861
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
You are getting more and more sensible.

862
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,980
You don't need to brush your teeth when you get up tomorrow.

863
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Because today, I am going to beat your teeth.

864
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
You can't even get your teeth out of your mouth.

865
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,980
You can't learn so many words.

866
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Get out of here.

867
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,980
What are you doing?

868
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,980
I am here.

869
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,980
He is the great man in the mountains.

870
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Maybe he can help Li Zhi.

871
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,980
What are you doing?

872
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,980
You can't take hope from him.

873
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
He is so good.

874
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
He is so smart.

875
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
He is so good at learning.

876
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
He needs to be taught.

877
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,980
He is so good at learning.

878
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,980
How can he keep Li Zhi?

879
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
He can't do that.

880
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,980
He can't control his skills.

881
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,980
Get out of here.

882
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,980
Li Zhi, what are you doing?

883
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,980
I am saving you.

884
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
What are you doing?

885
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
What are you doing?

886
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,980
You dare to break my will.

887
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,980
God is watching.

888
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,980
He is so angry.

889
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
He will kill you.

890
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
God, please spare me.

891
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
This thing is poisonous.

892
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,980
This is the flower of Mantua.

893
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,980
This thing is poisonous.

894
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,980
Everyone will get a drug.

895
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,980
Really?

896
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,980
Yes.

897
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,980
I have seen this many times.

898
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
When I am sick,

899
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I feel better.

900
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
You are not sick.

901
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
It is the effect of anesthesia.

902
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
It only makes you sick.

903
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,980
It will cover your eyes.

904
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
You are the one.

905
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,980
You believe me or this man?

906
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,980
I don't know what to talk about.

907
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
For example, the poem is a song.

908
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,980
For example, the flower is in front of you.

909
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,980
It is in front of you.

910
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
God.

911
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
Get out.

912
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Qi Lang, I am not going in.

913
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,980
There is a barrier in the fish tank.

914
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,980
It is a barrier.

915
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,980
It is a barrier.

916
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
It is a barrier.

917
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,980
You help me find someone in the fish tank.

918
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,980
The rabbit in the fish tank is burned to death 10 years ago.

919
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
Then you can go out.

920
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,980
You can go out.

921
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,980
I am not sick.

922
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,980
I am sick.

923
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,980
I am sick.

924
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,980
I want to see the world of the rich and the poor.

925
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,980
But I only see a man showing his tears.

926
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,980
A little bit.

927
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,980
A little bit.

928
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,980
We are not able to take a risk.

929
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,980
We are not able to take a risk.

930
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,980
I have no thoughts.

931
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,980
I see a man showing his tears.

932
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,980
We are not able to take a risk.

933
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,980
You are now far away from my dream.

934
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,980
I rekindled and talked to you.

935
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,980
From then I promised myself.

936
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:53,000
Li jam jam, Li jam jam...
