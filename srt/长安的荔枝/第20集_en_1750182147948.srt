Be careful.

17
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,980
Think carefully.

18
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,020
Don't run.

19
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,320
What?

20
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,160

21
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,280
Little 800.

22
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Are you going to check the floor for us, Cantonese Hip-Hop?

23
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:12,880
Please welcome the aunts

24
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,840
It's cheerfully empty today.

25
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,200
Everyone is leading a happy meeting.

26
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,760
The reason you're here today

27
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,800
was for Airen Fыng to cover her.

28
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Wu Zheng presents you with the best is in government.

29
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,680
You can brand new programs,

30
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
open at this place,

31
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,600
and block the banks with studying fields.

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,560
But why are you

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560

34
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
and the most important

35
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
and the most important

36
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Liang Qin has been in charge of it

37
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
I have one more

38
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
The list of the talks

39
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
with the left and the right

40
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
also belongs to the right

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:08,560
The list of talks with the left and the most important

42
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,560
I will take this gift for the right

43
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Yes

44
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
If there is any order

45
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
I will do everything I can

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
to fulfill the order

47
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
You are right

48
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
The future is not limited

49
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Don't forget me

50
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Thank god you are the wife of the husband

51
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:05,560
The first one is the wife of the husband

52
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,560
The second one is the wife of the husband

53
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,560
The third one is the wife of the husband

54
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Get up

55
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
What are you doing?

56
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
What are you doing?

57
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Get up

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Let me go

59
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,560
You think you can survive if you escape?

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Even if you escape

61
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
There is no difference between the outside and this

62
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I will go to the guest

63
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
My lady

64
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I will go to the hall to wait for the order

65
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I will go to the hall to wait for the order

66
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
This way please

67
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
What is your name?

68
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Dong Xue

69
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Dong Xue

70
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
I am here to call you

71
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Dong Xue

72
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Come

73
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
This is the red chicken from the flower shop

74
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
It is tender and tender

75
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Come

76
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Come

77
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560

84
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Come

85
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Amita

86
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Come

87
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Why are you here?

88
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,560
I heard you found someone in the sea

89
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Didn't Lan Yu tell you?

90
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
It's just a fisherman

91
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,560
I misunderstood the fish market

92
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Why did you make a big mistake?

93
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Is this man called A Tu?

94
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Why did you bring the Chamberlain?

95
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
The man is looking for him

96
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Why are you looking for him?

97
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I heard that Li Shan De is looking for him

98
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,560
He knows a way to get out of Lingnan

99
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,560
We can't let him get into Li Shan De's hands

100
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Don't worry, I won't give him to Li Shan De

101
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Amita

102
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
You may not know

103
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Li Shan De is a cunning and cunning man

104
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
You are not his opponent

105
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I think

106
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I will take him away

107
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Or keep him safe in the mansion

108
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Father

109
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I can't give you A Tu

110
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,560
I heard that this man was a spy

111
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,560
A mysterious man threw two thousand sea troubles in front of the building

112
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
It's like a prediction

113
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,560
I must find out who the mysterious man is

114
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Qi Jing Lou, the fireman

115
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Hai Fan Chou, the gangster

116
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,560
This is all the big news about Lingnan

117
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
The rumors are spreading all over the world

118
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
We can't trust the news that the rumor came from

119
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
You don't know how chaotic it was

120
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Hai Fan Chou has big brothers and sisters every day

121
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,560
You have to say that it has something to do with Qi Jing Lou

122
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
It's not a coincidence

123
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
If that's the case

124
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,560
I can let A Tu take him away

125
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I just want to know who the mysterious man is

126
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,560
I can't let him get away

127
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
I can't let him get away

128
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
He is A Tu

129
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Let go of me

130
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
You save me

131
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Who will save him?

132
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
He threw two thousand sea troubles

133
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Say it

134
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
He threw two thousand sea troubles

135
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I saw him with fire and Qi Jing Lou

136
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,560
He burned the sea fire

137
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
It's crazy

138
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,560
You believe in rumors

139
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
I am a crazy woman

140
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Why do you want to take me away?

141
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,560
You have the evidence

142
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I have it

143
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
You have to kill me

144
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,560
You will be the king of the world

145
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I will be the king of the world

146
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
I won't kill him

147
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
You have the evidence

148
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Good thing

149
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,560
You have to kill him

150
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't shoot

151
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
What are you doing?

152
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Amita

153
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
You are in my body

154
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
I have been raising you for ten years

155
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
How am I going to deal with you in the future?

156
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,560
You should know it

157
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I will be with you for ten years

158
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
I will be with you for ten years

159
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I will be with you for ten years

160
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
I will be with you for ten years

161
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
I will be with you for ten years

162
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
More than you

163
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Do you believe in him or me?

164
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
You will

165
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
I hope you can do it

166
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
I hope you can do it

167
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
But you have to kill him

168
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
I hope you can do it

169
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
From the beginning

170
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
You are lying to me

171
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
You are lying to me all the time

172
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,560
I am your brother

173
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Why do you want to kill him?

174
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,560
If I really kill you

175
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Why don't you kill me?

176
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
I raised you up to this day

177
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Why are you waiting for your wings to be hard?

178
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Are you going to fight with me?

179
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
You want to hit your head

180
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Who taught you how to be a man?

181
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Who taught you how to be a man?

182
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Who taught you how to be a man?

183
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Who taught you how to be a man?

184
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
I raised you up to this day for ten years

185
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
You are still not satisfied

186
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
What do you want to do?

187
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,560
I heard you scared me at that time

188
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
I know the truth

189
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,560
I want you to apologize to my aunt

190
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
What are you talking about?

191
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Why do you dare to talk to me like that?

192
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Apologize

193
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Are you going to kill me?

194
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
You want to kill me?

195
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
What are you?

196
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I will tell you one last time

197
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I can love you

198
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I can also destroy you

199
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I want to die

200
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I want to die

201
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Can I?

202
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
I won't die today

203
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
I will die

204
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Then you will die

205
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Kill him

206
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Kill him

207
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Long Jian

208
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Kill him

209
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Kill him

210
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Kill him

211
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Kill him

212
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Kill him

213
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Come

214
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Come

215
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
What's wrong?

216
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
What's wrong?

217
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
What's wrong?

218
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Are you hurt?

219
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I'm fine

220
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I killed the people outside

221
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I will take you out

222
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Listen to me

223
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Yu Chang

224
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Who saved Amita?

225
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Tell Yang Xiaowei

226
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,560
The people in the city are all dead

227
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Don't let them go

228
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Don't let them go

229
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Order 46

230
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,560
All of you, search the place secretly

231
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Don't hurt the people

232
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Amita

233
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Yes

234
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Sir

235
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Are you hurt?

236
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
I'm fine

237
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Who are you?

238
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
The people outside call me Mr. Kong

239
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,560
You and me are both dead

240
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Why did you help me?

241
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,560
I want to talk to you about a deal

242
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
He Youguang killed your aunt

243
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
You can't fight him alone

244
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Now the whole city is searching for you

245
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,560
You can't go anywhere except me

246
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
I can help you

247
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
But as a exchange

248
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,560
I want to be the guilty one who killed He Youguang

249
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Miss

250
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
It's okay

251
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
It's okay

252
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Miss

253
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
We won't cry

254
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,560
You can stay in Li Zhiyuan

255
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,560
You can go with me to the big fish market

256
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,560
You won't have a home

257
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Youguang

258
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I promised to send you to the repair shop

259
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
I won't let you down

260
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
It's not my fault

261
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,560
It's my fault

262
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
He said he told me

263
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,560
He won't meet her again

264
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,560
He said he was in the city

265
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
He said he was in the city

266
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
He didn't only know

267
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,560
The way the big fish market is

268
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
He also knew some secrets

269
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,560
That's when he came to kill me

270
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
This result

271
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Is the only thing he has in his life

272
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
But

273
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
He's dead

274
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I didn't see him

275
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,560
We've been busy for a long time

276
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
We've been waiting for a long time

277
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
We've been busy for a long time

278
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,560
We still can't find the small road in the big fish market

279
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Li Dashi

280
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Or I'll go to the big fish market to find it

281
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,560
The big fish market is a three-way street

282
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
It's a three-way street

283
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
There are only three directions

284
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
There's only a narrow water basin

285
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,560
That can go to the east

286
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,560
It's a long way

287
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
The mountains are clear

288
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
It's a long way

289
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
It's hard to find it

290
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,560
It's hard to find it

291
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
We can only go to the other side

292
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
And search for it for a while

293
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
If we're in a hurry

294
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
We'll have to take the road

295
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
We'll have to take the road

296
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
We'll have to take the road

297
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
We'll have to take the road

298
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
If we say so

299
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
We'll have to take the road

300
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
ップ

301
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I can see you

302
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Please keep an eye on this colour

303
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Mister

304
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I'm Lan Ke

305
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
You gave me a speech

306
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,400
The very young lady

307
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
This little girl is quite cute.

308
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Do you have a name?

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,640
No.

310
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,440
You don't even have a name?

311
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,920
You're so smart.

312
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,480
Why don't you call me Ah Hui?

313
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay.

314
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,080
Okay.

315
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Ah Hui, don't be afraid.

316
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
It's okay if you can't see it.

317
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,960
The embroidery is so hard to get.

318
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,680
Come here.

319
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,760
Let me see your hand.

320
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,720
It's soft.

321
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,560
Have you learned embroidery before?

322
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,200
I've practiced it myself.

323
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,080
Then what are you embroidering?

324
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,480
I embroidered it myself.

325
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,520
Let me see.

326
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,720
This jade needle is really good.

327
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,560
You embroidered it?

328
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
It's a good foundation.

329
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,920
Okay.

330
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,600
I'll take it.

331
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,840
You should give it to Mr. A'Gong.

332
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,880
Thank you, Mr. A'Gong.

333
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,720
Okay, okay.

334
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,120
Kid, get up.

335
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Thank you, Mr. A'Gong.

336
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,960
I don't need to thank you.

337
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,120
From now on,

338
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,120
you can live here and learn to remember.

339
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,320
Okay.

340
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,480
I'll give you this.

341
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,640
Uncle Lin,

342
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,200
this is a handkerchief for you.

343
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,480
This is a pattern that Uncle A'Gong has drawn for me.

344
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,800
He said that the meaning of this pattern is hope.

345
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,720
This is for me?

346
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,200
Okay.

347
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,040
Hope.

348
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,840
I want Chang'an's jade needle.

349
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,960
Chang'an's jade needle.

350
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,560
Chang'an's jade needle.

351
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,280
Who is Chang'an?

352
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,120
He has a question.

353
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,680
Chang'an's jade needle.

354
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
Chang'an's jade needle.

355
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,000
Chang'an's jade needle.

356
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,120
What is it?

357
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,960
An's jade needle.

358
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
An's jade needle.

359
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760
This is Chang'an's jade needle.

360
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,280
Please have a taste.

361
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,600
It's so delicious.

362
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,480
Why is it so delicious?

363
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,800
This is the jade needle that I've been dreaming of.

364
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
That's right, Your Highness.

365
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
This is An's jade needle.

366
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,160
It's more than my five-day-long life.

367
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
It's more than my five-day-long life.

368
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
It's so delicious.

369
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,640
They are making the sour milk.

370
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,920
It's so delicious.

371
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,200
What are you doing?

372
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,360
This is the combination of animals.

373
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
When they are�

374
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,040
anking road on the floor,

375
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,560
they are difficult to find.

376
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
SWAT.

377
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,920
Look.

378
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,600
Look.

379
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
This is the mountain of Da Yuling.

380
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,600
It is.

381
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
The sign is I,

382
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,360
and you apply blood for it.

383
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Yes.

384
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,000
This isen't only an oppressor oven.

385
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
Thief.

386
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
Keep up the care.

387
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Go, go, go!

388
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Go, go, go!

389
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
We're starting!

390
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Go, go, go!

391
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Older brother Yang.

392
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Master Li.

393
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Master Li, we can't wait.

394
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Although we found the little Lu in the prison,

395
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
we must have someone to go there personally to know if we can get through.

396
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Yes.

397
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
So I think I should go and talk to him.

398
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Once I get through, I'll tell the secret to the enemy.

399
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Then I'll go north along the way.

400
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I'll help all the informants before you fight.

401
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
That's great.

402
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm just telling you this.

403
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
After I get the news, I'll go after you.

404
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Remember, after you get through the prison,

405
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
you can go to Chang'an without any trouble.

406
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
You can meet the transfer team with Li Zhi.

407
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Master Li, don't worry.

408
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I'll be at the corresponding station to wait for Li Zhi to transfer.

409
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
I'll quickly go to the nearest station to Chang'an.

410
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
I'll let you take the new Li Zhi to the open.

411
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Thank you.

412
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
We must do everything we can to get through this battle.

413
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,200
If you need any help, I'll ask the chief to send the money to all the officials in Yan Tu.

414
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
You can go and support them.

415
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I'll go to the open. I'll go right away.

416
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Be careful on the way.

417
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Come here.

418
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Come here.

419
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Come here.

420
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Come here.

421
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Come here.

422
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Come here.

423
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Come here.

424
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Come here.

425
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Come here.

426
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Everyone.

427
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Listen to me.

428
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Be safe and sound.

429
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
What are you doing?

430
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
These days, we don't have good manners.

431
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
I'm going to transfer my ship to Sa Shan.

432
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I've set up a ship.

433
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
What are you doing?

434
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm going to transfer my ship.

435
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
He transferred my ship.

436
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Who should I contact?

437
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
He asked me to go to the merchant's meeting to buy the goods.

438
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,200
If I don't solve it, my luck will be ruined.

439
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Yes.

440
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
The merchant's meeting is a matter of practice.

441
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
He's the one who's in charge.

442
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
The other side of the city should be in charge of the goods.

443
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
What about the old man who's holding the gun?

444
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Yes.

445
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Listen to me.

446
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Listen to me.

447
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
I'll keep your word.

448
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
These days,

449
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
I'll give you a solution.

450
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Listen to me.

451
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Listen to me.

452
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Mr. Chao.

453
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
The merchant's meeting is in chaos.

454
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
He knows that he's still in trouble.

455
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
The people are helpless.

456
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I have several ships waiting for him at the entrance of the store.

457
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
I have a few ships waiting for him at the entrance of the store.

458
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I have a few ships waiting for him at the entrance of the store.

459
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I also have some money to invest.

460
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Is...is it all gone?

461
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Little brother.

462
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
You're so impatient.

463
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Amita isn't here,

464
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
is the charity department still here?

465
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Besides, Amita has left.

466
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
She might be in trouble for you too.

467
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
What?

468
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Please make an order for Mr. Chao.

469
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
This is a peacock.

470
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
It makes people panic and lives up to no good.

471
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I think it's better to go back to the right track and push a leader to be a leader.

472
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I think the young man has the money to be a leader.

473
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Thank you, Uncle Zhao.

474
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Cheng Xuan, thank you for giving me the opportunity.

475
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
It's not that I give you the opportunity, it's that you are lucky.

476
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Young and talented, especially, know how to be grateful and proud.

477
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
In my heart, it's the most important thing.

478
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Uncle Zhao, this is the letter of the three-year-old Li Feng Cheng.

479
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I hope you can take it as a reward.

480
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Uncle Zhao, please ask one more question.

481
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,200
In a few days, you will be a new leader.

482
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Will my leader be able to do it for a few days?

483
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
It's possible.

484
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Who can be the new leader?

485
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
It's not a fortune.

486
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
I'm not a leader.

487
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
I'm a leader.

488
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Thank you for your question.

489
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,200
If you can be as good as Uncle Zhao in the future,

490
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I will fight with you.

491
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
You guys are all here.

492
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Yes.

493
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
And here.

494
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
All of you, stand up.

495
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
All of you, stand up.

496
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
He Zishi, you must be quiet.

497
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Don't be angry.

498
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Old Zhao.

499
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Zishi.

500
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Amita, did you find it?

501
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
It's still there.

502
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,200
When did you start to catch a person

503
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
who is so useless in the field of leadership?

504
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Zishi, my sister.

505
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Cheng Mei has already been caught by Amita.

506
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
She has been caught for a long time.

507
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Get out of here.

508
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Keep looking.

509
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Zishi.

510
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Zishi.

511
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Now, there is a time

512
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,200
that I don't know how to do it.

513
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Amita is not here.

514
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
The hushengs

515
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,200
are about to start a fight.

516
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
I don't care.

517
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I don't have the time to talk to him.

518
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Zishi, Lingnan.

519
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Lingnan is a rich man.

520
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
He is a good man.

521
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
The hushengs

522
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
can't be alone.

523
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
If the hushengs are too loud,

524
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
the wounded won't dare to come.

525
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
They won't be able to live well.

526
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
What are you talking about?

527
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,200
I have a way to make up for it.

528
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Those hushengs

529
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
are not talking about the hushengs.

530
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
We will find a way for them.

531
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
At the same time,

532
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
there is a signal.

533
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Amita

534
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
is afraid that he can't be together.

535
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
The next husheng

536
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
will be possible to anyone.

537
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I have been

538
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
trying to make Amita disappear.

539
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
I can also

540
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
make up for the hushengs.

541
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
The wounded will be

542
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
the hushengs who don't want to be the hushengs.

543
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
At that time,

544
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,200
who will be the transfer of the hushengs?

545
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
You mean

546
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
the one you pushed out

547
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
was a husheng?

548
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Is it a husheng?

549
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
These hushengs

550
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,200
will definitely be on the hook.

551
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
At that time,

552
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Su Liang,

553
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Lin Shan De,

554
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
are the nine-headed hushengs.

555
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
They can't even pull them back.

556
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
They are dead.

557
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Who do you plan to choose?

558
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
The real blood of the hushengs

559
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
is a great reward.

560
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Please

561
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
don't be anxious.

562
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
If you are anxious,

563
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
you have the foundation

564
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
to make us proud.

565
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Qishan,

566
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
don't be afraid.

567
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
If you are afraid,

568
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
you can fight with your soldiers.

569
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
The hushengs will be the real hushengs.

570
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
They will be the hushengs

571
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
that will make us proud.

572
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
That's the kind of person

573
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
who will be the one to choose.

574
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
We will be the ones to choose.

575
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
That's the kind of person.

576
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Just say it directly.

577
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
If you want to fight,

578
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
you can do it.

579
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
The one who is the most important

580
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,200
and the one who is the most important

581
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
is Xiao Yun Chuan.

582
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Erzhao.

583
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
I have a question.

584
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Why are you so angry?

585
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Xiao Yun Chuan?

586
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Zishi.

587
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
I am a little worried about this.

588
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
As long as you are in agreement with the superior,

589
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
I can do anything.

590
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
He is not just this.

591
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
You are in the top.

592
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
You are a puppet.

593
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
I will continue to search the city.

594
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,180
Yongwu concealed

595
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
the mysterious incense.

596
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,700
Why did you ask him?

597
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,200
I am members of Sha hobbies.

598
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
You're telling him that

599
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
He is your own brother.

600
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Is it that far away?

601
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
She continua?

602
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,240
Husheng.

603
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Husheng.

604
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Husheng.

605
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,240
You don't have to help me anymore.

606
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
You betrayed me.

607
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
You blocked me again.

608
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

609
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Husheng.

610
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Husheng.

611
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Husheng.

612
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
I'm just afraid that you will see A'Tu in person.

613
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
You will be found by He Ci.

614
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
And He Ci will be in trouble.

615
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
After all,

616
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
he is your protector.

617
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
He is my enemy.

618
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
Husheng.

619
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
I didn't know that

620
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,320
your aunt's death was related to He Ci.

621
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,360
At that time,

622
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Lanyu suffered a lot.

623
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
She was buried here.

624
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
He Ci bought Lanyu.

625
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
He buried her mother.

626
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Later,

627
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
he sent me to the Hangshou.

628
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
He took care of the Hangshou.

629
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,320
He told me to keep the Hangshou in his heart.

630
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
He didn't dare to do anything to her.

631
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
He didn't dare to do anything to her.

632
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
I was always like this.

633
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
You only took me as your sister.

634
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
I was always like this.

635
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Did it hurt?

636
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,320
Did it hurt?

637
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
The movement of the transfer is not enough.

638
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
Okay.

639
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Help me take her.

640
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
It's not necessary.

641
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
She is her own person.

642
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Who should I take her?

643
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Amita.

644
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Amita.

645
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,320
I want to go to Chang'an to see my son.

646
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Are you going back to Chang'an?

647
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Li Mo.

648
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I will take this path

649
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
if I die.

650
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Sir, there is a secret letter in the house.

651
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Please give me a note.

652
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Don't rush.

653
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Please write a letter.

654
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
A big card?

655
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
But there is a big person.

656
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
I can't read it.

657
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
What a good idea.

658
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Third-class?

659
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
The first one is the first one.

660
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Third-class?

661
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
The second one.

662
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
The first one?

663
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
If you don't mind,

664
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320
I will ask the first one to write a letter.

665
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
I will write it.

666
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
I should have planned it earlier.

667
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
You are wrong.

668
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Only the details are good.

669
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Only the details are good?

670
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Yes.

671
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
The third one is the first one.

672
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
The third one is the most important one.

673
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
These are the most practical things in Chang'an.

674
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,320
The mayor and the lady asked me to take her.

675
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Thank you.

676
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Thank you.

677
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
What is the good thing about this?

678
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
The king of the king, please search Li Zhi.

679
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
The big card is three.

680
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
The last one is the most valuable.

681
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
The last one?

682
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
The more valuable, the more valuable.

683
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
The first one is the first one.

684
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
The first one is the first one.

685
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
The first one is the first one.

686
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
The second one is the third one.

687
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
The third one is the first one.
