1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's make them fit.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Time for that.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Where are we going now?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going to Miaoiforme.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What about your Clouds?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is this a RallenIN and his phantom power?

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The End

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 6

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just because there are so many people who love you,

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
you are so mean to me.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't fight anymore.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's useless.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have already used up your life.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Do you know why we are here?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you know how to live well?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let me out, quickly!

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Quickly!

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Have you left the building?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Did you guys have a bad conversation?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's okay.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's over when the flowers are blooming.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's go.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mudan.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Aunt Hong is also the first time to raise a child.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm thinking about it now.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I haven't managed myself yet and I've raised you.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I didn't make you a good friend.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I didn't even have to teach you well.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have a lot of responsibility

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
for you being like this now.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm like this now?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you mean?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's good.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Aunt Hong, you raised me, took care of me,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
avoided me from dying, starving and hurting.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've done such a thing.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You didn't abandon me.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You've already had a lot of mother.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,680
You don't have to give yourself the necessary

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to be a good friend.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Aunt Hong, do you think I'm sick?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't think so.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But you are all my friends.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's all.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It doesn't matter.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know what each other's deepest thoughts are.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I love each other with my face like this.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I love you.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My mother said that

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Qian Feng is a good friend.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I think, if Qian Feng didn't have you,

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
it wouldn't have been good.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What if I say that I've gone forward?

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What will you do?

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll chase you.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll do my best to chase you.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Luo Ren.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Luo Ren.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's wrong?

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Luo Ren.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The bag ran away.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Run away?

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The phone didn't have a bag.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It only had a note.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The fresh fruit.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The last set of the last one before the west.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I bought it.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The flower is blooming.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The drink is wine.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The fresh fruit.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hello.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hello, Miss.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What do you need?

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What?

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is 31 boxes.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The flower is blooming.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Help!

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let me go!

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let me go!

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let me go!

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me go!

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Be careful!

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What are you doing?

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to kill you.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going to kill you!

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm going to kill you!

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm going to kill you!

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What are you doing?

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're going to make others sleep.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't be so serious.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to kill you.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Be careful.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to kill you.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I...

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What are you doing?

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's wrong with him?

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know him.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He was looking at me before I got on the car.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then he came to me after I got on the car.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He came to me and then he killed me.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Miss, don't listen to him.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He's my partner.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We're a couple.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We're not a couple.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We're not a couple.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We're not a couple.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We're not a couple.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We're not a couple.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We're a couple.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's go back and rest.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What's wrong with him?

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's a liar.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He's not my partner.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know him.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's his name?

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He...

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know his name.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is he your partner?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're a liar.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Be careful. I'll kill you.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let go of me.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let go of me.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do you know him?

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Do you know him?

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know him.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know him.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Shut up.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let go of me.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's coming.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The police told me that he's a criminal.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And he's been detained.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're a criminal.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So it's okay.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I saw the watch on the table.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You called me Mu Dai.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll call you Mu.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Mu, I didn't mean anything else.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm so grateful that you saved me.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I was contacted here.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You stay here.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll go with my aunt.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know where the kitchen is.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm here to see someone.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you planning to live in a hotel?

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mu, how about this?

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You stay with me.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My aunt has a hotpot restaurant in Lao Cheng.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She's rich and has a lot of food.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And her business is good.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
She might even help you find someone.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Here.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Are you okay?

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm scared.

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's okay, aunt.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She saved me.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Mu Dai, your sister.

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Aunt, you were supposed to be here.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I promised her.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You should help me.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm here to help you.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I'm so tired.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
She's so pretty.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She might be...

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Aunt, she's a good girl.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She'll be fine.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I know what to do with my brother.

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you a big brother?

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's go.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
These years, when we were in the bridge,

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
there were fights.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You two don't go.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The End

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Come on.

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We're here.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is it.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Come in.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This way.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We're back.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come on.

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Come on.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sit here.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Zhang, bring the breakfast.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay, boss.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Boss, the breakfast is ready.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Eat more.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Miss Mu Dai, you saved Xiao Li.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm willing to keep you here for work.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But you've seen it.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's the way it is.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Look.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Cut the vegetables.

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is that okay?

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't think it's that useful.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm not used to it.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Then you can go out with Xiao Li.

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can have a meal.

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm not used to it.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm just a little bit of a nuisance.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How about a bowl of porridge?

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can do that.

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A bowl of porridge?

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A bowl of porridge?

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're willing to do that?

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's great.

213
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I just left for a bowl of porridge.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't find anyone.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Come on.

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hurry up.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Come on.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is good.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I brought something from a young age.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's all here.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you want to go out?

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I didn't expect that he would go there.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I asked someone from the old house.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But Mu Dai didn't go.

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There must be something.

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
By the way, today is the Phoenix House.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't you want to go there?

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Not really.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's raining so hard.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's the sound?

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Phoenix House, open the big window.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The fire is burning.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The small food is coming.

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There's a free meal.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is the day you chose the Huangdao.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Who would come to our place

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to pay this price

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
with such a big rain?

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is there anyone?

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Please come in.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's okay.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The meal is really good.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a good meal.

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Uncle Gui.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We're old friends.

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We're not just friends.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We're like a family.

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What do you think about our meal?

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Right?

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay.

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're the first customer in our restaurant.

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We're opening a restaurant.

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You come to the factory.

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't care if you want money.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can't go there if you have to.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But if you want to take it back,

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't take it back if you want more.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They're not in my house.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They're just running around.

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They're running around.

262
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Get out of here.

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm just a busy man.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm not a busy man.

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm just a busy man.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm just a busy man.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why?

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Open a restaurant.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Five dishes.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Three dishes for free.

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come on.

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Everyone has one.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Each person has one.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Pick whatever you want.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
White soup.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's what you said.

277
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Phoenix's hotpot.

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Uncle Gui said

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that this is too unrecognizable.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's just a house.

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The main one is a beautiful one.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a little bit meaningful.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's good.

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We've been together for a long time.

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Thank you.

286
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're welcome.

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Although the restaurant is changed,

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
it's still very comfortable to stay here.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Come on.

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Come on.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's a little small.

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't mind it.

293
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This bed is usually not supported.

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's a little messy.

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let me clean it up.

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I remember now.

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The Wanwu Garden is a place of origin.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I decided to take care of the Xia Guans.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Come on, little radish.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Hurry up and bring the small pocket back.

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

307
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to take a look at the house.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I was abandoned by my mother.

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
She wore a pair of red high heels.

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
She was always so cool.

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Later, she took me to a welfare hospital.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
She gave me a peach.

321
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She left.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Could it be that her real sister...

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
is her mother?

324
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Sister Mo Mo.

325
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Sister Mo Mo.

326
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Sister Mo Mo.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is the present I gave you.

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Have a look.

329
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Do you like it?

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The original building you asked me to check.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I've checked it for you.

332
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There are only three holes in the whole south.

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's been removed.

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The last hole is this.

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The last hole is this.

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What do you want?

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This kind of person.

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll tell you.

339
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If you look at it again,

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll pull out your eyes.

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll take you to the next one.

342
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Sister Mo Mo.

343
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Who are you looking for?

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I used to live there.

345
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Little rabbit.

346
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Cute, right?

347
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've contacted the welfare hospital.

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
When the wooden beam was gone,

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
it was too small.

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It had no evidence.

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I only knew that she was speaking with her local accent.

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The old man shouldn't be too far away.

353
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where is that welfare hospital?

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Leng Gui.

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Leng Gui is a welfare hospital.

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Are you suspecting that he's gone back to the old man's house?

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm leaving.

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Wen Feng Hu.

359
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please leave a message about the wooden beam

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
near the welfare hospital.

361
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Right.

362
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's so nice.

363
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Send me this.

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I like it too.

365
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What's wrong?

366
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Why are you here?

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I have to do something at home.

368
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What do you want to do?

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I heard that there's something wrong with the wooden beam.

370
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm so afraid that I'll come back.

371
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm so afraid that I'll come back.

372
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There's nothing I can do.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's okay if you're afraid.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm so glad you're here.

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm so glad you're here.

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't you have any good intentions?

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're just a smart guy.

378
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm just a smart guy.

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You're just a smart guy.

380
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know how it feels.

381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You shot the video by yourself.

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Go upstairs.

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You can send me a message.

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm telling you.

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The most important thing is Leng Gui.

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hello?

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The text message is here.

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,760
Find someone who wants to live a different life.

389
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,240
You understand?

390
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,760
Just rely on me to make a video.

391
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,480
We are called pure hair.

392
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,520
Luo Ren has already gone to find Wan Feng.

393
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
What should we do?

394
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
We can only make a few mistakes

395
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,560
and choose some local media.

396
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,360
We can ask them to send us news.

397
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,240
What is this?

398
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,960
This is called the strong link to the Ma Tai.

399
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,880
It's a big one.

400
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,600
It's a word.

401
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,760
Smell.

402
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,040
Is it reliable?

403
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,160
He's so thoughtful.

404
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,800
Really?

405
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,160
He gave a few of his hosts a gift.

406
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,080
He's already tied up with a big brother.

407
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
He must have told him that

408
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm a hair stylist.

409
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,360
Yes, I'm a hair stylist.

410
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,920
I don't know what to say.

411
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,640
What should I do?

412
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,560
It's been a long time since I last met Luo Ren.

413
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,000
Why did you do this?

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,280
You're so ugly.

415
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
It's good that you're here.

416
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,320
You're a different person.

417
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,120
I'm a bit thirsty.

418
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,800
What's up?

419
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
Tell me, are you thirsty a bit faster?

420
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,120
I think I see theüf.

421
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,280
Where?

422
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Where?

423
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,920
There.

424
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Come on!

425
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Are you alright, brother?

426
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Yes!

427
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Dantong,

430
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
men should be quick.

431
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Don't be so cowardly.

432
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Come on!

433
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Brother,

434
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Dantong,

435
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
you're so brave to fight with me.

436
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
I want to go to the temple.

437
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Brother,

438
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
I heard that

439
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
you're scared of men.

440
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I'm scared of men.

441
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
You're so ridiculous.

442
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
I've never been there.

443
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
They told me

444
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
that when you were in the middle of the night,

445
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
you could hear the heartbeat

446
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
on the stone table.

447
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
It's so loud.

448
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Dantong.

449
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Little girl,

450
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
you're here again.

451
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You said you wanted to have a beer.

452
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Drink it up.

453
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Come on!

454
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Dantong!

455
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
It's done.

456
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Brother,

457
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
he said he couldn't drink it.

458
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I'll drink it up for you.

459
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Dantong,

460
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
drink it up.

461
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Come on!

462
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
It's okay.

463
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
It's okay.

464
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Aunt,

465
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
they came last time.

466
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
What's wrong?

467
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I can't do anything.

468
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
What can I do?

469
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Which table?

470
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
They're the ones.

471
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
I'm not going.

472
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
I'm not going.

473
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm not going.

474
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I'm going.

475
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm not going.

476
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
They won't let me go.

477
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
I...

478
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
I'm still going.

479
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
I'll go.

480
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Miss Gu.

481
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Don't go.

482
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Don't go.

483
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Don't go.

484
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
What's going on?

485
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
You're doing a laundry job now?

486
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Your hand is dirty.

487
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
It's dirty.

488
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
What's going on?

489
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Did you eat it?

490
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Where's your boss?

491
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Boss!

492
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
No.

493
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
You're a laundry man.

494
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
What are you doing?

495
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
Brothers!

496
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
What do you mean?

497
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Come on.

498
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Come on.

499
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
You're going to kill me.

500
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
You're so noisy.

501
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
No.

502
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
No.

503
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
No.

504
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
No.

505
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm new here.

506
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Don't be angry.

507
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
No.

508
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I don't know the rules.

509
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Come on.

510
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
You guys go play.

511
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Go play.

512
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Give me another bottle of beer.

513
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Miss Gu.

514
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
You're so naughty.

515
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Enough, brother.

516
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Miss Gu.

517
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Did you watch the show before?

518
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
You're so naughty.

519
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
No.

520
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
It's my first time.

521
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Dr. Mu.

522
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
You just stay here and do your job.

523
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
You don't need to wash the dishes.

524
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I'll find a new one.

525
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Mrs. Xie.

526
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
You can watch the show if you want to.

527
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Okay.

528
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I'll give you a job.

529
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
Brother.

530
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Brother.

531
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
What do you think about this?

532
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
The illusion is coming again.

533
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
It's the fourth time.

534
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
The fourth time is coming.

535
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Give me an idea.

536
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Don't say it.

537
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
The interrogation is over.

538
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Don't be so bold.

539
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Now, Dr. Mu is alone again.

540
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
I'm not sure.

541
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Now, Dr. Mu is alone again.

542
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
The fourth time is coming.

543
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
It's coming.

544
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
You're worried that Dr. Mu will be in danger.

545
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Theег Liu's bedroom

546
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
What special special astonishing letter

547
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
tired Dr. Mu?

548
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I don't want you to see what I wrote.

549
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I'm never scared in reality.

550
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
We are afraid of being concurrently nuisance

551
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
or theölliglo dónde???

552
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Let me never come here.

553
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
I really need your help.

554
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
He doesn't want

555
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
to escape from the house of Dr. Mu.

556
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
You're a grown-up.

557
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
I can't see anything.

558
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Sister Mu Mu.

559
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,800
You scared me.

560
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,560
Am I that scary?

561
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,480
Look.

562
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm searching for the red heels you want to find.

563
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,640
The ones on the list are all horrible.

564
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
Especially this one.

565
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,400
The most scary one.

566
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,120
It's been 20 years.

567
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,120
At the time,

568
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,040
Nan Tian was developing a new area.

569
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,520
It was built by a giant butterfly.

570
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
But this butterfly

571
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,400
was just a little bit older.

572
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
The place where it was developed has changed.

573
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,840
So this place

574
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,400
has become a place of exchange.

575
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,880
People are getting less and less.

576
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,840
Then, there's a strange talk.

577
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,520
There's a group of couples

578
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,360
going to the butterfly meeting.

579
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,720
That guy

580
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,240
wanted to write some mountain poems on the stage.

581
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,120
But he just finished writing his name.

582
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,640
He heard a heart beating.

583
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,240
There's a heart beating inside.

584
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,440
I heard it.

585
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,680
At that time,

586
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,040
they suddenly felt like a wind blowing on their neck.

587
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,120
They were like someone blowing air in the back.

588
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,640
They didn't dare to look at it.

589
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,160
They just looked at it.

590
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,840
But they found out

591
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,880
there's a pair of

592
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,160
pale women's legs

593
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,480
and a pair of

594
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,640
red high heels.

595
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,800
Mu Jie,

596
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,760
don't you think it's scary?

597
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,080
Yes, it's very scary.

598
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,200
Mu Jie,

599
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
you're too cruel.

600
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,600
This place is Nan Tian's

601
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
most scary place.

602
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
Many people go there to try to fight.

603
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,400
If you really dare to go there,

604
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
it's going to be scary.

605
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,200
You think that's the same as me?

606
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,280
Mu Jie,

607
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,640
do you have a boyfriend?

608
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,720
I do.

609
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,160
What do you mean?

610
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,720
Is he handsome?

611
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,280
Is he handsome or not?

612
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Mu Jie,

613
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,080
tell me.

614
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
Mom.

615
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,120
The train today is coming down to Wingsi River.

616
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,520
Don't miss it

617
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,160
when you are in Wingsi River.

618
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,920
Just a minute.

619
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Mom!

620
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,360
Mom, wait for me! Don't go!

621
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Look at him.

622
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
He's like this.

623
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
He's like this.

624
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
He's so shameless.

625
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Mom!

626
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Mom!

627
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Mom!

628
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Mom!

629
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Why did you hit him?

630
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Why?

631
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Don't hit me!

632
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Don't hit me!

633
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Mom!

634
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Hello, I want to ask you something.

635
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Just eat the cake.

636
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Don't be scared.

637
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I want two radish cakes.

638
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Just two.

639
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,920
What do you want to ask?

640
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,920
There used to be a building like Tian Jing.

641
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
I lived there before.

642
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Does anyone live there now?

643
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
No, I've been wasted.

644
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Do you still remember the people in the building?

645
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Who do you want to ask?

646
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,920
A woman who wears red heels for over 20 years.

647
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
She likes to dress up and wear makeup.

648
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,920
She likes singing.

649
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
She...

650
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
You know?

651
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Yes.

652
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,920
A little girl who lives in a kitchen.

653
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
She often takes care of men.

654
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Her wife comes to her.

655
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
She has a big head.

656
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
She's drunk at the real building.

657
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
I knew it.

658
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
She would be in trouble sooner or later.

659
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
She's a very kind woman.

660
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Later, when she got sick,

661
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
she was in a difficult situation.

662
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,920
She even took the scarf and tied her face up.

663
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
She went to the hospital and tried to get the doctor.

664
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
She finally got the doctor.

665
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
She looked like a ghost.

666
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
She was so scary.

667
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Where's Haolan?

668
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
She's dead.

669
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
She was in the town hall.

670
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
She was killed by a jump.

671
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
She's dead.

672
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
She's dead.

673
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
She's dead.

674
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
She's dead.

675
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
She's dead.

676
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
She's dead.

677
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
She's been in the building for a while.

678
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,920
She's never been in a fight.

679
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,920
No one dared to mention her name.

680
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Nobody would.

681
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
But I'm not afraid.

682
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm a old woman.

683
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
Poor thing.

684
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I don't know where that girl is.

685
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
She's so cold.

686
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,920
She's so tired.

687
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
She's dead.

688
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
I'm sorry.

689
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I'm sorry.

690
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm sorry.

691
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
I'm sorry.

692
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm sorry.

693
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
I'm sorry.

694
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
I'm sorry.

695
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
I'm sorry.

696
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
I'm sorry.

697
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I'm sorry.

698
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,920
I'm sorry.

699
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm sorry.

700
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
I'm sorry.

701
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm sorry.

703
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
I'm sorry.

704
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
I'm sorry.

705
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
I'm sorry.

706
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm sorry.

707
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
I'm sorry.

709
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
I'm sorry.

711
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm sorry.

713
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm sorry.

714
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm sorry.

715
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
I'm sorry.

716
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
I'm sorry.

717
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
I'm sorry.

718
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
I'm sorry.

719
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm sorry.

720
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
You didn't hear me.

722
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
I didn't know.

723
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
That bitch.

724
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Let's check it.

725
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,760
Don't worry

726
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:19,520
See you

Who? Who?

742
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
You... You...

743
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
You're not that restaurant waiter?

744
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,580
Oh my god. You're not even on the way.

745
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
You scared me.

746
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
What are you doing?

747
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,580
They said there's no moon.

748
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,580
Here. You can hear the heartbeat.

749
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Go.

750
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Chao.

751
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,580
I'm really on the way.

752
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,580
I don't believe it.

753
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
I don't believe you need to check it out.

754
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
I know.

755
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
What? Why are you not going?

756
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Chao.

757
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
I... I miss Niang Niang.

758
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
You want to get a hangover, right?

759
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
Help me.

760
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,580
Brother, this is too high.

761
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
Let's not count it.

762
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,580
It's so high.

763
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,580
We can get a hangover.

764
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,580
Come, let's go.

765
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
You...

766
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
Little bastard.

767
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Why did you do that?

768
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Why?

769
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Sister Mo Mo, why did you wake up so early?

770
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
Did I go out last night?

771
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
Last night...

772
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
Last night...

773
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
You went out.

774
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
You came back late.

775
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
I mean, did I go out after I slept last night?

776
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
After...

777
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,580
After I slept, why did I go out?

778
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I don't know what you said about the dream.

779
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
I slept so hard.

780
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,580
Then, the time goes by so fast.

781
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,580
The clear line of the flower is breaking.

782
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Tell me the answer.

783
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,580
The gentle line of the chicken feet.

784
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,580
In the sea, the wind blows gently.

785
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,580
The smoke of the ear.

786
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:01,580
The clear line of the flower is breaking in the dark.

787
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,580
Tell me the answer.

788
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,580
The gentle line of the chicken feet.

789
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:17,580
In the sea, the smoke of the ear.

790
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:23,580
The smoke of the ear is breaking in the dark.

791
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,580
The clear line of the flower is breaking.

792
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,580
Tell me the answer.

793
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,580
The gentle line of the chicken feet.

794
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:53,580
In the sea, the smoke of the ear.

795
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,580
In the dark.

796
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,580
In the dark.
