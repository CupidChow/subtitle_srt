Schwermann millisecond

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,920
...

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,080
French

4
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
The End

5
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Episode 1

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
It's so pretty.

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Don't move.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
If you move more, I'll be in trouble.

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Don't laugh.

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
If I keep moving,

11
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
your eyebrows will be all over the place.

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Zheng Ping An.

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Is that your little brother?

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Yes.

15
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Zheng Ping An.

16
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Look at you.

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
You look pale.

18
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
You're so old-fashioned.

19
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
You'll starve to death.

20
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Take him.

21
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Hide behind him.

22
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
And forget who you are.

23
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
The manager is downstairs.

24
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
There are not many guests today.

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
Although he looks like a stranger,

26
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,080
the guests upstairs can only be welcomed by themselves.

27
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I understand.

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Don't worry, boss.

29
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
These guests upstairs

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
are my best friends for many years.

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
They are my best friends.

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
They are my best friends.

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,080
I also support them in Chang'an.

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Don't say anything else.

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
In the past,

36
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
people were served by others.

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
From now on,

38
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
people were served by others.

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
You're still not going up?

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
No.

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
I'll be back.

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
He'll be back soon.

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
He'll be back soon.

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
I'll be waiting for him.

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Zheng Ping An.

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
You're old again.

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Zheng Ping An.

48
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
He's not well.

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Now, who doesn't know

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
that he's only been served by the chef?

51
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,080
He's got all the rights to be a chef.

52
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I'll be back soon.

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
The chef is not well.

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
The chef is not well.

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
He's not well.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
He's not well.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
He's not well.

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
He's not well.

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
He's not well.

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
He's not well.

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
He's not well.

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
He's not well.

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
He's not well.

64
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
He's not well.

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
He's not well.

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
After the chef's service,

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
we'll have a drink with him.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
We'll drink with him.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Then, Zheng, please.

70
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Yes.

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
What?

72
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
What?

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
What?

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
What?

75
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
I haven't found out for so many years

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
that Zheng Xiong has been born to be a good boy.

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
He's a brilliant man.

78
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
He's a brilliant man.

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
He's a brilliant man.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I can't believe it.

81
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Zheng Xiong only has the talent to dance

82
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
and dance.

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Zheng Xiong.

84
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Zheng Xiong.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Go!

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Go!

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Go!

88
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Go!

89
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Go!

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Go!

91
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Go!

92
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Go!

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,840
Shen Publicünü

94
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Shen land

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,300
Shen U Acadestine

96
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,120
To kill

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,260
Shen Ling

98
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,260
The

99
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,260
the

100
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,260
the

101
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,260
the

102
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,260
the

103
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,260
the

104
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,260
the

105
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,260
the

106
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,260
the

107
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
the

108
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
the

109
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,260
the

110
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,260
the

111
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,260
the

112
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,260
the

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:27,680
Always On

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,420
Li Zheng is a soldier.

115
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,460
I'm afraid he will be more ruthless.

116
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,860
These years,

117
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,380
it's because of the self-preservation of the people.

118
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,820
The right side is more dedicated.

119
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,220
Now the Noble Consort is more sincere.

120
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,500
She can't be a real man anymore.

121
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,860
He Yaoguang has the military uniform.

122
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,820
The wind is getting stronger.

123
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,980
The chance to turn the right side of the ship

124
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,180
is getting more and more.

125
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,220
So you just mentioned the official thing.

126
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,500
You deliberately incite Zheng Ping'an.

127
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
You want to keep him?

128
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,180
But he is a timid person.

129
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,700
It's hard to admit it.

130
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,940
I will tell Zheng Ping'an about the past.

131
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,100
Just to let him know

132
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,940
that the noble family he wanted to return to

133
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,780
is not equal to the status of the noble family.

134
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,540
These years,

135
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,900
he has been in the hotel room in Chang'an

136
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,180
and has been very beautiful.

137
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,500
No matter how good the Huxuan dance is,

138
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,900
it's just a roundabout.

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,420
He is like me.

140
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,660
He is the chess piece in the Noble Lady's eyes.

141
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,500
The nail in her hand.

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,100
Since she has entered the palace,

143
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,900
why not give her a chance?

144
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,940
Let her know that

145
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,460
the glory is not given by others,

146
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,620
but by herself.

147
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,940
I need a helper

148
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,540
to hide the empty room.

149
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
He is the identity of the right-hand man.

150
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,300
He can use it.

151
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,180
If Zheng Ping'an

152
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,900
has the blood and conscience of a man,

153
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,380
he will stay.

154
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,980
If he wants to leave,

155
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,940
he will let him stay in Chang'an

156
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,700
for the rest of his life.

157
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,340
Sir,

158
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,500
can I write a letter to the right-hand man

159
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,180
to the right-hand man?

160
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,620
Can I move the right-hand man?

161
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,420
The right-hand man is a new courtier.

162
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,620
He can't move his position

163
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,980
in the filial piety.

164
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,100
He has been in the prison for many years

165
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,780
and has not been able to catch the right-hand man.

166
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,980
He is still in the prison.

167
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
Now,

168
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,860
as long as He Yougwang is pulled down,

169
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,020
he will be charged with the right-hand man's crime

170
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,180
and he can move the right-hand man's root.

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,620
How can he pull He Yougwang down?

172
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,100
You should know that, right?

173
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,220
Sir.

174
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,760
I have a grudge against You ILD.

175
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,860
I also ask you

176
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,860
to identify this characteristic –

177
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,100
You have finally scenified yourself

178
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,940
with your indifference to turn the question back

179
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,700
that you would break into the eco container first.

180
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
I'll lonely you

181
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,740
if I Pronounce Thisamam.

182
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,140
ład

183
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,420
ved

184
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
in which哈哈

185
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
I will go to the

186
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,380
We did

187
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,300
road

188
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,040
Lu-an will save time.

189
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:47,940
Linan already got хорошus

190
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,680
for a long-time outdoor business,

191
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,080
when he bought theaga real quick.

192
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,520
He then joinedvenge with a tiger,

193
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,760
waiting for his shipyard company,

194
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,200
to split

195
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
The tiger was really strong inside,

196
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
the people thought the hotel

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
was made stout to attract lotんです to pay.

198
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,240
Just when,

199
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,560
even the best in preventing tiger business

200
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,420
all went out and won big bag,

201
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Hai Hu drew a sea urchin to sit at Qi Jing Lou and then came to class.

202
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,420
But one night, Qi Jing Lou left the water.

203
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Hai Hu didn't have time to escape and died in that fire.

204
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
During the night, Hai Hu became a useless man.

205
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,420
In that period, he cried and loved the sea.

206
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
I love you.

207
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Can you say it again?

208
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
I still don't understand.

209
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
After the game,

210
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Hai Hu was the one who drew the sea urchin.

211
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,420
After Qi Jing Lou's fire, Hai Hu's business collapsed.

212
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
He was not only in the dark, but also in the government.

213
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
He also became a useless man.

214
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Once he died, he became the commander of Linan.

215
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
I understand.

216
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Qi Jing Lou's fire was the biggest cause of the disaster.

217
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
The fire was not an accident.

218
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
The fire was a cause of the disaster.

219
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Song Wu Ji found Qi Jing Lou in Linan.

220
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,420
He quickly returned to Chang'an.

221
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
He must have found the clue.

222
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Did the fire in that year have a person who was lucky to be alive?

223
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
You can ask.

224
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
The fire in the night was a fierce fire.

225
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Qi Jing Lou's business was a man's life.

226
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,420
But if the fire is a human, it is difficult to leave a gap.

227
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
I was in the dark.

228
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,420
Many famous scenes did not appear.

229
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,420
But since the man in the fire is a man of nature,

230
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
you are an idol.

231
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,420
You can use this identity to go out for a walk or go to the west.

232
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
I heard from you.

233
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
But you stay in Linan.

234
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,420
You must have a clear and honest statement with the Governor.

235
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,420
They will not interfere in the future.

236
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,420
Mr. Xie mentioned that I have my own arrangement for the Governor.

237
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,420
I have no other choice but to lead the night.

238
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,420
I will do my best.

239
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
I underestimated you.

240
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,420
I thought you were just a coward.

241
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
You don't underestimate me.

242
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
I am a coward.

243
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,420
But for my father and for my sister,

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
I will be bold for a while.

245
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
Wang Jing is back.

246
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Please stay.

247
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
Yicheng.

248
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
It's so late. Why don't you take a rest?

249
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
I was waiting for you.

250
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
Waiting for me?

251
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
It's not too late.

252
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
The shop is very small.

253
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
The time is short.

254
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
I will go to the shop to pick up the money.

255
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
The account is here.

256
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,420
The famous show is here.

257
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,420
Please take a look.

258
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,420
The famous show.

259
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
Here.

260
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
This is the same.

261
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Yicheng.

262
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
I live in my own house.

263
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Who else lives in my house?

264
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,420
I have been to the Governor.

265
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,420
He said that the Wolf King is not a petty man.

266
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
He will help him.

267
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Otherwise, the people would laugh at him.

268
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
And he will lose your face.

269
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Don't listen to him.

270
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
He doesn't know me.

271
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Minister Li also said

272
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,420
if the Wolf King insists on helping him,

273
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
he will go to your house to save him.

274
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
He also said that

275
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
the relationship between you two

276
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
will be over.

277
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,420
I...

278
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Qi Lang.

279
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
Help Gu Yejie.

280
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
Otherwise, where will I live?

281
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
If you didn't help him,

282
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
would they have offended me?

283
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
The Governor has taken my account first.

284
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Then I will go to the factory.

285
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Okay.

286
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I

287
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
don't like to owe others money.

288
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
Take it.

289
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Okay.

290
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Okay.

291
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Have a good rest.

292
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Come.

293
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Take the money.

294
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
Where is the supermarket?

295
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
Give me the money.

296
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
What money?

297
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
You are stupid.

298
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Su Liang gave you so much money.

299
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
You even spent my money.

300
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I don't have any money now.

301
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
You can't just give me money.

302
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
The money that Su gave me

303
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
is the money that Shiyan has transferred.

304
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
You can't move.

305
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
You are a big hand and a big foot.

306
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
You really don't have any money?

307
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
I am a horse-drawn man now.

308
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,420
I am not a pejoshi.

309
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,420
I don't have any money.

310
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
I have no money.

311
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
I have to raise you.

312
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,420
I have raised you.

313
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Give me this.

314
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
What?

315
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
You bought a house for twenty yuan.

316
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
No, Ping An.

317
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
Why do you come to Lingnan?

318
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
This is too hard.

319
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
What is this?

320
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
This is...

321
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Is there anything like this?

322
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Give me the money.

323
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
I can give you the money.

324
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,420
But you have to tell me clearly today, Ping An.

325
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
Why do you come to Lingnan?

326
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Do you have to travel with the name of Ma Guiyun?

327
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Who is Ma Guiyun?

328
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,420
And that day, you said you wanted to revenge.

329
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
I am worried about this.

330
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
What is going on?

331
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I know too much about you.

332
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,420
If you are not good, you have to tell me.

333
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
Or I...

334
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
I am worried about you.

335
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Ma Guiyun is a right-wing man.

336
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
He is dead.

337
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
The left-wing man asked me to name him.

338
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
To ask you something.

339
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Wait.

340
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Gao, you go out.

341
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Bring the money.

342
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,420
You go out too.

343
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Master, I know too much about you.

344
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
You go out.

345
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,420
I got the letter from He Yuguang to You Xiang.

346
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
I have got the letter.

347
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
I can go back to Chang'an.

348
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,420
But I heard that you are related to You Xiang.

349
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
I want to collect more evidence.

350
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
I want to move to You Xiang.

351
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
You...

352
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
You want to move to You Xiang?

353
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
You are so smart.

354
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
Have I ever laughed?

355
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,420
We are both dead.

356
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
It's so embarrassing.

357
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
You are the closest people.

358
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
You are so stupid.

359
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Yun An, we have to live well.

360
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
We have to go back to Chang'an.

361
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Close your eyes.

362
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
I will get the money.

363
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
No need to close your eyes.

364
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
I can send you back.

365
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
Fine, you go back.

366
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
I will send you back.

367
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
No.

368
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Let's go.

369
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Ping An, I will tell you something.

370
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Don't worry.

371
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
I will take care of you.

372
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
No.

373
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Don't talk.

374
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
You are here.

375
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
You are here.

376
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
You are here.

377
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
You are here.

378
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
You are here.

379
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Ping An, we have to go back to Chang'an.

380
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,420
We have to go back to Chang'an.

381
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,420
We have to go back to Chang'an.

382
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
We have to go back to Chang'an.

383
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,420
I...

384
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
I...

385
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
Yun Shang...

386
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,420
Think about it.

387
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Don't worry.

388
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
What is this show?

389
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,420
What is this show?

390
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
The tiger's cake.

391
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
This tiger cake is so beautiful.

392
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
So beautiful.

393
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
The tiger cake.

394
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
The tiger cake.

395
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
I want you to go back to Chang'an.

396
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
The southern direction.

397
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Hurry up, Zhuang.

398
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Li Shan De.

399
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,420
Come out.

400
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Li Shan De.

401
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
You little animal.

402
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Why are you shouting?

403
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I am here to find someone.

404
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Hurry up.

405
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Zhu Zedong is a guest.

406
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Li Shan De.

407
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I will meet you.

408
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Li Shan De.

409
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,420
Don't push me.

410
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Li Shan De.

411
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Hurry up.

412
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Li Shan De.

413
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Go.

414
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Don't shout.

415
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Zhu Zedong is a guest.

416
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
What are you shouting?

417
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Li Shan De.

418
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Call the tiger.

419
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Li Shan De.

420
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Li Shan De.

421
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
Li Shan De.

422
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
Hurry up.

423
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Li Shan De.

424
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Tong.

425
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Why are you here?

426
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
I will send you Li Zhi.

427
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Tell me.

428
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
So many new Li Zhi.

429
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
I can't eat Chang'an's birthday.

430
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,420
I am a good cook.

431
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Thank you, Tong.

432
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
You are welcome.

433
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Li Zhi is enough.

434
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,420
Did you think about

435
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
sending Li Zhi to the birthday party?

436
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
I think I can do something.

437
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,420
The way to send Li Zhi to the party

438
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,420
is to send Li Zhi to the party

439
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
in five days.

440
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
It is already the deadline.

441
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
Then you can't send her to the party.

442
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
I can't trust you.

443
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,420
If you send Li Zhi to Chang'an,

444
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
it is very important to send her to the party.

445
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
What are you talking about?

446
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
What are you talking about?

447
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,420
If I have a shorter route,

448
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,420
my plan is to change it to Liang's.

449
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
Then the plan may be better.

450
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Then it is just one day or two days?

451
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
You can't say that.

452
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
The money I bought Chang'an's house

453
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
was collected every day.

454
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Then Li Zhi's day

455
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
can be deducted every day.

456
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
It may be less than that.

457
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Maybe there is still a chance.

458
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
We have to try.

459
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
How?

460
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420
We really need to find a few horses.

461
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
We really want to try.

462
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
The horses I made are very powerful.

463
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
Here.

464
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
And this.

465
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
This, this.

466
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,420
The price is good.

467
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
No way.

468
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,420
This is too expensive.

469
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Too expensive.

470
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,420
I can't run 30 miles.

471
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
I can't run.

472
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
What is he doing?

473
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
For your family,

474
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
his career

475
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,420
has to be worth more than 70,000 yuan.

476
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
5000 yuan.

477
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
No matter how good the price is,

478
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,420
it can't be worth more than 1000 yuan.

479
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Shut up.

480
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
The Dong family likes people like him.

481
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
People like you,

482
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
who are just like a pot of soup,

483
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,420
who are just like a pot of soup,

484
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
who are just like a pot of soup.

485
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Who is just like a pot of soup?

486
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,420
Li Zhi is the one who is not lying on my head.

487
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
I really don't know where you are looking at him.

488
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
He is just a young man.

489
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
He can't be your aunt.

490
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
I, I will go back and calculate.

491
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
I will go back and calculate.

492
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
I will take care of it.

493
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
I will take care of it.

494
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Don't go.

495
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
Let's talk more.

496
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Can you?

497
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Is it expensive?

498
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,420
The price of your house is

499
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,420
more expensive than Chang'an's house.

500
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
If I want to make this experiment,

501
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,420
I need hundreds of horses

502
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
and dozens of riders.

503
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
If I calculate it,

504
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
I can't get over 1000 yuan.

505
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
So much money?

506
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,420
Can't you save it?

507
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,420
I can't save it.

508
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
The fastest horse and the best rider

509
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
is the fastest horse and the best rider.

510
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Otherwise, the result will be meaningless.

511
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,420
Where did you get this money from?

512
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Think of a way.

513
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
I am on the way to Huashan.

514
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
Huashan?

515
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
You are going to climb the mountain?

516
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
What mountain?

517
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
It is a pen.

518
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,420
The point is that you have to climb the mountain.

519
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
You have to go to the top.

520
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
You can't get down the middle.

521
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Thank you for your interest today.

522
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
See you.

523
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
I will calculate it later.

524
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,420
He is not nice at all.

525
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,420
He can speak clearly.

526
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
He is very gentle.

527
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
You think that

528
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
everyone can see Wei Ling

529
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
in one mouth.

530
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
What do you want to say?

531
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
You are so loyal.

532
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Your father will go to the temple with you.

533
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
What should I do?

534
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
He loves to talk.

535
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
He loves to listen.

536
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
He can't understand the culture.

537
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
You haven't figured it out yet.

538
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
He is not interested in you at all.

539
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
He just wants to see you as a good liar

540
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,420
and to take advantage of your fate.

541
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,420
Look at him.

542
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
He is the horse and the best rider.

543
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
He is not advantageous at all.

544
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
You didn't listen to him.

545
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
He said he has no money.

546
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
Besides,

547
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
he is not nice to you.

548
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
No matter what,

549
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
I will take care of him.

550
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Rrrrrrr.

551
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
Dog.

552
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
Dog.

553
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Rrrrr.

554
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
Report.

555
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Report.

556
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
What are you doing?

557
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Rrrrr.

558
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,420
How many times have I said it?

559
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
My wife is in a bad mood.

560
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
She doesn't have any important knowledge.

561
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
She doesn't want to disturb me.

562
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,420
I thought about what you people

563
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,420
would do.

564
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
You can sleep.

565
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
I will do the work.

566
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
What is it?

567
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
Hurry up.

568
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
We are in the same room.

569
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
Our men are looking at the right side

570
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
and the right side

571
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
and the right side

572
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
and the right side are looking at the wrong side.

573
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
She didn't come back to Chang'an.

574
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
I thought this is the key.

575
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
So...

576
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,420
This is the key.

577
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
What's the matter with you?

578
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
I am going to report this.

579
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I am going to report this.

580
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Why do you think

581
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
this Marui is staying in this Li Nan?

582
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
This is the key.

583
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
This is the key.

584
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,420
Today,

585
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,420
I have bought things on the street.

586
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
I have been in a hurry

587
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
and the rules are over.

588
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
I have been reported.

589
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I am in a hurry and I am happy.

590
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
I am happy

591
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,420
that you are still in Chang'an, north of the capital.

592
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
I am happy

593
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
that I finally have the chance

594
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,420
to be with you.

595
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
In the past,

596
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
I was busy with my work.

597
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
I couldn't get a job.

598
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,420
I was too busy with my work.

599
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,420
I didn't want you to be absent-minded.

600
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Today, I came here

601
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
to give you my advice.

602
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
I am

603
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
touched.

604
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,420
I am a good person.

605
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
I am a good person.

606
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
I am a good person.

607
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
I am a good person.

608
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
I am a good person.

609
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
I am scared.

610
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
I am going to serve you

611
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
today.

612
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,420
You don't have to be scared.

613
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
Good boy.

614
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
My god.

615
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
This is the new year's wine.

616
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
It is a new one.

617
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
It is a special wine from Lingnan.

618
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
I hope you can enjoy it.

619
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
Look.

620
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
This is the first cup of wine.

621
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
It is a new wine.

622
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
I think

623
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
it should be

624
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
a good drink.

625
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Good.

626
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
Cheers.

627
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Cheers.

628
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Cheers.

629
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
The second cup of wine

630
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
is now

631
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
to the old man.

632
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
He is in Chang'an,

633
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
New Year's Eve.

634
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Five cups of Jingyang wine.

635
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Five cups of wine.

636
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Five cups of wine.

637
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
This cup is full of drinks.

638
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Full of drinks.

639
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,420
Cheers.

640
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Cheers.

641
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Cheers.

642
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
Cheers.

643
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Cheers.

644
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Cheers.

645
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Cheers.

646
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
Cheers.

647
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
Cheers.

648
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
Cheers.

649
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Cheers.

650
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Cheers.

651
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Cheers.

652
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Cheers.

653
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Cheers.

654
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Cheers.

655
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Cheers.

656
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Cheers.

657
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Who would have thought

658
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,420
your colleague died of a disease?

659
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
And he used the last breath

660
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,420
to give you a right hand.

661
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,420
This cup is for him.

662
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
For him.

663
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Brother Xin.

664
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
The dead are gone.

665
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
We just sat down.

666
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
The dishes are ready.

667
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Let's eat.

668
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Brother Gu.

669
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,420
You are in a hurry.

670
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,420
I'm in a hurry to deliver the ice-cream.

671
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Now you have the smile.

672
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Why don't you go in?

673
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,420
How did you talk to Brother Gu?

674
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
Brother Gu must have taken a new task

675
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
from the right side.

676
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
You can't talk to him.

677
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,420
You still don't deserve to be a part of it.

678
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,420
I'm sorry.

679
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
I'm sorry.

680
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,420
This cup is for Brother Gu.

681
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,420
It's a good idea.

682
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,420
The fish is not watered.

683
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,420
It's a good idea.

684
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
I'm here to take the banquet today.

685
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,420
To see the common feelings of the three of us.

686
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,420
The wine

687
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
is our past together.

688
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,420
This banquet

689
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,420
is good wine,

690
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,420
good food,

691
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
and good friends.

692
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
I'm here to take the banquet.

693
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,420
Good friends.

694
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,420
If you ask me to make a ceremony,

695
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
I'll think that the banquet is good.

696
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,420
The wine is good.

697
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,420
I can only

698
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
thank you.

699
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,420
Brother Gu.

700
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I just heard you say

701
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,420
I think he's right.

702
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,420
We're here today

703
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,420
to drink wine, right?

704
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,420
I suggest

705
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,420
this cup of wine.

706
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Drink it alone.

707
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
Good night, Brother Gu.

708
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
Let's drink.

709
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,420
I've made more than ten cups of wine.

710
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
Even if the wine is sweet,

711
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
I'm afraid I can't drink much.

712
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
Who told you that it's sweet?

713
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
It's a bottle of wine.

714
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
It's a bottle of wine?

715
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,420
The wine is just sweet.

716
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
It's sweeter.

717
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,420
It's not sweet.

718
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
It's good for your health.

719
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,420
My husband is fine now.

720
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,420
He's fine.

721
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
He can drink it alone.

722
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,420
The wine is not good.

723
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
I'm hungry.

724
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,420
I'm hungry.

725
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
I'm not hungry.

726
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
I want to have a meal.

727
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
I want to go back.

728
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,420
Why don't you let me go back?

729
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
I sent a messenger

730
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
to give you a letter.

731
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
I saw that letter.

732
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
He gave me a letter.

733
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,420
I was angry.

734
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
I was angry.

735
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
I was angry.

736
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
I was angry.

737
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
I was angry.

738
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,420
I was angry.

739
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
Brother Gu.

740
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
Brother Gu.

741
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Brother Gu.

742
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
I'm not angry.

743
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
I'm telling you.

744
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,420
We don't know other places.

745
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
In Lingnan.

746
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
If anyone dares to make you angry,

747
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,420
I'll send people to get 50 taels.

748
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Brother.

749
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
You're so funny.

750
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
In this letter,

751
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,420
what can he write?

752
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
He wrote...

753
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
He wrote...

754
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
He wrote...

755
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,420
The moon in the desert.

756
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
Drink first.

757
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,420
We'll talk about it later.

758
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
You finished it.

759
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,420
What did you say?

760
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
I said,

761
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
I said,

762
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,420
I said,

763
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
I said,

764
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
I said,

765
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,420
Brother.

766
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,420
In Chang'an,

767
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,420
when you drink this wine,

768
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,420
you should dance.

769
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Brother.

770
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,420
Ji Baba.

771
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Ji Baba.

772
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,420
Your family can have secrets.

773
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,420
You told me,

774
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,420
there's a letter to the man who wrote it.

775
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,420
What's that?

776
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,420
Ji Baba.

777
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,420
I don't hide it.

778
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,420
I don't hide it.

779
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,420
Actually,

780
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
there are two words.

781
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,420
Poison.

782
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,420
What does poison mean?

783
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,420
Poison.

784
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,420
It means the three-spreaded thread.

785
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,420
The big one is the Wanli River Mountain.

786
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,420
It means the water is flat,

787
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,420
the birds are flying in the forest,

788
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
the tide is rising and falling,

789
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,420
the moon is rising and falling,

790
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
that's all.

791
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Can you understand that?

792
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,420
I don't know what poison is.

793
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,420
I think it's the new one,

794
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,420
the new one,

795
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,420
which is the one that is under the leadership of the leader.

796
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
What did I say?

797
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
I'm drunk.

798
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
I'm drunk.

799
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Did you hear that?

800
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
I didn't hear it.

801
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
Did you hear that?

802
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,420
I didn't hear it.

803
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
I'm drunk.

804
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,420
I just want to ask,

805
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,420
what does the leader of the leader of the day and night want to do?

806
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,420
The leader is my brother.

807
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,420
I'm looking at the leader of the leader.

808
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
What does it mean?

809
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Don't worry.

810
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
He's still a man.

811
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,420
I'm looking at the leader.

812
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Why don't you worry?

813
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,420
Brother, I'm not leaving.

814
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,420
I want to lead the leader's big and good drinking business.

815
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
It's just that,

816
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,420
brother,

817
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,420
the cost of the rice is huge.

818
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
Brother.

819
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Brother.

820
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,420
Brother,

821
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,420
the leader of the leader of the day and night is Gong Shi.

822
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Gong Shi is a Gong Cha.

823
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,420
That's right.

824
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,420
From now on,

825
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
you must be happy.

826
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Of course, you must come to this city to cure it.

827
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
Tell the master,

828
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,420
whatever he does,

829
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,420
he's the best.

830
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
Drink.

831
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
Drink.

832
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Drink.

833
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
Drink.

834
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,420
There are various advantages of this four-way route.

835
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
I don't want to be able to walk through it at once.

836
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,420
I just want to know if this path can be changed.

837
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,420
I can't let this path go into the long-term.

838
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Anyway, I can go back to the city.

839
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,420
Either here,

840
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
or the last few months,

841
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
you let me live in the Communist Party.

842
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
Either you kill me.

843
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Come on.

844
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Who's going to kill me?

845
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,420
You kill me.

846
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
You kill me.

847
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
I'm a leader.

848
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
I know I can see your life.

849
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
You kill me.

850
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
So,

851
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,420
you're the one who killed me.

852
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
I'm a leader.

853
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm a leader.

854
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I'm a leader.

855
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm a leader.

856
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm a leader.

857
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm a leader.

858
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm a leader.

859
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm a leader.

860
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm a leader.

861
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I'm a leader.

862
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm a leader.

863
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm a leader.

864
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,420
I'm a leader.

865
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm a leader.

866
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I'm a leader.

867
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm a leader.

868
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
I'm a leader.

869
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm a leader.

870
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm a leader.

871
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm a leader.

872
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm a leader.

873
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm a leader.

874
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
I'm a leader.

875
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
I'm a leader.

876
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
I'm a leader.

877
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm a leader.

878
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I'm a leader.

879
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm a leader.

880
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,420
I'm a leader.

881
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,520
I'm a leader.

882
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,720
I'm a leader.

883
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm a leader.

884
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,220
Let's take stand this.

885
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,320
Let's take stand this.

886
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,620
I'll hold your store for you

887
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,820
till I get locked up.

888
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,420
Women fall into a fit of fate.

889
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,420
I'm persistent with孩cest or大遺us.

890
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,220
And I'm a leader.

891
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,220
Let's take stand this.

892
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,220
I'm that leader.

893
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,420
You did well.

894
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,620
We should be in this together.

895
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:40,620
In the cold wind and the moon, before the heart is broken

896
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:50,620
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit

897
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:22,620
I was challenging in my Beijing youth to get up at the time
