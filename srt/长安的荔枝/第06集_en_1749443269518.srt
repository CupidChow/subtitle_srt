00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,300
Cute

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:27,300
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

3
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,420
sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it,

4
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,300
but I'm not sure if you can see it, I'm not sure if you can see it,

5
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,900
but I'm not sure if you can see it,

6
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,300
look at this.

7
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,020
New generation of beauty artists were born inī LUHDUB.

8
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
The more than 100,000 people inī LUHDUB.

9
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,020
I think the one who passed this is Li Zhi

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,020
The one who passed this is Jin Yin

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Please watch Chang An's Li Zhi

12
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,020
Qi

13
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,020
Li Zhi

14
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Zhang Yan

15
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
Mo Xun

16
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Red Aaa

17
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,420

18
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,020
This incense is heiの

19
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Su Liang

20
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,020
The one who passed this is Avenger

21
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,680
Yes.

22
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,420
Leader Su,

23
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,180
you should join us.

24
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,560
Within such a short time,

25
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,840
how can you

26
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
have these materials in place?

27
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,940
When you repair the perfים,

28
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,560
you solved it, too.

29
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,280
Look, that Analisesian하는

30
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,940
the parl one,

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,340
forks and sprockets.

32
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,760
∅ form, ∏-ань is the other.

33
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,660
∃ graphically forms, ∝G male par� french victim. ∑ female hierarchy.∆

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,420
equivalently Fel gir on that bank,

35
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,020
Four-spice shell is more snake than the one in the Chenxiang.

36
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,220
Especially the amount of the Chenxiang wood.

37
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,120
I dare to bet that the whole Chang'an is not really able to provide.

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,620
This matter is in Chang'an.

39
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,620
Except for the amount of the wood,

40
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,620
no one can move it.

41
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,020
It's just enough to stay.

42
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,020
Chenxiang and Ru Xiang, I have already bought them.

43
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,420
The boat has already opened to the inside. It will soon be finished.

44
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,820
The immortal, the little ghost, doesn't know.

45
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,420
Don't know.

46
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,420
It's not even a secret.

47
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,220
I guess that's enough. We have to get someone to help us.

48
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,020
Handle!

49
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,420
Handle!

50
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,020
Handle, our boat

51
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,720
is on the way to the sea when it's about to take off.

52
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,620
She's taken off!

53
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,920
So what's reply to this ship to this man?

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,720
It's because she has been dismissed and wascompoused.

55
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,420
What Mrs. Yu asked Xiang Huan directly into this advance.

56
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,920
Su La.

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,920
The right side of the Sishang Pavilion has been moved.

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,920
The material used is a famous shop in Yangzhou.

59
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I already know.

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
That was my dream.

61
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I was sent back.

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I didn't get it back.

63
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Chang'nan.

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
I don't have my own place.

65
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Give it to me.

66
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Give it to me.

67
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Give it to me.

68
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
It's over there.

69
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
I'll get you.

70
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Give it to me.

71
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
If you want to take it on the road,

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
you'd better find a big hole in the honeycomb.

73
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Just put the honeycomb inside.

74
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I know how to use the honeycomb.

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Do you have any way to make the honeycomb longer?

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I'll tell you a secret.

77
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Don't tell anyone.

78
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Or I'll punish you.

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
No.

80
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Before you put the honeycomb on the road,

81
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
you can soak the honeycomb with the salt water.

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
But it can be used for three days.

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Three days?

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,920
The honeycomb method is the same as the one in Yangzhou.

85
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I used it in Shanglin Shrine before.

86
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I know.

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Do you have any motive to make the honeycomb longer?

88
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Comrades, Yang Xiao Wei is here.

89
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Wait for me.

90
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Move aside.

91
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Come on.

92
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,920
I thought Yang Xiao Wei was in trouble last time.

93
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,920
He was not only in a bad mood, but also in a bad mood.

94
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
I didn't expect that today he's here again.

95
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I'll give you a honeycomb.

96
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Today, either you go back to your positions,

97
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
or you go out of the circle.

98
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't move.

99
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I've been making money recently.

100
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
There are only so many now.

101
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
When I sell the fruit in May, I'll be able to pay more.

102
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
That's all?

103
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm so happy to get it.

104
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
How much did you owe?

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Didn't you lose?

106
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I also advise you.

107
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Now, you're in a bad mood.

108
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
It's a debt.

109
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
If you keep doing this,

110
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm afraid that the people in your society

111
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
will never be able to do anything.

112
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Let's think about it.

113
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Don't listen to him.

114
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,920
What? I'll go to the steel mill.

115
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
What?

116
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
What?

117
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Put it down!

118
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Put it down!

119
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
As long as the person is still here,

120
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
the circle can still be seen.

121
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
It can't be given.

122
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Where's the money? Give it to me.

123
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
A'Tong. A'Tong.

124
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
You can use the water to clean it.

125
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You can't even use the method to clean it.

126
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Shut up!

127
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Tell me.

128
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Where did you get it from?

129
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
What water?

130
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Can you use the money to clean it?

131
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Shut up!

132
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Come on.

133
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Water.

134
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
That's it.

135
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Just take the jar inside the house.

136
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Put the lychee in the water.

137
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
The water can also be used to clean the lychee.

138
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
It's good for four days.

139
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
It's not good for two days.

140
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,920
It's just that it can be taken for six days.

141
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
It can be taken for six days.

142
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
That's good.

143
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
That's good.

144
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Six days.

145
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
You two are good.

146
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
A'Tong, hurry up and sign it.

147
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Sign it?

148
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
That's my circle.

149
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
You can't leave the circle.

150
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
You can't leave the circle.

151
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
I'm telling you.

152
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
This circle's lychee is all mine.

153
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I want it.

154
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
I...

155
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I was ordered by the Governor to take the circle.

156
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm not the Governor.

157
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
You can't take it.

158
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I...

159
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
I was ordered by the Saint.

160
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Shao Lingnan was ordered by the Governor.

161
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Shao Lingnan was ordered by the Governor.

162
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Then the Saint will take the circle.

163
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Which one of you can take it?

164
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
If that's the case,

165
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I can't give you the lychee.

166
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
But the lychee's debt

167
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
must be yours, right?

168
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Come.

169
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Take it.

170
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
What?

171
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Money is not a good thing.

172
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,920
How long have you been a member of the lychee?

173
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I thought you were a immortal.

174
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
A'Zong, be careful.

175
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
You're crazy.

176
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm not.

177
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Today, you can't take my circle.

178
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,920
If you want to be a criminal,

179
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
you can only take me alone.

180
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
It has nothing to do with my identity.

181
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
You can't take it.

182
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Anyway, it's free.

183
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
I don't have it.

184
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
You can't take this circle.

185
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,920
You're lying.

186
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
What are you waiting for?

187
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Go.

188
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Who can take it?

189
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
I'll see who can take it.

190
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
No one can take it.

191
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm the governor of the Saint's Palace.

192
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Governor.

193
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Do you know?

194
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Governor.

195
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I announce that

196
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
from today on,

197
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,920
the death penalty is the use of the lychee.

198
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,920
The penalty is the use of the lychee.

199
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
The penalty is the use of the lychee.

200
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm afraid you'll be punished.

201
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Go.

202
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Go.

203
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Go.

204
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Go.

205
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Go.

206
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Go.

207
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Go.

208
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Go.

209
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Go.

210
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Go.

211
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Go.

212
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Go.

213
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Go.

214
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Go.

215
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Go.

216
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Go.

217
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
You didn't take it.

218
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Go.

219
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Go.

220
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Go.

221
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Drink slowly.

222
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Don't worry.

223
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Li Shande, go.

224
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Go.

225
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Li Shande, the guard of the gate,

226
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
saw that he was leaving the house

227
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
not only in the city,

228
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
but also in the street.

229
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
He was in the street.

230
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
He would have a long time to see.

231
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Did you and Hezi get along well this time?

232
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Yes.

233
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
You're so good.

234
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
You're not a soldier in a day.

235
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
You drove away the city.

236
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
You're like a person.

237
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
You're so good at fighting.

238
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
But I'm curious.

239
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,920
How did you convince him?

240
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
He was a young man.

241
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,920
He didn't know how to hang around.

242
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
He taught me.

243
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
He used the same knife

244
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
to put it in General's hand

245
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
to kill the enemy.

246
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
He used it to kill the enemy.

247
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
He used it to kill the enemy.

248
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
He used it to kill the enemy.

249
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
The same tool and different method

250
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,920
are different in the result.

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Tell me.

252
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
How did I teach you?

253
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
You're so good.

254
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,920
You've been a good man.

255
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
You're so good at fighting.

256
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
You're so good at fighting.

257
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
You did see the difference.

259
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
You're so good.

260
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
I've been a little bit in the south.

262
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Now, Li Shande is gone.

263
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,920
The military uniform is in my hand.

264
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
I've been a little bit in the south.

265
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Little pig.

266
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Why are you back?

267
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
I'm not leaving.

268
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
You're not leaving?

269
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
I'm not leaving.

270
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm going to stay in the military uniform.

271
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
I think this is a good thing.

272
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Shi Yan.

273
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
You're so good.

274
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
You're so good.

275
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
You're so good.

276
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
You're so good.

277
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
You're so good.

278
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
You're so good.

279
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Little pig is here to kick the boat.

280
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Didn't I tell you?

281
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,920
The boat is full of weight in the south of the river.

282
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,920
The boat is going to investigate the danger of the private warehouse.

283
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Your boat is checked.

284
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Of course it will be confirmed.

285
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Go back and get some news.

286
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Go back.

287
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Go back.

288
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Go back.

289
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Go.

290
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
This is the Wufu Tongdie.

291
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Please take a look.

292
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
There are black and white papers on it.

293
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
You can have a look.

294
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,920
The official code is in the Wufu Tongdie.

295
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Does that mean

296
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,920
I don't need to check my goods?

297
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,920
I can send them to the police?

298
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,920
It's still the old man who's going to fight.

299
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,920
He can get a legal punishment.

300
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
If so,

301
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
we'll follow the order.

302
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
We'll send you to the boat.

303
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Go.

304
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Go.

305
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Go.

306
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Don't do that.

307
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Go.

308
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
What's going on?

309
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Go.

310
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Go.

311
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Su Lang,

312
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
we're all out of the boat.

313
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Out of the boat?

314
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Yes.

315
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
We're all out of the boat.

316
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Go.

317
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Little Wei.

318
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Why is my boat empty?

319
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Your boat is empty.

320
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
It's empty.

321
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
The Anxi River is full of people.

322
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Now,

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,920
the officials are all out of the boat.

324
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I can't escape.

325
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Can you tell Xiao Long

326
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
where they went?

327
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Xiao Wei should know

328
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,920
where they went.

329
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Don't try to be so hard.

330
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,920
You're being too rude.

331
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm not being rude.

332
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm not mean.

333
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
What do you mean?

334
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
The single sentence says

335
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
the ship is empty.

336
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Now, I'm giving you back the boat.

337
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Besides,

338
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
you're lucky.

339
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
The food is scattered.

340
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
The numbers are all back.

341
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Or,

342
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
when you encounter a storm,

343
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
you'll be in the sea.

344
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
It's possible.

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
You thief.

346
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Give us back our boat.

347
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
How can it be empty?

348
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
What are you talking about?

349
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
It's empty.

350
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Put it in the bag.

351
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Go.

352
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Little Wei.

353
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Don't talk.

354
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Can you tell Xiao Long

355
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
where I should go

356
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
to find my Anxi?

357
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Master Fu.

358
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
If I stay at home,

359
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I'll go back to Li Nan.

360
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
You're not going to go back?

361
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,920
You're still keeping your own money.

362
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Go on.

363
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
How can the big-shot spices

364
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,920
be carried away under their eyes?

365
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
That's right.

366
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
My guess is that

367
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
they didn't steal it.

368
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
But they must know

369
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,920
who stole the handkerchief.

370
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
They can't tell.

371
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
That means

372
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
there's a big man

373
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,920
behind this.

374
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
It's hard to tell.

375
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
There will be a risk.

376
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
So they must

377
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
find a way

378
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
to get out of here.

379
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Your eyes will be big.

380
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Your ears will be long.

381
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
No matter if they're standing

382
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
or hiding,

383
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,920
as long as they're out of here,

384
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
they'll be out of here.

385
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
You're too much.

386
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I've been waiting for an explanation.

387
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Why are you avoiding me?

388
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Brother, this jar is so thin.

389
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
It's so light.

390
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
You can all leave.

391
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
I'll go get it.

392
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Li Shande,

393
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm telling you the truth.

394
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
He wanted to kill you.

395
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
He was so cheap

396
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
after he went back.

397
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I don't know

398
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
how he found out

399
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
you're a leftist.

400
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
He said you're a worker.

401
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
You're just a craftsman.

402
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
You're a craftsman.

403
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
It's me.

404
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
I'll help you.

406
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Master Wu,

407
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
what my wife said

408
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
is true.

409
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
That day,

410
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
my wife

411
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
broke the second pot of wine.

412
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
She agreed

413
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
that you should leave

414
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
and not kill you.

415
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm a madman.

416
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I don't know

417
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
if I can kill him.

418
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
He's a madman in Lingnan.

419
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Anyway,

420
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,920
he died when he went back.

421
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
And Liu Xian is dead.

422
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
I'd rather use this method

423
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
to save money.

424
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
You're so stubborn.

425
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
You want to stay here

426
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
and get rid of him?

427
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm not stubborn.

428
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Anyway,

429
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm not so sure.

430
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm sure

431
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
I'll be a good man.

432
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
But I'll be a good man

433
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
even if I'm a bad man.

434
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I'll make you all

435
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
the same.

436
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I'll see

437
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
who can win the last one.

438
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll do it.

439
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
If I really succeed,

440
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I'll be saved.

441
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I'll

442
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
make you all

443
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
the same.

444
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
OK.

445
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
I'll take the first one.

446
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Go.

447
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Preventary nutrition will

448
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
."

449
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Send three swaggers

450
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
after I am young.

451
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Change me for a wine?

452
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Senior.

453
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,360
You,

454
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
mixt These women.

455
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Come.

456
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Why are you here?

457
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,920
I told you, this is a medical resource.

458
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Come, sit down.

459
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
A medical resource.

460
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:30,920
I had to transport our high-end medical resource to Chang'an before June 1.

461
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
So I came to take some red blood for the three months.

462
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I went to do a medical insurance test.

463
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I thought you were trying to help us to make up the story.

464
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
So you really want to use the medical resource?

465
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Yes.

466
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Chenyuan, what's the name of the holy man you mentioned?

467
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
He's bigger than the monk.

468
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
That's much bigger.

469
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,920
The holy man is the biggest temple in the world.

470
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,920
So he doesn't have the medical resource?

471
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
No, he doesn't.

472
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,920
The holy man lives in Chang'an, which is my hometown.

473
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
He's 5000 miles away.

474
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
What's 5000?

475
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
5000 miles?

476
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,920
It's a very long distance.

477
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,920
So it's far away than Shaozhou?

478
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
It's far away.

479
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I don't understand.

480
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Why doesn't the holy man come to eat by himself?

481
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
I want to take you there.

482
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I want to know too.

483
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Is Chang'an bigger?

484
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
It's bigger than Zhou.

485
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
It's much bigger.

486
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Chang'an is not only big, but also crowded.

487
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
It's also crowded.

488
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,920
The place I went to was called Qingqing Palace.

489
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
The Qingqing Palace is the holy man's home.

490
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
The palace gate is bigger than the city gate.

491
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,920
The next door is the main street.

492
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
It's wide and has a lot of steps.

493
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
You can go on horseback riding.

494
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
The two streets are all closed.

495
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,920
You're so good at talking.

496
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
You don't even have the address.

497
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
We live in Chang'an.

498
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
We have a lot of address.

499
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
But we don't have address.

500
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
We often eat noodles.

501
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Especially the pancake.

502
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
The filling is good.

503
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,920
It's perfect when it's cooked.

504
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,920
I get up late sometimes.

505
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
I buy one.

506
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I walk with my daughter.

507
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
One person per bite.

508
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
One person per bite.

509
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
One person per bite.

510
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Do you miss home?

511
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Changxiang Temple.

512
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Chang'an.

513
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Chang'an, don't be sad.

514
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
We're so lively.

515
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
You'd better stay tonight.

516
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Have a good meal.

517
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
And drink.

518
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Cheers.

519
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Cheers.

520
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
What's this?

521
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
It's a taste.

522
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Can you drink it?

523
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Yes.

524
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I'll drink.

525
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Are you a little bit jealous?

526
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
No, no, no.

527
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm thirsty.

528
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
It's not a taste.

529
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
You're drunk.

530
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
How many bottles of juice are there?

531
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
I'll tell you.

532
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I said we just got off the bus.

533
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I didn't expect him to be so fast.

534
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Why are you so stubborn?

535
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Just drink.

536
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
But I think you're a good person.

537
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
I won't give you the rest of the money.

538
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Drink.

539
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
What's your name?

540
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
My name is Li Shande.

541
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm from Liang.

542
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Li Shande?

543
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Six words.

544
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
It doesn't matter.

545
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Just call me Li Shande.

546
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Li Shande.

547
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
You said you miss home.

548
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Why didn't you mention your wife?

549
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,920
My wife passed away six years ago.

550
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
She left me a little girl.

551
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
We're close.

552
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm more than a little girl.

553
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
You're a person who's important.

554
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I have no idea.

555
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Mr. Li, let's dance together.

556
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
No, no, no. You dance.

557
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
You dance.

558
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Come on.

559
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Come on.

560
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Li Shande,

561
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
are you willing to stay at this place?

562
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm willing to.

563
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I still have to send this place

564
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
to the Chang'an for the birthday.

565
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Then it's settled.

566
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
You stay and help me.

567
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Let's make this place together.

568
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
I'm in Chang'an.

569
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm also a teacher.

570
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
I can help you.

571
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,920
I can make this place more exciting.

572
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Really?

573
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Really.

574
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
Okay.

575
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
I want to drink with you.

576
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Drink with you?

577
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Drink with you?

578
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
This is a good idea.

579
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Come on.

580
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I want to drink with him.

581
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Come on.

582
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Come on.

583
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Radu,

584
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
are you crazy?

585
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
You drink with that guy.

586
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Isn't that willing to be a couple?

587
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I think he's pretty good.

588
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
You know him.

589
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
The world's daughter, the choice of the wolf king,

590
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
no matter what,

591
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
he's handsome, talented,

592
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
and has a good family.

593
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Wait, wait, wait.

594
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
He's not handsome either.

595
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
I don't understand what he's saying.

596
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,920
But I can feel that he's a talented person.

597
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
And he knows the farm.

598
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,920
I need someone to be with me

599
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
to keep this garden.

600
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
It's all fake.

601
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
You only know him for a few days.

602
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
He lied to you.

603
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Radu.

604
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Think about it.

605
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Have you ever said

606
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
your origin is the best water and soil?

607
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Every one here

608
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
wants to take over your garden.

609
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
How can you trust him?

610
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I trust you.

611
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
You're also a grown man, Radu.

612
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,920
He won't stay in Lingnan.

613
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,920
He said he had a daughter, Chang'an.

614
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
And he said

615
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
he was a life-size man.

616
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
He wanted to go back to Chang'an.

617
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
He was 5,000 miles away from Lingnan.

618
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
He was walking for more than a month.

619
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
He was going to eat fresh lychee.

620
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
He was so lucky.

621
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
He was so lucky.

622
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
He was so lucky.

623
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
He said he couldn't be sure.

624
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
If you don't want to get married,

625
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
you can be my widow.

626
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
I'll be more tired to help him.

627
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Stop it.

628
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
I'll be your widow if you don't want to get married.

629
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
A'Tou.

630
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
What's wrong with you?

631
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Take care.

632
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Be careful.

633
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Okay.

634
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Mr. Li.

635
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Mr. Li.

636
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
What brings you here?

637
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm here.

638
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I've come to trouble.

639
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
I have a boat.

640
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
It's in the back of the Yangshou.

641
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
I'm in the port.

642
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
I'm in the port.

643
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm in the port.

644
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I'm in the port.

645
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm in the port.

646
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm a man.

647
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm a man.

648
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Mr. Su.

649
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
We don't need so many people.

650
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Yes.

651
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
So...

652
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
So I'm here to see you.

653
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Is that so?

654
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Yes.

655
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,920
You've used the butterfly.

656
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Yes.

657
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
It can't be removed.

658
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Yes.

659
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
And the money you gave me

660
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
is also in the bank.

661
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
It's not you.

662
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
No.

663
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
You don't understand.

664
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
But I understand.

665
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
My money

666
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,920
is in the bank of your bank.

667
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I won't let them

668
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,920
go back to the original place.

669
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
You and the Chishi's Mansion

670
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
have a relationship

671
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
with the Oubon Sillian.

672
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Can you help me

673
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
to seduce and seduce them?

674
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
I just want to know

675
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
where my Ansheng香 is.

676
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
I...

677
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I have no relationship

678
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
with them.

679
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm with the Chishi.

680
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
The relationship between me

681
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
and the Chishi

682
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
is the relationship of the butterfly.

683
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Now

684
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
the relationship between me and the Chishi

685
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
is in your hands.

686
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
I have no relationship with them.

687
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I really love the butterfly.

688
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Love the butterfly?

689
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Is it really love the butterfly

690
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
or not?

691
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Love the butterfly?

692
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Yes, it's not love the butterfly.

693
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Why?

694
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
It's love the butterfly.

695
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
If

696
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
I let more money

697
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
go to the land in your land,

698
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
can you

699
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
pay more money?

700
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
No.

701
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
You have a order.

702
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
It's not money.

703
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
It's...

704
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
I really want to

705
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
earn your money.

706
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
But I can't.

707
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Why?

708
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I can't say

709
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
that I have to

710
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
study the experiment

711
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
of the transfer of interest.

712
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
I can't do it.

713
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
I can't do it.

714
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
I can't do it.

715
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
I can't do it.

716
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Uncle Tao, you are here.

717
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Thank you.

718
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
I'll help you.

719
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Thank you.

720
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Where is Li Daxi?

721
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Li Daxi?

722
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Where is he?

723
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Li Daxi.

724
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Uncle Tao.

725
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Why are you here?

726
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Li Daxi is

727
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
so kind to the Holy Master.

728
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I brought some chicken soup

729
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
for Li Daxi.

730
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Try it.

731
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Thank you.

732
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
I'll go this way.

733
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Okay.

734
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Okay.

735
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
It's so nice.

736
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Uncle Tao, you are a good cook.

737
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
You are so good at cooking.

738
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Really?

739
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Then, is it tasty?

740
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
To be honest, it's not good.

741
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
It's not good.

742
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Lin Jian.

743
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
Li Daxi.

744
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
Li Jia is a great cook.

745
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
He lives alone in this station.

746
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
He must be a good cook.

747
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
He is a good cook.

748
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
But Li Daxi

749
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
is back to the factory.

750
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Why is he here?

751
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
I was looking for hope

752
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
in the old room.

753
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
I wanted to

754
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
study the way

755
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
of the transfer of the interest.

756
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Uncle Tao, you are not here today.

757
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
I want to visit you.

758
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm lucky.

759
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
What's the matter?

760
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
I'll tell you the truth.

761
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Uncle Tao.

762
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Our leader.

763
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Is there a soldier?

764
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Soldier?

765
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Of course, there is a soldier.

766
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
But Li Daxi

767
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
is useless.

768
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
I have to use the soldier

769
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
to transfer the interest.

770
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
How much do you want?

771
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
I don't need much

772
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
when I was in the hospital.

773
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
But the more I get lucky,

774
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
the better it is.

775
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
This way.

776
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Li Daxi wants to use the soldier.

777
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
It's a loan.

778
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
I can't

779
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,920
lend it to the saint.

780
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
It's a real use.

781
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
He should give it to me.

782
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
You are from Chang'an.

783
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
You have seen the big world.

784
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Don't worry.

785
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I'll go back

786
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
to the box-making shop.

787
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
Thank you.

788
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Thank you.

789
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Goodbye.

790
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Goodbye.

791
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Why is he so hard?

792
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
I told you

793
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
the fire should be cut off.

794
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
It's a fire.

795
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
But I haven't

796
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
reached the end.

797
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
He's so excited.

798
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
He wants to have a bite.

799
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Zi Shi.

800
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
He's using the saint's order

801
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
to get the soldier.

802
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
We can't give it to him.

803
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
I'm looking at you.

804
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Actually...

805
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
I thought you said

806
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
it's not a bad thing.

807
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
This time,

808
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
I asked Zhuo Jin

809
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
to make a special dish

810
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
with lamb.

811
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Good idea.

812
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
It's not even tasty.

813
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
What about the soldier?

814
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
But the right side

815
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
will teach us a trick.

816
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
If you want to get the uniform,

817
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
you have to write the filial piety letter.

818
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
If he wants to get the soldier,

819
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
we'll let him write

820
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
the letter of the soldier.

821
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
I'll write it now.

822
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
You can write it now.

823
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
You're really good at writing.

824
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Jin Li Shande.

825
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Because of the transfer of the order,

826
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
you and Ling Nan

827
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,920
are fighting for the army.

828
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
You should be the one

829
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
to be the one to be the traitor.

830
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
The traitor.

831
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
No, no, no, Mr. Li.

832
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Is there a word?

833
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
The soldier.

834
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
The soldier?

835
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Mr. Li,

836
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
you're definitely

837
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
the soldier of the soldier.

838
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
I got it.

839
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
I thought

840
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
you wanted to use

841
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
the military force to suppress the army.

842
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
Look.

843
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
I got it.

844
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
I said you were

845
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
facing the south yesterday.

846
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
I didn't say that.

847
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
The military force

848
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
didn't solve the problem.

849
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
We didn't talk about the military force.

850
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
So,

851
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I hope you can

852
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
help me with the military force.

853
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Mr. Li,

854
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
this army

855
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,920
is much more difficult.

856
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
You know,

857
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Ling Nan is more hot-tempered

858
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
than Chang'an.

859
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
I've never seen

860
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
this army before.

861
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
It's a pity that

862
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
it's difficult to fight.

863
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
It's hard to fight.

864
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Then,

865
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I'll write it down.

866
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
I'll take it back.

867
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Let's think of a way.

868
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I'll take my leave.

869
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
Here.

870
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Thank you.

871
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I've been

872
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
especially lucky

873
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
to bring the melon.

874
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
You said that

875
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
you met a senior again.

876
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
You can't be sure.

877
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
Yes.

878
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Tan Xiaojian

879
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
has become a black and white man.

880
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
He's a man of the past.

881
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Of course,

882
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
he can't be a man of the past.

883
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
But he's not a man of the past.

884
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
He's a man of the past.

885
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
He can't be a man of the past.

886
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
He's a man of the past.

887
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
He's a man of the past.

888
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
He's a man of the past.

889
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
He's a man of the past.

890
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
How can you be so satisfied?

891
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
You and Li Shanze

892
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
are a man of the past.

893
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Yes.

894
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I think you two

895
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
are the ones

896
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
who made you

897
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
the pervert.

898
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
No.

899
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
What?

900
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Kongming said that

901
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
you were not moving.

902
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I didn't move.

903
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I was moving.

904
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
I was moving.

905
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
I was moving.

906
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
I was moving.

907
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Right.

908
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
He said

909
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
he was a pervert.

910
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
You're making him mad.

911
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
He was so angry

912
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
that he had to give up.

913
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
But he

914
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
made us know

915
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
what to do

916
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
in the future.

917
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
What to do?

918
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
This is...

919
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,920
I'll try this lamb soup.

920
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Yes, this...

921
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
This must be eaten.

922
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
I heard that

923
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
the people in Chang'an

924
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
want to eat this soup.

925
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Right?

926
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Yes.

927
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
I'm so hungry.

928
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
I'm so hungry.

929
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
I'm so hungry.

930
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Mr. Shan.

931
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
How is Luo Tu?

932
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
I'm afraid

933
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
he's hit by a fire.

934
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
He's not moving.

935
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,920
He's not moving.

936
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
What's the matter?

937
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
He's hot.

938
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
He's hot.

939
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Who killed

940
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
your mother?

941
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
You can't keep your life.

942
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
You're right.

943
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
How could...

944
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
How could this happen?

945
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I can't

946
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
stop myself

947
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
from getting pregnant.

948
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
I can't die.

949
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
I can turn this bad thing

950
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
into something else.

951
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,920
But you can only say

952
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
this person is a rich man.

953
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
He's a unlucky man.

954
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
He's a short-lived man.

955
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
What if I get hurt?

956
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Mr. Kong Lang

957
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
won't let the wolf

958
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
get out of here.

959
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Go.

960
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
I'm hungry.

00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm hungry.

964
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
I'm hungry.

965
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm hungry.

966
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
I'm hungry.

967
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm hungry.

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
I'm hungry.

969
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm hungry.

970
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm hungry.

971
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
I'm hungry.

972
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
I'm hungry.

973
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm hungry.

974
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm hungry.

975
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm hungry.

976
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
I'm hungry.

977
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm hungry.

978
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm hungry.

979
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm hungry.

980
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
I'm hungry.

981
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
I'm hungry.

982
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm hungry.

983
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I'm hungry.

984
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I'm hungry.

985
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I'm hungry.

986
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm hungry.

987
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm hungry.

988
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
I'm hungry.

989
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I </n candidate

990
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
and made a mistake.

991
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
I left in a exploitive way.

992
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,640
Then they found

993
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,420
my shoe back even it's little.

994
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,960
I plucked the shoe for一下 Podleé filled myージ

995
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,920
and let flow my race.

996
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
They want long to try over it.

997
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
It dissipates from body through the tiger folds.

998
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
I fell into a dream.

999
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
I couldn't hear what happened.

1000
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,920
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

1001
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,960
Yeah
