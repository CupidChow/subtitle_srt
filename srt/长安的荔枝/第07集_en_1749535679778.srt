Magまぁ

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It was two continue cats.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
...

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It wasn't a black cat.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,340
Sw周

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,780
Good

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,620
Sweet

Season 2

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,640
Episode 22

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Is this bigger or is it bigger?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
No, it's bigger than this.

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,580
Yes. The first one,

19
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,580
This is the best.

20
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
You go to bed.

21
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,580
I haven't changed my clothes.

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,580
Go to sleep.

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,580
You can change your clothes.

24
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,580
Open it yourself.

25
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,580
Put your hand in.

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Good.

27
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Close your eyes.

28
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm happy to be alone.

29
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
I want to be with you.

30
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,580
I want to be with you.

31
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,580
I want to teach you how to learn.

32
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
I want to practice.

33
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Close your eyes.

34
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,580
I'm happy to be alone.

35
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,580
Where's your dress?

36
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
It's pretty.

37
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,580
It's a dress made of clouds.

38
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,580
It's a dress made of clouds.

39
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
How did you change your dress?

40
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,580
Teach us.

41
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Yes.

42
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Teach us.

43
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Xiu.

44
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
You changed such a beautiful dress.

45
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,580
My mother bought me a tofu.

46
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,580
She saw your aunt buy me flowers.

47
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,580
No way.

48
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Is this really your own dress?

49
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,580
Give it back to me.

50
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,580
It's bought.

51
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,580
My mother said that you are good at getting married.

52
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,580
You are a good match.

53
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,580
You are right.

54
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
You changed your dress.

55
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Give it back to me.

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,580
I changed my dress for you.

57
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Yes.

58
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
I changed my dress for you.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,580
Did your mother change your dress for you?

60
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,580
I heard that her mother died of illness.

61
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,580
This flower basket must be bought by her father.

62
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,580
Xiu's father will pay for it.

63
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,580
Buy a flower basket and get it.

64
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Don't call her father.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
Don't call her father.

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Xiu.

67
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,580
Give it back to me.

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
What are you laughing at?

69
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
Why are you laughing at me?

70
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,580
Who are you laughing at?

71
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,580
What is it?

72
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
It's salty.

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,580
It's salty?

74
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
How many people beat you?

75
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
Six.

76
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,580
Six?

77
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
Six?

78
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Six?

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Six?

80
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
Six?

81
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Six?

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
Six?

83
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Six?

84
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
Six?

85
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
Six?

86
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Six?

87
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Six?

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,580
You are still laughing at me?

89
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Who beat you?

90
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
I beat you.

91
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,580
You beat you again?

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,580
What are the other people doing?

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
You didn't see it.

94
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
They are acting.

95
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,580
You are so stupid.

96
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,580
Why are you fighting?

97
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Because of the flower basket.

98
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,580
They remember my flower basket.

99
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,580
They beat my father.

100
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,580
They said it's not your hand.

101
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
I'm so angry.

102
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
It's my flower basket.

103
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
I'll make another one for you.

104
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Really?

105
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,580
It's my hand.

106
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
Your hand?

107
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
Remember, you can't fight.

108
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
Okay?

109
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,580
I'll do it.

110
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
You can't fight?

111
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Who are you talking to?

112
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Who are you talking to?

113
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
I'm talking to my mother.

114
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,580
You are talking to your mother?

115
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Come on.

116
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Mr. Li,

117
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,580
he is asking for your opinion.

118
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
You are in the right place.

119
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
I have something to tell you.

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,580
I know.

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,580
Li Shande's life is precious.

122
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,580
He is so soft and firm.

123
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
He is so stubborn.

124
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,580
He has to do something for himself.

125
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
It's him.

126
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
He is the one.

127
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,580
He is so stubborn.

128
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
He is so stubborn.

129
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
He is so stubborn.

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
He is so stubborn.

131
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
He is so stubborn.

132
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,580
He is so stubborn.

133
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
It's him.

134
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
He is so stubborn.

135
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
He is so stubborn.

136
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
I will send news to Zhao Xinming.

137
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,580
Tell him Li Shande is not from Zuo Xiang.

138
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,580
And eliminate his concern.

139
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Then who is the one

140
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
who told you about the life of the drug?

141
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,580
You can't keep your life.

142
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
You are so funny.

143
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,580
How could you...

144
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
How could you do this?

145
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,580
The new owner of the right-hand side, Li Nan,

146
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,580
will break your identity as soon as he sees you.

147
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Break my identity?

148
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
It's so far away.

149
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
I'm afraid we will have time to choose.

150
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
The new owner has left Chang'an for 21 days.

151
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,580
He should be here soon.

152
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
Stop him.

153
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
I sent out the master.

154
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,580
I used to help him with the perfume.

155
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,580
But now the owner is so stubborn.

156
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
He has to leave the city several times.

157
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,580
Then he changed his route and hid your identity.

158
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
I have already sent people

159
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,580
to Li Nan's place of residence.

160
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
This is our last chance.

161
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,580
It's also your last chance.

162
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
You must seize this chance.

163
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,580
But don't let Wang Wuyi

164
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,580
get sick and die.

165
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,580
The future is in danger.

166
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,580
I don't believe he can be defeated.

167
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
Zheng Ping'an.

168
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,580
I'm afraid that the left-hand side, Xiang Chuiqing,

169
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,580
will be forced to leave the city.

170
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,580
You want to live?

171
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
I will take the school center tomorrow.

172
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
I will leave Li Nan.

173
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,580
Otherwise,

174
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,580
the new owner will be separated

175
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,580
from the family.

176
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
Where is my money?

177
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
What's wrong?

178
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
I'm busy.

179
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
Tell me.

180
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
How can I live

181
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
without money?

182
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
What should I do?

183
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
I'm afraid that I'm lost.

184
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
The wolf went out.

185
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
It burned when he came back.

186
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Maybe it was a cold.

187
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Nonsense.

188
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
Can this place be cold?

189
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
It's a heavy rain.

190
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
I don't know

191
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
if you're worried about me.

192
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
I'm so happy.

193
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
Stay away from me.

194
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
I can feel better.

195
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
It's hot.

196
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Come on.

197
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
It's windy.

198
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
It's not warm.

199
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
It's cold.

200
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
It's getting warmer.

201
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Go.

202
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Pull the curtains.

203
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
It's so hot.

204
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Come on.

205
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
Go.

206
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
You know everything.

207
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm afraid of death.

208
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
But I'm not a timid person.

209
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
We can't be scared

210
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,580
because we're going to die.

211
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
We can't be scared.

212
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
We can't be scared.

213
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
Right?

214
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Are you feeling better?

215
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
I was a little kid.

216
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Mr. Sun Ming said

217
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
that I can't die

218
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,580
because of the chaos in my life.

219
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,580
And I have a skill.

220
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
I can turn the bad thing

221
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
into others.

222
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
What do you think?

223
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
You'll say a few words.

224
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
You won't say you're out.

225
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
It's comforting.

226
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,580
It's comforting.

227
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
It's turning bad things into others.

228
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Others want to live.

229
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
Why are you so excited?

230
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
I said that

231
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,580
it's turning bad things into others.

232
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
It's not my fault.

233
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
You can only say

234
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
that this person is rich.

235
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Right?

236
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
He's a dead man.

237
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
He's a dead ghost.

238
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Who's a dead ghost?

239
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Who's a dead ghost?

240
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Get out.

241
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Ming,

242
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,580
you're not a good person.

243
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,580
You're a good person.

244
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,580
You can't persuade him.

245
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Ming,

246
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
stop persuading him.

247
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
Fine, I'll buy him medicine.

248
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
Take good care of him.

249
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
Qi Lang,

250
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
even though I'm a little bit stupid,

251
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,580
he's sincere to you.

252
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Look,

253
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
he's always

254
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
making a fool of himself

255
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
in the room.

256
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
Now he's going to

257
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,580
go out to buy medicine for you.

258
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm a good person.

259
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Gao.

260
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Okay, here you are.

261
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
You're here.

262
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Qi Lang,

263
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
get out of here.

264
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Open the door.

265
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
The snow will be here soon.

266
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
I'll go out.

267
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,580
The flowers are really good.

268
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
It's from Chang'an.

269
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Do you want to buy flowers?

270
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,580
I heard that you also come to Chang'an.

271
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
It's hard to change.

272
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
I really came from Chang'an.

273
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
So you're here.

274
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
My husband

275
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
was a nurse.

276
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
He offended the right-hand man

277
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
and left his family behind.

278
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
I won't do anything else

279
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
after he left a few years ago.

280
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
I can only

281
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
rely on these

282
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
wall-to-walls.

283
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
I'm so tired.

284
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
How did you

285
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
get into trouble?

286
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
You're a big man.

287
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580
You want to learn this?

288
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
I'll change.

289
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,580
I'll come to get you.

290
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
You're wrong.

291
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
You're so good.

292
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
You're faster

293
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
than my calculations.

294
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
You're not good enough.

295
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Sir,

296
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
the jade jade is gone.

297
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
I can't get the prescription.

298
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,580
I forgot.

299
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Sir,

300
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
the jade jade

301
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
was sold to Hu Sheng

302
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
a few days ago.

303
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
They're all gone.

304
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
They're all sold.

305
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
They're doing the spices business.

306
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
They're afraid of the smell.

307
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
They put jade jade jade

308
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
next to it.

309
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
They can store it

310
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
as much as they want.

311
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,580
They even bought the jade jade.

312
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
How about I

313
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
change it to a shirt?

314
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,580
The price...

315
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
The same price.

316
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Okay.

317
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,580
Why are the jade jade

318
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
double-layered?

319
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Yes.

320
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Where did you buy it?

321
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,580
I haven't seen it in Ningnan.

322
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,580
It's only for Hu Sheng.

323
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,580
When I went to send jade jade jade,

324
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
I saw they used this

325
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
to store the spices.

326
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
The spices were

327
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
very small.

328
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
It's suitable

329
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,580
for the jade jade.

330
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
What about the jade jade?

331
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
There are many.

332
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,580
I don't know.

333
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
There are many.

334
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
But I heard

335
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
they need to be handled.

336
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Where to?

337
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
Boss Su,

338
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
they're inside.

339
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Boss Su,

340
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
there's news.

341
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Someone's out of the store.

342
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Out of the store?

343
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Yes.

344
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
It's definitely ours.

345
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
It's ours.

346
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
It's our Nanshi Xiang.

347
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
Who's the one who's out of the store?

348
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Amita.

349
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
In the beginning of next month,

350
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
we're going to launch

351
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
a new business.

352
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
At that time,

353
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,580
each of us will have a new business.

354
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,580
Who can bring the best business

355
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,580
will be the new one.

356
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I hope you don't miss this opportunity.

357
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
No matter who's out of the store,

358
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,580
it can't be moved by Amita's status.

359
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Amita has been a good-for-nothing

360
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
for the past years.

361
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
The scale of our business

362
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
has increased by a hundred times.

363
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,580
The total number of goods is also increasing.

364
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,580
This is all a public skill

365
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
that people know.

366
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
If we want to choose the salesman,

367
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
it must be Amita.

368
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
When Boss Su was the salesman,

369
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,580
we made friends with the people in the store.

370
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,580
We never had to see

371
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
the people's faces as businessmen.

372
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,580
But the way the business has changed

373
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
in the past few years.

374
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
But we're businessmen

375
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
who are running on the market in the big store.

376
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,580
How can we avoid the business

377
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
and make the business better?

378
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
The meaning of business is to protect the business.

379
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,580
This style will never change.

380
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
You're talking nonsense.

381
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,580
You're as beautiful as a bird singing.

382
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
Boss Su,

383
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,580
what style has made you come out?

384
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
It's the evil style.

385
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
The demon style.

386
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,580
It's the wind of stealing.

387
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,580
The wind of robbing.

388
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
It's the wind of stealing.

389
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,580
It's the wind of stealing.

390
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Remember when you liked to say

391
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
that you were so talented?

392
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Why haven't you seen it for years?

393
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
You're so strong.

394
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
If you haven't seen it for years,

395
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
you're also

396
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,580
so confident that you can see the whole world.

397
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Everyone is here.

398
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Open the store and tell me.

399
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Why did you steal my Anxi?

400
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,580
You can use it in a messy way.

401
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,580
You can't say it in a messy way.

402
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,580
You said that I stole your spices.

403
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Do you have any evidence?

404
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
Hangshou.

405
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
Hangshou.

406
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
Boss Su has forced us to make our spices.

407
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Not him.

408
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
Tell me.

409
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Why?

410
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
My spices just disappeared.

411
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Your spices appeared on the market.

412
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Is it a coincidence?

413
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Boss Su,

414
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
you've been away for too long.

415
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Your spices business

416
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
has been broken down by you.

417
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
My spices are in double-layered.

418
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
In Lingnan,

419
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,580
my spices are in double-layered.

420
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
My Su Liang is a family.

421
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Amitabha,

422
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,580
do you dare to open the box?

423
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,580
Is it Su Liang's goods?

424
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,580
We can't fool him.

425
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,580
We really want to make a big deal out of it.

426
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Hangshou.

427
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Go and get our goods.

428
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Hangshou.

429
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
Give me your gun.

430
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Give me your gun.

431
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,580
Give me your gun.

432
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
I've put a paper in it.

433
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
I'll put it on the water.

434
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,580
You can't put it in double-layered.

435
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
This is a dream.

436
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,580
What a dream.

437
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Who's that?

438
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
What are you doing?

439
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm buying a dream.

440
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
I'm not selling it.

441
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
Let me introduce myself.

442
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,580
I'm Li Zhishi, a saint.

443
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,580
I'm in charge of the transfer of the li-zhi.

444
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Li Zhishi?

445
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
What does it have to do with me?

446
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
Li Zhishi?

447
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
I don't care what you do.

448
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,580
I'm telling you,

449
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
I don't understand.

450
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
When you go out,

451
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,580
you can ask around.

452
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,580
Look at the background.

453
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,580
Be careful. You'll regret it if you lose your job.

454
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,580
I'm so proud of my job.

455
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
You're jealous?

456
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
No.

457
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
You think I can't thank you?

458
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
Who's disturbing me?

459
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
Yang Xiaowei, this is the one.

460
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,580
I'm Li Zhishi, a saint.

461
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
Shut up.

462
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,580
Look, the 9-point-1 is the one

463
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,580
with the 3-point-1.

464
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Li Dashi.

465
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Yang Xiaowei.

466
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,580
You're so lucky.

467
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,580
Su Lang, you've read it.

468
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,580
This is not your double-layered ink.

469
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
It's not my double-layered ink.

470
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
It's my Anxi incense.

471
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,580
The transfer of the li-zhi

472
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,580
has been passed down to the sea.

473
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,580
It can be kept for 8 minutes.

474
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Except for my Su Liang,

475
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
in the Linan,

476
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
no one can do it.

477
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,580
I'm not a fan of the

478
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,580
Su Liang.

479
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,580
I'm a fan of the Su Liang.

480
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
I'm a fan of the Su Liang.

481
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
I'm a fan of the Su Liang.

482
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
No one can do it.

483
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
Amita, you've changed

484
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
my double-layered ink

485
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,580
and stole my Anxi incense.

486
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Su Lang, I respect you for

487
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
making you smoke.

488
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
If you're shameless,

489
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,580
you're too disappointed.

490
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
If so,

491
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
don't blame me for not giving you the li-zhi.

492
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
What can you do to me?

493
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
I won't sell this ink.

494
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
What can you do?

495
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,580
I'll pay you.

496
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Okay.

497
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,580
You're not worth ten yuan.

498
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
Are you a real businesswoman?

499
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Can I buy it?

500
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I won't sell it.

501
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
Don't be angry.

502
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Didn't you mess it up?

503
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Think about

504
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
how you treated me last time.

505
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,580
I took the paper to collect the debt.

506
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
I was about to sell it.

507
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
You jumped out and sold it.

508
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
You became a public figure.

509
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
You turned my paper

510
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
into a paper.

511
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
You didn't give me

512
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
a little face.

513
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
Didn't I tell you?

514
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,580
You're a fortune teller.

515
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
You're a fortune teller.

516
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
You're a lucky guy.

517
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
You're a lucky guy.

518
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
I don't want to sell it.

519
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
I'll sell this ink.

520
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
I won't sell it.

521
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,580
This time, Mr. Su

522
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,580
took the paper to collect the debt.

523
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,580
He asked me

524
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
where is your paper?

525
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
The paper

526
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,580
was given to Mr. Su

527
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
by the paper.

528
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
It was used by the paper.

529
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
It can be passed through.

530
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,580
Mr. Su

531
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,580
was enough for you to do this.

532
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
You were a merchant

533
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
who was a fortune teller.

534
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
You should know

535
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,580
that a fortune teller

536
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,580
who has broken the rules

537
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
is going to be in trouble.

538
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
You broke the rules

539
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
today.

540
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
Are you going to do it?

541
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
I won't sell it.

542
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
I'll announce it.

543
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
I'll announce it.

544
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
All the double-decked dreams

545
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
will be used as a fortune teller.

546
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,580
The special supply of goods

547
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
is the fortune teller.

548
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
This is the dream of fortune tellers.

549
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
You're a fortune teller.

550
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Today,

551
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
I'm here.

552
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
You're going to break another double-decked dream.

553
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
That's going to be a lifetime.

554
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
A lifetime.

555
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
I sold half of my assets.

556
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
I'm going back to the south.

557
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
I just want to do my own business.

558
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
It's not dangerous for you.

559
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
But you

560
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
have to hold my nose

561
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,580
and hold my neck.

562
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
I'll be your fish

563
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
when I walk away.

564
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,580
You're young and beautiful.

565
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,580
But you're too hard-hearted.

566
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
You're in trouble.

567
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
You're a merchant.

568
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,580
You're a fortune teller.

569
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
You're a fortune teller.

570
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
The future of fortune tellers

571
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,580
will never have bright light.

572
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Su Lang.

573
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
This is not a place

574
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
where you're being selfish.

575
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
Yes.

576
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,580
Your Majesty.

577
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,580
I found a double-decked dream.

578
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
It's a pre-made one.

579
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,580
The bottom is...

580
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,580
What should we do now?

581
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,580
Su Lang.

582
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Listen to me.

583
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,580
Do you really want to do business?

584
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Of course.

585
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,580
Su Lang's goods are not lost.

586
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
I'm sorry.

587
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
I'm sorry.

588
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Su Lang.

589
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
What did you say?

590
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Did you forget?

591
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Your goods have been shipped

592
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,580
and put in the warehouse in the west.

593
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
My goods have been shipped?

594
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
Put in the warehouse in the west.

595
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
I... I forgot.

596
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,580
The next person told me

597
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,580
that looking for a warehouse

598
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,580
is in the west.

599
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
I forgot.

600
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
I forgot the silver and silver.

601
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,580
I misunderstood.

602
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Your Majesty.

603
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
I apologize.

604
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
Su Lang.

605
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,580
Since the misunderstanding has been solved,

606
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
the five members of the Chamber of Commerce

607
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
are here today.

608
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Let's welcome them back together.

609
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Welcome.

610
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Welcome.

611
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,580
What are you doing here?

612
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Amida.

613
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
Don't be like Su Liang.

614
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Even if she comes back,

615
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
she won't be able to move your place.

616
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Amida's name is not what you should call her.

617
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Hangshou.

618
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
I'm sorry.

619
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
Do you think I will care about Su Liang?

620
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,580
I'm just curious about Li Zhishi.

621
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,580
I had to get a Li Zhiyuan.

622
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,580
She turned him into a jade.

623
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,580
She ruined my business.

624
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,580
She should have lost her life

625
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
to kill fish.

626
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
Let's not be afraid of this.

627
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Let's not block Hangshou's way.

628
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
You do it.

629
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
I... I...

630
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
I was just trying to make Hangshou happy.

631
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
When did Hangshou become so wild?

632
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
It's all my fault.

633
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Hangshou let me be a victim.

634
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,580
I wonder if he can give me a chance.

635
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Mr. Han.

636
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Hangshou is in a bad mood today.

637
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Please go back.

638
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Mr. Han, please.

639
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
I'll be back in a few days.

640
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
I'll ask for your permission

641
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
when Hangshou is in a good mood.

642
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
Goodbye.

643
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Hangshou.

644
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
He's a man.

645
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,580
He's not confident.

646
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
He thinks he can match you.

647
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Okay.

648
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
It's the new year.

649
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,580
These old people are all so kind.

650
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Su Liang is back today.

651
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,580
I need someone like him to help me.

652
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,580
It's so late.

653
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
I'm not back yet.

654
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,580
How about I go out and buy some medicine for Qin Lang?

655
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,580
Wait a minute.

656
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,580
I think he'll be back soon.

657
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
You don't have to believe me.

658
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,580
I was in a bad mood today.

659
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,580
I didn't expect that

660
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,580
you're a good-for-nothing.

661
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
You're a good-for-nothing.

662
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
You're a good-for-nothing.

663
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,580
Is there anyone in the government?

664
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,580
I don't know.

665
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Amita's father is a good-for-nothing.

666
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
He was a good-for-nothing.

667
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,580
Now, he's a good-for-nothing.

668
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
He's a good-for-nothing.

669
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
He's a good-for-nothing.

670
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,580
It's hard to live a good-for-nothing.

671
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm not a good-for-nothing.

672
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,580
Although I'm a good-for-nothing today,

673
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,580
I'm a good-for-nothing.

674
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
Of course.

675
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Can you give me your double-layered questions?

676
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,580
I'll do it if you like it.

677
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Thank you, Mr. Su.

678
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,580
I'm grateful to you.

679
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
I'm so grateful to you.

680
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
I'm grateful to you.

681
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
I'm grateful to you.

682
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Are you polite or sincere?

683
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Of course, I'm sincere.

684
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,580
If you're sincere,

685
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,580
can you give me some money?

686
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Not money, but head.

687
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Head?

688
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,580
What's head?

689
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,580
I'm a good-for-nothing with you.

690
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Come on, let's go.

691
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,580
You're a good-for-nothing.

692
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
How's it going?

693
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,580
The old people are all so nice.

694
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
It's hard to be honest.

695
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
Thanks to your help and guidance,

696
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,580
I've learned so much about business.

697
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,580
I've learned so much about business.

698
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,580
That's why I've established the government.

699
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
Okay.

700
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Remember, if they dare to bully you,

701
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,580
tell them to put their teeth down.

702
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
Who dares to bully me?

703
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Actually, I've been getting into trouble lately.

704
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,580
If this matter is successful,

705
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,580
I can lead the people to move to Linnan.

706
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,580
At that time, no matter who's alive,

707
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
if they want to leave the sea,

708
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
they have to head down.

709
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,580
This is the garden of our family.

710
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,580
Then I'll stay by your side.

711
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
I'll help you clean up the garden.

712
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Okay.

713
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Do you want to make the sales of the company go back to Linnan?

714
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,580
No, that old fox.

715
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,580
At that time, my aunt was a businessman.

716
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
She couldn't look at me.

717
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
She didn't let me touch her business.

718
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,580
I didn't let her go to the port.

719
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
But you know what?

720
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Her several sales ships were on the sea.

721
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
But then, the typhoon came.

722
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,580
The old man was stupid.

723
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,580
He was like a little fox.

724
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
He was late.

725
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,580
I heard that he went to the Shen family with a big family.

726
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
He went back to the old family.

727
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Fortunately, the whole sea is ours.

728
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,580
You're afraid of him being the god.

729
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
Aunt, you're back.

730
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Brother.

731
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
The medicine.

732
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
How is it?

733
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Is it better?

734
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I bought the medicine.

735
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
I have to take care of it.

736
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,580
I'll go get the medicine tomorrow morning.

737
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,580
You bought the medicine?

738
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,580
Yes.

739
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
You didn't bring it back?

740
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,580
You've been doing this for a long time.

741
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,580
I finally understand my sister's feelings now.

742
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,580
Why should I mention your sister?

743
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,580
Can't I?

744
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
Why?

745
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,580
You don't want to admit that you've made a mistake?

746
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,580
Didn't my sister change your life to a lesson?

747
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
You're sick.

748
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Why are you angry?

749
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,580
You're sick.

750
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Come back.

751
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,580
If you can really take Lv Zhi back to Chang'an,

752
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
why should I stop you?

753
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,580
I don't want you to live.

754
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
You're a born-in-law.

755
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
You can do anything.

756
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,580
But you have to take Lv Zhi back.

757
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
Will my sister die?

758
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,580
Can I be like this?

759
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Let you be the one who's always the one who's good at math.

760
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
I want you to leave.

761
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,580
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

762
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
You'll be the one who's left with no money.

763
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,580
You're the one who's left with no money.

764
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
I want to stay.

765
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
I want to stay here.

766
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm willing to take this job.

767
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
I want to eat Lv Zhi.

768
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
Is that me?

769
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
I don't want to go back to Chang'an to watch the show.

770
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I don't want to see my child grow up every day.

771
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Will he get married and have a good life?

772
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
He must be waiting in the yard every day

773
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
to wait for the osmanthus tree to bloom.

774
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
He doesn't know that it's a dead tree.

775
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,580
He doesn't know that his aunt is a dead man who can't live for six months.

776
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
I want to stay.

777
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
Yes.

778
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,580
I'm a life-saving man.

779
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,580
I only know how to make flowers and plants.

780
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
I'm not in a hurry.

781
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
I was cheated by my classmates.

782
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
I'm willing to take this job.

783
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
I'll stay.

784
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
I saw a little hope.

785
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,580
I want to catch this hope and go back to see the show.

786
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,580
You're still in a hurry with me.

787
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Where's your hope?

788
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Did you see it?

789
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
You're holding it.

790
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm already sick and sick.

791
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
What if I die tomorrow?

792
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,580
What if you let go of your dead body?

793
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,580
What if I die?

794
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Do you think you can live and live?

795
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,580
We're both dead.

796
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,580
What if he's a lonely and helpless man?

797
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
We'll be cursed by the gods tomorrow.

798
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,580
How can we go to see my sister?

799
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Stop arguing.

800
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,580
Be careful.

801
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,580
Yes.

802
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
There's still a living one.

803
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
Tell me where I went.

804
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Go!

805
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Who's there?

806
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,580
After the storm, the waves have gone away.

807
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Open the door.

808
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
The case is over.

809
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
The new witness is still in the forest.

810
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
I came to the Wolf King.

811
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I've been thinking about the Wolf King.

812
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
Didn't he send a strong army?

813
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
How could he kill Chu Chongwei alone?

814
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
This man is a man of the past.

815
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
He's a man of the past.

816
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
He's a man of the past.

817
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,580
He's a man of the past.

818
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
He's a man of the past.

819
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
He killed Chu Chongwei alone.

820
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,580
Some people feel that he's just a man of the past.

821
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,580
If you say that, I'll be exposed.

822
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,580
There's still a chance for the Wolf King.

823
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
You can tell me.

824
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
When I came back from the horse,

825
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I didn't find his trace.

826
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,580
He must have gone to the mountain to hunt for the sand.

827
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,580
The Wolf King must still have time to finish the left.

828
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
You're not his opponent.

829
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm not going to let him go.

830
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,580
What if I give up?

831
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,580
If the Wolf King leaves halfway,

832
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Mr. Kong Lang will not let the Wolf King leave the forest.

833
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
I'll take care of you.

834
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Calm down.

835
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
This way.

836
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Brother.

837
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
Come on.

838
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Come on.

839
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,580
Come on.

840
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
Why are you so early?

841
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
It's bright.

842
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,580
You and I are in no need to go to the forest.

843
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
What's the matter?

844
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,580
Of course it's about the transaction.

845
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Don't worry.

846
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Don't worry.

847
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I don't know what you're doing.

848
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
I'm staying at the same house with Li Zhi.

849
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
I'm always looking for him.

850
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
He's always looking for Li Zhi.

851
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,580
He's always looking for him.

852
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,580
He's always looking for Li Zhi.

853
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,580
He's not a leftist.

854
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,580
Since you've been watching me closely,

855
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,580
we're in trouble.

856
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,580
Come on.

857
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Have some.

858
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
I can't eat.

859
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
I'm out of the house.

860
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
It's okay.

861
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
This is a special thing about Lingnan.

862
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
This is Lingnan.

863
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,580
It's not longer than Chang'an.

864
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
It's a big deal.

865
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
You have to finish your breakfast first.

866
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Dorg, you come with me.

867
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Don't give him.

868
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
Since you've lost your mind,

869
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
let's just have a talk.

870
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
I'm sorry.

871
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
No, listen to me.

872
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
He's dead.

873
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
Dead?

874
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
How can he be dead?

875
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
He's dead.

876
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,580
He's not dead?

877
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
No.

878
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,580
He's not dead?

879
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Where did he go?

880
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
He's dead.

881
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
He's dead.

882
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
He's dead.

883
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
He's dead.

884
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
He's dead.

885
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
Ling,

886
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,580
it's no use if you go to the chicken farm.

887
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
He's a chicken farm.

888
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
If you go into the chicken farm,

889
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
he'll be stuck in the field.

890
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
He won't get hurt.

891
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
How can he be dead?

892
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Is it because of the food?

893
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
The chicken farm

894
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
is not as important as the chicken farm?

895
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,580
I'm right.

896
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
It's the same thing.

897
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
I'll buy him a chicken.

898
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
I'll buy you a chicken.

899
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
I usually

900
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
don't talk about the chicken.

901
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,580
I'm not talking about chicken.

902
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
I'm talking about money.

903
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
Of course,

904
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
this chicken farm is important.

905
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,580
But

906
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
if he goes into the chicken farm,

907
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
he won't be a chicken farm anymore.

908
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Who is he?

909
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
He's a master of the chicken farm.

910
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Run.

911
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
Chicken farm.

912
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
What do you mean?

913
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
It's father's idea.

914
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Chicken farm?

915
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
Chicken farm.

916
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,580
The End

917
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
What do you think?

918
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
It's a good idea.

919
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
Come on.

920
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Report.

921
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Report.

922
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
The important thing is

923
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,580
that we don't have to deal with the emergency.

924
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
I'll ask

925
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,580
the one who's on the right

926
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,580
to wait for him.

927
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,580
The one who's on the right.

928
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Look at him.

929
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Brother Gu Yun.

930
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
We can't tell.

931
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,580
What's wrong?

932
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
The End

933
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,580
The End
