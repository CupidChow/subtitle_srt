00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:23,000
know

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,460
onn

7
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,060
The guest has arrived,

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,840
go

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,200

00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,120
underground

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:10,660
The

13
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,660
I'll sell it.

14
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm not used to it.

15
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,060
My family can't bear it.

16
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
It's better than having a good family.

17
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
Everyone,

18
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,020
let's get out of here.

19
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,020
We can't hang this for a few days.

20
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Yes, we can.

21
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Go faster

22
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
Run immediately

23
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,340
They want to

24
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,660
for their protecting are workplace

25
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,600
with all the relationships

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,560
with this wholeございます

27
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
Let him talk.

28
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,960
Don't stop.

29
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,500
Unavoidably.

30
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,620
Right on.

31
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Let him say

32
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
I can only be a dog

33
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,660
You are all like a lion

34
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,660
You are all together

35
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,660
You are all the same

36
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
You are all the same

37
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
You are all the same

38
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
You are all the same

39
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
You are all the same

40
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
Go

41
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
I don't want to hear

42
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
Go to the emperor

43
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Go

44
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
You are all the same

45
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
Get up

46
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
You are the king of the country

47
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,660
The king

48
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Your Majesty has already set out to death

49
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
You are a coward

50
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
You dare to use your own body

51
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,660
To harm the court's reputation

52
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,660
You are so impudent

53
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
You will be punished

54
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
You killed me today

55
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
You can't finish the victory of the Yunling

56
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
You can't stop the heavy-duty

57
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
Go

58
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Don't let me down

59
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Your Majesty

60
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
I am not a good student

61
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,660
I hope you can let your brother out

62
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
And let the court

63
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
Let my Tang

64
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Re-enact the Qing Ming

65
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
The King of the Country

66
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
We are going to meet the merchants

67
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
But they are all the gold you sent

68
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,660
You have to take out your long-term spirit

69
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,660
They really want to buy the interest

70
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,660
Don't worry

71
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,660
As for how much you take

72
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
You have to see how we act

73
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
You can talk less later

74
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Just cooperate with me

75
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Let me introduce you

76
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,660
The top official of the top city of Shanglin

77
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,660
The first red man of the Holy People

78
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
The Holy People

79
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
The Holy People

80
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
The Holy People

81
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,660
The Holy People

82
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
The Holy People

83
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
In Chang'an

84
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
The top officials of this office

85
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Are all in a hurry

86
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Without you

87
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
You can't be a good student

88
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
You have to take the life of the Holy People

89
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
of the Holy People

90
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
You are all here to witness

91
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Your glory

92
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Look

93
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
The Fourteenth Talisman

94
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Is really prepared

95
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
For the whole world

96
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Master Li

97
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
The Holy People

98
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Are not so rare

99
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Why do we have to

100
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Find some real people

101
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
To buy the money?

102
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
It's not the Holy People

103
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
Not all the Holy People

104
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Can be provided to the Holy People

105
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
The first of June

106
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
The birthday of the Noble Consort

107
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
The Holy People

108
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Is the top of the first class

109
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
The first class of the first class

110
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
The Holy People

111
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Must be rewarded

112
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
For the Holy People

113
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
The Holy People

114
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Must be rewarded

115
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
For the Holy People

116
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
How much money do we have to pay?

117
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
It's just this year

118
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
I guess

119
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
The money I used

120
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Is from Li Zhi

121
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
The money I used

122
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
Is all from the money

123
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
But

124
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Li Zhi

125
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
Is not for anyone

126
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
You mean

127
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
Who is the winner

128
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
Is all from Master Li

129
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Or is he the master of Li Zhi?

130
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Master Li is in the Holy People

131
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Singing and dancing

132
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
His goods are unnecessary

133
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
No need to pay

134
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
Everyone

135
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
The benefits

136
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
I don't need to say more

137
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
I'm sorry

138
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
It's okay

139
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
It's really good

140
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
It's okay

141
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
It's okay

142
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
It's okay

143
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
It's okay

144
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
It's okay

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
It's okay

146
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
It's okay

147
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
It's okay

148
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
It's okay

149
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
It's okay

150
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Why are you cheating?

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
What do you mean by cheating?

152
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
I was cheated

153
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
I can take my body

154
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
And take some water

155
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
But I can't

156
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Use my childhood

157
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
To treat me as my own

158
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
To cheat the innocent

159
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
They are not poor people

160
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
They are born

161
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
They are not rich

162
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
They are not dead

163
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
They are not dead

164
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
I can do the trick

165
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Money

166
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
You can take it

167
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Think about the show

168
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
After three days

169
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
The public is open

170
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
The person who is qualified

171
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
Can participate in the competition

172
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Think about it

173
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Think about it

174
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
This is the place where the mayor

175
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Take medicine

176
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Take it

177
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Take it

178
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Take it

179
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Take it

180
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Everyone

181
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Everyone

182
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Everyone

183
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
I have a different opinion

184
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
You guys

185
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Maybe

186
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Buy a person who is qualified

187
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
He is qualified

188
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
This business is not necessarily for you

189
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
We still need to spend this money

190
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
I bought

191
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Just a chance

192
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
I came to your big hall to do business

193
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Over the mountains and seas

194
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I am afraid that I will die on the road

195
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
My family's daughter is helpless

196
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
If you can buy this money

197
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
For me

198
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Even if I die

199
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
They can live well

200
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
We are

201
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
This is a good thing about the Zhao family

202
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Thank you

203
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Thank you

204
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Yes, yes, yes, yes

205
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Sorry, sorry

206
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Sorry

207
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
I said the wrong word

208
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
One word

209
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
The saint wants

210
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
The fairy

211
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Not the fairy

212
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
I want to make the fairy a fairy

213
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
How can it be a fairy

214
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
The fairy

215
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
The fairy is a ghost

216
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
This is impossible

217
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Impossible

218
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
This is impossible

219
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
What else to say

220
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
This is a good thing

221
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
The profit is out

222
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
It's our fate

223
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
We are not qualified to spend money

224
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
This is the most important thing

225
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
This is the most important thing

226
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
We are not willing to do it

227
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Not strong

228
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
This is the end

229
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
This is the end

230
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
This is the end

231
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
This is the end

232
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Give me the money

233
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
This is the end

234
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Give me the money

235
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Give me the money

236
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
Don't be angry

237
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
You will see the aunt

238
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Tell her

239
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Get out

240
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
You don't know the beauty of the aunt

241
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
The wolf

242
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
The wolf

243
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Don't be angry

244
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
You are a gentleman

245
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660
I find those foxes easy

246
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
It's not easy to raise the money

247
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
I'm going to take the money and borrow it

248
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
You are good

249
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Take the money yourself

250
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
They are all aunt

251
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
They give me money

252
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Just want to make some money

253
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Let your family and children live better

254
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
I can't do it for my own daughter

255
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Just do it for others

256
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
They have money

257
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
And they can come back in the future

258
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
You can come back

259
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
If you die

260
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660
You will be worshiped as a slave

261
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Will she thank you for being a righteous father

262
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
You are a gentleman

263
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
You have the right to marry

264
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Just three months

265
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
I don't believe I can only lie

266
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Don't be kind

267
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I am willing to do it for you

268
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
You can make the money

269
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
You can help me

270
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
You are a gentleman

271
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
I can't put them in their place

272
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
You can do it

273
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
You can help me

274
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
I'm willing to do it for you

275
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
You can help me

276
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
You can help me

277
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
You can help me

278
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
You can help me

279
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
You can help me

280
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
You can help me

281
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Sure.

282
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Well, the fight is over.

283
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Major cause want to give himself up.

284
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
There's no weapon left in his hand.

285
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Hold your breath expect

286
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Come

287
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I'm dead!

288
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Is that your master's residence?

289
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Is he at home?

290
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Excuse me, I'm in Qi Feng Ge.

291
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,660
I've searched for the master's residence in Qi Feng Ge.

292
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
I hope I'm not...

293
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
...a little bit of a sister.

294
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
I have a little bit of a meaning.

295
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
Take it.

296
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
Don't...

297
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
...don't eat the taige.

298
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Taige?

299
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
What's this?

300
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
It's so delicious.

301
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,660
I'm from the capital.

302
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
I'm a fox.

303
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,660
I do some business in Gao Zhou.

304
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,660
I also have a sugar-coated man.

305
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
His name is Su Liang.

306
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
His name is Gu Su.

307
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
His name is Su.

308
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
He's a good man.

309
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
He's a good man.

310
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
He's a good man.

311
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,660
They all call me Su.

312
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
You're all good at speaking.

313
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
I understand.

314
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,660
But you won't understand my speaking.

315
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,660
If my speaking makes you confused...

316
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
...it's natural.

317
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
But don't...

318
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
...must be a good man.

319
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Yes, yes.

320
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
That's a good idea.

321
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
What's the matter?

322
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,660
You like to open the door?

323
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
I like it too.

324
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,660
But I must have encountered a big trouble.

325
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,660
I need a lot of money.

326
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Am I right?

327
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
What?

328
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Am I right?

329
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Well...

330
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
I'm right.

331
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
Don't worry.

332
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
I have money.

333
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
I can lend you money.

334
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,660
You can lend me money?

335
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Of course.

336
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,660
We businessmen like to exchange...

337
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,660
...fishing, fishing, fishing, fishing...

338
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
...and fishing.

339
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
We can exchange fishing for a mountain.

340
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
We don't have a mountain.

341
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
I don't eat fishing.

342
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,660
I want to exchange things with you.

343
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,660
I don't have anything valuable.

344
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,660
The friend who didn't have a good friend...

345
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,660
...said that you can sing in the countryside.

346
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
You don't need to check.

347
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
You don't need to pay.

348
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,660
I think you must have got a common service.

349
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I do have a service.

350
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I do have a service.

351
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm right.

352
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,660
The goods are not limited.

353
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
The service is empty.

354
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
It's white.

355
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
It's empty.

356
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I'm right.

357
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,660
It's empty.

358
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
Great.

359
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Can I lend you money...

360
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,660
...for the businessmen?

361
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
How much money do you need?

362
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
I'll give you now.

363
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,660
You can get the King of Sea.

364
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,660
I can get the Royal Family.

365
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,660
We can fight and win.

366
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,660
I don't have a good friend.

367
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
We're Tang people.

368
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
You're Tang people.

369
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,660
I like your sincerity.

370
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,660
We're not far from the north.

371
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
We're close.

372
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
Li Bai said it.

373
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
You're always talking about the loss.

374
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
We're Tang people.

375
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
If we can use it for the sake of the world...

376
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
...it's a murder.

377
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
I understand.

378
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I won't let you lose.

379
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,660
I'll make you pay a big sum.

380
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
You make a price.

381
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
I'll give you the money.

382
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
766.

383
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Deal.

384
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,660
If you don't have enough money, I'll add three more.

385
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Just make a sum.

386
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
How about it?

387
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
766 is 3.2.

388
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
996.

389
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
996?

390
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
You're not...

391
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Pay the bill.

392
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Be careful.

393
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Slow down.

394
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Slow down.

395
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,660
You're so lucky.

396
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
You're a leader.

397
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
You have to pay the bill.

398
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,660
You took the money.

399
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,660
I've never seen you like this.

400
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,660
You made the budget.

401
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,660
But we're low on the value of the money.

402
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,660
I think you can earn 1,500 yuan.

403
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
You can eat it.

404
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,660
I regret the cool attitude of the other party.

405
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Anyway, you're back.

406
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
What's the deal today?

407
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,660
I went to the ice house before I came here.

408
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I made a long-suffering map.

409
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm the general of the world.

410
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,660
I have a friend in Tang.

411
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Last night, I spent a night in the house.

412
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,660
After I left Chang'an, I went to Shangzhou from Lantian.

413
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
I crossed the Han River in Shangzhou.

414
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
Then I went south.

415
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,660
I crossed the river in Oozhou.

416
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
I went to Hongzhou, Jizhou, Qianzhou.

417
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,660
I went to Shaozhou, Meiguan, Wulingchuan.

418
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,660
And I got 5,447 yuan.

419
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,660
The money was 5,447 yuan.

420
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,660
But I came to Linan to get the money.

421
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I didn't try it.

422
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Try what?

423
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
The money?

424
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,660
If I succeed, I don't need to die.

425
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
I have my uncle.

426
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
You'd better die.

427
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
How can you think of the money?

428
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Now you have money to go back to Chang'an.

429
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,660
You have a lot of money to save.

430
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Lin Jingqian and Zi Mei said

431
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,660
I was a dead man.

432
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,660
But I could make a living in the scene.

433
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
I'm very proud of you.

434
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Brother-in-law, don't be.

435
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Zi Mei is a man.

436
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
She doesn't have a small family.

437
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
She's in Chang'an.

438
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
You're so proud of her.

439
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
You even made a profit.

440
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
You might be in a lot of trouble.

441
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,660
But I know you're a good man.

442
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
You're still a dead man.

443
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
But I've never seen a tree before.

444
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
I'm not willing to do it.

445
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Why would you see a tree?

446
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,660
You'd better go back to Chang'an to see the show.

447
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
She's a child.

448
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
She's in Chang'an.

449
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,660
If my sister were alive,

450
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
she wouldn't let you live alone.

451
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
Gao.

452
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Come.

453
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
Pack up the car and the workers.

454
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,660
Pack up the workers' luggage.

455
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Yes.

456
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,980
The

457
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Вы Would Like The Shudder

458
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Is it made with the sword of the military?

459
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,660
It's so sharp.

460
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
This knife is made by a certain master.

461
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
It's made of a broken knife.

462
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Because the wind power is the treasure of the family.

463
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
For so many years,

464
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
except for the guest,

465
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
only a guest from the Three Kingdoms of Heaven

466
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
came to the Shangyuan Festival.

467
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Unfortunately,

468
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
the master's son has no wish.

469
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
But he doesn't want to

470
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
think that he has the good fortune of the Dongbo Heaven.

471
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
The Three Kingdoms of Heaven came to the Shangyuan Festival.

472
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Is it the right time?

473
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,660
The water is cold.

474
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,660
I'll go get some water after the meal.

475
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Jinjiang.

476
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Uncle.

477
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Go get some water.

478
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
Yes.

479
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Brother.

480
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Brother.

481
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Brother.

482
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
After Wuji was taken to the court,

483
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
the families that were separated

484
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,660
have now been found.

485
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
The family of Liu Zichang'an

486
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,660
is very unscrupulous about what happened to Wuji.

487
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Only his body is left.

488
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
I'm afraid that

489
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
he will be suppressed by the Prime Minister.

490
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
Prime Minister.

491
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
I'm lucky to have you.

492
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
I'll send Wuji with you.

493
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Open your mouth.

494
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
I'm not saying that you're not well.

495
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Even if you're not well,

496
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
you're still soft.

497
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
I'm afraid that you'll be killed

498
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
by our hands.

499
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
The poison is coming out.

500
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
Wuji,

501
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
if you didn't find important information

502
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
in Lingnan,

503
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
you wouldn't have come back

504
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
to see me at the house.

505
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
It's a pity.

506
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
He just got into Chang'an.

507
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
He was caught by the Prime Minister.

508
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
The news

509
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
was also sent out by you.

510
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,660
He said that he didn't find any evidence

511
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,660
in Lingnan.

512
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
He only said that he was looking for

513
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Qi Jing Lou at the end.

514
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Qi Jing Lou

515
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,660
is the most unwilling to go to Heyou Palace.

516
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Qi Jing Lou has burned the fire

517
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,660
and has been in the house for 50 days.

518
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,660
He can't find any evidence.

519
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
But he said that he had hope

520
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
that he would come back

521
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
to Chang'an

522
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
as soon as possible.

523
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
These days,

524
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
I'm investigating the crime of

525
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
the corruption of the Right-Handed Man.

526
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,660
Wuji is going to move the Right-Handed Man.

527
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
He's still dead.

528
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
He's helpless.

529
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
The Prime Minister

530
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
is actually helpless.

531
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,660
Now, Wuji is in the right-hand corner.

532
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
He said that he was going to kill

533
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
some local officials

534
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
with his own son.

535
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
He's still fighting for the throne.

536
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
He's out of the question.

537
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
He said that he was going to

538
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,660
protect his reputation.

539
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
You know that

540
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
he's a good man.

541
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
But he can't do anything

542
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660
without his son.

543
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Now, Wuji is worthy of being a man.

544
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
He's not going to let things get worse.

545
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,660
The Prime Minister is going to the emperor

546
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
to stop the Right-Handed Man

547
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
from doing anything

548
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
that Wuji has done.

549
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,660
His Majesty is going to

550
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
kill the Prime Minister.

551
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,660
He You Guang asked me this time

552
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
whether I was going to be a soldier

553
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
or a soldier.

554
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
He's going to be a man

555
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
who's going to be a soldier.

556
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
These years,

557
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
he's been working for

558
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
the National Security Service

559
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
in the local city.

560
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
He's going to be

561
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,660
his guardian.

562
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660
His Majesty

563
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
is going to

564
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
be a guard

565
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
in the hospital.

566
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
That's good.

567
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,660
He's going to be a soldier.

568
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,660
You've been working for him

569
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
for so many years.

570
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,660
Let's help him.

571
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
Send someone

572
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
who's reliable to Lingnan

573
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
and tell him

574
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660
that this news

575
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
is in the cloud.

576
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
Let him stay there.

577
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,660
We'll be back

578
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
when things are solved.

579
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,660
The news that

580
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
Wuji found in Lingnan

581
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,660
must have been

582
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
stolen by the Youxi.

583
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
He sent someone

584
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
to the city at night.

585
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
The direction is high.

586
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
In this way,

587
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,660
Lingnan's situation

588
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
is more dangerous.

589
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
I wonder

590
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,660
if Zheng Ping'an

591
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
can solve this case in a good way.

592
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Prime Minister, you don't have to worry.

593
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
This person is very powerful.

594
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
I'm sure

595
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
he's going to be a tough guy.

596
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
What's more important is

597
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
he's going to be a good man.

598
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660
It's most convenient

599
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,660
for someone who's smart

600
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
to control him.

601
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
If he's exposed to the public,

602
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,660
he'll be a good man

603
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
if he's been there.

604
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
Kong Lang won't let him

605
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
leave Lingnan.

606
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,660
The water is very cold.

607
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,660
Gao'er,

608
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,660
go and inform the Governor

609
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
that Li Zhishi has left.

610
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,660
Tell him to send someone

611
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
to the gate to verify the case.

612
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Yes.

613
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
Prime Minister Li.

614
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Guiyun.

615
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,660
He's going to Chang'an Manli.

616
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
He's going to Chang'an Manli.

617
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,660
He'll be there

618
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,660
any time.

619
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Take care.

620
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Qing Shan, Hengbei,

621
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,660
Bai Shui,

622
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,660
and the east city.

623
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
The first one is

624
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
Gu Peng, Wan Li, Zheng.

625
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,660
Fu Yun, You Zi Yi,

626
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,660
Luo Ri, Gu Ren Qing.

627
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,660
You can go back and forth

628
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,660
and make a name for yourself.

629
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Guiyun is a talented man.

630
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
He can't make a good sentence.

631
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
He can only borrow

632
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
a few words from Tai Bai.

633
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
It's a love story.

634
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Prime Minister Li,

635
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,660
I hope you can

636
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
take care of him.

637
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
Yes.

638
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Since you're in my shoes,

639
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
I have to give you back a hand.

640
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
No need to be so polite.

641
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
The rules are not bad.

642
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
It's early in the morning.

643
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Yes.

644
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Yes, yes.

645
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Gu Yuan, Beiyang,

646
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Lu Man Man.

647
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
You're a man of the two sleeves.

648
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
You're not tired.

649
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
You're going to say goodbye soon.

650
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
You have no idea.

651
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
You're a good man.

652
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,660
You're so mean.

653
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
This is a poem from my past.

654
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
I changed it.

655
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
It's a poem from Yuan.

656
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660
I know.

657
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
You wrote it well.

658
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
You're kind and safe.

659
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
But,

660
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
there's no one

661
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
who can be the king of the world.

662
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Change the way.

663
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Go.

664
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Master.

665
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Master.

666
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
Please save me.

667
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Master, save me.

668
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Are you back?

669
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
I'm here to see the fairy.

670
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
But,

671
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
Master.

672
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Don't.

673
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
Fairy?

674
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Fairy?

675
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,660
Fairy milk.

676
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
First, you have to choose the fairy milk.

677
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,660
You also need the magic powder from Fairy.

678
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
And the magic technology.

679
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Lock the fairy.

680
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
It can create the fairy taste.

681
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Fairy milk, fairy speed, fairy technology, fairy taste.

682
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
Isn't it the fairy milk?

683
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,660
What else?

684
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,660
Let's go.

685
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Let's go.

686
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
Thank you, Master.

687
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Don't go.

688
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
I'll send the fairy milk.

689
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
The fairy milk is ready.

690
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
You're back.

691
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
The fairy milk is the first.

692
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Of course, the fairy milk is the first.

693
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Where are you going?

694
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,660
We're going to the bus station to Chang'an.

695
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,660
This bus is called YZ.

696
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
It's been a long time since we've been here.

697
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
How long?

698
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
It's been a long time.

699
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
So many people.

700
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
So many cars.

701
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
I've been looking for two poems.

702
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,660
What are you doing here?

703
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,660
I'm going to the bus station.

704
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
I'm going to the bus station.

705
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
I'm going to the bus station.

706
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Who is this?

707
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
He's Cheng A-di.

708
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Cheng A-di.

709
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
catalog

710
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,260
Beijing

711
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,460
S path

712
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,660
Main Street

713
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,960
You are everywhere.

714
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,660
Why don't you go faster?

715
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,700
ос

716
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,700
and can make some hope.

717
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,700
The little girl from the foreign country is not here.

718
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
You mean that animal girl?

719
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
No, I haven't seen her today.

720
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Lang Jun,

721
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
let me...

722
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
give me 200,000.

723
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
I'll take you to her right now.

724
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Lang Jun, Lang Jun, Lang Jun.

725
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Let's discuss it.

726
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Look at my big stall.

727
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
What's the business with you?

728
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
What's the business with you?

729
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Let's discuss it.

730
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Let's pay the price.

731
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
10 yuan.

732
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
This is the resource.

733
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Lang Jun,

734
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,700
this is where animals plant the resource.

735
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
But now,

736
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,700
it's not over 10 days yet.

737
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Look.

738
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
It's not good for the animals.

739
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
This is the beauty.

740
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
It's not good for the animals.

741
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
Lang Jun,

742
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
don't look at the resource.

743
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
It's not good for the animals.

744
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
But the resource we have in the world

745
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
is the best.

746
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Especially the animal you want to find.

747
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700
It's Tong.

748
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
The resource he planted

749
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
is big and round.

750
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
It's a lot of meat.

751
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
It's the best.

752
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
We have to go and see.

753
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
The resource in front of us

754
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
is...

755
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Look at the resource.

756
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Lang Jun.

757
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Money.

758
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,700
He's still running.

759
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
We need to find the resource.

760
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Don't worry.

761
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
It's enough.

762
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Forget it.

763
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Don't worry.

764
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Don't worry.

765
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
You're a man.

766
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
You're wearing a uniform.

767
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
Come on.

768
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Come on.

769
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,700
Come on.

770
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
You're a man with a uniform.

771
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
But it's not the one

772
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,700
we were looking for last time.

773
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
The one we were looking for last time.

774
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
I think it's the new boss of the Fourth Master.

775
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
The secret room.

776
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,700
The Fourth Master has called you.

777
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
The money.

778
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
I've been here before.

779
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Come on.

780
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,700
He's a good man.

781
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm the secret room.

782
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
The resource is not good.

783
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
The resource is not good.

784
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Come on.

785
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
You're a man with a uniform.

786
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,700
You're a man with a uniform.

787
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
What do you want?

788
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
What do you want?

789
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,700
What do you want?

790
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
No.

791
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
You have some purpose.

792
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,700
You're not talented.

793
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Or...

794
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,700
What do you want to say?

795
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
No.

796
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
We need to fight.

797
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
I can't bear it.

798
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,700
What are you doing?

799
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Did you get hurt?

800
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Let me grab the bug.

801
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Let me see.

802
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Did you get hurt in the rain?

803
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
No.

804
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
It's this.

805
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,700
Princess Shi Bei.

806
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Isn't it just a bug?

807
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
No.

808
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
We're in the dormitory.

809
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
We need to get the big mother to clean up.

810
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,700
We need to get Princess Shi Bei.

811
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
You can't do anything.

812
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Chun Xiang will fly.

813
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
The ants can't catch her.

814
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
You can't get rid of her.

815
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
I can do anything.

816
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Chun Xiang is a dirty man.

817
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
He can't wash the dirty things.

818
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,700
You can't wash the dirty things.

819
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,700
You can wash the dirty things.

820
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
You can wipe the dirty things.

821
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
You know what?

822
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Wash the dirty things.

823
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,700
It's dirty.

824
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
It's dirty.

825
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
It's dirty.

826
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
It's dirty.

827
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
It's dirty.

828
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Let's go.

829
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
It's dirty.

830
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
It's dirty.

831
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
It's so dirty.

832
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,700
No need.

833
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
I tell you.

834
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
Chun Xiang doesn't only

835
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,700
wash the leaves and the plants.

836
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
It's also good for the fruit tree.

837
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Do you want to know

838
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
how useful it is?

839
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,440
Hurry.

840
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,800
Let me Singapore the solution.

841
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,840
Help yourself.

842
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,880
I am the one who drinks.

843
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,920
I can see the steam from her wedding.

844
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,560
Steam?

845
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,360
Right.

846
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,980
Here.

847
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,580
Bring some water to the steamer.

848
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,200
Half of them are going to pick up the mint leaves.

849
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
You're a newbie.

850
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Come, come, come.

851
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Come, come, come.

852
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Come, come, come.

853
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Come, come, come.

854
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Come, come, come.

855
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Come, come, come.

856
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Come, come, come.

857
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
No, no, no.

858
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Mint leaves are poured into the water.

859
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Mix them well.

860
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Please help.

861
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Give me thec conquered mint leave.

862
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Come, come, come.

863
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,000
After I, ahead of itoy will prospect

864
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
alone with the mint leaves.

865
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Come, come, come.

866
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:21,000
After that, right to the end

867
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

868
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

869
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

870
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

871
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

872
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

873
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

874
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

875
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

876
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

877
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

878
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

879
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

880
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

881
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

882
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

883
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

884
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh.

885
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
No.

886
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh.

887
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
No.

888
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
No.

889
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
No.

890
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
No.

891
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
No.

892
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
No.

893
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
No.

894
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
No.

895
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
No.

896
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
No.

897
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No.

898
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Why is she here?

899
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The bad guys are back!

900
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You?!

901
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Miss Tong?

902
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Why are you here?

903
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I...

904
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm so sorry.

905
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm so sorry.

906
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm so sorry.

907
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm so sorry.

908
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm so sorry.

909
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm so sorry.

910
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm so sorry.

911
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm so sorry.

912
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Miss Tong,

913
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
all the people in the city

914
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
are going to die because of this.

915
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They're going to die!

916
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They're going to die!

917
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
They're going to die!

918
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is not my way.

919
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
This is all the wisdom of the ancestors.

920
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm in the forest of Chang'an.

921
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm just a worm.

922
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Don't mess with me.

923
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm not a worm.

924
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Don't waste it.

925
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm going to work.

926
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Don't waste it.

927
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Don't waste it.

928
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
What brings you here today?

929
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I went to the west to buy some corn.

930
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I was looking for you to buy some corn.

931
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You weren't there.

932
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The people said the corn here is good.

933
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I came here.

934
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I didn't expect you to have a lot of corn.

935
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You're so small.

936
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You're the source.

937
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
My father and mother left it to me.

938
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But the corn is only three months old.

939
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'll pick the good ones for you in four months.

940
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'll send you to the city.

941
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I can't wait for four months.

942
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll be back to investigate.

943
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I want to buy some corn from you.

944
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'll be on my way.

945
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'll see how long it takes.

946
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Come with me.

947
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Happy Lunar New Year.

948
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Don't don't go there to get corn.

949
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'll buy some corn.

950
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
More

951
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Grandpa's farm

952
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Look at mom's gift

953
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Is this mom's Oreo?

954
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Niu Niu

955
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Change

956
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Wow, give it to Wafi's mom

957
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Take a look

958
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Delicious, fun, and fun

959
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm in the forest

960
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But the red is gone

961
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The mood is floating

962
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Long安, let people fall

963
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Who is the one who has touched my shoes?

964
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I don't have to write in the middle of the day

965
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Just for the sake of a good fruit

966
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I want to try it

967
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
This road

968
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm in the dream

969
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I can't hear it

970
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And I'm so mad

971
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I want to see

972
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,880
I want to see the world of the red-and-white

973
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,880
The world of the white-and-white

974
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
But I only see a man

975
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,880
Showing a tear

976
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,880
A little bit

977
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,880
A little bit

978
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,880
A little bit

979
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,880
We can't stop

980
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,880
The mood is floating

981
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,880
Long安, let people fall

982
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,880
Who is the one who has touched my shoes?

983
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,880
I don't have to write in the middle of the day

984
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,880
Just for the sake of a good fruit

985
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,880
I want to try it

986
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
This road

987
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,400
I'm in the water

988
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,320
But the red is gone

989
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,400
The mood is floating

990
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Long安, let people fall

991
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
with love

992
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
I don't have to write in the middle of the day

993
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Just for the sake of a good fruit

994
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
I want to see

995
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
I want to see

996
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
I want to see

997
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Let people who get hurt

998
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
And want to see

999
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,400
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

1000
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,400
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

1001
00:46:43,400 --> 00:47:05,400
I can't help but laugh

1002
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,400
I can't help but laugh

1003
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:21,400
I can't help but laugh
