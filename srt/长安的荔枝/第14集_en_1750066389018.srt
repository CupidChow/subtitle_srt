11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Look! Look!

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Look! There's a group of enemies coming back.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's cold.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh my god!

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The people are afraid of the normal people in the village.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They don't dare to come back home to have tea.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's normal to see the people in the village.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When you just entered the village, you heard that the enemies were killed.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You might also see the people in the village.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They're not冷-blooded. They...

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They just don't know the enemies.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In their hearts, they're just a terrible beast.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They're not beasts.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Master is right.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There's no right to blame the villagers.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Did the wild boar do anything to us when we first met him?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What did he say?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I told the villagers about the situation.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We need to stay for a few days.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
His father's business is in a hurry.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We might need to cooperate with the relevant investigation.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But we need to send the new police back soon.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We can't delay it.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We need to split up.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We need to send the new police back to Li Xi first.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll go first.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll stay.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He saved me.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not a human being.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Besides, we need to stay for a few days.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll stay and accompany him.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Master.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you have any other news, contact me.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, right.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is my father.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He wants to talk to you.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He said you'd stay in the village.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He thinks you're suffering a lot.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He hopes you don't get too depressed.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You should keep going.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The road ahead will be better.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My father also said that

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
if you meet someone you like,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you must catch them.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
People are easy to get away from you.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But once you get away,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you might never find them again.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Give it to me.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Come and help me.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Give it to me.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't take that kind of fruit.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Look for this.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Maybe fate is too dense,

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but in the storm,

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
those courage and courage

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
are only the body.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I remember those light-hearted things

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
will have a full warmth.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The path of life is a good one.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's not a love story.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So when you get there,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
there will be someone who's kind to you.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I miss you, grandpa.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's okay.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm okay, too.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No matter what,

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I love you.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I love you.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I just want to cry.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm okay when I cry.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Those courage and courage

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
are only the body.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I remember those light-hearted things

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
will have a full warmth.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The path of life is a good one.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There will be someone who's kind to you.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, that's it.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll contact you later.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's me.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What did you say?

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He said we can't contact him these days.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He said he has a big picture.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He sent it to the group to make us smile.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He also said we can't.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He brought us a gift.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A gift?

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What gift?

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He didn't say that.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But the gift from God should be a reflection.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A reflection?

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
By the way,

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I left my clothes with Y1 and Y3.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why did you wear my color?

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's better that she left.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why?

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not as good as Y1 and Y3.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There are more people who talk to Y1 and Y1.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They talk more.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hit him.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hit what?

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Your?

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Can I open it?

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's the same.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Is this from Amazone?

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Do you know what she's doing?

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
She lives in the park.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She's very spiritual.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you have a girl you like,

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you can take her with you.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Take a rest in front of me.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Take a rest.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mr. Mu.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you remember that

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
you asked me a question?

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I asked you a lot of questions.

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I...

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ask me a question.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Do you like me?

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I've never answered that question.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If I answer now,

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
can I still answer?

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You said that

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the best time for the two of us

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is when you like me.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I like you too.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ndai.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I like you.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What if I say

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going forward?

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What will you do?

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll chase you.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What if I say

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going forward?

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll chase you.

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll chase you.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you still here?

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're helping Han Ling, right?

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't want us to walk together.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't want you to hold someone else's hand.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My mom said that the future is better.

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I think

159
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
if Qian Feng didn't have you,

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it wouldn't have been good.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's okay.

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do you like me?

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I like you.

164
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Where are you?

165
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Where?

166
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's so warm.

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
According to the international management,

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
a small team

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
will always be a team.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm Lu Dali.

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can I?

172
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm Lu Dali.

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I hate you.

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Who's the one who scared me?

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're not convinced?

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're a little bit slow.

177
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Wait for me.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll hug you.

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll hug you.

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Look.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a bit like Xinjian.

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm not sure.

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not sure.

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm not sure.

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not sure.

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Xinjian is a bit abnormal.

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Is it because...

188
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Our guess is right.

189
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's another one.

190
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And another one is broken.

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This Xinjian is not complete.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
She's really mean.

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She's not the same.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
She didn't show us the water.

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So, there's Xinjian

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
in the mountain.

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But it's okay.

198
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Most of Xinjian is here.

199
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The one in the mountain

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
should be fine.

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've told my mom and I.

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If there's anything else,

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
contact me immediately.

204
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't let the rest of Xinjian

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
mess with others.

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So,

207
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
is it okay to be cold this time?

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Can't you see?

209
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's really valuable.

210
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Bo Yangzi,

211
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Mu Jie,

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Feng Huanglan,

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and many other places

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
in the country.

215
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think I've said it.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Whether it's water or blood,

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to Xinjian,

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you can only

219
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
help her for now.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Only by finding

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the few things

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
in the legend

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
can you

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
seal Xinjian.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But where should we find this?

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There are

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a few of them in Xinjian.

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If there are only three,

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
we'll be good.

230
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Li Shijie is good.

231
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well,

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll help you

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
credit some money.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please.

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is this for me?

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I know.

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What's wrong?

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Can I find a new one?

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Look.

241
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Look at your face.

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He said he has something important to do.

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Bullshit.

244
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm just kidding.

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He's not a good guy.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't have time to take care of Pingding.

247
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Thanks to Miss Lian.

248
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Or this matter...

249
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Miss Lian.

250
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The one who wrote the letter to Feng Huanglu.

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The boss of Lianyuan store.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard we're going to be renovated.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're very enthusiastic.

254
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You have a lot of good ideas.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
How did he know?

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I told you.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The neighbor.

258
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The neighbor is more than you.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Miss Lian.

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't contact him again.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why?

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hongsheng.

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have to go back.

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I've sent you here.

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's a mission.

266
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The staff told me

267
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
that you'd be gone

268
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
if you come back.

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I have to go.

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can solve the problem.

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you know what you're going to do?

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What's next?

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
First,

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you have to prepare

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
a nice photo for your grandpa.

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This time,

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
the three major events,

278
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
you have to send it to your grandpa.

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You have to prepare

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the evening flower circle, the little black sand.

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And the destination.

282
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You have to call him.

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Find a way.

284
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Wait a minute.

285
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Tell me again.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
First, you have to find it.

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Then I'll do it.

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Second,

289
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank God I'm here.

290
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The little boss's mother is still with me.

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What can she do?

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You have to guess.

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why do you know

294
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
all these things?

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I?

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why don't I know them?

297
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm more than ten years old.

298
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm a cook.

299
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I've done everything

300
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
for the funeral.

301
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Mr. Yan.

302
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Mr. Yan.

303
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Mr. Yan.

304
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Who are you?

305
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Finally, someone is here.

306
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Where is your grandpa?

307
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Inside.

308
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Mr. Yan.

309
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes.

310
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mr. Yan.

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Mr. Yan, come out.

312
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You can tell me if you have something.

313
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Where is your grandpa?

314
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're dead.

315
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why are you playing with me?

316
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm asking you to play with me.

317
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Okay.

318
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You're pretending to be dead?

319
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You can't pay me back.

320
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let your grandpa out.

321
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What do you mean?

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I have a death certificate.

323
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you want to see it?

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll give it to you.

325
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You still pretend to be dead?

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're lucky.

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm going to tell you now.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm going to tell you now.

329
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm going to tell you now.

330
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm going to tell you now.

331
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm going to tell you now.

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm going to tell you now.

333
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He taught me.

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know Yan's skills.

335
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You don't have enough money to pay the medical expenses.

336
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Now, you really want to pay the medical expenses.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But you can't say you have a debt.

338
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Where is the ring?

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The ring.

340
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Come on.

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Brother, is this the ring?

342
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You have to pay the medical expenses.

343
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You always tell me the medical expenses.

344
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Look at it clearly.

345
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
How much money does my uncle owe you?

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Little sister, listen to me.

347
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He owes me 120 million for this house.

348
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't only have this ring.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I always come to the market.

350
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I always come to the market.

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I always come to the market.

352
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I always come to the market.

353
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I always come to the market.

354
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You promised to pay the medical expenses.

355
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You promised to pay the medical expenses.

356
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What's wrong?

357
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You guys are so ridiculous.

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Brother, don't be so mean.

359
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll pay the medical expenses.

360
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll pay the medical expenses.

361
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But listen to me.

362
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We Yan family always talk.

363
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'll pay the medical expenses.

364
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But I don't have money now.

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I can make money with my hands.

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Maybe I'll pay it slowly.

367
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But I won't pay it to you.

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Do you understand?

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You don't have money now.

370
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can pay it slowly.

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What's the trick?

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If you don't agree,

373
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll kill you.

374
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Brother, you heard it.

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He's not afraid of death.

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll give you a way.

377
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Here, call the police.

378
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Let the judge decide whether to pay the medical expenses.

379
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Do you think so?

380
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He's a girl.

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He's worth millions of yuan.

382
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He'll pay you back.

383
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's good.

384
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll pay you back.

385
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll pay you back.

386
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's good.

387
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay.

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You have to pay the medical expenses.

389
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's go.

390
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Maybe...

391
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
frost?

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Are you sure you're okay?

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

394
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,840
Really no problem

395
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,880
No, it's just

396
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,400
You wrote it for me

397
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,320
Finally, the photo

398
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
I just follow this

399
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,080
Come one by one

400
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,040
I know

401
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Our Yanyan family is now

402
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,080
Only me

403
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,960
So I have to live more beautifully

404
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,720
Everything is okay

405
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,160
I can start from scratch

406
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,720
From now on

407
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,640
I will try

408
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,960
In the future, with my own strength

409
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,080
I will be rich again

410
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, then

411
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,080
Since you said that

412
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
I'm relieved

413
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,880
But I have to save you one thing

414
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,760
Just

415
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,880
You are not everything

416
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,160
Go out here

417
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,320
Go south

418
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,680
There is a bar called Qu San

419
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,880
Then your friends

420
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
With a bite of food

421
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,680
Just a bite of meat

422
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,400
Let's go

423
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Come here, come here, come here

424
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Let me have a look

425
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,840
Okay, put it here

426
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,160
I just want you to take Ping Ting out

427
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,320
Why are you here

428
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,640
Isn't today the water power

429
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,120
I'm not listening, I'm not worried

430
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
See the pipe is not enough

431
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,120
I let Miss Lian

432
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,000
Look at it

433
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,440
You put it again

434
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Who is this

435
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,880
Miss Lian

436
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,480
It's okay

437
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,080
Let's talk about the water power

438
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,520
Miss Lian, you know

439
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
I'm not afraid of anything

440
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,080
I'm not afraid of anything

441
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm not afraid of anything

442
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm not afraid of anything

443
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,520
I'm afraid of anything

444
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I'm not afraid of anything

445
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,320
Miss Lian, you know

446
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,680
I heard from the doctor

447
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,720
You helped me to repair these two days

448
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Thank you

449
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
It's all a gift

450
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,680
What are you polite

451
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,880
Right, Zheng Hong

452
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,960
The wall of the warehouse

453
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,440
My friend got a new product

454
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,720
We can go and see the sample tomorrow

455
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,760
Okay, okay, okay

456
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,360
Miss Lian

457
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,160
I'm not lying

458
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
Come on, give me

459
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,360
Ping Ting, don't stay here

460
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,520
Look here, it's messy

461
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,080
Come on, come on, come here

462
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,560
Ping Ting, come on

463
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,000
Where did you get this?

464
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,440
Come to my room and talk

465
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,080
I just said it, Miss Lian

466
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,480
What's your purpose

467
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
purpose

468
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,640
How can I not understand

469
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
Help take care of Ping Ting

470
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
Help guide the decoration

471
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,200
Don't give me trouble to see the sample

472
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
What's the matter

473
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,360
Business is good

474
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,320
Don't you think you are too enthusiastic

475
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,360
No way

476
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
I have been enthusiastic since I was a kid

477
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,560
What's the solution

478
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,880
Is it wrong

479
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,520
What do you want me to pull in

480
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
Zheng Guo

481
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,200
Wooden bag

482
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,520
Where is the room

483
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,760
Inside

484
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,560
If it's okay, I'll go first

485
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,360
Tomorrow, I'll ask Zheng Guo to see the sample

486
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Ping Ting

487
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,920
Zheng Guo said

488
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,240
You are doing something in the room

489
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,400
me

490
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,520
He said you took the pretty girl to the room

491
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,760
Don't let her in

492
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,880
What do you want

493
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
Always tell

494
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,960
Where is the pretty girl

495
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Here

496
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,640
Zheng Guo also said

497
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,600
People read a book and read a wall

498
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
You are unhappy

499
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,360
How did he upset you

500
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,000
Why are you so sensitive to him

501
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
I don't know how to say

502
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,640
He gave me a

503
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,640
Uncomfortable feeling

504
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,520
And he is all day

505
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,400
I am Ping Ting and Zheng Guo

506
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,080
I feel a little bit uncomfortable

507
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,720
Then I'll go to see the sample tomorrow

508
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,240
I am also Feng Huanglong's shareholder

509
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,640
Also work

510
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,560
At the end

511
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,480
I will teach his work to me

512
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,840
No need to bother him

513
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,640
What do you think

514
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Ping Ting

515
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Come

516
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Have you eaten

517
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Zheng Guo

518
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
I brought it

519
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Sit here and eat

520
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Sit here and eat

521
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Come and eat with me

522
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Come come come

523
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Okay

524
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Thank you, Zheng Bao

525
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Coming

526
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Come Miss Lian

527
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Come come come

528
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Please come

529
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
This is Miss Lian

530
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
This is Mu Dai

531
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Miss Lian, hello

532
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
You helped me a while ago

533
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Everyone told me

534
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Thank you for your hard work

535
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
This Mu Dai

536
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
It's also one of the shareholders of Feng Huanglong

537
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Let him go with you today

538
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Familiar familiar

539
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
In the future

540
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
He will come

541
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,400
I'm sorry for the trouble these days

542
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm sorry

543
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
What are you so polite, Zheng Bo

544
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Let's go, the car is outside

545
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Okay

546
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Then I'll go first

547
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Okay okay

548
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Let's go, Zheng Bo

549
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Sister

550
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Sister, go upstairs

551
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Sister, not upstairs

552
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Sister, go out

553
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Bye bye

554
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Eat

555
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Eat more

556
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Come come come

557
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
This is a pure hand-made product

558
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Then in each of its carvings

559
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
The details are handled quite well

560
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Then this is a big rational picture

561
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Each of its ten pieces

562
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Is handled by someone

563
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Every small piece of detail

564
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
It's very strong

565
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Then this one

566
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
These six are all used

567
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
The materials used in the process

568
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
The details of the carvings

569
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
All handled well

570
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Then this is the color

571
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
The color is very beautiful

572
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
What are you looking at, Tingting

573
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Sister

574
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Upstairs

575
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
This is the downstairs, Tingting

576
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
You can't figure it out if you go up and down

577
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
You still cover my heart

578
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
I said

579
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
You don't eat breakfast

580
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
This is all morning

581
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
You just sleep and get up at night

582
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Smells good

583
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm a little hungry

584
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I'm hungry too

585
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Why don't you go to the restaurant

586
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
I'll order a bowl of rice

587
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Okay

588
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Then I can't eat spicy

589
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Eat some spicy

590
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Thank you

591
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Okay

592
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Hello boss

593
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I just ordered the order

594
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Please help me fill it

595
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
In addition, I want a soda

596
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Don't forget

597
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Thank you

598
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Not an actor

599
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I heard from that expert

600
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
He belongs to

601
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Lin Zhangmu

602
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Lin Zhangmu

603
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Lin Zhangmu

604
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Lin Zhangmu

605
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Lin Zhangmu

606
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I didn't understand what he said

607
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Indeed

608
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
The words of the expert

609
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
are very popular

610
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
The expert has been very familiar

611
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Oh, right, Boss

612
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
There's one more thing

613
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Do you remember

614
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
the dead pig in the Moon Hill?

615
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Someone recently came out and said

616
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
that the dead pig in the Moon Hill

617
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
20 years ago

618
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
when he was still not gone

619
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
a woman was going to the mountain

620
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
and was forced to go to her

621
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Then her husband

622
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
took the hunter in our village

623
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
and took her to the mountain

624
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
and finally killed her

625
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
But later

626
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
someone found that the woman

627
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
ran into the mountain

628
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
and stayed with a little wild man

629
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
The crowd spread

630
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Many people said

631
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
this little wild man

632
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
was the one who lived with this wild man

633
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Impossible

634
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
People say that he was a human

635
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
He can't have children with you

636
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
The moon was already

637
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
planned in the whole world

638
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
He was so angry

639
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
that he left the village

640
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
He didn't care about the bastard

641
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
But who knew

642
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
that this woman was a abandoned woman

643
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
and never came back to me?

644
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
This is a real thing

645
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
and a test

646
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
And

647
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
if this woman doesn't come back

648
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
have you ever thought

649
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
that something happened

650
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
and she can't come back?

651
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Then I'll call her

652
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
A abandoned woman

653
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
She has a daughter

654
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I guess

655
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Another woman

656
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
is not a human

657
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
She is a woman's daughter

658
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
She is heartless

659
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
And she has a tiger

660
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
She gave her own daughter

661
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
The world is so big

662
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Where is she?

663
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Sister is upstairs

664
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Sister is upstairs

665
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Bing Ting

666
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Do you mean her sister?

667
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
She is not here

668
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
She can't go upstairs

669
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
I don't know why

670
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Sister is upstairs

671
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
She said it for a day

672
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
It's not a mother's sister

673
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Bing Ting

674
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Do you mean

675
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Sister has been upstairs?

676
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
It's that sister

677
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Bing Ting

678
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
To be continued

679
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
So what is this place?

680
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Jingyan Poo

681
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I can't remember the exact location.

682
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,400
Anyway, there are many places.

683
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Lian Shu.

684
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
If it's okay, I'll leave first.

685
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,400
Tomorrow, I'll go to see the sample.

686
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,200
I'll go to see the sample tomorrow.

687
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm also Feng Huang Luo's shareholder.

688
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I should work.

689
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Lian Shu.

690
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Who is this?

691
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,800
He looks familiar.

692
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,800
It seems that we used to work here.

693
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Uncle Cheng.

694
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,200
Don't say that.

695
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,200
I really don't dare.

696
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,200
I won't do that again.

697
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,400
Uncle.

698
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
I think this guy is a little too much.

699
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,600
He's a good guy.

700
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Besides, these days,

701
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,000
we don't have the time to interview those workers.

702
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,000
We're not good at it.

703
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,600
At least one contest.

704
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,600
I have the time.

705
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I tell you,

706
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
don't do it again.

707
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Definitely not again.

708
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Come to work.

709
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Yu Wan San, let's go.

710
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,200
Get in the car.

711
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,000
Come on.

712
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,000
Lian Shu.

713
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Uncle Cheng.

714
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
What's the matter?

715
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,000
You mean Lian Shu is that woman's daughter?

716
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,800
And she even took the car to the boss?

717
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
That woman?

718
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,200
No.

719
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,800
But my master came in.

720
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Uncle Lian Shu took her away.

721
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,000
He...

722
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
He's so angry.

723
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,000
How is it?

724
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
He said he drove away.

725
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,000
The car left for an hour or two.

726
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,600
I can't find it.

727
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let's call the police.

728
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Call the police?

729
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,600
The salesman said that

730
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,000
they sometimes have to mention the car on the barbecue.

731
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,600
What proof do we have?

732
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
It's a fake.

733
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
You're the most stupid.

734
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,600
You can't get it out of your head.

735
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,200
Let's go.

736
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,400
Here.

737
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
Here.

738
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,800
Here.

739
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Thank you.

740
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Thank you.

741
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
What are you doing?

742
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
What are you doing?

743
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,400
I don't know what I'm doing.

744
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,400
I just think it must be nice to drop you.

745
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm not blaming you.

746
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
You didn't blame me.

747
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm sorry.

748
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm sorry.

750
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,200
I'm sorry.

751
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm sorry.

752
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,600
Give you your phone back.

753
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,600
Walk me out.

754
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,840
You got tired of wearing those.

755
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
Very thin andには占,

756
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
You're a dirty little brat.

757
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
My sister.

758
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
She's with you.

759
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
But your mother has been looking for me.

760
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
That's my mother. She's crazy.

761
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Her brother is going to the mountains to get some food for the wild.

762
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
The village chief is so harsh.

763
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
He said he's not going to care about the wild.

764
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
But what about me?

765
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
What about my dad?

766
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
We're not going to face it.

767
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
But your mother took care of him.

768
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Is there a reason?

769
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Reason?

770
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
He went to the mountains once.

771
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
He hasn't come back for days.

772
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
My dad was worried that he would send someone to look for him.

773
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,200
But he was left with a wild man in the mountains.

774
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Everything that happened here was seen by the blind.

775
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
My dad killed that dog.

776
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
He didn't want to tell the truth.

777
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
But he did.

778
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,200
He said he was in the mountain to save the wild.

779
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
My dad didn't make it clear that he killed the wild.

780
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
He was guilty.

781
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
It's too ridiculous.

782
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
It's like telling the truth.

783
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Why don't you believe your father?

784
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
What if he's telling the truth?

785
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
But he's the one who made it up.

786
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
He knows he's been hit by a beautiful face.

787
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
He's the one who made it up.

788
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
He knows he's been hit by a beautiful face.

789
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
He's the one who made it up.

790
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,200
He won't even want his own child.

791
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I'm his own daughter.

792
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Mom, this tiger is so beautiful.

793
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Do you think the color is like honey?

794
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Yes.

795
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Sweet and sweet.

796
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
It's like a treasure.

797
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,200
I'll give it to you when you grow up.

798
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Okay.

799
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
No need.

800
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,200
He doesn't even want me to do that.

801
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
You never thought that

802
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
maybe your mom would be in trouble.

803
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
She won't be able to come back.

804
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
She won't be able to come back.

805
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
She's back.

806
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Mom.

807
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Mom.

808
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,200
She left the tiger to that little animal.

809
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
But she left such a ugly thing.

810
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
But sometimes I feel

811
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
she's like a human being.

812
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
She knows me.

813
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
She knows how to comfort me.

814
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
It's a waste of time

815
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
to talk to you so much.

816
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I should go up the road with you.

817
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Mom.

818
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Mom.

819
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Mom.

820
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Mom.

821
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Mom.

822
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
Mom.
