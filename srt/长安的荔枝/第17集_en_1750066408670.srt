Hello, auntie?

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
What?

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Aunt said you killed someone.

14
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Stop!

15
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Stop!

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Stop!

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Stop!

Stop!

Stop!

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
The police are coming.

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Luo Shun?

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Report, there's no suspect here.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
The West hospital found a suspect.

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Roger that.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Ask the suspect.

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Who are you?

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm his boyfriend.

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
You're that guy?

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
A guy?

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
I asked him if he had a boyfriend.

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,280
He said he had a boyfriend.

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,280
He said he had a certain relationship when he was in a daze.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
He's a real man.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Where is he now?

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
He's gone.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
There were a lot of police officers who said he was a murderer.

39
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
No.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
How did you find him?

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
I came to you because I had something to do.

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I borrowed your car and used it.

43
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Where is Nantian?

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Come in.

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
You're going to run away?

46
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
What else?

47
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
You know what I'm talking about, right?

48
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Is Bu Bao going to be arrested?

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Is Bu Bao going to give me a word?

50
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Are you hungry?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Why don't you eat something first?

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
I'll fix it.

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Okay.

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Do you have a new clothes?

55
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I'll wash it.

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
I'll wash it.

57
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Long time no see.

59
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
How are you doing?

60
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Do you know that?

61
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
A long time ago,

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I got skin disease.

63
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
At first,

64
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
he was just a small white-skinned man.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Later,

66
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
he became like a plague.

67
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
He scattered my face,

68
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
even my body.

69
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I became a man who was always in my shoes.

70
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
I was taken away by everyone.

71
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Later,

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
I became Nantian's choice.

73
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I also saw Nantian's choice.

74
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
It grew bigger and bigger.

75
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Until one day,

76
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
they were like me.

77
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
You don't know how happy I felt.

78
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
You ask me,

79
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
how happy I felt.

80
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
I can't be happy anymore.

81
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Long time no see.

82
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
You've made me wait here for 20 years.

83
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Can our game start now?

84
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Can it start now?

85
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
It's too late today.

86
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Many stores are closed.

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
You'd better rest.

88
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I'll arrange the other stuff for you tomorrow.

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
It's quite a busy day.

90
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Although your love for Nantian is a bit lacking,

91
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
you're still a teammate.

92
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
You're not forcing me.

93
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Lu Dai,

94
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
after eating again,

95
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
your mood이 unfully.

96
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Lu Dai,

97
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
I want to ask you a few questions.

98
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
First of all,

99
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
You don't have money to expose yourself.

100
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
How long can you keep running?

101
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Can you hide in the medical room?

102
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Are you helping yourself or killing yourself?

103
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Second, did you kill someone?

104
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I don't know. I don't know.

105
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I heard there are two witnesses pointing to me.

106
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I don't know. I don't know.

107
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
You escaped.

108
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
If you escaped to another place,

109
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
someone pointed you to kill someone.

110
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
You escaped.

111
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Is this the way you handle the problem?

112
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
What do you want to say?

113
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Mo Dai.

114
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
The doctor said you were more rational.

115
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
You were more capable.

116
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
But I don't think so.

117
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
You have more guts than you do.

118
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
What did you say?

119
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Isn't it?

120
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
You were pointed to kill someone.

121
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
The first person who was shot was Tao Tao.

122
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
They said you were killed,

123
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
so you were shot.

124
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
What if you were framed?

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I just think it's too much to explain.

126
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Tao Tao will make things more troublesome.

127
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm here to help you.

128
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
But what happened that night?

129
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm in a bad mood.

130
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
But I just walked around.

131
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
I remember the part

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I didn't say anything.

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
I just wanted to tell you.

134
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm here to help you.

135
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I'm here to help you.

136
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
But what happened that night?

137
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I was in a bad mood.

138
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
But I just walked around.

139
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
I just remember the part

140
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
I didn't kill anyone.

141
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Just the part you remember?

142
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
I didn't kill anyone anyway.

143
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
But I wouldn't dare to guarantee

144
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
if he didn't go out that night.

145
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Him?

146
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
He wouldn't kill anyone.

147
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Really?

148
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Do you know him very well?

149
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Of course I do.

150
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I know him better than anyone else.

151
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Why did you and him

152
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
just go out?

153
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I don't know him.

154
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Let's play a game.

155
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Don't be a master first.

156
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Don't be angry.

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
You have to do your best to defend yourself.

158
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
This is a game to defend yourself.

159
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
You are framed.

160
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
You have to give out the reason

161
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
to make people happy.

162
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You have to do your best to defend yourself.

163
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Think about it for five seconds.

164
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
If you can't think of it,

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
you drink it.

166
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
If you think of it, I drink it.

167
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
You have five chances.

168
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
If you can't think of it,

169
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
you are the murderer.

170
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Do you dare?

171
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
I'll do it.

172
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
The first one.

173
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Time's up.

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
One more time.

175
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Time's up.

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Keep going.

177
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

178
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
If you can't think of it,

179
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
you are the murderer.

180
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
It's not me.

181
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
There are many times

182
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
when you are a murderer.

183
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
You are the murderer.

184
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
You are the murderer.

185
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
You are the murderer.

186
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
You are the murderer.

187
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
There are many times

188
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
when you are a murderer.

189
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
You will shout at me.

190
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
You will find everything

191
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
if you keep on doing it.

192
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I am the murderer.

193
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
The reason?

194
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
The reason?

195
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
The reason is that I have no grudge with Zhang Tong.

196
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
I only have a little bit of my head.

197
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Why should I kill him?

198
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I didn't kill anyone.

199
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay, the last one.

200
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
No motive.

201
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Keep going.

202
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Even if we don't have any conflicts,

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Zhang Tong, whom we met on the bridge,

204
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
is just a different person.

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I can talk to him all the time.

206
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Why should I kill him?

207
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Okay.

208
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
This is the last one.

209
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
And,

210
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I know what I want to know.

211
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
I even want to leave.

212
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
How could I be so strange

213
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
to go to that old bridge?

214
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
I heard

215
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
there are two witnesses.

216
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
One is called Ma Chao

217
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
and the other is called Song Tian.

218
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
It's said that they don't know each other.

219
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
But many people's relationship

220
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
is unknown.

221
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
So they don't know each other.

222
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
They are working together.

223
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Or they are trying to kill each other.

224
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Why did they hurt me?

225
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Zhang Tong was killed by someone.

226
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
The murderer must have hoped

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
to find a way to kill him.

228
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Indeed,

229
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
this matter is quite strange.

230
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
But I wanted to see

231
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
who is the murderer.

232
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
You'd better get some rest.

233
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
I am at the next room.

234
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I'll be there tomorrow.

235
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Ma Chao.

236
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Ma Chao.

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Ma Da.

238
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Ma Da.

239
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Ma Da.

240
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Ma Da.

241
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Ma Da.

242
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Ma Da.

243
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Ma Da, are you okay?

244
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Why are you asking me that?

245
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Ma Da.

246
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Are you okay?

247
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
She is indeed not the same.

248
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
You'd better get some rest.

249
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
If she doesn't listen to you,

250
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
please

251
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
let her have a rest.

252
00:14:48,280 --> 00:15:15,280
8th Moon

253
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,520
What can we do?

254
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,760
Besides the power of the Red Desert,

255
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,120
the rest of you

256
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
should do something.

257
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,480
Mo Dai,

258
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,800
you little poor thing.

259
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,840
Look at you.

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,720
You look so thin.

261
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,280
Don't worry.

262
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,640
Leave everything to us.

263
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,240
Yes.

264
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,640
Master, you are a master.

265
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,520
We will go to

266
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,640
Ma Chao.

267
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,840
What else can we do?

268
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
We will settle the problem.

269
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,240
You are so immature.

270
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,200
I don't know which one is the biggest mistake.

271
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,840
You don't want to find a boyfriend.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,560
You don't want to pick a girl.

273
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,280
Why do you say that?

274
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Why do you bring me here?

275
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,920
Well,

276
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,040
we should

277
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,440
pack up our things.

278
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,400
We have something to do later.

279
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,560
Let's go.

280
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,400
What's the matter?

281
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,800
Go back to sleep.

282
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,120
Yes.

283
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,600
I don't want to back to sleeping.

284
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,800
You are teaching me

285
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,520
about the dual personality features.

286
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,800
It makes me feel

287
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,000
different today.

288
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,520
And I feel

289
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,960
it's so cool.

290
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,400
You are actually no better than that.

291
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,000
Is that wasabi?

292
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,520
Or that tau- expert?

293
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,560
I mean,

294
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,360
Is it because

295
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
My little sister seems to have changed.

296
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
She used to treat me well.

297
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Lei Qingyu is a teacher.

298
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
She used to be a teacher.

299
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Now she is a father.

300
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
But I see that

301
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,360
she loves you so much.

302
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
You should take it.

303
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
He Jia is a member of the He family.

304
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
She is happy.

305
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
People are here.

306
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Let's discuss it.

307
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Two witnesses,

308
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Ma Chao and Song Tie.

309
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
One and three.

310
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Cao Panpao.

311
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
You two are in Ma Chao.

312
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
I am Song Tie.

313
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Hong Sha.

314
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Mu Dai is giving it to you.

315
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
He only treats you like a good face.

316
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Of course.

317
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,360
You don't understand this kind of sisterhood.

318
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
You men don't understand.

319
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
I am sorry.

320
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Mu Dai.

321
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Why is there a tiger and a horse?

322
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I have to hug someone else.

323
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Are you someone else?

324
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
You are my sister.

325
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
How is it?

326
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Is it very cool to be in a small team?

327
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Is it very warm to have friends?

328
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I don't need friends.

329
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Why is Cao Panpao still here?

330
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
He is here.

331
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I am going.

332
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
What?

333
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I saw Cao Panpao's face.

334
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
I am scared.

335
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Cao Panpao.

336
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I didn't know you were so close.

337
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360
You have been changing your mind.

338
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
I was afraid to scare you.

339
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
But Cao Panpao.

340
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Let's go to Ma Chao.

341
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Is it that heavy?

342
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,360
We are facing the evil.

343
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
We are facing the evil.

344
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
We are facing the evil.

345
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,360
We are facing the evil.

346
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
We are facing the evil.

347
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
One word.

348
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
So cool.

349
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
I am going.

350
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I am coming.

351
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Where are you going?

352
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
I don't know who is taking care of this bag.

353
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I just want to play with you.

354
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
You can talk to me.

355
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
This bag.

356
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Who is taking care of it?

357
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
I am going to cook.

358
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
You are eating so much.

359
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I...

360
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
I...

361
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I am going to eat.

362
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I am going to eat.

363
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Brother.

364
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
You are interesting.

365
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Give it to your friend.

366
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Brother.

367
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Why is your beer bottle made of sugar?

368
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
I bought it from a magic shop.

369
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Interesting.

370
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360
You were so good at choosing.

371
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Why are there so many people?

372
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
You are right.

373
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Brother Cao, you are still eating.

374
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
Look.

375
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Look at this.

376
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
What is this?

377
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
You used to be a man.

378
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
There is a problem.

379
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Besides,

380
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
who would have thought that Wang Budan

381
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
would still bring a little brother?

382
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
We are in the same boat.

383
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
You are right.

384
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
How is the result of your communication today?

385
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
The process is quite smooth.

386
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
But the result is very different.

387
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Ma Chao said that

388
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
they would drink wine after dinner.

389
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Zhang Tong was so angry when he was walking on the bridge.

390
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,360
He just walked around and scared him to the brim.

391
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Brother.

392
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
This is too high.

393
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
How about we stop?

394
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
It is so high.

395
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
We can still jump.

396
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Brother.

397
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
But he said that he saw the light coming out.

398
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
He was scared and ran away.

399
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
When he went out,

400
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
he almost hit a electric car.

401
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Isn't there another person named Song Tie?

402
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
It is this car, right?

403
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
No.

404
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I have found Song Tie.

405
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I have not seen this incident before.

406
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
I was called to the police station by my friend.

407
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
When I went home that night,

408
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,360
I heard a sound of a car.

409
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
I was so scared.

410
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
So you have not seen the crime scene?

411
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
No.

412
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
But I want to know what happened.

413
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
At that time,

414
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,360
a man came out from the bridge.

415
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
I told you that the car was like a ghost.

416
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
There is no other person?

417
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
Yes.

418
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
That man just ran over.

419
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
There was another person on the bridge.

420
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
He was so beautiful.

421
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Then the police told me to stop.

422
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
It was him.

423
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Why is he so sure that it was a ghost?

424
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Song Tie said that a pretty girl

425
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
appeared in that kind of place in the middle of the night.

426
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
She was very hot-blooded.

427
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
So she looked at you more.

428
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
It seems that I have been to the old bridge.

429
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Don't worry about the conclusion.

430
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Don't forget that there is another witness.

431
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
The car?

432
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,360
I think it was a woman from the night shift.

433
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,360
She was going from Chengdong to Chengxi after she got off work.

434
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
The old bridge was her way of life.

435
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
The reason why Song Tie did not see her

436
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,360
was because when she was in the bridge,

437
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
the woman was in the middle of the bridge.

438
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
When Ma Chao ran away,

439
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
she was apparently hit by her.

440
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,360
So she was the only one who passed through the whole city.

441
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
She was probably the most likely to have been caught by the murderer.

442
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Maybe the police have interrogated her.

443
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Let's go there tomorrow.

444
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,360
We have already said that the wind has gone down here to see the stars.

445
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
The oil fee is quite high after all.

446
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,360
And the weather is amazing today.

447
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,360
It's a pity that the stars here are worse than the small mountains.

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Is it the stars that are worse or are the stars that are worse?

449
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,360
After all, the person who accompanied you last time to see the stars is her.

450
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm afraid that everyone has two sides.

451
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Why do you have to be so isolated?

452
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Try to be strong.

453
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
I've been thinking these days.

454
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,360
You're telling me those things in your mind.

455
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
I think you're right.

456
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,360
I've already found some strange moves.

457
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
But I didn't ask anything.

458
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
I didn't do anything.

459
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
I didn't ask anything.

460
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm sure it's a good idea to care about you.

461
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,360
I think that you've been thinking about me.

462
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
So?

463
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
So I think you're not different.

464
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,360
And you said that Mu Dai is too weak.

465
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,360
I'm completely different from the one who has lived a bad life.

466
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Is there any reason?

467
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Mu Dai has a family, friends, love, courage and honesty.

468
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I think you should put down your prejudice.

469
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
It's a good way to be a good person.

470
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
You'll find out that he's actually taking care of you.

471
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
He's really stupid to take care of me.

472
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
He didn't do anything to hurt me.

473
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
He won't.

474
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
What's the reason?

475
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,360
You've used every reason you've been protecting yourself.

476
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Because you're the same person.

477
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
He only thinks about you and protects you.

478
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
You're the same, aren't you?

479
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,360
You only show up when he's in danger.

480
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Right?

481
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
You know how much you've known me.

482
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Don't say that you know me more.

483
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
I don't know enough.

484
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
But you've told me everything.

485
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,360
You've taken down many terrible things for him these years.

486
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Because you think that you can handle these terrible things.

487
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,360
And you have more experience.

488
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
You'll change your personality.

489
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
When you meet Huo Zihong,

490
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
you'll meet your master.

491
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
And many friends.

492
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
So he's soft.

493
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
You're smiling.

494
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
You can't be so harsh on yourself.

495
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
It's unfair to you.

496
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
It's unfair to him.

497
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
You need to grow up.

498
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
You need to be strong.

499
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
You need to have a bright future.

500
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
But you can't.

501
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,360
You'll be tired of walking on the street.

502
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
You're too much.

503
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Are you sure you want to see Wu Yiping?

504
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I brought a cap.

505
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
I think I can't recognize him.

506
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Hello, I'm Luo Ren.

507
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Hello.

508
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
We're all friends.

509
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
We're all concerned about this case.

510
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Please describe what happened that night.

511
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
What happened?

512
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm not sure.

513
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
I'm not sure.

514
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm not sure.

515
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
I'm not sure.

516
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
I'm not sure.

517
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm not sure.

518
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
I'm not sure.

519
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
What happened that night?

520
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,360
I went down the street.

521
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,360
I saw two people standing on the street.

522
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
They were lying there.

523
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
They didn't see me.

524
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm so scared.

525
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
You fell down.

526
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
I was scared.

527
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
I heard the doctor.

528
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I looked back.

529
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,360
I didn't know I was falling down.

530
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Did you see a girl?

531
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
I saw her.

532
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,360
I climbed up the street to get a ride.

533
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
I saw a girl.

534
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
She looked at me.

535
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
She was so weird.

536
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I fell down.

537
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
She didn't say she'd come to help me.

538
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
She was so heartless.

539
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Can you help me?

540
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Do you see the girl?

541
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
She is.

542
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Are you sure?

543
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm sure.

544
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
It's her.

545
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Thank you.

546
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,360
I still think it's weird.

547
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
There's a double-decker in the tomb.

548
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
But she's never done anything bad.

549
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
She's never hurt anyone.

550
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Why did she suddenly become a murderer?

551
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Don't you think it's weird?

552
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,360
And she was taken by three people at the same time.

553
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
It's so dark.

554
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
Can they see clearly?

555
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Why are they so sure?

556
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
They must be the one they saw.

557
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
What did you say?

558
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
It's so dark.

559
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
I know.

560
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
I think there's no pain on the bridge.

561
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Where are we going?

562
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
To the bridge.

563
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
I've been to the old bridge.

564
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
There's no road to the bridge.

565
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,360
The place where Zhang Tong was chasing is at the bridge.

566
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
That night,

567
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
besides the bridge,

568
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Songtian and Wuyi Ping were the first to meet the tomb.

569
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
And they were not close to each other.

570
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
It was dark.

571
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
They didn't wait for you.

572
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
It was dark.

573
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Yes.

574
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
We were together.

575
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
We were together at the time.

576
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
We didn't remember each other.

577
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
We were in the river.

578
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
But you all know each other well.

579
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Don't you think it's strange?

580
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Yes.

581
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
There must be something wrong.

582
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
There must be something wrong.

583
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
The three of us were the same.

584
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
We scared them to death.

585
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
No wonder they said that they were in the tiger.

586
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
What tiger?

587
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Three people in the tiger.

588
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
The meaning of three people in the tiger

589
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
is that three people lie and there's tiger in the world.

590
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Why don't we be more generous?

591
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
If Songtian and Wuyi Ping were in the tiger,

592
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
three people would be lying.

593
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
What you mean is that

594
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
the three of them don't know each other.

595
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
How can they make a contribution?

596
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
And Wuyi Ping

597
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
looks very honest.

598
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Could it be that they were together

599
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
and became a POA?

600
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
Heart.

601
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Could it be that it's a heart?

602
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
How could we forget the heart?

603
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
There's a fantasy.

604
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I've seen it before.

605
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
The wind of the unknown.

606
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
The wind of the unknown?

607
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Have you heard of

608
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
a story from the South Sky City?

609
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Mom.

610
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Didn't you feel that I was a evil wind?

611
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Evil wind?

612
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Why do I always feel that my stuff is wind-free?

613
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
It's so heavy.

614
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
It's been windy tonight.

615
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Besides,

616
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
the wind is so strong that

617
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
it's afraid of the evil wind.

618
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Here it is.

619
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
These people are so evil.

620
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
They came here to practice.

621
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
They can practice

622
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
but they can't.

623
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Who came here to practice?

624
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
What kind of a person can they practice?

625
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
There are many people.

626
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Who came here to practice?

627
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
What kind of person is that?

628
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Master!

629
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
What is it?

630
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
It's money.

631
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
There's a name

632
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
of Zhang Tong on it.

633
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
I've burned the paper.

634
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Ma Chao.

635
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Ma Chao.

636
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
What's wrong, Chao?

637
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Is there something wrong?

638
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
It's nothing.

639
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
I didn't find that paper.

640
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
I just want to die.

641
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
I'm still in the dark.

642
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
I've been dreaming about it for two days.

643
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Tell me.

644
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Chao,

645
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I'm really talking to you.

646
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
I'm talking to you.

647
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
You scared me.

648
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Okay.

649
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I advise you

650
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
to not be in a hurry.

651
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Why?

652
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
You don't know.

653
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I heard that woman

654
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
was a good girl.

655
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
I know.

656
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
She said that woman

657
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
was very strong.

658
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
She was so strong.

659
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
She didn't have any reason to do it.

660
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
I also heard

661
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
that woman was a good girl.

662
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
I know

663
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
that you're still in the dark.

664
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
You only know what she did.

665
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
She ran away with a gun.

666
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
If she killed you,

667
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
it would be easy.

668
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
I don't know.

669
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
And I also heard from Xiaoxi

670
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
that she said

671
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
that woman was not a good girl.

672
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
You killed her.

673
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
How could it be?

674
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I saw it myself.

675
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
Don't be so excited, Chao.

676
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
Come.

677
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
You were drunk at that time.

678
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
You really remember it.

679
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
I also heard that

680
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
after that incident,

681
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
you ran away.

682
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
The police found you the next day.

683
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Why didn't you call the police?

684
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Don't move.

685
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
Don't move.

686
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Please move.

687
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Who is Ma Chao?

688
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Ma Chao.

689
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
Ma Chao, I'm asking you.

690
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Where were you last night?

691
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
I was in the garden.

692
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
I went with my friend to drink.

693
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Your friend died.

694
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Do you know that?

695
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Something happened.

696
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Someone killed my friend.

697
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Then why didn't you call the police last night?

698
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
I was drunk at that time.

699
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I was in a daze.

700
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
I was in a daze.

701
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Chao,

702
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
don't be so rude.

703
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
You're a big brother.

704
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
You were pushed down

705
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
from the bridge

706
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
and fell to the ground.

707
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
How could you forget the police?

708
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Brother,

709
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
I suddenly don't want to pee.

710
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Pee?

711
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
I really don't dare.

712
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
No, do you want to pee?

713
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
How could you pee?

714
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Brother, I beg you.

715
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Don't make a scene.

716
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
I really don't dare to push you down.

717
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
I really don't dare to push you down.

718
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Ma Chao,

719
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
what's wrong with your neck injury?

720
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
I really don't dare.

721
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
I really don't dare.

722
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
I really don't dare.

723
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Ma Chao!

724
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Ma Chao!

725
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I can't remember it.

727
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Chao,

728
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
how did I die?

729
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
I'm so miserable.

730
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Why?

731
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
I really wrote this.

732
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
I really don't dare to pee.

733
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Ma Chao!

734
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
I killed someone on the bridge.

735
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm so sorry.

736
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
It's not me.

737
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
It's not me.

738
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
It's him.

739
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Get out of the way.

740
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Get out of the way.

741
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Ma Chao, get out of the way.

742
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Let's go.

743
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:40,500
Dad, we need to go to

744
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
It's him.

745
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Who?

746
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
He's the one who hit him.

747
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
No.

748
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,900
He hit the girl.

749
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,500
Look at him.

750
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,100
Yes.

751
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,500
I said it's not me.

752
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
It's him.

753
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,900
What are you doing?

754
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,500
He is the one who got the girl.

755
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Yes.

756
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
It's him.

757
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
It's him.

758
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
