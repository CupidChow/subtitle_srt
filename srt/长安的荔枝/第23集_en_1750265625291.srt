1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Because two million had worked together before,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,360
it would have saved more than half as much as the real story.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,540
So I used the value of my time to really understand that Westconnene continued his path.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,760
Thanks your friendship is often not stopping you from conselling him.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,380
But I realize that we witnessed that crisis in North Itually.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,300
Thanks for the chance toapproach me.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought it was a black cat.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,060
It's a patCI

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,540
NFT

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,420
Hat

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,840
Jack Grosven PG

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,820
Bug

17
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Come out.

18
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
It's you.

19
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
It's been two years.

20
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
It's been two years.

21
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
It's still a lifetime.

22
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
Where is your husband, Nannan Huang?

23
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
When did you come to visit me?

24
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Yuan Qing.

25
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Come back to Chao'an with me.

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
The air is now moving freely.

27
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,820
I also found someone to pick you up.

28
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,820
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
I'm alone.

31
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
This is more than Chang'an.

32
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
But I'm a mountaineer.

33
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
I'm a treasure.

34
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
I'm worried.

35
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
I'm just a beggar.

36
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,820
I'm not going to live here for a while.

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Then you won't be Mr. Kong.

38
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Mr. Kong.

39
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Zhang Ming'er.

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Stay.

41
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,820
I'll go back to Chang'an with you.

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
I'll go back to Chang'an with you.

43
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,820
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm sorry.

48
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Stay.

49
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
I'll wait for you in Chang'an.

50
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
If I didn't come back,

51
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
I would have come to Lin'an to pick you up.

52
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Wait for me.

53
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
I'll go back to Chang'an with you.

54
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,820
I'm sorry.

55
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Where are we going?

56
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
I'll go back to you.

57
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,820
I'll go back to you.

58
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Such a beautiful lady.

59
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
It's a pity.

60
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
I can't bear to let her go.

61
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Go.

62
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
My Xiu.

63
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
I don't like to watch my daughter.

64
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,820
She's a good girl.

65
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm sorry.

66
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
You're sorry.

67
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
I'm sorry.

68
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I'm sorry.

69
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,820
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
She's much more fragile than in Chang'an.

75
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
She's standing in the middle of the forest.

76
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
But I don't know how to call her aunt.

77
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
I don't know how to call her aunt.

78
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm still not used to it.

79
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Aunt?

80
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Aunt?

81
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
Xiu.

82
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Aunt?

83
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Let me see your aunt.

84
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Aunt?

85
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Aunt?

86
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Aunt, come back.

87
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Aunt, you're so white.

88
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
You're like a dream.

89
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
What?

90
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
I've been thinking.

91
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
I haven't opened the door yet.

92
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm back.

93
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Aunt,

94
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm afraid Xiu is thinking about her future.

95
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
I'm in a dream.

96
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
I'm asking you,

97
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
when will you open the door?

98
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
I said,

99
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
I can't wait.

100
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
I have to go back to see Xiu.

101
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I'm going to see Xiu.

102
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
I have to go back to see Xiu.

103
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Is this the car?

104
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
This is the friend that aunt taught me in Lingnan.

105
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
She and aunt went back to Chang'an for business.

106
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
She's also a business worker.

107
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
She's not.

108
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
She's here for business.

109
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
You're here.

110
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Go find a place.

111
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Okay.

112
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Take it.

113
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
You two,

114
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
two.

115
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Okay.

116
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

117
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
You're out of the house.

118
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
I've been missing you.

119
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
This time,

120
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm still a householder.

121
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
Ten.

122
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Okay.

123
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,820
I know your name is Xiu.

124
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Your aunt has been reminding you on the way.

125
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
My name is Amita.

126
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
You can call my name directly.

127
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
You're not a sugar man.

128
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
My aunt is a sugar man.

129
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Lingnan's food

130
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
is not as good as yours.

131
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Here.

132
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Uncle.

133
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
My aunt is in Lingnan.

134
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
She's been reminding you on the way.

135
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
You've ruined my aunt.

136
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
You're so good at cooking.

137
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
My aunt

138
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
is looking for you.

139
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
I told my aunt to forget about you.

140
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
But she's still looking for you.

141
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
No, no.

142
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
She's good at cooking.

143
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
She's good at cooking.

144
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Here's your soup.

145
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Auntie, eat slowly.

146
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
You've eaten six.

147
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
The fish is so delicious.

148
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
It's delicious.

149
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
I can't finish it.

150
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
You can't finish it?

151
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
I can't.

152
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Chang'an sells noodles.

153
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
I can't finish it.

154
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Chang'an sells noodles.

155
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
It's a great place.

156
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Especially this shop.

157
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Look.

158
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
There's lamb meat inside.

159
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
They put ginger, ginger and garlic on the dish.

160
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
And they put some ginger powder on it.

161
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
It's a great place.

162
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Don't waste it.

163
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Cover it.

164
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Chang'an

165
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
doesn't need this kind of youth.

166
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I've already sent the message to Kong Lang.

167
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I'll send it to him in two days.

168
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Today,

169
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
I'll move to the old house in Guiyi.

170
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I don't like the rent.

171
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I'll just leave it to you.

172
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
You can lend me the rent.

173
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm not sure if I can afford it.

174
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Try it.

175
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
I'll take it.

176
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Come over there.

177
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Stay here.

178
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Uncle Chang'an.

179
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Thank you for your hard work.

180
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
You're busy with your business.

181
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
I didn't say anything.

182
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Go back to your work.

183
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
I'll go first.

184
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
I'll go to the old house after I finish my business.

185
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Remember,

186
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
you're the owner.

187
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Amita is the guest.

188
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Take care of her.

189
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
I'm back.

190
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
She's not with me.

191
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
You have to work hard.

192
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
I'll come back early to change.

193
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
You have a lot of skills.

194
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Don't make a day off.

195
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Don't be angry.

196
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
I'm leaving.

197
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I'll go back.

198
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Is this the official?

199
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
This is the official.

200
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I don't know if this official

201
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
is here to work for me.

202
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Cheng Meng is a good businessman.

203
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
He's a good businessman.

204
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
He's a good businessman.

205
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Are you looking for Du Zhi or Yuan Mai?

206
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
You're busy with your work.

207
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Do you want to say hello to them?

208
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I just came back from Chang'an.

209
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
I haven't...

210
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
They're here to ask for you.

211
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
You can go to the owner of the house

212
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
in front of the house.

213
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
You can follow them later.

214
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Please come with me.

215
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Please.

216
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Please.

217
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Here.

218
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,820
I just came here.

219
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
You must be hungry.

220
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Your plugged in pocket?

221
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
It's mine.

222
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I did that today, too.

223
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
You should try this.

224
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I'm working on it.

225
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
You may have a bad job ella.

226
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
It's like looking for food.

227
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Be careful.

228
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Save yourself.

229
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,540
It doesn't matter but let's continue.

230
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,980
Why wait so long

231
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,300
It's getting hot

232
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,740
Mostly

233
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,580
Are they

234
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,500
This brother is a little attuned

235
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,900
The first time it happened

236
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,180
I can see

237
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,060
It's all right

238
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,860
He stopped training

239
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Not at all

240
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,540
Today, we have a lot of people.

241
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
Can you do it?

242
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
Yes.

243
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,540
You can do it.

244
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
I think you can do it.

245
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
When you do it, you can put the fork on it.

246
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Then, you can ask the host

247
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,540
and you can get the job tomorrow.

248
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
I can't finish it today.

249
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,540
If you are in the position of the guard and the assistant,

250
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
it's not hard to do it.

251
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Maybe you can finish it in a day.

252
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Not enough.

253
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,540
You have to be happy when you are in the position.

254
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,540
For example, you just sent a new letter or a new aunt.

255
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,540
Anyway, as long as she is happy,

256
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
your business will be good.

257
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,540
It's so natural and peaceful.

258
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,540
We can do it together.

259
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,540
If not so, we can't finish it in 45 days.

260
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
It's a long wait.

261
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Wait for me.

262
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,540
This is the palace.

263
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Why is it so crowded?

264
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
The assistant is only one person.

265
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
It's a big problem.

266
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Can't she be more than a few people?

267
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Yes.

268
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
The assistant is under the book.

269
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Then it's the city.

270
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Then it's the wolf and the wolf.

271
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
The official is in charge of the capital.

272
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Everyone is in the position.

273
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Who do you want to be the division?

274
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,540
The wolf or the wolf?

275
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
I don't dare.

276
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,540
I don't have the right to ask for it.

277
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
So, since it's so,

278
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,540
why don't you follow the Yuan?

279
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Everyone knows the situation.

280
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,540
Why are you so late today?

281
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
We are in the private family.

282
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
It's a whole day.

283
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
We are so busy.

284
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
If we are not in a good mood,

285
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,540
we will be sick.

286
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Can we stay here for a while?

287
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
That's right.

288
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
It's better to stay in the dark

289
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
for a day than to stay in the dark for three days.

290
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
If we can't stay in the dark,

291
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
we can stay for four to five days.

292
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
In the last night,

293
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
we were in the public office.

294
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
We were busy.

295
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
We spent the day

296
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
with a light heart.

297
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
That's great.

298
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,540
This flower tree is about to cry.

299
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
Don't say that.

300
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,540
This flower tree is the tree of loyalty.

301
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,540
How do you know?

302
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Why do you call it the tree of loyalty?

303
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,540
When I left Chang'an,

304
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
I told Xiu'er

305
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,540
that when the flower tree was opened,

306
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,540
it was my father's funeral.

307
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
This flower tree,

308
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
knowing my father's character,

309
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,540
is a form of a sword and a sword.

310
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
So,

311
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,540
I decided to give it to my father

312
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
to make some food.

313
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
So that my father

314
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,540
won't be a fool in front of Xiu'er.

315
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,540
You're so mean.

316
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,540
It's really a gift from loyalty.

317
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,540
How do you know my father?

318
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
Your father

319
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,540
just broke my voice

320
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
when he arrived in Linnan.

321
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
He jumped into Linnan's foot.

322
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,540
It's hard to not know him.

323
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,540
He told me that you're his friend.

324
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,540
I was in trouble.

325
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Your father left Linnan for me.

326
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
He's a good man.

327
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,540
I went to the Holy Humanity's temple

328
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,540
to meet with the gods

329
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
to help you.

330
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
So,

331
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
I'm grateful

332
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,540
that you're a kind person.

333
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
No need.

334
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
I'm a little dog.

335
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,540
I can make flowers and grass.

336
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,540
I can save them all.

337
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
Let's go.

338
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
Let's go home.

339
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
My father

340
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
bought me a medicine

341
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
to cure my mother.

342
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
He sold the house to me.

343
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
But he kept thinking about my mother.

344
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
So he bought me a new one.

345
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Look.

346
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
The flower tree

347
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
is not my mother's hand.

348
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Now you're

349
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540
so serious about your father.

350
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
You're so mean.

351
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
He's also

352
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
good to me and my mother.

353
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
He's good to others.

354
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
My father has a broken heart.

355
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
He's not willing to give up.

356
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
He's also

357
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
so mean to me.

358
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
He's so mean to me.

359
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
And

360
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
he always

361
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
doesn't like

362
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,540
to buy a new one.

363
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Actually, he's already chosen.

364
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
But

365
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
the flowers and grass

366
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
are all scattered here.

367
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
I can only remember

368
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,540
your father.

369
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
But

370
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
he's a little bit more modest.

371
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,540
But he's really a kind person.

372
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
He's giving it all

373
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
to give it to you.

374
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,540
He's not only a good boy,

375
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
but also too old.

376
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
How is he old?

377
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
He's like

378
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
a person with no shoes.

379
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
He's not common.

380
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Besides, he's experienced the world

381
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
and can keep a heart of a son.

382
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm so sorry.

383
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I'll leave you to it.

384
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Li Shande is back.

385
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I saw someone moving

386
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
things in the house.

387
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
But I didn't see Li Shande.

388
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,540
I saw a woman.

389
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,540
It seems

390
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,540
there's a woman in the house.

391
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
A woman?

392
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
Shi Xinya,

393
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
it's our duty to

394
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
protect Li Shande

395
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540
from the child's death.

396
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
We have to seize the opportunity.

397
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
It's better to take back

398
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
the treasure we owe.

399
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Otherwise,

400
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm afraid he'll forget

401
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
what he's got.

402
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
You're right.

403
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
He's looking for a woman.

404
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
He should have money

405
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
to pay us back.

406
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Since Li Shande doesn't want to show up,

407
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,540
you should invite that woman.

408
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
I want to talk to her

409
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,540
and talk to her.

410
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
I'll go.

411
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Everyone,

412
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
it's time for the morning dance.

413
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
We can only wait for one more audience.

414
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
The rest is up to tomorrow.

415
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
What?

416
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Shi Xinya,

417
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
it's morning.

418
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
There are only a few people.

419
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Shouldn't we finish it?

420
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Yes.

421
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Li Weichi is only concerned about

422
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
his own business.

423
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
But the host has to take care of everything.

424
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,540
He has a new style of dancing.

425
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
But he doesn't agree with the body.

426
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
I don't know

427
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
who will be the first to come

428
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,540
if we don't take care of them.

429
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,540
I'm worried about him.

430
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
He should be the first to come.

431
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
I'm worried about him.

432
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Who's worried about him?

433
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,540
I've been to Chang'an for five or six days.

434
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
I'll take him down.

435
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
If it rains,

436
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Chang'an will be destroyed.

437
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,540
What's the point of this?

438
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
You're right.

439
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
What's the point?

440
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
I'm worried too.

441
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
The west gate is closed.

442
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
It's been closed for a long time.

443
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
There's a lot of fog today.

444
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,540
And there's a head of the officials.

445
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
The west gate is blocked.

446
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
It's been blocked for an hour.

447
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
If we don't take care of them,

448
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,540
if they kill us,

449
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,540
we'll think about this.

450
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
It's serious.

451
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
It's serious.

452
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
It's serious.

453
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Compared to the two of you,

454
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,540
I'm worried about Li Zhi.

455
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Who are you?

456
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
Li Zhi.

457
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,540
You're Li Zhi.

458
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,540
So you're Li Zhi.

459
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,540
You're Li Zhi.

460
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,540
Li Zhi.

461
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Please.

462
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
Please.

463
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Please.

464
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
You know me?

465
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
How could I not know?

466
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
I was in the top ten.

467
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
The iron was the most important thing.

468
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,540
No one could see us.

469
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Later, I found out that you

470
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
took the ghost job.

471
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,540
I was so lucky.

472
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,540
I didn't get a chance to see you.

473
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,540
The rumor in the room

474
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,540
is that you're a colleague of the top-ranking official.

475
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
You dug a pit.

476
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
I dug a pit.

477
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
I didn't believe it.

478
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
I didn't even have a pit.

479
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
It was so hard.

480
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
We had to work together.

481
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
We had to work together.

482
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
And we only had one person

483
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
to report the news.

484
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,540
We had to work together.

485
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
Could it be that

486
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
you didn't even have

487
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
a close colleague in the top-ranking official?

488
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
The rumor in the room

489
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
is so unbelievable.

490
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
Could it be that

491
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,540
you're the one who made the decision?

492
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Well,

493
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
I'm just kidding.

494
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
Could it be that

495
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,540
someone caught him and hurt him?

496
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Could you tell us more about it?

497
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Yes.

498
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Nothing can be revealed.

499
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,540
Since you're in this business,

500
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
you can go to Lingnan to get a new job.

501
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
A new job.

502
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,540
How can you go back to the factory?

503
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
So I'm here

504
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
to do this, right?

505
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
Yes.

506
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
Everyone,

507
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,540
did you find out the truth?

508
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
The cook is still waiting.

509
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
If no one comes,

510
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,540
the cook will have to leave the house.

511
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
Mr. Li.

512
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,540
Mr. Li.

513
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
Mr. Li.

514
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Mr. Li.

515
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
Mr. Li.

516
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Mr. Li.

517
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Mr. Li.

518
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Mr. Li.

519
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Mr. Li.

520
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,540
You're the cook Li?

521
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
It seems that

522
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,540
I've already passed on the position of the court.

523
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Why are you here to see me?

524
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,540
The world's future is at risk.

525
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
It's all up to the client.

526
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
So I'm here.

527
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Since it's the holy ceremony of the holy ceremony,

528
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
it's not appropriate to follow this rule.

529
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
You can leave.

530
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,540
But you don't have to go through this.

531
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Master.

532
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
If it's a general job,

533
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
I can pass these rules

534
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
and go straight from the national treasury to the front.

535
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,540
But the luck is not only for the front,

536
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,540
but also for the cooperation of all the teeth.

537
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
So this job

538
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,540
must be carried out by the Ministry of Revenue.

539
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Then I'll do it.

540
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
I heard the master's idea.

541
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
First of all,

542
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,540
you're so clever.

543
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,540
How did you pass the Ministry of Revenue?

544
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,540
I'm just trying to be careful.

545
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,540
There are four standards for the Ministry of Revenue.

546
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Deep, strict, and strict.

547
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,540
First of all, your appearance is so cool.

548
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
You have a bright voice.

549
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
You're so free and calm.

550
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,540
These three are not qualified.

551
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
As for the court,

552
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,540
how many li of money do you need to get to Chang'an?

553
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,540
No matter if it's one or two,

554
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,540
all these money are needed.

555
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,540
How many li of money do you need?

556
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,540
40 li.

557
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
Do you know

558
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,540
from Henan to the capital,

559
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
the official price is

560
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,540
100 li of money, 100 li of money,

561
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
120 li of money from the mountain.

562
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
From the south,

563
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
a master's interest

564
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
is worth 700 li.

565
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
That's too much.

566
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
700 li.

567
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
The sum is

568
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
1.5 li of money,

569
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
and 500 li of money from the capital.

570
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
You have to know

571
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
that the capital

572
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,540
is not worth 15 li of money

573
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,540
from the capital.

574
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Am I busy?

575
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,540
The way I designed

576
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
and transferred money

577
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
are very simple.

578
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
The only disadvantage

579
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
is that the cost is too high.

580
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,540
You know it well.

581
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
This is a waste.

582
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
It's not greedy.

583
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Back then,

584
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,540
Pei Yaoqing

585
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
was good at repairing the river and the river.

586
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Although the cost is too high,

587
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,540
after repairing it,

588
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,540
he can make the capital of the capital.

589
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
But

590
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
your method of transferring money

591
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
is very useful.

592
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
For example,

593
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
the horses' skin,

594
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
the ice,

595
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
the human's body,

596
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
the equipment,

597
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
the food,

598
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
etc.

599
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
After this,

600
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
we will have to

601
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,540
come here again.

602
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,540
There is also a decree in Luzhou.

603
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Why don't you run from there?

604
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
Is Lingnan

605
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,540
your relative?

606
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
It's the decree of the saint

607
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
to appoint Lingnan.

608
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
I am the one who obeys the decree.

609
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
You are the one who obeys the decree.

610
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
I am Zhao Zhang's servant.

611
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,540
You can't give the money.

612
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
Master,

613
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
I have been in Lingnan

614
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
for more than a month.

615
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,540
I have been trying to make money.

616
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
I have already convinced

617
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
the people of the country

618
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
to give the money.

619
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
They don't need to pay the court.

620
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Left hand is saved money.

621
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Right hand is free.

622
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
In the end,

623
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
the people of the country

624
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,540
are paid by the court.

625
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,540
This is the money sent by the saint.

626
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
Aren't you going to give it?

627
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,540
It's called the decree of the great emperor.

628
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,540
The Ministry of Revenue is very careful.

629
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
It's just the order

630
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,540
of the court.

631
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
You go to the pharmacy to catch the medicine.

632
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,540
You have to open the prescription all the time.

633
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
Then you can call the fire department

634
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
to get the medicine.

635
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,540
With the judgment of the central secretary,

636
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,540
the chairman will be very happy.

637
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,540
The chairman just said

638
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,540
that the saint is the best.

639
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
Don't have to follow these rules.

640
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
Master Li,

641
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,540
I said that you don't need to follow the rules.

642
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
It's you.

643
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,540
You have to follow the rules.

644
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,540
You have to follow the rules.

645
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,540
I am a little chairman.

646
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,540
I am a man.

647
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Why do you make it difficult for me?

648
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,540
I am old.

649
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,540
You can go to the court

650
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,540
and find the people of the court.

651
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,540
Left.

652
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,540
According to Yun Qing,

653
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,540
He You Guang has brought the evidence

654
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
of this girl.

655
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,540
The letter of He You Guang

656
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,540
can't be used to act.

657
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,540
This time, Yun Qing took Amita.

658
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,540
It's a fake in Linan.

659
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,540
Now, You Xiang is busy with the operation.

660
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,540
She is very upset.

661
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
I think

662
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
we should keep searching

663
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
to find the evidence.

664
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,540
As you said, He You Guang

665
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,540
doesn't dare to tell Amita again.

666
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
He just sent a secret search

667
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
of the girl in Linan.

668
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
He killed her today.

669
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,540
Amita is not a thief.

670
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,540
But she is a key witness.

671
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,540
The devil sent people to find the girl.

672
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,540
We should find the chance to find her.

673
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,540
Wu Yu and You Xiang have been fighting each other for a long time.

674
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
And they have come to the capital of Su Qing

675
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
to control the situation of Chao Gang.

676
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,540
The court has been talking about the situation.

677
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,540
We can't talk about it anymore.

678
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,540
The Song family is called the Great Army of the Left.

679
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,540
We can't rely on the country and the country.

680
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Send the letter to Yun Qing.

681
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Tell her the timing is right.

682
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
We must make a plan.

683
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,540
We must not let the situation get worse.

684
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
Let's go.

685
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Come back with your aunt.

686
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
Thank you, aunt.

687
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
You are welcome.

688
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,540
Come back.

689
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,540
Little girl.

690
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,540
We are here to find Master Li.

691
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Who are you?

692
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Master Li bought this house.

693
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
We helped him.

694
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
We gave him some merit.

695
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Merit?

696
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,540
You like to call yourself a gold.

697
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
You are a generous person.

698
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
I am a good person.

699
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,540
Of course, I should be more generous.

700
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,540
I am a good person.

701
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Don't talk about them.

702
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,540
They are bad people.

703
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
What a coincidence.

704
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Master Li is not here today.

705
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
Let's come again.

706
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,540
Little girl.

707
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,540
We want to come again.

708
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
But tomorrow is a day off.

709
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,540
How many days can Master Li have?

710
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
Master Li has ordered the food of the holy man.

711
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
He has sent the whole Chang'an city.

712
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,540
We are worried about this.

713
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Did we lose some of our merit?

714
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,540
Since we met Master Li's friend today,

715
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,540
we don't want to miss the opportunity to talk.

716
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Please come with me to see my master.

717
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,540
I am his friend.

718
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,540
I can't do anything about his business.

719
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,540
I can't solve any problem with you.

720
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,540
I understand what you mean.

721
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Master Li will come back.

722
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Hello?

723
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,540
I am afraid that after the grass is pruned,

724
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
I will see Master Li again.

725
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
It will be hard to come back.

726
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,540
This little girl has returned to Chang'an.

727
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,540
She has moved back to the house.

728
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,540
We worked hard to get this house.

729
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,540
If you continue to push us like this,

730
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,540
we will think that we are all wrong.

731
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Although we are human,

732
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,540
we are hungry for people.

733
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
You are so stupid.

734
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,540
Don't force us to lose our merit.

735
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
We are all businessmen.

736
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,540
We are all good people.

737
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,540
You can go with us.

738
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,540
What is this?

739
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:19,540
You should find the head of the court.

740
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
I am going.

741
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,540
I just came back from there.

742
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,540
The six ministries of the capital are the command.

743
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,540
The real one is the one who made the decision.

744
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
It is the one who is the prime minister of the central office.

745
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
It is a bit difficult.

746
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,540
Why?

747
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,540
I am the commander of the wing.

748
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Can't I be like the emperor of the Dongfu?

749
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,540
Do you know why there is a five-storey house here?

750
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Why?

751
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,540
There are so many things in the world.

752
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,540
Why do the Prime Minister come here?

753
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,540
The scum from the central office

754
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,540
will have to pass the six ministries of the capital.

755
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
After the small matter is over,

756
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,540
the Prime Minister will send us to the five-storey house

757
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
after the meeting.

758
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,540
We can't let the Prime Minister come.

759
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
So?

760
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:22,540
So you can't send this scum here.

761
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
You have to send it to the Ministry of Revenue first.

762
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,540
After they are done, you have to send it to the Ministry of Revenue.

763
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,540
This is the most normal process.

764
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Then...

765
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Then...

766
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,540
Isn't this going to be a lot of trouble?

767
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,540
The prime minister is a professional.

768
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,540
He can do it naturally

769
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,540
only when he is under the water.

770
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
You have to follow the process.

771
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,540
You have to follow the process.

772
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
I...

773
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I just washed my face.

774
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
I just washed my face.

775
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
The body and the body of the house

776
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,540
can't be put into the house.

777
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
But...

778
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,540
There is another western mirror that you can try.

779
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
The public affairs in Zhuzhou

780
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,540
are all transferred to the Ministry of Revenue first.

781
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,540
You have to find them

782
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,540
about the law.

783
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
You can go tomorrow.

784
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Today is the day.

785
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,540
If you dare to go, they will be late.

786
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
Go.

787
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Take her out for a walk.

788
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Follow me.

789
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,540
Go.

790
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,540
Go.

791
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Tell me.

792
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,540
If you forcefully invite us here,

793
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,540
there must be something important.

794
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,540
Sister, you look like a good person.

795
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Then I will tell you the truth.

796
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Your new minister Li

797
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,540
borrowed 150 cans from me

798
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,540
and bought a house in Guiyi Village.

799
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,540
But once he took the money out,

800
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,540
he took a dead man.

801
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
I'm afraid it will be two of us

802
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,540
in June.

803
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,540
I took the money to make money,

804
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,540
not to do good deeds.

805
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,540
So I invited you here today

806
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,540
to say that

807
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,540
since you have destroyed Chang'an,

808
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,540
you should return the money I owed you first.

809
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Actually, I have a feeling

810
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,540
that I will be able to return it.

811
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,540
If you didn't return the money,

812
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
that would be his wrong.

813
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,540
If you don't take the money,

814
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,540
that would be your wrong.

815
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,540
As a businessman,

816
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,540
you can't stand up for the rules.

817
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,540
I'm afraid you can't stand up for them.

818
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,540
It's not impossible to do things according to the rules.

819
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,540
It's just the rules.

820
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
I have to do it.

821
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
I dare to return the money

822
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,540
in Chang'an

823
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,540
with a hundred ways.

824
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
You really want to break my face?

825
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,540
Before June 1st,

826
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,540
Li Shan De was the one who was the witness of the holy ceremony.

827
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
Even if you broke your face,

828
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
can you take him with you?

829
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,540
So you are determined to return the money?

830
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,540
You don't want to return the money?

831
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
He really took the money

832
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,540
in Li Nan.

833
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,540
And he invested all his money

834
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,540
in the experiment of the transfer of interest.

835
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
He took the money

836
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,540
and changed it to the chance of his life.

837
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
So he came to Chang'an

838
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
and once he got the approval,

839
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,540
he could complete the transfer of interest.

840
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,540
Sister, don't worry.

841
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
He won't be able to die

842
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
on June 1st.

843
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
Why did you fight again?

844
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,540
He asked me to do it.

845
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,540
I just let him go.

846
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,540
He said that he would return the money

847
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,540
in June.

848
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
I don't know why.

849
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,540
No, no, no.

850
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
No?

851
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,540
Brother Ming.

852
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
Why are you here?

853
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,540
You have a business with him again?

854
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
He said that he would take the money

855
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
from the prince.

856
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,540
I don't know what to do.

857
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Let's go.

858
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
You have to tell me where I should go.

859
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Where should I go?

860
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,540
The sea fire is burning.

861
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,540
The dead are dying.

862
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
We are two conditions just apart.

863
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
A relative family.

864
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
What does your father do?

865
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,540
He.

866
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:44,540
They don't know anything

867
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
about you.

868
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,540
I will not be able to live without you.

869
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,540
I will not be able to live without you.

870
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,540
I will not be able to live without you.

871
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,540
I will not be able to live without you.

872
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,540
I will not be able to live without you.

873
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,540
I will not be able to live without you.

874
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,540
I will not be able to live without you.

875
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,540
I can't live without you.

876
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,540
I will not be able to live without you.

877
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:13,540
You have to live without me.

878
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:26,340
Let's sing to the Apache flower
