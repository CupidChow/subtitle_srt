1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
again, new 2w puesto

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
You

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,680
The

4
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,000
snow-covered

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
one.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Those

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hu merchants said

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that the

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
origin of the year

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
was good luck

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
to get these

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
gifts.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
gifts are all

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
prepared

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in the palace.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is the quality?

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's all

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
prepared.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Just like

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the one in the

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Youxiang City.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let them exchange them.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Exchange them

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
for the same quality

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
as last year.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This year

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
it's indeed a good quality.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But if it's not

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
possible to get it next year,

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
what should we do?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't know

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
what to do.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What should we do?

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We should

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
not only ask for the

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
gift of the Holy Spirit,

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but also ask for the kiss.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Lu Xiao,

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the one

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you like the most

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is now a new son.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's a good boy.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's good.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Remember,

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
this is the

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
first and last thing

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we should do.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't worry,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
he won't die

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in the first month of June.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're his person.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can help him speak.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
From today

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to the first month of June,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
how many

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
of these changes?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why do I

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
have to worry about this

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
every day?

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have to be with him

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
for his life.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You just

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
started to speak

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and the quality is gone.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't just

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
worry about

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the good things

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you do.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just keep an eye on

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the woman.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Take a good chance

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and hold on.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You've been holding on

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
for the rest of your life.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You've found the truth.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If it's you,

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll try my best

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to persuade my master

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
to give

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
a big chance

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to Lishan

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
with 150 gold coins.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Lishan

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
has completed the transfer of interest.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As his person,

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
he'll try to

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
understand your good.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ten times more

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
than the ten times

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you can exchange.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If he fails,

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
he'll

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
return the money to you.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because he has to

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
give his

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
child

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to his own

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
no matter what,

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the gold

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
behind you

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
won't be worth it.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Stop it!

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Stop it!

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Where's my child?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Where's my child?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are you so anxious?

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I asked you to return the money.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Didn't you also ask me to do it?

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I gave you the money

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I gave you

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
six months ago.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I promised you

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that I'll give

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you the money

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I gave you

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
six months ago.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What else do you want?

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want you to return the money now.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I heard that you went to the office today.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're going to give me the money.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But there's a good news

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to share with me.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Where's the money?

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's so easy to do.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then you have to

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
give me the money

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and return the money

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
three or four times.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Two or three days?

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I only got back one day.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't worry.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
give you the money

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I gave you.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can give you the money

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and I can do it.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay?

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you believe me?

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Someone has already

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
found me.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Master Li is not a good father.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He found a good man.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't worry.

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I won't trouble you today.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I also need

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to give the money

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to the owner.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So you have to come back

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and let me eat Ding Xin Wan.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Otherwise,

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I won't let you go to Chang'an again.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I know.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hurry up.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We're going to the office.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hurry up.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't touch my clothes.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hurry up.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who told you to bring her here today?

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Who told you?

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hurry up.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Didn't you have a

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
three-year-old man

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
who was responsible for you?

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They were too many people.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I couldn't have friends with them.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm a businessman.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know their situation.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Besides, they're going to 100 places.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
100 places?

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
100 places?

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're lucky today.

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're lucky.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you know where this is?

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is this where you said you'd go?

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's where you said

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you'd go to the office

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and close your mouth.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you know where this is?

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Chang'an.

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you know Chang'an?

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's called Jiu Liu.

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's called Yulong Kun Da.

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Where can you go?

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Where?

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where?

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Where is the Chang'an 108-room?

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Where are you going?

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This way.

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hurry up.

193
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hurry up.

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hurry up.

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you want to stay here?

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Uncle Zhang.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Can you help me look after the kids?

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Where are you going?

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll buy you some food.

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Help Zhang Shen cook.

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Uncle Zhang.

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Uncle Zhang.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sit here.

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sit here.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's so fast.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Last night,

208
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I had a dream.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I had a dream.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I had a dream.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I dreamt of Li Shan De

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
in Chang'an.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He was like me.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's nothing.

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't know

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
why he's so angry.

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He's not a coward.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's a coward.

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Uncle Zhang.

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You don't always think

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you're a coward.

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know how to live.

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're not as good as a chicken.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where are you going?

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Please check.

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Please chase.

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Please look after me.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So long drearing.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's freezing out!

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You must pull over to me.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't see you for the rest of my life.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm not willing to give up.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not willing to give up!

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not willing to give up!

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm not willing to give up!

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm not willing to give up!

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm not willing to give up!

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm not willing to give up!

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm not willing to give up!

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not willing to give up!

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not willing to give up!

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not willing to give up!

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm not willing to give up!

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not willing to give up!

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm not willing to give up!

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not willing to give up!

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not willing to give up!

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not willing to give up!

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not willing to give up!

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not willing to give up!

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I...

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I brought you dinner.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're joking.

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,840
and some of the heirloomi squares.

256
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,700
You see, that was a bit of seriousSMC.

257
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,260
But you definitely had a good dream last evening.

258
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,560
Don't 시간 it.

259
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,780
Enough.

260
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,180
Don't make it aени.

261
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,560
Stop saying

262
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I'm a good uncle.

263
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I just don't want to see a kid like you

264
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
who has become a crying child without you.

265
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I don't mean that.

266
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Okay, you eat here.

267
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I hate Meila.

268
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,560
I've been a model to my father for so many years.

269
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I saw you and Xiu get along well

270
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
and made some memories.

271
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,560
My father has always been very strict with me.

272
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,560
He taught me how to ride a bike and take me to the sea.

273
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Every time I was hurt by the horse,

274
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
he took a ring that was always with him

275
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
and told me to wear it

276
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,560
so that the daughter of the sea tiger wouldn't be angry.

277
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,560
He said that his ring could protect me.

278
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
I was safe.

279
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
I didn't cry.

280
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I just hated him.

281
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I thought why my aunt can't be like others' aunt?

282
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
I just wanted him to be in my heart

283
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,560
because I cared about your safety.

284
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Then I found out that he killed that horse.

285
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
But that time,

286
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I didn't get on the boat with him.

287
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
He went to Linan.

288
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,560
He went to Linan and died in the lake.

289
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,560
The daughter is my father's soft tears.

290
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Your father doesn't care about you.

291
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
He knows the seal is sealed on the sea.

292
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
He doesn't know if he can safely come back.

293
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,560
He just wants you to know

294
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
that even if you don't have a doctor,

295
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
you can live well by yourself.

296
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
But all these years,

297
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I've been in the river.

298
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I've been living by the river.

299
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
He's different from my father.

300
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
He's very considerate of me.

301
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
But all these years,

302
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
he gave me a wonderful life.

303
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
He changed my original appearance little by little.

304
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
It seemed like a knife

305
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
filled with a piece of jewelry

306
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
and left a gold on it.

307
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
But it was hidden in the bridge.

308
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
He slowly got angry.

309
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
I've lost my identity.

310
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
I have no money.

311
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
I've been running all the way to Chang'an.

312
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I can't do anything to my father.

313
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I can't do anything.

314
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Life is a real life.

315
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
A knife can only be re-changed

316
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,560
after a magic power.

317
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
You're the daughter of the sea fox.

318
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,560
The love of the sea

319
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,560
is the love of the sea.

320
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Shangguan,

321
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
I'll do something today.

322
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Have a good meal.

323
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
I'm leaving.

324
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
You're here so early.

325
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Your father has a job again.

326
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
He said he'd be a thief today.

327
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
I have to work for him now.

328
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Okay.

329
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Well.

330
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Shangguan is really...

331
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Good waiting, your Highness.

332
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,480
That's good.

333
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,200
How foolish.

334
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,360
viral.

335
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,920
Impressive.

336
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
Very effective.

337
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,160
We often think how quite Trang Anh can be.

338
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,080
Say what do you need?

339
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,040
I need positive government HTML.

340
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,400
So I can attract views from幾

341
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,120
Silver cooling extension project

342
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,480
I can let all the sheep

343
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,560
cooperate with the arrow.

344
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,680
So that the noble consort

345
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,960
can have the ceremony

346
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
on the birthday banquet.

347
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,040
There's not much time.

348
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,080
What are you waiting for?

349
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,480
Just go and talk.

350
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,360
Here.

351
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
First,

352
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,040
put these in the storage box.

353
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,120
Thank you.

354
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Thank you, Jianshi.

355
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
You've helped me a lot.

356
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,560
You're so talented.

357
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,160
You're so considerate.

358
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,880
I should support you.

359
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
The noble consort

360
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
can only have the polite fingers.

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,680
Who came up with this idea?

362
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
I wasarden of my and greater power

363
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,520
of Tang.

364
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,120
I was implicated and unmanable.

365
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
Tell me about this.

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,040
Are the kindness of Jianshi

367
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
the kind people always have?

368
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,920
No.

369
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,480
It's not

370
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
LAHT and UDT,

371
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,800
they are honorable-dasdqt

372
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,000
and maintain the house

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,000
on the Jiutianchang river

374
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,640
At that time, it's this kind of aura.

375
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,280
It's also good for those Lin Gang members to be able to see.

376
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,320
At that time, let me open my eyes and see what this Xian Li Zhi looks like.

377
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,360
I definitely won't forget the grace of seeing.

378
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,600
How come it came from Ling Nan Yu?

379
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,560
The one who wins is Ling Nan's Li Zhi.

380
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,680
That's wrong.

381
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,960
My Tai Hu Si is just a group of people.

382
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,440
What I received is all from the outside world.

383
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,040
I can't care about Ling Nan's matter.

384
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,320
Then...

385
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,480
Who am I looking for in Ling Nan's Li Zhi?

386
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,040
Four-fold Jin Xie should be the one who's hiding.

387
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,840
Five fingers!

388
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,920
Give me five.

389
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,880
Ten fingers!

390
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,040
Good.

391
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,480
出来!

392
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
I can't help you.

394
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,240
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,920
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,640
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,240
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,920
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,720
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,560
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
You followed me?

407
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
I'm here to protect you.

408
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,920
You're from Jiangsu?

409
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,360
I'm here to ask you to return to Lu Si Cheng.

410
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
I want to see him.

411
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
Tianwen, you want to see me?

412
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Lu Si Cheng.

413
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,080
Trust me.

414
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,880
Mr. Kong Lang has told you.

415
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm here to see you.

416
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,960
I want to express my feelings.

417
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,920
I'm here to help you.

418
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,280
I want to bring you-

419
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
the letter i take from the floor.

420
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,480
For the past few years,

421
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,440
I've used my했ry gate

422
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,160
to help me become a proper model

423
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,800
to thanked and respected people.

424
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,520
And the чудaly credited shopping mall.

425
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,600
The aftershadow of Lanling까지

426
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
is an instruction letter.

427
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,480
It's all a crime.

428
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,520
If the left side can be punished for the right side,

429
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
it will be a crime to kill the right side and He Yougong.

430
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,360
You don't have enough evidence.

431
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,400
Lu Si Cheng,

432
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,240
my father is a tiger that has been in the human world.

433
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,000
My mother used to be a businesswoman.

434
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,880
My words are not divided.

435
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,240
Besides, when He Yougong died,

436
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,840
I was also involved in it.

437
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,720
I gave up my life to save my life.

438
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,640
I believe it can prove that it can only work short.

439
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,640
Once you do as others say.

440
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,600
But we're going to...

441
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
deal with you.

442
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,000
And the right-handed man goes on being her brother.

443
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,280
Just kill him if you want to.

444
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,520
They won't just panel it.

445
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,160
If you exact the course of your life to the right,

446
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,520
the people of the court will believe you.

447
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,600
If you are being initiated,

448
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,760
if you are going to be library of the search force,

449
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm not trying to harm Youxiang.

450
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
It's our fault that he's ugly.

451
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,680
Even if I'm the one who's been

452
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,760
trying to harm Youxiang,

453
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
I won't force him to do it.

454
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
After he's gone,

455
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Noble Consort

456
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
will be on the side of the Saint's耳.

457
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
She'll be gone for a few days.

458
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
This matter

459
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
might be settled after 8 p.m.

460
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
I'm not even able to remember the last word.

461
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Then I'll come to Chang'an this time.

462
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I don't think you have any help.

463
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
To deal with Youxiang,

464
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
you need to be extremely careful.

465
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
You won't be able to keep him in a stable position.

466
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Xin, I'll take it.

467
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
After we wait for Mr. Kong Lang to get the evidence

468
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
in the south,

469
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
you'll be on the side of the Saint's耳.

470
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Then I'll have to wait

471
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
for him.

472
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Amita,

473
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
it's been years since we've been together.

474
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
We've been together for so long.

475
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
But

476
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
the punishment doesn't mean that we don't have any money.

477
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
We don't mind your sincerity,

478
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
but we want you to be patient.

479
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
It's been a while.

480
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
It's time for us to go to Chang'an.

481
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
How's Li Zhi's business?

482
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Is he doing well?

483
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
We'll keep him in a stable position

484
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
and keep him in a stable position.

485
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
And Mr. Kong Lang.

486
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Here, give me the money.

487
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Two cents.

488
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
I want Li Zhi from Chang'an.

489
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

490
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Who is he?

491
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

492
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Who is he?

493
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

494
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

495
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

496
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
What's the problem?

497
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

498
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

499
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

500
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Please have a taste.

501
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
It's delicious.

502
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
What is this?

503
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
It's so delicious.

504
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
This is what I've been dreaming about.

505
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Li Zhi from Chang'an.

506
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
That's right, Li Zhi.

507
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Here's for princess.

508
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Let's go.

509
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
We got to tell them where we are going to.

510
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Let's go.

511
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,580
Hey, don't mess around here.

512
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,560
It's not gonna work this time!

513
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
You say that too many times.

514
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,560
Bring someone with you who needs me.

515
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,380
Too many employees

516
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,560
and others for the day.

517
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
They're useless for the state.

518
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
It's not easy.

519
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Xu Jian.

520
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Luo Ping.

521
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Luo Ping.

522
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Liang Yuan.

523
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,560
I've heard that Chang'an has a job.

524
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I didn't expect that you are the one who is in charge of the unlucky job.

525
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Don't mention it.

526
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
How is it?

527
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Liang Yuan.

528
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
You are in the wrong place.

529
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,560
The savings you want is the money you want to transfer to the bank.

530
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,560
We left the money to collect it and not transfer it.

531
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
The money you want to transfer

532
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,560
is to go to the Ministry of War to find the Ministry of War.

533
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
The Ministry of War is not that good.

534
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
But the Ministry of War is in charge of the transportation.

535
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
The left-winged rat is in charge of the storage.

536
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
That should be taught by the old man.

537
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Can you...

538
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Liang Yuan.

539
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,560
The left-winged rat is indeed more suitable for the Ministry of War.

540
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
But...

541
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I'm just a little spy.

542
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,560
What I said to the old man is also our order.

543
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Yes.

544
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Can you let the order to help me put this stick in the ice?

545
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Well.

546
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
You can keep this stick.

547
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I'm going to put the money in front of our storage.

548
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I beg him to put this stick in the ice.

549
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Well, that's a big help.

550
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
It's a big help.

551
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
We have been together for three years.

552
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
You helped me a lot in the math.

553
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
You are good friends with me.

554
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
It's so great.

555
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
You know what I'm talking about?

556
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
It's a good thing that you are a good friend.

557
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
You are a good friend.

558
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:38,560
You don't know that I've been helping you for the past two days.

559
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Le Ping.

560
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm sorry for saving your life.

561
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Brother Liang Yuan, it's serious.

562
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I didn't know that he was your classmate.

563
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
If you want to know, you will have a good life.

564
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
No need.

565
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
It's just that we studied together for three years in math.

566
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
If it's really good,

567
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
he doesn't know that I'm in the storage.

568
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
You said you were going to help him put the stick in the ice.

569
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
But didn't you just deny him?

570
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
He is very narrow.

571
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
I don't mean that.

572
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
He can go.

573
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
It's obvious that he can't go.

574
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I'll just wait and see if he can get away with it.

575
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
I don't know if he will come again.

576
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
If he comes again,

577
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
you can tell him that the stick is on the ground.

578
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
We can't control it.

579
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
We can't control it.

580
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Brother Liang Yuan, why are you back?

581
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
I was passing by.

582
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
You were the one who got in.

583
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I just want to ask you one thing.

584
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
You know that I'm in a fight with God.

585
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Why are you still bothering me?

586
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Okay, I just want to ask you one thing.

587
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
You know that you are a dead man.

588
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
But you still want to ask me to help you put the stick in the ice.

589
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
You are in a fight with God.

590
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,560
I should be the one who is scolding you for your death.

591
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
You are in a fight with God.

592
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
You are in a fight with God.

593
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
You should be the one who is scolding you.

594
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
If you are scolding someone else,

595
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
you will be in a fight with God.

596
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
I won't blame you if you are scolding me.

597
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
It's a fair and fair game.

598
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
But you have to tell me the truth.

599
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
You know that I don't have time.

600
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
You are still bothering me.

601
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
You are not bothering me.

602
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
You are in a fight with God.

603
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
You still don't understand?

604
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
We are in a fight.

605
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
You are in a fight with God.

606
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
What is your own business?

607
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Do you have no idea what you are doing?

608
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Why should I do that?

609
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
You know that you are a dead man.

610
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
You still want to ask me to help you.

611
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Why should I help you put the stick in the ice?

612
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Because you taught me some math that year.

613
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
You are so good at math.

614
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Okay.

615
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Since you don't have the skills to do that,

616
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I will tell you the truth.

617
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Don't go to the ice.

618
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
It's not a game.

619
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Tell me the truth.

620
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
The gate of the ice is not even open.

621
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
You are so useless.

622
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
I will go to the ice myself.

623
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Stop.

624
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Do you have a blessing?

625
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
I have something to say to you.

626
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
The military is a big deal.

627
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
The one who has no blessing can't be killed.

628
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Hurry up.

629
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
I will cut the stick.

630
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
We are trying to save you.

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
We are trying to save you.

632
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
The general of the military

633
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
lost half of his life because of you.

634
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Get out of here.

635
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Don't block the gate.

636
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
You said that the past was not working.

637
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
They were not in a hurry.

638
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Now that they have the ability to transfer,

639
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
the future is not working.

640
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Why are they still

641
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
blind and blind?

642
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
You are so good at math.

643
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Even if it's for the sake of the people,

644
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,560
what can you do with that ordinary fear?

645
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
You have done what you have done.

646
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
If you can't do it,

647
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
what about them?

648
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
If you can't do it,

649
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
they can't break the relationship.

650
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
You are looking for the right person

651
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
to take the lead?

652
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
The four rooms are in the left.

653
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
We are not going to follow you.

654
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
You have to follow the right.

655
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Let's go.

656
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
The gate of the military department

657
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
is not even open.

658
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Get out of here.

659
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Get out of here.

660
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
What's wrong?

661
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
You are calling me a thief.

662
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I am also a man.

663
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I am still a man.

664
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I am not a man.

665
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Get out of here.

666
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Get out of here.

667
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Master, please let me go.

668
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Master, what happened?

669
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
You are the lawyer of the party.

670
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
The lawyer of the party

671
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
is the lawyer of the government.

672
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
You will be executed.

673
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
They...

674
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
They have already said it.

675
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
You are going to ask them,

676
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
are you the lawyer?

677
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Yes.

678
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Go back and tell the minister

679
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
that Li Zhi is in Chang'an.

680
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Yes.

681
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Xiu.

682
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
You really don't care about me?

683
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Come on.

684
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
Take a look.

685
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
You really don't care about me?

686
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Xiu.

687
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
Li Zhi Shi

688
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
is a man who

689
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
has been a lawyer for a long time.

690
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
He is a man who

691
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
has been a lawyer for a long time.

692
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
This Li Zhi Shi

693
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
is a beauty.

694
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
All the transfer officers

695
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
can't even look at him.

696
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Because they envy him

697
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
and that's why they are in this situation.

698
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I am so smart.

699
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I can't stand this.

700
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Why do they want to remember Li Zhi Shi?

701
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Ask your aunt.

702
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Who do you think the problem is

703
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
in the world?

704
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
Is it that the court

705
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
has to spend a lot of money

706
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
to do this for the people?

707
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
And the transfer

708
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
is getting farther and farther.

709
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
The cost is getting bigger.

710
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Do you think

711
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
the land of Tang

712
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
is even further

713
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
from the land of Lingnan?

714
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
That's true.

715
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
So I went to Lingnan

716
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
to give birth to Li Zhi.

717
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
The cost is the biggest.

718
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
The water is also the biggest.

719
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
That's why they are jealous.

720
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
In the past few days,

721
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I went to all the summer vacation places

722
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
to do some summer vacation.

723
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
But they didn't know me.

724
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
They told me everything.

725
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
But they said

726
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Li Zhi Shi from Lingnan

727
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
couldn't get pregnant.

728
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
My father's mission

729
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
was impossible.

730
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
I had to do the first one

731
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
to get Li Zhi back to Chang'an.

732
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Those people can't do it.

733
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Those people can't.

734
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
But my father is different.

735
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Because my father

736
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
is different.

737
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Smile.

738
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Uncle, did you lie to me?

739
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
No.

740
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Uncle, I have something to ask you.

741
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Will Ami stay in Chang'an forever?

742
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I don't know about that.

743
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
I haven't asked her yet.

744
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Will she stay

745
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
in the house

746
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
that we rented?

747
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
No.

748
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
If the house is in a bad mood,

749
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
she has to pay for it.

750
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Will she stay in our house?

751
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Why would she stay in our house?

752
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
How can we live in Chang'an?

753
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Uncle,

754
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
my aunt and Ami

755
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
are friends.

756
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
They are friends.

757
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
In your father's life,

758
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
you only think of your mother.

759
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
Only your mother

760
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
knows your aunt.

761
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
In the past,

762
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,560
my aunt was a village head.

763
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
She was so strange

764
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,560
that she was caught in a forest

765
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
and she was so noisy.

766
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
My aunt was a foreigner.

767
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Later,

768
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
we met your mother.

769
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
We moved here together.

770
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
My mother

771
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
planted the rose tree herself.

772
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
One day,

773
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
she went to college.

774
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
I said,

775
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
I said, this rose tree

776
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
can't live anymore.

777
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
But your mother

778
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
insisted on taking care of it,

779
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
making it edible.

780
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Your mother said,

781
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
she must live.

782
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Since the second year,

783
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
the rose tree was in the wild.

784
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Your mother said,

785
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,560
the flowers are so beautiful.

786
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
You treat them well.

787
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
They will repay you.

788
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
The rose has its own meaning.

789
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
It means that you are in a good relationship.

790
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Later, in Shangyi Village,

791
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
your aunt always makes these flowers.

792
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
She always thinks of your mother.

793
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,560
I don't know if I can make it.

794
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
So,

795
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
in this life,

796
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
your aunt is like

797
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
only your mother.

798
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I understand.

799
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Mr. Kong Lang,

800
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
isn't Mr. Kong Lang the mastermind?

801
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Don't you want to come to Mr. Kong Lang again?

802
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Isn't this a good way to go?

803
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Isn't it normal

804
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
to ask about the progress of the matter?

805
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
Mr. Kong Lang,

806
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
where are you going?

807
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
You are going to ask Mr. Kong Lang.

808
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Besides,

809
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
you have to ask Mr. Kong Lang

810
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
why he still wants to buy

811
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
the girl's shirt.

812
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
We can't control the procedure.

813
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
This is called etiquette.

814
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
I don't understand.

815
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
I think

816
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
it's Mr. Kong Lang who has been

817
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
a spy for many days.

818
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
He is very anxious.

819
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Gao,

820
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
since you were a child,

821
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
did anyone think about your dog mouth?

822
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
The new thing about the spy is the important thing.

823
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
There is no suspicion,

824
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
but the old and the new.

825
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Good job.

826
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Gao,

827
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
do you think

828
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
I am

829
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
very generous

830
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
and considerate?

831
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
I am very generous

832
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
and considerate.

833
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Come here.

834
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
I will kill you

835
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
if you keep learning.

836
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
Come.

837
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
I have news for you.

838
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
I know Mr. Kong Lang's rules.

839
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
He may do something.

840
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
But I am very anxious

841
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
about the blind date.

842
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
I hope

843
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Mr. Kong Lang

844
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,560
can do my business first.

845
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
It's a rule.

846
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Don't worry.

847
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,560
I will take the painting.

848
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Please go back.

849
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
I will take the painting.

850
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Please go back.

851
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
I will take the painting.

852
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Brother Wei.

853
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
Brother Wei.

854
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Why are you here?

855
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
I bought books at the bookstore.

856
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Didn't you come to buy books?

857
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
I bought books at the bookstore.

858
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
I didn't choose the middle one.

859
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
I thought about other books.

860
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Then

861
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
I will talk to you again.

862
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Goodbye.

863
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Where is he?

864
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Why are you back?

865
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
I didn't see the book

866
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
at the bookstore.

867
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
I came back to look for it.

868
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,560
I will accompany you.

869
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
What are you looking for?

870
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,560
I am looking for a book

871
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
called Red Garden of the South.

872
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
I will read it every day.

873
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I will pray for you.

874
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Brother Wei's right-hand man

875
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
is so loyal.

876
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
You are

877
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
a good girl

878
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
in this old play.

879
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Is there a girl

880
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
in the book called Red Garden of the South?

881
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
I misunderstood.

882
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
I used this fan

883
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
by myself.

884
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,560
Don't laugh.

885
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Look.

886
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
There is another round of this fan.

887
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
It's white.

888
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
When I was young,

889
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
I really wanted

890
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,560
to transfer my new history to you.

891
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
But in his hand,

892
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,560
it was called Red Garden of the South.

893
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,560
I heard that Li Shande is back.

894
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
Really?

895
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
How about

896
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
asking him to come

897
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
and return to the spiritual tree?

898
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
How is it?

899
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Good.

900
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,480
I am going to

901
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
pour your blood into a bottle.

902
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,560
Yes.

903
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,560
Ready.

904
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
ogeneously.

905
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,560
I am a man of my own.

906
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,560
I am a woman of my own.

907
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,560
I am a man of my own.

908
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,560
I am a man of my own.

909
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,560
I am a man of my own.

910
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,560
I am a woman of my own.

911
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,560
I am a woman of my own.

912
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,560
I am a man of my own.

913
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,560
I am a man of my own.

914
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:46,560
The Buddha is the Buddha, the Buddha is the Buddha, the Buddha is the Buddha.

915
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,560
The Buddha is the Buddha, the Buddha is the Buddha.

916
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:01,560
The Buddha is the Buddha, the Buddha is the Buddha, the Buddha is the Buddha.

917
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:21,560
Until the sunset, what do you do?

918
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,620
you
