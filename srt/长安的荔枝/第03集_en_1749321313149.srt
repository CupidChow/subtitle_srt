1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
The card pattern is for every million sharing

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,680
Money

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,780
First Dodo

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,020
Let's see

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,580
No Aurangida

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,700
Reimu

7
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:51,200
Logically speaking, the

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I don't know.

9
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
If the saint can be blamed,

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
the copper birds must be brainwashed.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
They are so scared that they can only save him.

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Why can only he save them?

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Look, he eats those flowers all day.

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
No one can save him in Shanglin.

15
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
He must be the first in the amusement park.

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,200
So, if he goes to the old Mudan,

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
he can't come to pick you up.

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
If he doesn't save Mudan,

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
the copper birds must be brainwashed.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Do you think he can save them?

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Did you save them?

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
He is so smart.

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
If he can save the copper birds,

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
they must be grateful to him.

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Of course.

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
If he can save them,

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
they must be grateful to him.

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Is it hot?

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Yes.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
It's hot.

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
We should buy a fan.

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
It's too hot here.

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I'll teach you a technique.

34
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
What are you doing?

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
You are a dog.

37
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
You are blind.

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
You don't know who you are.

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Why are you calling me a blind?

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm blind.

41
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
You are scolding others.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Fatty.

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Stop it.

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
You are still a dog.

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
This way.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm so hungry.

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I can't eat this.

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm going to drink water.

49
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
And I'll throw up the fried chicken.

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I think you are a good boy.

51
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
You are a good boy.

52
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm not a good boy.

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm a good boy.

54
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I think you are a good boy.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I think you are a good boy.

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I dare not.

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm the president of the good boy.

58
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
I'm Zhao Mingxin.

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm from Zixin.

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm a good boy.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm Ma Guiyun.

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm from Huixia.

63
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I'm a good boy.

64
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I'm a good boy.

65
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm a good boy.

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm a good boy.

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
I think you are a good boy.

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
All right.

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm an expert.

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I am a good boy.

71
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Good boy.

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Before I leave,

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Panbao gave me a letter.

74
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Let's see if you know.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
Look carefully, Brother Xie.

76
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Look carefully.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Don't be so weird.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
I don't believe you.

79
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,760
But the precepts can't be denied.

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,280
I have an appointment with Pan Bao.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
If he's willing to give someone's property,

82
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,080
he'll secretly

83
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,720
take a break.

84
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,560
In case...

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,760
Brother Gui, do you understand?

86
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,680
I do.

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,040
Brother Xie is so low-key.

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
Is this a fake?

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
Is it fake?

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
The truth is...

91
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
It's true.

92
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,240
It's a fake.

93
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,440
Why did Pan Bao come back with me?

94
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,720
And you took Brother Gui away?

95
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,520
The precepts say that

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,000
the matter of the Co-Priest

97
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,800
is a big deal.

98
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,000
You can't take it away.

99
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,440
Give me the property.

100
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
I'll come to Lingnan

101
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
and meet the Co-Priest in advance.

102
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I've never seen a co-priest.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
I've seen Brother Gui today.

104
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,880
It's like seeing a co-priest.

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm asking you, where's Pan Bao?

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,080
He's in the right-hand corner.

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
He gave me the property.

108
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
He asked me to bring it here.

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
Don't you understand?

110
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,640
I understand.

111
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
The precepts are so big.

112
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
There's a connection between the two sides.

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,000
It's natural.

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,760
So...

115
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,040
וצa,

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,520
do you have any skills

117
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,280
that will lead you to the next 23 years?

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,480
About actually needing them.

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
No!

120
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,140
Sims говорd like a thousand per

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,340
rate for it.

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
I need to hand this

123
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,920
to the leader.

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,440
I can't tell him.

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,260
How about

126
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I don't need to be so far away from here.

127
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
I understand.

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
But, He Ci Shi...

129
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
went out to look for a place to stay.

130
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
He hasn't come back yet.

131
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm not afraid to stay here for a few days.

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I'll be the first to enter the place.

133
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Since that's the case,

134
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
there's another thing I need to ask you

135
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
to tell He Ci Shi in advance.

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I'll follow your instructions.

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Shi Yao,

138
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
do you want to be the first to enter the place?

139
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
It's not the first.

140
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
It's a letter.

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,320
If He Ci Shi can write a letter to You Xiang personally,

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,320
then it will be a good cooperation.

143
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Is this a letter for the court or You Xiang?

144
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Of course, He Ci Shi is the center of the saint.

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Do You Xiang have any concerns about the sincerity of He Ci Shi?

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Well, Xing Ming,

147
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I'll tell you a story on Chang'an Hotel.

148
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,320
There's a official who needs to do a secret mission.

149
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
There are two people in charge.

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
One is Li Guo Gong,

151
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
the other is Fan Guo Cui.

152
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,320
What should we choose?

153
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
We should choose a criminal.

154
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
We have eight soldiers in our hands.

155
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
That's my intuition.

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I see.

157
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
What's on the top?

158
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm a small group of people who don't deserve to know.

159
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm told by the people,

160
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I'll change one letter to another.

161
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll change one letter to another.

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,320
The rumor that He You Guang has been in Chang'an for years.

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
He's so stupid and stupid.

164
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
He's in the fire of the fire.

165
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,320
It's been ten years since he's been in the military.

166
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Good news.

167
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Give it to me.

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Sister gave it to me immediately.

169
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
She said she'd hand it to me personally.

170
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
You should have told me earlier.

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
No, no, no.

172
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Don't worry.

173
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
She asked for it.

174
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
What?

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,320
You Xiang wanted you to write a letter to her.

176
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Then write it.

177
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
How could you say that?

178
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
This letter is not for the saint.

179
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
It's for You Xiang.

180
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
You'll have a real scar on your hand.

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
If someone sees this letter in the future,

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
he'll see it.

183
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
What's the point?

184
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
It's obvious.

185
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
We were just talking about You Xiang.

186
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
You're so stupid.

187
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
What's the difference?

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Two ministers are talking about the saint.

189
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
One minister is not the saint.

190
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
The other minister is the big problem.

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I think it's not that simple.

192
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
It's not that complicated.

193
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
It's not that simple.

194
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
It's not that complicated.

195
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
This letter is a common name.

196
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
After you hand this letter to her,

197
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
she'll feel relieved.

198
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
I'll feel relieved too.

199
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
If she's relieved, we'll all feel relieved.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
You can't be relieved.

201
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,320
She took this ice-cream suit and wrote it.

202
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I think it's about the rain.

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
What rain?

204
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
I've decided.

205
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
You can arrange it tonight.

206
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Give her the letter.

207
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Take the ice-cream suit back.

208
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
We've sent so many things.

209
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
She can't be sent away.

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
It's fair.

211
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I'm so worried.

212
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
This ice-cream suit is the best in the world.

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
That's right.

214
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Listen.

215
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
If we get the ice-cream suit,

216
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
I'll change the whole world

217
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
and replace the whole world.

218
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
After this, who can replace the man in the south?

219
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
The man in the south should be replaced by the man in the south.

220
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Old man

221
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,200
I'd like to have theThis is a temporary address.

222
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Your Highness,

223
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Four neuen rats tried to escape.

224
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,480
That's all.

225
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,280
Hahahahahahahahahah

226
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,380
hahahahahah

227
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,860
optics

228
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,720
Tape

229
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,420
Who the heck is this?

230
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,280
Here is the seal,

231
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,020
Phantom'sсть.

232
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,420
It's a вотcenerpori.

233
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,260
Here.

234
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,740
Zhao.

235
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,180
If I ask the teacher,

236
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
what's the zodiac sign?

237
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,460
It's YESSIR.

238
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,700
He stole the dog

239
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,900
and kidnapped him.

240
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,020
Right?

241
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,220
For thisWhom

242
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,860
I often know.

243
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,940
I've hadd the knowledge as well.

244
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,020
What do I know?

245
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,020
Okay.

246
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,420
I am here to take over the new position of the Holy Master.

247
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,420
I have the authority to do everything I can.

248
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Please help me with the operation.

249
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Don't say that.

250
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
You did a good job.

251
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
You are so good.

252
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Look at your position.

253
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
This time, you are cheating.

254
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
You are so lucky.

255
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
I am not cheating.

256
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I have the Holy Master's belt.

257
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
You can do this.

258
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
You can't do the belt?

259
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
No, I am not cheating.

260
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
You can send Han to the court to ask for evidence.

261
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
The Holy Master and the Holy Master

262
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
have the authority to do everything.

263
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
This is a good idea.

264
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
From here to Chang'an,

265
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
there are more than 5,000 miles.

266
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,420
I will be there tonight.

267
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
I will pass the transmission.

268
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
I guess I have to wait for the reply

269
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
after the operation.

270
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,420
About a month.

271
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
I will be there in a month.

272
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
I can't wait for more than a month.

273
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,420
I have to take the Holy Master's belt to Chang'an.

274
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
What is Chang'an?

275
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
You can't change.

276
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Go.

277
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
I...

278
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
No.

279
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I want to give you a lesson.

280
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,420
I can't look at you like this.

281
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Is the belt so good?

282
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
I am not cheating.

283
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
You are cheating.

284
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I am not cheating.

285
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,420
The door of the liar is not so low.

286
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
You have to work hard.

287
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
You have to be careful.

288
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
I am Zhang Kaihuai.

289
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
I can't cheat anyone.

290
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
But I can't let others

291
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
cheat like a fool.

292
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
Come.

293
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Give me the one from Chenjiang.

294
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
You are a magnet.

295
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
I am not a magnet.

296
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
What are you doing?

297
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
What are you doing?

298
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
You are a liar.

299
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
What are you doing?

300
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,420
Don't tell me.

301
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
I am not cheating.

302
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
I am not cheating.

303
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
Give me the belt.

304
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
You are a rabbit.

305
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
You are a magnet.

306
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
You are a liar.

307
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
I am not a liar.

308
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
I am really a liar.

309
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
I am a liar.

310
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
I am here to work.

311
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
What job do you have?

312
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
There is no idiot in the world.

313
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Who can think of such a stupid way

314
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
than the idiot?

315
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
What is that?

316
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
What?

317
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
You are a fool.

318
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
You are a fool.

319
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
You are so bold.

320
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
I am telling you.

321
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,420
Don't be a fool.

322
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
You are a fool.

323
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
You are a liar.

324
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,420
You are a liar.

325
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Wait a minute.

326
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Wait a minute.

327
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
Wait a minute.

328
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
This one.

329
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,420
This is the temperament of a saint.

330
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
But it is not the same as before.

331
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
In these years,

332
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
many things have been taken away.

333
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Will it be new?

334
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
It is not easy to say.

335
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
It is not easy to say.

336
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Give me the belt.

337
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Let me try.

338
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
The gift of the thousand miles

339
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
is the new one.

340
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
It is the old one.

341
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
It is the old one.

342
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
You have no evidence

343
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
to make me believe you.

344
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
What should I do?

345
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
I still have to pull you to the fish.

346
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Pull me out.

347
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
I know the treasure.

348
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
The treasure is you sent to the Chang'an, right?

349
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
You look like a little girl.

350
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
How do you know the treasure?

351
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,420
I am not familiar with it.

352
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,420
It is the silver tea.

353
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
I am familiar with it.

354
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
I have never seen it before.

355
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
I know it.

356
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
I have never seen it.

357
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
I have never seen it.

358
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
I know it.

359
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
It is the silver tea.

360
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
It is the silver tea.

361
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
It is in Chang'an.

362
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
It is in Chang'an.

363
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
How is it in Chang'an?

364
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Did Pan Bao

365
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
go to Chang'an

366
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
and give this

367
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,420
black tea to the emperor?

368
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Yes.

369
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
I sent this black tea to the emperor.

370
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
What does it have to do with Pan Bao?

371
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
He went to the amusement park

372
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
and collected the tea trees.

373
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Then he drank too much

374
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
in the nimbich.

375
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
He was drowned.

376
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
I saved him at first.

377
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Then I went to help him.

378
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,420
He fell into the water

379
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
when he came back.

380
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
He drank too much?

381
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Why did you drink too much?

382
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
He left a bottle of wine beside the pool.

383
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
A bottle of wine?

384
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Yes.

385
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
You didn't see him drinking

386
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,420
without your own eyes?

387
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
I didn't see you.

388
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,420
Now you should believe me.

389
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
And my wife

390
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
has been in the imperial court

391
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,420
in Lingnan.

392
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
You should know the truth.

393
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Lingnan imperial court.

394
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
Yuzheng.

395
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,420
To be honest,

396
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,420
it is not important

397
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
whether it is true or not.

398
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
If it is true,

399
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
I will kill you.

400
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
If it is true,

401
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,420
I will not send Li Zhi to Chang'an.

402
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
I will kill you.

403
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,420
Yes, Yuzheng.

404
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
I have experienced

405
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,420
the journey of the journey.

406
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
I will not cut Li Zhi's life

407
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,420
back to Chang'an.

408
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
But I was also punished

409
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
when I went back.

410
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
I was killed by you.

411
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
I was also killed by Wang.

412
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,420
I will not cut my family.

413
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,420
But

414
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,420
I will not kill you.

415
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Zexi.

416
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
Can I talk to you?

417
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
Zexi.

418
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Is the door open?

419
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
Ma Guanyin is not in my shoes.

420
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Maybe she left early.

421
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
Maybe

422
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
she is hiding something.

423
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Let me fix something.

424
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Don't worry.

425
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I can fix it.

426
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
You are that one?

427
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
What is that?

428
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,420
Li Zhi's...

429
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Li Zhi's...

430
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Is it like this?

431
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
About your matter,

432
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
I need to go to the police

433
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
and investigate.

434
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
I need some time.

435
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
You go back first.

436
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Director, director,

437
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
this is our own business.

438
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
I will go back first.

439
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Director, director,

440
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
this is our own business.

441
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Please go back first.

442
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
Okay.

443
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Sir, please go to Mr. Kong Lang

444
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,420
and investigate Ma Guiyin.

445
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
I didn't expect

446
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
the person who sent the message

447
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
would be here so soon.

448
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Get out of the way.

449
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Get out of the way.

450
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Get out of the way.

451
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
He Ci Shi said

452
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
he would verify my identity.

453
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
He is giving me a painting.

454
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
He Ci Shi is busy with his business.

455
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
He can't handle your matter so soon.

456
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
You,

457
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
come again.

458
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
No, no, director,

459
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
look,

460
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
it's late.

461
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I don't have a place to stay.

462
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Can you

463
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,420
ask Mr. Zhao

464
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
to provide me a place to stay?

465
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Mr. Zhao,

466
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
go to Qi Feng Pavilion to drink.

467
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,420
No, no, no.

468
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Well,

469
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Qi Feng Pavilion, how can I go?

470
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Lan Yu,

471
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
I've met Mr. Ma.

472
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
Lan Yu?

473
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I've heard that

474
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420
Mr. Ma is a great figure

475
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,420
who is a great figure.

476
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,420
I didn't expect that he is so elegant.

477
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
He is indeed a young and talented

478
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
and rich man.

479
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Mr. Ma comes from Chang'an.

480
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,420
How is Chang'an

481
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
more than a man?

482
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
Chang'an

483
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,420
is the world's first city in the world.

484
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Light is as bright as fire,

485
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,420
fire is as bright as clouds,

486
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
wine is as bright as water,

487
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
art is as bright as the rain.

488
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
The palace in the world

489
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,420
is just like that.

490
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
Then,

491
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
if we are in Chang'an,

492
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
we will be happy.

493
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
I'm so envious of

494
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,420
the beauty of Pan Bao.

495
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Pan Bao,

496
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
I've come to Qi Feng Pavilion

497
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
to meet the famous people here.

498
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
The girls know him.

499
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,420
Do you know Mr. Ma?

500
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Yes.

501
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,420
I've had a few drinks

502
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,420
in Chang'an.

503
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
I like it.

504
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
I've got an old wound on my arm.

505
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,420
I've never drunk in Li Nan.

506
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
It seems that Chang'an is a real man.

507
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
I'm fine now.

508
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
Yes.

509
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
He doesn't drink.

510
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
It's useless.

511
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,420
He's a master of the three-way street.

512
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
It's useless.

513
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Because in Chang'an,

514
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
there's a job called

515
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
the wine market.

516
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
No one can escape

517
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
from his wine market.

518
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
Anyone.

519
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
The two-way street is very...

520
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
Mr. Ma,

521
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
how many days

522
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
have you been away

523
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
from the market?

524
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
I've been away.

525
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
We've been away

526
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
for almost 25 days.

527
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
You're right.

528
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
I've just received a message.

529
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
26 days ago,

530
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Pan Bao died

531
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
in Chang'an's garden.

532
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,420
26 days ago,

533
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
Pan Bao died.

534
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
I have no news.

535
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Who told you?

536
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
A...

537
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Li Jun Shi from Chang'an.

538
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
It seems that

539
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
Mr. Zhao

540
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
would rather believe

541
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
a person who is not clear about the origin

542
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
than believe

543
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
a person who is the one

544
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,420
who has the right to believe.

545
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Of course, I respect the right.

546
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
But I have a question.

547
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Why does the right

548
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,420
have to be this little thing?

549
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
This is the enemy's hand

550
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
and it's a threat to us

551
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
and the right.

552
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
Mr. Zhao says that

553
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
every word is a guess.

554
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
I don't have to explain too much.

555
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
It seems that

556
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
this leader doesn't welcome me.

557
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
What did Mr. Ma say?

558
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,420
I'll go back to Chang'an.

559
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Take this military uniform

560
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
to Chang'an.

561
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Mr. Ma.

562
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Don't be so impulsive.

563
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
You are too anxious.

564
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
You are just joking.

565
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
I don't believe you.

566
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,420
The leader is far from Chang'an.

567
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
The news is not good.

568
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
We don't know

569
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
how to move in the court.

570
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
We have to do something for He Zixuan.

571
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,420
We have to explain these questions to him.

572
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
Please.

573
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
Mr. Gui.

574
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Excuse me.

575
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,420
The joke of the leader is very serious.

576
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
We can't use it for a few days.

577
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
The truth will come out.

578
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
Don't touch my shoes.

579
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Don't touch.

580
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
Put them down.

581
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
Don't touch me.

582
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Don't touch me.

583
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Don't touch me.

584
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Don't touch me.

585
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
Stop.

586
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Stop.

587
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
If I were you,

588
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
I would leave quickly.

589
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Who are you?

590
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Tang Lv.

591
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
He is a leader of the Dou'ou people.

592
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
He has 40 soldiers.

593
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
He is a corrupt man.

594
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
He is a corrupt man.

595
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
He has a long-term position.

596
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
If you five

597
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
have a full-fledged army,

598
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
you will have 200 soldiers.

599
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,420
The corrupt man's wealth is 300.

600
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
Miss, how much is your salary?

601
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
It's...

602
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
15 silver per pound.

603
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
40 gold per pound.

604
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
15 silver per pound.

605
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
40 gold per pound.

606
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
80 gold per pound.

607
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
The total is 200 silver per pound.

608
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,420
The long-term position is 400 silver per pound.

609
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,420
You five have 480 silver per pound.

610
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,420
Anyway, I have a clear account for you.

611
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
You can think about it.

612
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Thank you.

613
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
Is this the first leaf you just picked?

614
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Yes.

615
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,420
It's the new leaf.

616
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
The leaf is only available in April.

617
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
It's the early leaf.

618
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
It's called the third leaf.

619
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
What's the taste?

620
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,420
It's...

621
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
It's...

622
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,420
It's the first leaf in April.

623
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
It's the first leaf.

624
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,420
How's the taste?

625
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
It's not good. It's too sour.

626
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
We drink it like this.

627
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
So it's very cheap.

628
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Then...

629
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
the third leaf can only last for three days.

630
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
But we have a secret recipe.

631
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
It can be stored longer.

632
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
What secret recipe?

633
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Don't take it out.

634
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
Here.

635
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
Give me a third leaf.

636
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
I helped you just now.

637
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Can you be cheaper?

638
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
I'll give you a discount.

639
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
I don't owe you a favor.

640
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,420
Thank you for helping me.

641
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Then...

642
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
please be less.

643
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
They are already starting to doubt me.

644
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
I can't get this leaf.

645
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
What should we do?

646
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
It's okay.

647
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
It's all right.

648
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Where did you get this?

649
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,420
It's a big deal.

650
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
I'm here to see you.

651
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Come with me.

652
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Li Shande.

653
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
Did you see it?

654
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Is it him?

655
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Qi Lang, you must be drunk.

656
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
Uncle Zhao.

657
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
Why are you here?

658
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
The patient said you were here.

659
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
I brought you some new recipes.

660
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
I'm not a man.

661
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
Why should I try new recipes?

662
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,420
You're a student.

663
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
But...

664
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
the students of Chang'an didn't eat me.

665
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
You'll be talking about your business tomorrow.

666
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Today, I want to ask you to go back to your friend.

667
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Go back to your friend.

668
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
I can't go back.

669
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
I can't live here.

670
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
I'll wait for you here.

671
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
You're so small.

672
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
I can't.

673
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
I can't.

674
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
Wait.

675
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
No.

676
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
This...

677
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Peace.

678
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
Peace?

679
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
I'm in a good mood.

680
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Why are you here?

681
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm talking about the long story.

682
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
I'm going to find you.

683
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
Peace.

684
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Peace to you.

685
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Peace to me.

686
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Peace to myself.

687
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
I didn't expect that.

688
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
He's so stubborn.

689
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
I have important things to talk about with Mr. Zhao.

690
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
Yes.

691
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
You're going to talk about the long story.

692
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
We'll talk about it later.

693
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Go back to your friend.

694
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Mr. Zhao.

695
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Peace.

696
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Chang'an is in a big trouble now.

697
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Chang'an is a popular place.

698
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Peace is just a kind of...

699
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
a way of life.

700
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
It's all a big trouble.

701
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
You know him.

702
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
What's he doing?

703
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
What's he doing?

704
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
He's called...

705
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Li Shande.

706
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
He's the monitor of the Shaolin Bureau.

707
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
He sent him to Linnan.

708
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
Maybe it's...

709
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
the meaning of the saint.

710
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
No.

711
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
There are too many lies now.

712
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,420
We're all in a big trouble.

713
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,420
There are many lies in Chang'an.

714
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Really?

715
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
I'm the hero of the little brother.

716
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Someone's going to lie to me.

717
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
Last month,

718
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
a distant relative

719
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
just lied to me for 200,000 yuan.

720
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
I'm not taking the money.

721
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,420
Drink some wine.

722
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,420
Drink some wine.

723
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Come on.

724
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
It hurts.

725
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
It hurts.

726
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
It hurts.

727
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
You're wrong, Mr. Zhao.

728
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Let me go first.

729
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
No.

730
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Why are you here?

731
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
I'll talk about it later.

732
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
Where are you going?

733
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,420
I don't have a place to live.

734
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
I have to wait for Mr. Zhao

735
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
to arrange a place for me.

736
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
You can live in our place.

737
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Mr. Zhao, you can't bother me.

738
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
I'll leave.

739
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
I'll leave.

740
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
Mr. Zhao hasn't eaten yet, right?

741
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Let's go.

742
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Here you are.

743
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
I'll go back to my room.

744
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Mr. Zhao,

745
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
it's easy to eat

746
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
when you're hungry.

747
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
You're so sweet.

748
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
I'm not.

749
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
I'm just a little bit hungry.

750
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
I'm not hungry.

751
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
I'm just a little bit hungry.

752
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Here you are.

753
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Qi Lang.

754
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Ping An.

755
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Li Shande.

756
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Come in.

757
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Li Shande.

758
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
I'm back.

759
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
When was the time for you to get up?

760
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Before you left Chang'an,

761
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
I was calculated.

762
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
I took the hot-blooded rain.

763
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
What about the embroidery?

764
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,420
I wanted to entrust it to you.

765
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
But you left.

766
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
I could only entrust it to Xiu Fang.

767
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Xiu Fang?

768
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
You're really good, Li Shande.

769
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,420
You're really good.

770
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
You're really good.

771
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
You're from the south.

772
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,420
Why did you mention Pan Ba?

773
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Why did you mention him?

774
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I didn't mention He Yougwang.

775
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
He didn't believe me.

776
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
He said he wanted to

777
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
put me in the river

778
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
and go to the river.

779
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
You really know He Yougwang?

780
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Yes. I haven't asked him about Ping An.

781
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
Why did you come to Lingnan?

782
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,420
It doesn't matter.

783
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
You just remember.

784
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
I don't call him Zheng Ping An.

785
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
I'm Ma Guiyun.

786
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Ma who?

787
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Ma Guiyun?

788
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Ma.

789
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Who's Ma Guiyun?

790
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Me?

791
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
You're not Zheng Ping An?

792
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Ma Guiyun?

793
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
It's a big deal.

794
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
It's a big deal.

795
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
You even talked to me.

796
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
But Ping An,

797
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,620
you were officially

798
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,420
expelled.

799
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
But why did you come to Lingnan?

800
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
You're a Ma... Ma... Ma... Ma...

801
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
Ma... Ma... Ma... Ma...

802
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,420
Why are they from the south?

803
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
You're drunk.

804
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,420
Your sister is not here.

805
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
I have to take care of you.

806
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
Shut up.

807
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
You even have the face to listen to my sister.

808
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,420
My sister is with you.

809
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,420
My sister is dead.

810
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
Xiu and you

811
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
have been together for so long.

812
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,420
I don't know.

813
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
You've been with me for thousands of miles.

814
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
You want to kill me for Zheng, right?

815
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
Yes.

816
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
You want to kill me for Zheng?

817
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
You...

818
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,420
You're a wretch.

819
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
You said that and you hurt him.

820
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,420
Shouldn't I hurt you?

821
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
Why should I hurt him?

822
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
I...

823
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
From now on,

824
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
I'll be my official guide.

825
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,420
You'll be your only bridge.

826
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
Come here.

827
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,420
Why did you call me Ma Guiyun?

828
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,420
Get lost!

829
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,420
Get lost!

830
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
You can just call me Ma Guiyun.

831
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,420
And you're afraid of me.

832
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Why?

833
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I'm afraid of you.

834
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
Why are you afraid of me?

835
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
Why am I afraid of you?

836
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Get out.

837
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Get out.

838
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,420
Get lost.

839
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
I'm sick, Zhan Shen.

840
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
I'm so lucky.

841
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
Get lost.

842
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,420
Get lost.

843
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Get lost.

844
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,420
Are you crazy?

845
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

846
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,420
Get lost.

847
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,420
I'm scared.

848
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
Is he staying here?

849
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Who can arrange it?

850
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
Wu Yue said he's not in love.

851
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
He can hang up.

852
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Who's hanging up?

853
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,420
Who's hanging up?

854
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Okay.

855
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Really?

856
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
You're out of your mind.

857
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
You've been out of your mind for so many years.

858
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
How dare you call me out?

859
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
I'll see who's next.

860
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,820
You will walk and hear the interns bootk begging for Said Kuomintang.

861
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,260
Grandsire, do you have any software you'd like to learn?

862
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,860
Why don't you lend me one,

863
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,420
one that I can learn from?

864
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,260
I got an escape sit-up.

865
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,540
It seems that I'll need them.

866
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,260
Is it a��는 choice?

867
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,240
you'm surprised at me anyways.

868
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,340
Me eitherätterd it w或者

869
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm fine.

870
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,880
That's all.

871
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,380
Quite inriaif.

872
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,140
You're too blind.

873
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,940
So you're glooooool.

874
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,260
Stop compiling what we saidprü-

875
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,980
I'm out.

876
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,040
What about you?

877
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,880
I can't think of any flow,

878
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,040
yet I just stepped stj.

879
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,660
Hold on.

880
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,660
The result was revealed when it was just arrived.

881
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,660
You... all know?

882
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,660
The left-hand man thought he would choose a skilled man.

883
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,660
Even if he didn't have the opportunity, he should at least be smart.

884
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,660
I didn't expect him to be a fool.

885
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Let me remind you. I'm in charge of completing the task for you.

886
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,660
If you fail, I won't let you leave Linan City.

887
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Thank you for your honesty.

888
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Although I'm not capable of sending Wuji,

889
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,660
I will use my life to fight for it.

890
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,660
I can't help but to cool down the hot blood.

891
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,660
I will follow you.

892
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,660
I can prove to the Cishifu that you are Ma Guiyun.

893
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,660
But I still have to rely on myself to get their trust.

894
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,660
They had already believed me.

895
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,660
They suddenly caused a green stone to reveal the death of Pan Bao.

896
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
They made them suspect me.

897
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Then you just have to prove that Li Zhishi is lying.

898
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,660
That will solve the problem.

899
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Li Zhishi is very smart.

900
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
If I say he is lying,

901
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,660
he will think of all the ways to lie to me.

902
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,660
And he knows me.

903
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,660
He knows I'm not Ma Guiyun.

904
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
It's better to know the truth.

905
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,660
Let him join the fire to help you.

906
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:54,660
I have a special relationship with him.

907
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,660
It's not that special.

908
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,660
I just don't want to be entangled with him.

909
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,660
It's not that kind of entanglement.

910
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
It's my...

911
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,660
You don't have to explain it to me.

912
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,660
If you can't even deal with a small Li Zhishi,

913
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,660
how can you deal with He Youguang?

914
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
Ma Guiyun wants to leave?

915
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Who knows who Ma Guiyun is?

916
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
You can still live for four months.

917
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Do you know who Ma Guiyun is?

918
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
You can live for four hours.

919
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,660
I'm a dead man.

920
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
I'm not afraid of death.

921
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Mr. Zhao,

922
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,660
I'm here to tell you something.

923
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
A leftist is deceiving.

924
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
He said he was a rightist.

925
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
He killed the king.

926
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,660
Brother Guiyun,

927
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,660
you don't know who he is.

928
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,660
I'm a rightist.

929
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,660
I'm a dead man.

930
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
I'm a rightist.

931
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,660
I'm a rightist.

932
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,660
I'm a rightist.

933
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm a rightist.

934
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
I'm a rightist.

935
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm a rightist.

936
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,660
I'm a rightist.

937
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I'm a rightist.

938
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
I'm a rightist.

939
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,660
I'm a rightist.

940
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm a rightist.

941
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,660
I'm a rightist.

942
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,660
I'm a rightist.

943
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
I'm a leftist.

944
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,660
He went to see the King of the Fox.

945
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,660
And he followed his son to the imperTIA with his hand.

946
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
Why did he die?

947
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,660
I was afraid no one else could defeat him.

948
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,660
I was afraid the Lord could kill me for it.

949
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
He became a threat.

950
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,660
He came down the tower to make the king escape.

951
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,660
But I was afraid he would be scared.

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,660
So I gave up my life for it.

953
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:41,160
Before I want to be heartless

954
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:51,160
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit

955
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,880
a little bit

956
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,480
I am hard to seem

957
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,160
to be

958
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:19,760
ación

959
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,320
come

960
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Wait forada

961
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,840
He has other
