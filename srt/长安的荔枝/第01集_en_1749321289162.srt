00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
A

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
The Beauty of compromise

3
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,100
Episode 1

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on, jump out of the net

5
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,420
Nemехats

6
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,740
For whom

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can blow up a flower with a raincoat.

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're a mother.

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You'll be short if you fall.

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not easy to live in winter last year.

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This time, I was so confused.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I didn't get hurt.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll use wood sticks first.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then I'll use yellow mud to remove the wound.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I should be able to survive.

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You have to push the flower to the back.

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
After all, it's hurt.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's itchy.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As the saying goes, the most favorite wood stick of the holy man

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
must be removed by hand.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've seen wood sticks in three different directions.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's really hard to get rid of it.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's too late.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:53,380
은 정도 pero

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
Alright.

26
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
These little things

27
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,720
can't come to you.

28
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,620
Idiots

29
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,720
To kill them.

30
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Insert your weight on us.

31
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,760
Uncle Valbergine, go!

32
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,480
Do it, sir!

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,960
Go, go, go!

34
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,960
Liu Shiliang?

35
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,280
Liu Shiliang?

36
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,800
Liu Shiliang?

37
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,000
This...

38
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
Isn't this a joke?

39
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,080
You...

40
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,400
This...

41
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,520
This is...

42
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,000
Who died?

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,640
Who died?

44
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,280
Shunyan.

45
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,560
The order

46
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
was to transfer a circle to the inside.

47
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,240
And finally, we were sent to Lin's Mansion.

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,280
We didn't leave the house.

49
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
From Lingnan,

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
we went back to Chang'an with the address.

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
Even if Mingzhi is Cui Mingfu,

52
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
someone has to pick him up.

53
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,480
With your help,

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
we will get this place back to Lengzi.

55
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,920
You have the arrangement.

56
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Yes.

57
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
I'll make it.

58
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,200
Leng Z decentralized in our world.

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:53,380
We live together

60
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,060
even when the neither of us sign了 a agreement

61
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,060
How can I win, Commander?

62
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,060
Commander! Commander!

63
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
Commander, I bought it with my own money.

64
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,060
I have a key.

65
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Don't you remember?

66
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
You are busy with your work.

67
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,060
You are responsible for all the household chores.

68
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,060
I have to stay and help you.

69
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Commander Liu,

70
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,060
I have to work for the people.

71
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,060
I am afraid that I can't do enough.

72
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Commander,

73
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I am not responsible for all the household chores.

74
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,060
I am a senior.

75
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
I can't let anyone do this.

76
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,060
I will never fight for everyone.

77
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Commander,

78
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,060
I am afraid that I will be in trouble.

79
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,060
I will be in trouble after I arrive in the south.

80
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,060
I am afraid that I will be in trouble.

81
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,060
I am afraid that you will be in trouble.

82
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,060
I can't do this.

83
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
I am sorry.

84
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
You all are pushing.

85
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Do you want me to go?

86
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
No.

87
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
Commander,

88
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,060
look,

89
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,060
we are not sure about this.

90
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
Yes.

91
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Li Shande?

92
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Master.

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
Master.

94
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
You are Arang. Get up.

95
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Get up. Please wait.

96
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Get up.

97
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
You are here.

98
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Get up.

99
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
You are so aggressive.

100
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
You called me this morning.

101
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Who told you to call birds?

102
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
You can't sleep without a shadow.

103
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Uncle.

104
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Uncle.

105
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Uncle, you are here.

106
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,060
Did you eat the food?

107
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
No.

108
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,060
Not yet?

109
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
No.

110
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
I was hungry just now.

111
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,060
Go and buy a bottle for you.

112
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,060
Go.

113
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,060
Bye.

114
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Don't run away.

115
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
I am still uncle.

116
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Did you see the house?

117
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Yes.

118
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I saw it.

119
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
I saw it.

120
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
I saw my own house.

121
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
My own house.

122
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,060
That was my sister's house.

123
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,060
I bought medicine for my sister.

124
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
I made a house.

125
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
My sister's life is not saved.

126
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,060
I worked hard to make a house with you.

127
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,060
Now someone wants to sell it.

128
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,060
Sell it back.

129
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Yes.

130
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
I didn't say I wouldn't sell it.

131
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
What price did you get?

132
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
I don't know about the price.

133
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,060
I don't know about the price.

134
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
I just bought the house.

135
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
I made a mistake.

136
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
I made a mistake.

137
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
I made a mistake.

138
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Look at the price.

139
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,060
It's broken.

140
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,060
I was so angry.

141
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,060
I made a price of 300 yuan.

142
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
It's the same price as my price.

143
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Don't hesitate.

144
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
It's not just your wish.

145
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
You can get a job in the future.

146
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,060
You can't lose your chance.

147
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,060
If you say so,

148
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,060
I have to make a move.

149
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,060
I mean,

150
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
I don't have enough money.

151
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
How much?

152
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
I have 130 yuan.

153
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
300 yuan in total.

154
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
You have 130 yuan.

155
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
I...

156
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Ping An.

157
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
You don't have enough money.

158
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
You don't have enough money.

159
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,060
Li Shande.

160
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,060
You've been in Chang'an for over 10 years.

161
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,060
You can't get there.

162
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
You can't get there.

163
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
You can only get the flowers.

164
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
The gold in the flowers.

165
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
The silver in the grass.

166
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,060
You're so shameless.

167
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
You have to drink with your colleagues.

168
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
You're so...

169
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
I don't know how to get there.

170
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,060
He Guang.

171
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,060
Ping An.

172
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,060
You're so...

173
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,060
You're so...

174
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
What do you mean?

175
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
It doesn't look like I'm going to get there.

176
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Even if I can get out of there,

177
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,060
I can't just give the money to you.

178
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Forget it.

179
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
Come back.

180
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
I told you.

181
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
You can't lose your chance.

182
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
Yes.

183
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
How about this?

184
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
You go to Ping An's house to find Shi Xinniang.

185
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I'll make sure of it.

186
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
I'll borrow it from him.

187
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
You're so nice to me.

188
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,060
This house is worth 300 yuan.

189
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,060
According to the rules of the market,

190
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,060
he can borrow 150 yuan from me.

191
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
I'm not that bad, am I?

192
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Find your close friend to lend you some money.

193
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
My close friend, Xi Ru.

194
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
Right?

195
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
I'll make sure of it.

196
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
I'll lend you money.

197
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
The house will be yours.

198
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,060
Why are you so upset?

199
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,060
We're the ones who owe you.

200
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
If my sister hadn't been married,

201
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
how could she have married you?

202
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
Shi Ru is back.

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
She's back.

204
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,060
Come back.

205
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Is it good, Xia Er?

206
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Yes.

207
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
You want one too?

208
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
Here, take it.

209
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
Eat more.

210
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
This is good for you.

211
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Look at you.

212
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
I can see how good you are.

213
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Thank you, Ping An.

214
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Thank you, Ping An.

215
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,060
I've prepared two pieces of the lentils.

216
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,060
Okay, I'll go with Xiu.

217
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
See you.

218
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,060
See you.

219
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
See you.

220
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Go in.

221
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,060
When did he write this?

222
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,060
How did he know I would lend it to him?

223
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
You, get out of the way!

224
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Didn't I give you money?

225
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
What else?

226
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
Come here.

227
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
This is the debt of the Zheng Lang Jun.

228
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,060
Yes.

229
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,060
Go in.

230
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
Mr. Ru.

231
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
I remember

232
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,060
that you have a brother and sister.

233
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Now, you're in the house of your father,

234
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,060
and you're in the house of your father.

235
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Is that how you live?

236
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Yes.

237
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
If you have any idea,

238
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
just tell me.

239
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
I'll do my best.

240
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
I'll do my best.

241
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,060
Although he doesn't have the right to do his job,

242
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
he can't do his job well.

243
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
Although Li Sheng Ge

244
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
has lived in the Miao Mu Flower Plant,

245
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
he has also delayed the reason

246
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,060
for not buying the plants in the future.

247
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
He has turned our Shang Ling tree

248
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
into a pond of dead water.

249
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Dead water?

250
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
Mr. Liu, have you thought about it?

251
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Even though he's gone,

252
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
no one can do what he did.

253
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,060
But without him,

254
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
we don't have that much work.

255
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,060
My money is finally enough.

256
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,060
I and Xiu can also move back to the old house.

257
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,060
The Miao Mu Flower Plant you planted

258
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,060
in the yard has already been crying.

259
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
But it's okay.

260
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
I'll plant another one.

261
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,060
By August,

262
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,060
I'll buy a new one.

263
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
I'll personally give it to you.

264
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Just like you have always been with us.

265
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
In the future,

266
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
we'll be with you every day.

267
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,640
Kunual San

268
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
Good luck to you.

269
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,980
25 weights, only contains two apples.

270
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,540
Seventeen dollars!

271
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,820
The total number of the盒.

272
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,800
Seventeen and two whole.

273
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,220
for me.

274
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,740
The傭人 have left L Ajaskini quite a few years ago

275
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,900
showing only what he is worth by noticing

276
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,020
The coins he get

277
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,080
came from theział in his palm

278
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,600
With his trust in the units

279
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
his heir have greater stays

280
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,360
He's a master chef who Serves well.

281
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,720
This year, He recognized you

282
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,320
for marveling at the Flippa.

283
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,700
Nuo JiaJiu grew up in Pingkang.

284
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,920
Although he experienced logicalКАW at legacy lessons,

285
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,300
the fashion and character

286
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,120
was extraordinary.

287
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,680
Let us take action in this life.

288
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,480
�

289
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,940
adjustments

290
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,340
This is the Oinois Minister...

291
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,720
Soldiers from arriving we don't want to spread ourachelors

292
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,780
So I will write a guarantee

293
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
I will write a report as soon as possible

294
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,140
The serial number is probably 151

295
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,940
The monthly report is 4 years and 7 minutes

296
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,080
That's 294

297
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,480
How did the title say

298
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:28,280
3200

299
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,640
3280

300
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:36,660
3280

301
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,220
Have a good lots of money

302
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,000
But you revoke it

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
I can get the money back in half a day.

304
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,640
I'm a source of money.

305
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,840
I can get the money back.

306
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,680
I won't make a mistake.

307
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
I should be tied up.

308
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,200
I didn't expect that

309
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,920
the brother-in-law of the official wolf

310
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
is a genius.

311
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,920
When I came in,

312
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,760
I realized you were not ordinary.

313
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,680
Let's talk about the official thing.

314
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,000
You...

315
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,880
Talk about the official thing.

316
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,800
But Xia Yan is wrong.

317
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,480
After you've changed your face,

318
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,960
do you want him to choose a new shirt?

319
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,360
Congratulations, capacity- parent of a board.

320
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,700
Nice to meet you.

321
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,160
You never rush to do business.

322
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,040
You are indulging yourself in buying land?

323
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,840
You heard that a晶 is being used in a normal shop.

324
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,680
Really poor,

325
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I didn't realize

326
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,040
The bird's nest is on fire and sold the house.

327
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
The holy man has the power.

328
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Yes.

329
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
It's the glory of our Holy Spirit.

330
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,040
We must pay attention to the importance of holy grace.

331
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
We need to choose the most virtuous and virtuous.

332
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Everyone here, do you have any opinions?

333
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
We all want to see the Holy Spirit.

334
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Mr. Li, Mr. Li.

335
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Mr. Li.

336
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Here you are.

337
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Liang Yuan.

338
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Come on.

339
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I have something to ask you.

340
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Come on.

341
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Come on.

342
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Let's eat together.

343
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
No, no, no.

344
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I have to pick up the kid and go down the school.

345
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Come on.

346
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
I have something to ask you.

347
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Come on.

348
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Come on.

349
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Come on.

350
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Come on.

351
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
No, no.

352
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
I'm going back to the house to cook.

353
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Come on.

354
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I have something to ask you.

355
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Come on.

356
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
I'll cook.

357
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Sit.

358
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Come on.

359
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Sit down.

360
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Sit down.

361
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Thank you, Mr. Li.

362
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Let's have a drink first.

363
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Okay.

364
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Come on.

365
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Come on.

366
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Liang Yuan, have a taste first.

367
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
If you have something to ask, let's have a bite.

368
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Have a taste.

369
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Try it.

370
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
How does it taste?

371
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
It's refreshing.

372
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Come on.

373
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Mr. Li, you usually act like a professional.

374
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Help everyone solve the problem.

375
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Tell us what is the purpose of the juice?

376
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
It's a fruit.

377
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
It's a fruit.

378
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
It's a red skin.

379
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
It's like a paper.

380
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
It's a long-lasting product.

381
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
It's in the middle of the spring.

382
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
It's a five-month tree.

383
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
It's perfect for this taste.

384
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,040
But it's easy to break and not preserve.

385
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,040
It's a three-day fruit that has changed color and fragrance.

386
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
I haven't eaten it yet.

387
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Liang Yuan has seen it before.

388
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Come on.

389
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Come on.

390
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Come on.

391
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Liang Yuan,

392
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
according to you,

393
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,040
there is no way to eat in Chang'an.

394
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
No.

395
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
When we were in the Han Dynasty,

396
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
there was a service office in Chang'an.

397
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
There were various types of plants planted in it.

398
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
There was this tree in it.

399
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,040
But because the temperature difference in the south and the north is large,

400
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
the plant is hard to pick,

401
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
so it didn't work at the end.

402
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
What if we want to eat this juice?

403
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
It's easy.

404
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Take some fruit and use honey to make a fruit.

405
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
This is called juice.

406
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
But the taste of this juice

407
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
is not good.

408
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
It's a raw fish.

409
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
It's a raw fish.

410
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
It's a vegetable.

411
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
It's a vegetable.

412
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
It's a vegetable.

413
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
It's a vegetable.

414
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
It's a vegetable.

415
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
It's Liang Yuan.

416
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
It's a lot of vegetables.

417
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Yes.

418
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Liang Yuan,

419
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
you are really lucky today.

420
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,040
There is a job in Shanglin.

421
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
We have been recommending you.

422
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I was worried about you.

423
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I heard you say that.

424
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
I prepared this for you.

425
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Yes.

426
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
What kind of job?

427
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
It's not a big deal.

428
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
The interior is to be...

429
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
The interior.

430
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
It's not your business.

431
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
It's not good enough.

432
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
I have to make this job.

433
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
You are not here.

434
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
We are all here.

435
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
We think you are old.

436
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
You are the most suitable for this job.

437
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Yes.

438
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Look.

439
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
In the new year,

440
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,040
the saint often sends some jobs.

441
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Although it's not a formal job,

442
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
it's a job for the saint.

443
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,040
The next job is to make people respect.

444
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
This is a lot of family business.

445
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
It's not easy to do.

446
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,040
I heard that Li just bought a house.

447
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
He has done his job.

448
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
He is a rich man.

449
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
He can't afford to pay the loan.

450
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Congratulations.

451
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Here.

452
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Congratulations.

453
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Congratulations.

454
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Congratulations.

455
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,040
The assistant is really a good example.

456
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Here.

457
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
The saint is so lucky.

458
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
He is waiting for the silk and the silk.

459
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
This is the door.

460
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
If you drink this cup of wine,

461
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I will push you now.

462
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Old man, go to the bazaar.

463
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Here.

464
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Feng Chi.

465
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Qian Jian.

466
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Li Shan De.

467
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Jian Shi.

468
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
I am a good man.

469
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Here.

470
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Here.

471
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Three weeks later,

472
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
the top-ranking chief of the top-ranking chief

473
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Yi Xian Hang,

474
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
the division commander of the silk and the silk,

475
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
the Ministry of Rites and the imperial court,

476
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
are back to the tribe.

477
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Yes.

478
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Congratulations.

479
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Congratulations.

480
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Qian Jian.

481
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
From this moment on,

482
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Li Shan De is the only one

483
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
who will be the best in the world.

484
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Okay.

485
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Congratulations.

486
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Congratulations.

487
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Congratulations.

488
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Congratulations.

489
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Where is Zheng Shi?

490
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Where is he?

491
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Who will pay the loan tonight?

492
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
No need.

493
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
It's been a long time.

494
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
What's wrong with you two?

495
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
It's okay.

496
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Zheng Shi.

497
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Where is he?

498
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
He is here.

499
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
The news just got from the police.

500
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
The high-ranking chief He You Guang

501
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,040
has sent a man named Pan Bao,

502
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
who wrote the big-ranking chief of the south

503
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
to get the title.

504
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Wu Deng,

505
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
the chief of the south,

506
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,040
will be the one to pay the loan.

507
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Modem,

508
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
he is trying to give him

509
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
the title of the south's military man.

510
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Zi Fan, you are ahead.

511
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
If you can get the right to

512
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
the right to the right to the right,

513
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Zi Fan will have a way

514
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
to get the right to the right.

515
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
If Jing An Si is killed,

516
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
he will be killed.

517
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
If Si Cheng wants to find a person

518
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
who is capable of getting the title,

519
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,040
he won't suspect it.

520
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
The title?

521
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Zi Fan said

522
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
if he succeeds,

523
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,040
he will be the one to pay the loan.

524
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Pretty nice.

525
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
That's good.

526
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
He will be his subordinate,

527
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,040
mean he want to compete in C判.

528
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,040
this is generous.

529
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Wow, Pei Jiu Shi Lang.

530
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Go and ask around.

531
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I can't get in the house.

532
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
You're wrong.

533
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
It's not here.

534
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
It's not here?

535
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Next door.

536
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
You're wrong.

537
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Wang Zitao, Wang Zitao, Wang Zitao.

539
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Wang Zitao, Wang Zitao.

540
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
You're late.

541
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
You're in the long-term.

542
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Is your classmate here?

543
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Yes, sir.

544
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
You're a good teacher.

545
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
You're a good teacher.

546
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
You're a good teacher.

547
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,500
You've done pretty well.

548
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
What are you doing?

549
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I have no emotion.

550
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,340
I'm a lendman.

551
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,840
I don't it.

552
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,840
Even if I do, someone has to grab me.

553
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,040
What the heck?

554
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Just forget it.

555
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,040
You're my teacher.

556
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Big God

557
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Big God

558
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
It's me

559
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Is this back?

560
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
It's a person's order

561
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I'm in the line of the fairy

562
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Look

563
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Big God

564
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Don't

565
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Fairy milk

566
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Fairy milk

567
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
The fairy milk

568
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
First, you have to choose the fairy milk

569
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,040
You also need the magic liquid from the fairy

570
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Plus the fairy technology

571
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Lock the fairy

572
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Fang can create the fairy taste

573
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Fairy milk, fairy speed, fairy technology, fairy taste

574
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Isn't it the fairy milk?

575
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
What else?

576
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Why don't you go out right now?

577
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
One step at a time

578
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Thank you, Big God

579
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Don't leave first

580
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I'll send the magic liquid to you

581
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
The fairy milk is ready

582
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
You're back

583
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
The fairy is always there

584
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
Fairy milk

585
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
The fairy is always there

586
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Next

587
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
There's only one mission

588
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Get the fairy in that room

589
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Then you can get the ice-cream

590
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I've confirmed

591
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
That there's a fish tail

592
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
It's coming out

593
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Rui

594
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Lu Si Cheng

595
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I'm a person

596
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I've been doing this since I was a child

597
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Uncle

598
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
You saved me

599
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
You saved me

600
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
You saved me

601
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
The song is for the right person

602
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
The preparation is not easy

603
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
The right person is not easy

604
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
The right person is not easy

605
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Open the door

606
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Hurry up

607
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Be careful

608
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Be careful

609
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Life is worth it

610
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
You have to pay it back

611
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
The dream is the golden lord

612
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
The empty garden

613
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,040
We can't give you what you want

614
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:05,040
The right person said

615
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,040
The fish tail is not easy

616
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
I'll personally give it to him

617
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I'll give it to He Si Shi

618
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I don't know if he'll understand

619
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
I'm the lucky one from He Si Shi

620
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Don't you worry about the right person?

621
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm a good person

622
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
The right person

623
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I'll give it to He Si Shi

624
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Don't you worry

625
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Brother, are you okay?

626
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
You can help me

627
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Is this a fairy?

628
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I...

629
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Fang Yu

630
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Hey

631
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
What are you doing?

632
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm here to help you

633
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
I'm here to help you

634
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I'm here to help you

635
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm here to help you

636
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
What's going on?

637
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Why are you so slow?

638
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
He asked when the horse is going to be on the road

639
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Tonight

640
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
You want to ask me?

641
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
You dare to delay me?

642
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
It's a pity that I have something to do in Chang'an

643
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
I can't accompany you

644
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
You're not so polite

645
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
You don't have to accompany me

646
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
But there's one thing

647
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
I really need to work

648
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
I went to the city this time

649
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Only the right person

650
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
knows

651
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
I have a letter

652
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Take it

653
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
And Si Shi will read it

654
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Si Shi

655
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Uncle

656
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Uncle

657
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Uncle

658
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
What are you doing?

659
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Help me

660
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
You're crazy

661
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
You're crazy

662
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
You gave me this file

663
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
The emperor fell

664
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Please repeat it

665
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
How big is it?

666
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Is it like this?

667
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Look

668
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
The original

669
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
The wrong letter

670
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
The emperor changed it

671
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
But the paper didn't know why it fell

672
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
It has to be sticked back

673
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
This is a concave

674
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
It has to be sealed

675
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Or it will be a disaster

676
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Iron emperor?

677
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
I don't remember

678
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
What's the concave

679
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
when it's sealed

680
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
Did you put it on yourself?

681
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
How can the emperor have this?

682
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
You just said

683
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Iron emperor needs

684
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
to seal the seal

685
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Please ask

686
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
what's the concave

687
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Yes

688
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Is there?

689
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
This

690
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
The number of the sword

691
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
When you were drinking

692
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Didn't you say that the one you want

693
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
is the sword of the sword

694
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Did you drink too much?

695
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
You said that

696
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
the car is shaking

697
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Do we need to provide it?

698
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Tell me

699
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
When I was eating

700
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Did you bring the sword?

701
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
No

702
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,040
The commander said

703
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
the sword

704
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
The sword

705
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
is what you said

706
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
The emperor wrote it clearly

707
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
He sent you a

708
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
a concave

709
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
You have to take the concave

710
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Don't you see it wrong?

711
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
You know

712
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
the concave

713
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
It's not the same

714
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
It's not the same

715
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
So you need to

716
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
be more careful

717
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
The emperor knows

718
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
You have to look carefully

719
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
It's written clearly

720
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
The emperor wants

721
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
to lead the south

722
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
The emperor

723
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
The commander

724
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
The commander

725
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
The commander is 5,000 miles away

726
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
He is a soldier

727
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
The commander

728
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
The commander

729
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
The commander

730
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
I have a good old friend

731
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
I don't drink

732
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
I don't drink

733
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
I want to go south

734
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
I want to go south

735
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Hmmm

736
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Manager

737
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Can I please

738
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Have you done this?

739
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
To run

740
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Send it that way

741
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,120
you need to run

742
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,040
Please

743
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Please

744
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Let's follow

745
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Please

746
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Open the door! Where are you going?

747
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
Open the door! Open the door!

748
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,040
I want to return a clear room!

749
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
What are you doing?

750
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm stealing the room.

751
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Get in the room!

752
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Get out of here!

753
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Get out!

754
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
There's a smoke!

755
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Get out!

756
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Get out!

757
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Get out!

758
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
It's late.

759
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,040
I'll be home soon.

760
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,040
What's going on today?

761
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,040
You're a good cook.

762
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
What can happen?

763
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
You must have some urgent business.

764
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Xiu, come with me.

765
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Episode 1

766
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
What are you doing?

767
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
Get out!

768
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Get out!

769
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,040
You're the only one who's dead.

770
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,040
You want me to die alone?

771
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Or should I drag you all to the toilet?

772
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
If I have to say one step at a time,

773
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,040
then I'll be the head of the toilet.

774
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,040
Then I'll be the head of the toilet.

775
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,040
I'm the toilet of the man who's dreamy.

776
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,040
You're dead!

777
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,040
What's going on?

778
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
The cow has changed!

779
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,040
It's for the mother of the wild.

780
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
The last one.

781
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
It's so fun!

782
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
Episode 3

783
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
I will not be able to live.

784
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,040
I will not be able to live.

785
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,040
I will not be able to live.

786
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,040
I will not be able to live.

787
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,040
I will not be able to live.

788
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,040
I will not have enormous rewards.

789
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
I will not depend on you,

790
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,040
or want you to come and eat your batery.

791
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
After everything I have done,

792
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,040
I will just do everything I need.

793
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:25,040
I will live until I die.
