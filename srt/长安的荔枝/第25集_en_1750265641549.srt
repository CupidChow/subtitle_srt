emergency

apply

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
to

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,020
see

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,820
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
Let me handle this person.

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,300
Okay then,

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,340
I'll wait and see what思想 is.

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:03,940
Yeah.

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,620
I wait.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,420
Pack this

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,320
bag.

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,940
Remember,

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
no matter who asks me to follow the documents,

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,860
I need to prepare them in advance

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,580
as I take the samples before then.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
If I need it,

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
First date of disaster

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,100
will be Mythic here

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,840
//No poetry

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
Careful

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,080
Do not underestimate these cases

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,940
This is

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,240
the root of National People who Dit

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,880
I clear my mind

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,640
I must be very careful

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,720
not to disturb that there is any details

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,480
My Lord, there's some

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Luke's Post

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,140
Lockedchae

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,940
in this kind of situation

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,020
Let's have a hard time

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,520
Swear they didn't Xia單

54
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm a young man from the Si Nong Temple.

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm sorry to see you again.

57
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Who are you?

58
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
Why don't you see...

59
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,140
Chief Meng.

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,140
Chief Meng, you should be here.

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
I'm Li Shande.

62
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,140
I joined the Si Nong Temple yesterday.

63
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,140
I found the missing of the book when I was in the office last night.

64
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,140
I was a little worried about the calculation.

65
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,140
I fell asleep in a hurry.

66
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,140
I found the missing of the book when I was in the office.

67
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
Please take a look.

68
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,140
This is the record of the entry and exit this year.

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,140
This is the record of the entry and exit last winter.

70
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,140
This is the rule of the office.

71
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,140
I think the relevant figures have the information of the report.

72
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
The entering is the invеч.

73
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,140
This rule of the office is completed by olunance,

74
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
every month,

75
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
I believe.

76
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Everyone should be read by the agency,

77
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
then enter by Ctung.

78
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,140
They'll have 97.

79
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
It must be Orange Grand not 36 and 37.

80
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,140
Look,

81
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,140
the key of the remarks is welcome.

82
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I think,

83
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
in terms of history,

84
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
it's accessible to everyone.

85
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,700
If the warehouse is not strict,

86
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,260
even if there is a slight gap,

87
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,300
it will cause a huge gap.

88
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,540
Fish and fish silk.

89
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,380
These are very serious problems.

90
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,940
You may not know the specific situation.

91
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,020
You can't just...

92
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,260
Please take a look.

93
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,540
The big ones are 12.

94
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,580
One is up and one is down.

95
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,900
The high ones are 2.

96
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,860
The small ones are 3.

97
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,300
One is up and one is down.

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,900
They are horse legs.

99
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,540
Theлучous catch was also found in extrapolation.

100
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,860
They can only be found in snapding,

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,540
in technician's shift,

102
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,300
in field trade.

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,180
Go away.

104
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,620
Thanks!

105
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,820
I will tell you the truth.

106
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,180
There thermos,

107
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,780
which at least look so graceful.

108
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,100
There is no loss.

109
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,660
There's no win.-

110
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,180
It's przestrins,

111
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,940
He Cao Gao

112
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,100
Will you wanted me to

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Take him back for a check

114
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,940
Nothing else

115
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,460
But Fianc lining was missing

116
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,880
Don't worry

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,180
One 해서 worth of a loads

118
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Is the cost of work of those people

119
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,820
I will

120
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,460
Chase them and الث

121
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,800
Keep searching

122
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,700
Up to this

123
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,660
Underpass

124
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,980
Every people

125
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,020
Should know it

126
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
So on

127
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,300
Gwang

128
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,300
I'll teach him to put his strength on you.

129
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Don't worry, Master Gao.

130
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm not as good as you.

131
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Lao Hu.

132
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
It's been three days.

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Li Shande was promoted and went to the Holy Forest.

134
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
But I didn't expect that the Chief of the Meng tribe

135
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
was so bold and bold.

136
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,300
It's a result of being sent to the foreign province.

137
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
It's that simple?

138
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,300
The Chief of the Meng tribe changed the foundation.

139
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Actually, it was signed by Shaoqing.

140
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
He is a bastard.

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
He had to agree to this.

142
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
He was the one who was punished.

143
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Li Buzhong's brother told me that

144
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
he was only three days away.

145
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,300
He drove the Chief of the Meng tribe out of the Holy Forest.

146
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
What?

147
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,300
The Chief of the Liu tribe also punished him.

148
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
He even used a lawyer to beat him.

149
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,300
If Li Shande went to sue the Chief of the Liu tribe,

150
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,300
and said that he stole the gold from the palace,

151
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,300
he would have to be sent to the foreign province

152
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,300
in the same way as the Chief of the Meng tribe.

153
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Chief of the Liu tribe.

154
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Chief of the Liu tribe.

155
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
Chief of the Liu tribe.

156
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Xiaoyuan, I want to discuss something with you.

157
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
I think you are a talent.

158
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I want you to be a good example.

159
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Since you know the taste of the flower bird fish,

160
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,300
why don't you go to the Luoyou Garden to eat it?

161
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Chief, I'm from the Ming Song tribe.

162
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Chief, I'm from the flower...

163
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
You...

164
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Yan Shi.

165
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,300
The fan of the Xijuan tribe is used by women.

166
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Is it because the book is written by a girl with a noble background?

167
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
I used the fan by myself.

168
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Don't laugh.

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Look, this fan has a different kind of fan.

170
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
It's a fan.

171
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
It's a fan.

172
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
It's a fan.

173
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
It's a fan.

174
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
It's a fan.

175
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
It's a fan.

176
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
It's a fan.

177
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
It's a fan.

178
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
It's a fan.

179
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
It's a fan.

180
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
But in my own eyes,

181
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
I need to practice.

182
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
It's a fan.

183
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
The beautiful girl is a heart-shaped girl.

184
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,300
She has a beautiful voice.

185
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
She's a star.

186
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
She's a star.

187
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
I'm in the south,

188
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
but I miss the right side of my heart.

189
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Every month, I read the book.

190
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm in the north, I'm in the south.

191
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm in the heart of one person.

192
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
I'm a thousand miles away.

193
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
I can't stop my tears from flowing down.

194
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
I write the two words of my heart.

195
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm in the same bitter.

196
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
You're a bitter heart.

197
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
You're like a man who can be caught.

198
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
Dan Yuan.

199
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Maybe the book

200
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
only the heroine's book

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
has ever been mine.

202
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
That's all.

203
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
I'll take my leave.

204
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Take care, heroine.

205
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
I'll take my leave.

206
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Master Yu.

207
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
It's dark.

208
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Be careful.

209
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Don't be so naughty.

210
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,300
It's the right time to serve the Noble Consort.

211
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
The right time to serve the Lord is coming.

212
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
The Noble Consort is also doing well

213
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
at the banquet.

214
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
The time has come

215
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
to serve the Lord.

216
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
I've been waiting for this moment.

217
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
I'm so happy

218
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
that I can serve the Lord.

219
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm so happy

220
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
that I can serve the Lord.

221
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
There's not much time left.

222
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Are the gold threads of each land

223
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
in the grave?

224
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
The body of each land

225
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
has been recorded.

226
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
The anti-bomb lock has also been locked.

227
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
The next month,

228
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
we'll have to deal with it.

229
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
By then,

230
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
the Grand Master of the Tai Fu Temple

231
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
will have to take care of some people.

232
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
The dream will come true.

233
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Besides the body of each land,

234
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
all the branches of the land

235
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
will also be in good hands.

236
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
You have to be more diligent.

237
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Yes.

238
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Master Yu.

239
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Speaking of the various things,

240
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
there's a fun these days.

241
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
The body of that land

242
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
has returned from the south.

243
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
The body of the land?

244
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
You forgot.

245
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
You've been here before.

246
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
The leader of the office

247
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
was so mad that

248
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
the body of that land

249
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
was not even worth a thousand yuan.

250
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
You said

251
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
that's all you can do.

252
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
As a result,

253
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,300
the people

254
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
have now been born

255
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
to find the way to the ritual.

256
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
They are blocked

257
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,300
by the grass and grass.

258
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
They are kicked by the ladder.

259
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Finally,

260
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
they are sent to the Ministry of War

261
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
to find the way to kill the people.

262
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
They are kicked out

263
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
and lost half of their lives.

264
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
The body is in a state of

265
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
fighting for the benefit of the land.

266
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
They only want a place to live.

267
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
The ritual

268
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
is a bit similar

269
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
to the ritual of the ritual.

270
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Master Yu.

271
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
You are fighting for the benefit of the land.

272
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
That's a hard question.

273
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
You can't deny it.

274
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
The ritual is very good.

275
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
It's better than the ritual of the land.

276
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
The ritual is very good.

277
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
The great risk is

278
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,300
very good.

279
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
If the ritual

280
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
really takes the

281
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
way to the new ritual,

282
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
it will

283
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
be a great blessing

284
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
for the people.

285
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Uncle.

286
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
How come the old woman

287
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
has a baby?

288
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
How many days?

289
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Two days.

290
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Two days?

291
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
You didn't tell me

292
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,300
about the two days.

293
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Why didn't you tell me?

294
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,300
I was so angry.

295
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
You didn't come to Lezhou

296
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
for two days.

297
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Why didn't we

298
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
find the Holy Uncle?

299
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
Oh, no.

300
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
I was so angry.

301
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
I was going to Leyouyuan

302
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
to see the situation.

303
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
We had to take the punishment.

304
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Chuchu.

305
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Ask everyone

306
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
to come to Chuchu.

307
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
This...

308
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
This is not a good idea.

309
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
We need to get rid of the water.

310
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
You should tell me.

311
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
If we get rid of the water,

312
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
we will be in trouble.

313
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
If we kill the old woman,

314
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
we will be in trouble.

315
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
That's the most common

316
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
thing in the business.

317
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
You are so careless.

318
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I can't blame myself.

319
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
After the death of Li Shande,

320
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
everyone was well-off.

321
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
We were all killed by the old woman.

322
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Now,

323
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
the business is at stake.

324
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
How can I blame myself?

325
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
You are right.

326
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
I am responsible for the repair.

327
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
But I am just

328
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
careful with the lack of money.

329
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
I am more careful than my mother.

330
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
This bug must be

331
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
from the soil.

332
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
I am a good cook

333
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
for the old woman.

334
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
But the most important thing

335
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
is the best job.

336
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
If the bug is born from the soil,

337
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
we need to ask

338
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
if it is bought from the market.

339
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
If I buy the raw material

340
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
with the bug,

341
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
how can the bug be born from the soil?

342
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
I think it is the method

343
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
that is usually used.

344
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
The bug must be

345
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
from the neighbouring net.

346
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
The bug was brought in.

347
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Yes.

348
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
I am responsible for the neighbouring net.

349
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
But the neighbouring net

350
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
is often taught to me

351
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
by the old man.

352
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
The hardest job is the heart.

353
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Shuling,

354
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
when did you get the coal?

355
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
It is for the sake of the bug.

356
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
It is really a human being.

357
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Please,

358
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
please,

359
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Shuling,

360
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
please,

361
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
So,

362
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
you are all responsible?

363
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
I am in the forest

364
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
and I am in the garden.

365
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
If there is no plot,

366
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
I will take the responsibility

367
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
of the mother and the son-in-law

368
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
tomorrow.

369
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Then, what do you want?

370
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Today,

371
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
we must understand

372
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
and find someone to take responsibility.

373
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I heard that

374
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Li Shande is back.

375
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Really?

376
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Yes.

377
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I heard that Li Shande

378
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
made a big fuss

379
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
about Li Zhipi's death

380
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
in every mansion.

381
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
He didn't take the paper

382
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
and pushed it away.

383
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Shuling,

384
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
actually,

385
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
this Mudan

386
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
is Li Shande's responsibility.

387
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
We are just

388
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
helping him take care of Mudan

389
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
because he is a man of the past.

390
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Yes.

391
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Who knows

392
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
if he used the yellow mud

393
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
to break the paper

394
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
to make the bug today.

395
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Mudan is injured

396
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
and is in a very weak condition.

397
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
If mud is stuck in the mud,

398
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
it will hurt the root.

399
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
It will be a long time

400
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
and the bug will be born.

401
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
In that case,

402
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
we should take responsibility for Li Shande.

403
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,300
He is responsible.

404
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
He is a man of the past.

405
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,300
How can he take this responsibility?

406
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
We can

407
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
lie to him

408
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
and let him know.

409
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Who can lie to him now?

410
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Xia,

411
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
no.

412
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I just

413
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
try to find a way.

414
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Shuling, save me.

415
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
My 80-year-old mother

416
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
is still at home.

417
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Shou,

418
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Shuling.

419
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Li Shande

420
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
is a very strong man.

421
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
But after all,

422
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
we are in the same boat.

423
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
He went back to Chang'an

424
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
and was angry at the door.

425
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
He is a man of the past.

426
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
He is a man of the past.

427
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
He is angry.

428
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Well,

429
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
please come.

430
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I am Xia Xu, the leader of the top.

431
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
How do you think?

432
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Li Jian,

433
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Han is a foreign minister.

434
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
He can only come back when he wants to.

435
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Please wait.

436
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Wait.

437
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Yang Yuan.

438
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
When did you come to Chang'an?

439
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,300
You can do it in a good way.

440
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
That's right.

441
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Yang Yuan.

442
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Yang Yuan.

443
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I know what you think.

444
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
To be honest,

445
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
if I take this job,

446
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I will also think about it.

447
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
But you misunderstood us.

448
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Well,

449
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
now,

450
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,300
you have become a filial son-in-law.

451
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
They can laugh.

452
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,300
We can't laugh at people in Shanglin City.

453
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Since then,

454
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Liu Shuling has always blamed himself.

455
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,300
He said he couldn't help himself.

456
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
But you know,

457
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Shanglin City is a clean water pond.

458
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
It has no power.

459
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Other people in the city

460
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
can push the demolition network to the river.

461
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
Shanglin City

462
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
can only use its skin to remove it.

463
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Yang Yuan.

464
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
After you leave,

465
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
the officials will think of you.

466
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Everyone wants you to do this job

467
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
and also make the whole Shanglin City proud.

468
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Now, if you have any difficulties,

469
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
you must tell us.

470
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Your current situation

471
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
will be our future.

472
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,300
We will help you.

473
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Come on.

474
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
It's okay.

475
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Let's go.

476
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Send something.

477
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Do you have any people

478
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
to help me

479
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,300
transfer the lawyer's papers to the ground?

480
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
How can you do that?

481
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Li Jian has found

482
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
the way to transfer the lawyer's papers.

483
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
These fools

484
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,300
are still trying to push the demolition network to the river.

485
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Back then,

486
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
the lawyer's office

487
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
was the one who pushed the demolition network

488
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
to the river.

489
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
I can't clear up

490
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
the mouth of these fools.

491
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Yang Yuan.

492
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
What do you plan to do now?

493
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I can only push the transfer network

494
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
to the river.

495
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
I came here today

496
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,300
to ask the fellow

497
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
who can speak Chinese

498
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
to help me put this bomb on the ground.

499
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
From Shanglin City,

500
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I'm afraid

501
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
we will also meet the meeting.

502
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Mr. Qu.

503
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Brother Ling is not in the position of a lawyer.

504
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
But I'm helping him.

505
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Mr. Ling.

506
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Brother Jia is a good man.

507
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
He's a good man.

508
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
But he's not good.

509
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Brother Jia went to the office

510
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
to get the fire.

511
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
He'll be back in the month of next month.

512
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Yang Yuan.

513
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
You can wait.

514
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I can't wait.

515
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
If you come to see me yesterday,

516
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I'll be fine.

517
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
By the way,

518
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,300
I have a relative in the library.

519
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
He also manages some

520
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
goods transfer.

521
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
How about I ask him?

522
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
The library is all about the book.

523
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
Actually,

524
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
I have a relationship here.

525
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
I've been in the same building for years.

526
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
I just got a doctor's assistant.

527
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
I'll go there

528
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
and see if he can give me this mask.

529
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
I've been there.

530
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm responsible for the transfer.

531
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
It's a matter of time.

532
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Shanglin City is a water-based house.

533
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
It's hard to say.

534
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,300
It's a house of flowers.

535
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
To be honest,

536
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
we've seen a lot of people

537
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
in the library.

538
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
They're friendly.

539
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
They're friendly.

540
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,300
We can't even talk.

541
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,300
It's more about the relationship.

542
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Speaking of this,

543
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,300
I'm thinking of someone.

544
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Shanglin City

545
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
really has a person who has a relationship.

546
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Who?

547
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
You?

548
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Have you forgotten?

549
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
You Xiang ordered

550
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
to take the pillow

551
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
that the saint likes.

552
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
But the result was

553
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
you saved the pillow.

554
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
You took the pillow

555
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
and took it as a head.

556
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Now, you're taking the pillow

557
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
and trying to make it look good.

558
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
You're trying to make it look good.

559
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
You even mentioned it to him.

560
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
He must remember

561
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
the old-fashioned way you said it.

562
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
How can I remember it again?

563
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
I remember

564
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
the teardrop of your history

565
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
was signed again.

566
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
If you report it to him,

567
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
it's not a deal.

568
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Besides,

569
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
the transfer order

570
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
is still in progress.

571
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
It must be very surprising.

572
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I won't blame you.

573
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
After Li Chun

574
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,300
went to the amusement park to enjoy the flowers

575
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
every day.

576
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
He changed the person

577
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
who was in charge of it

578
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
and reported the situation to his mother.

579
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,300
This may be a chance.

580
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Which one?

581
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,300
When are you going to the amusement park again?

582
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
It's just today.

583
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Liao Yuan.

584
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Go and try it.

585
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Don't be so careless.

586
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Hurry up.

587
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Hurry up.

588
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
What's wrong?

589
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Go.

590
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
What's wrong?

591
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
Li Jianshi, you're back.

592
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Li Jianshi.

593
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
This is her birthday.

594
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
What?

595
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
Li Jianshi,

596
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
please help us.

597
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Li Jianshi,

598
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
please help us.

599
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
We're all right.

600
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
We're all right.

601
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
We didn't tell you it's her birthday.

602
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
She was in charge of it,

603
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
but she saw the birth of her mother.

604
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
She was afraid that

605
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
she might scare the ghost

606
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
and scare the soul.

607
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
She didn't know

608
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
that she's the daughter

609
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
of Li Jianshi.

610
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Li Jianshi.

611
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,040
he'd be the bullet to the left,

612
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,780
damn, he's veryいたmish would have had to manage all the criminals.

613
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,460
because of you whenést he'd built this huge house.

614
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,560
these idiots

615
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,580
I know

616
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,520
airtschafts like that would be kind of business.

617
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,660
never thought

618
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,300
that big a move he's going to used for the parties.

619
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,180
what they did was saving us a lot.

620
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,540
so

621
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,020
the you emple bluffing today

622
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,460
After the reward is given, the right-hand man will come back.

623
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,900
If he comes, we will be doomed.

624
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,300
Li Yan Shi, save us!

625
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,700
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

626
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,460
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

627
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,940
Come, come, come!

628
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,260
Come, come, come! Hurry, hurry!

629
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,500
Why did we come to the hospital today?

630
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,380
Didn't you hear that the saint is not aware of the truth?

631
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,220
The A-Qi is about to arrive.

632
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,300
I think it's Dong Wen who is going to come and play with the heart.

633
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,180
The A-Qi is going to the hospital for the saint.

634
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,580
He is looking at the circle.

635
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,300
Now it's time.

636
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,740
The A-Qi is actually going to remind the saint

637
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,260
that he will definitely receive the saint's heart.

638
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,780
Then let's just tell the A-Qi directly.

639
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,500
The A-Qi is a precious treasure.

640
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,660
Since we want to discuss the A-Qi's character,

641
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,300
we must do everything.

642
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,420
Let's first look at the difference between the treasure and the A-Qi.

643
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,660
If we tell the A-Qi again, it will be more effective.

644
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,980
Then he will be more comfortable.

645
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,260
In that case...

646
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,980
In that case, we will be lucky to have the right-hand man.

647
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,340
The right-hand man will be happy to have the saint.

648
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,540
The saint will be happy. We will be happy too.

649
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,420
The A-Qi is a precious treasure.

650
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,140
The right-hand man will be happy.

651
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,220
The right-hand man will be happy.

652
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,060
When the doctor comes,

653
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,020
he will have 7-8 doctors to help him.

654
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,180
He will be able to drink the medicine.

655
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,380
The right-hand man will be able to drink the medicine.

656
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,020
He will be able to stop the patient.

657
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,580
But...

658
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,020
He will be able to send the heart

659
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,980
package,

660
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,660
but also,

661
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,900
this den very special reward?

662
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,780
Why does it taste so bad?

663
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,780
What are you looking for?

664
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,780
He Lan is on fire!

665
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,780
The thing that's going on is not fire, it's a bug.

666
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
A bug?

667
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
The bug is a bug.

668
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,780
The bug is a bug.

669
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
How can you protect it?

670
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
What is it?

671
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Don't panic.

672
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
I'm not afraid of it.

673
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
Liu Huang.

674
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
The bug is serious.

675
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
The bug is serious.

676
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,780
It has to be re-dry and re-dry in the soil.

677
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Then it will be re-dry and re-dry.

678
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Liu Yan's family is in a bad state.

679
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,780
You made me a bad person.

680
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Good thing I can't repay the debt.

681
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,780
Otherwise I would have been in trouble.

682
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
The right-hand man is not coming today.

683
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Mr. Yu, he is Li Zhishi.

684
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
I've seen you before.

685
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm the top of the top of the top.

686
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
I've seen Mr. Yu.

687
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,780
I've been teaching Mr. Yu

688
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
how to transfer to Li Zhixian.

689
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,780
It's been a long time since the job was done.

690
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
It's been a long time.

691
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
It's not worth it.

692
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
You're not dead.

693
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,780
Did you do anything wrong?

694
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,780
I've been transferred.

695
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
I was a mute.

696
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
I didn't take my job.

697
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Maybe it's because of you.

698
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
I'm the only one who died.

699
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
I've been working on this job.

700
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Why don't you say

701
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,780
that the new job is in front of the people?

702
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
No.

703
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,780
I was able to get this job.

704
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
But I have to transfer to Liu city

705
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,780
after I've done all the work.

706
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
You don't know that.

707
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
Liu city

708
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,780
is about a month away.

709
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
The banquet of the noble man

710
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
is six months away.

711
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
It's not too late.

712
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Do you know why the Holy Man

713
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
is going to jump out of the coffin?

714
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,780
The outside world is so desperate.

715
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
He just wants to say something

716
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,780
and someone will be happy.

717
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
As a result,

718
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
you still have this kind of plan.

719
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,780
The Holy Man is the only one

720
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
who can do it.

721
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Forget it.

722
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
The duty of my deputy

723
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,780
is to buy the cloth.

724
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
The new job of Gao Zhou

725
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,780
is what the Holy Man wants.

726
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
I'll help you think of a way

727
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
to save the six cities in the city.

728
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,780
You need to help me.

729
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,780
If I can help the Holy Man,

730
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,780
I'll be in trouble.

731
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
But I heard that

732
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
the new job is not bad

733
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,780
except for three days.

734
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Can the new job really be done?

735
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
Look.

736
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
This is the special law

737
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
I wrote.

738
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
It's here.

739
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,780
You're so clever.

740
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
I...

741
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,780
I'm going back to the palace.

742
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Can you let me take you back

743
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
and check it out?

744
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
If you don't know,

745
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
I'll come to the police station tomorrow.

746
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
When?

747
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

748
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
I'll be there.

749
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
I'll be there.

750
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
I'll be there.

751
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
I'll be there.

752
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
I'll be there.

753
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
I'll be there.

754
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
I'll be there.

755
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,780
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

756
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
I'll be there.

757
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
I'll be there.

758
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,780
I'll be there.

759
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
Brother Liang Yuan.

760
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Why don't you ask me first?

761
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
I don't even know

762
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
what I'm doing.

763
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
Only he can help me.

764
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
This city is a new place

765
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,780
with a lot of people.

766
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,780
No one is in danger.

767
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
They're the best.

768
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
They can be replaced by someone.

769
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
What do you mean?

770
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,780
It means that no one is like a snake.

771
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
It's not easy to bite.

772
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,780
What do you mean?

773
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
It's a different thing.

774
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,780
You should at least leave it to him.

775
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
Now he's a good man.

776
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,780
He's got the law.

777
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Why didn't Zhao Hu Huapiao

778
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
take the new law back from the capital?

779
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
He's got the law.

780
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,780
He's got the law.

781
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
He has nothing to do with you.

782
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
No.

783
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
He said

784
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
he'd take the bomb back

785
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
and study it.

786
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
We'll meet at the amusement park tomorrow.

787
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Thank you.

788
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,780
He's got the law.

789
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
No.

790
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
No.

791
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
I've been to all the cities.

792
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
They can prove to me

793
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
that I've studied

794
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
the law of the transfer.

795
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
It secrets to me.

796
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,780
I'll see for myself what to do.

797
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,580
What if I want to start atinger company

798
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,780
like him?

799
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,780
What if I want to?

800
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,180
Hands off!

801
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,780
They'll catch our eyes!

802
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,780
What about res surnames?

803
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,060
Who's gonna in a good cause do thisipple sustainability thing?

804
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,340
How come you went to some好像 country man

805
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,420
to steal all your pine shoots and it's still missing a lot?

806
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:59,140
Normally I, my mind just którable research andkim

807
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,940
If you Straßen analytic fibri these fuzzy things

808
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:24,700
This means Lethya Championships's

809
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,900
The hyvä only takes the poison,

810
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,180
not the brains.

811
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,540
I was scared for a few months.

812
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,080
I used myudiary cord on my leg.

813
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,380
And I turned the dog over.

814
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,280
Really?

815
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,780
Too bad I was a person of하's suit.

816
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Fortunately, I know the shock.

817
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,480
I only used to be in love with Dir shoes.

818
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Now I can only see clearly what's happening now.

819
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I can't help you to save the world.

820
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I don't know how to deal with this situation.

821
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Or...

822
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I'd better give my daughter Annuo a good life.

823
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I'll give her a trustful life.

824
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
What kind of life?

825
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
How can you say that?

826
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Who do you think you are?

827
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Listen to me.

828
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I'm not a life.

829
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
No.

830
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
No.

831
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
No.

832
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
No.

833
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
No.

834
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
No.

835
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Mr. Yu.

836
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
When you and Nellie met last night,

837
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
you were in the hospital.

838
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Now, you've been through a lot.

839
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Oh.

840
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
You didn't plan to go?

841
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Did you plan to

842
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
send a transfer to the hospital yourself?

843
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
It's true that

844
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
such a fraud can be written.

845
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,480
The transfer method is very complicated.

846
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
It needs to be carefully calculated

847
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
to avoid getting into trouble.

848
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
It seems that

849
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,480
she has been in the south for many times

850
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
and has been rejected repeatedly.

851
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
It seems that

852
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
she is being mocked.

853
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
You should call me.

854
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Why can't I see her?

855
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
The more anxious it is,

856
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
the more I can't do it.

857
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Mr. Yu.

858
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Why are you here?

859
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
I'm waiting for someone.

860
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
No one will come

861
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
to the hospital this afternoon.

862
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Exactly.

863
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Let's go.

864
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
For example,

865
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
the fish in the pond

866
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
is very hungry.

867
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480
It makes it full of food

868
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,480
when it's full of food.

869
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
When it's hungry,

870
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
it will be very grateful

871
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,480
for the food.

872
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
It's your kindness.

873
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
It's a good thing.

874
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
We are hungry for a few days.

875
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Don't worry.

876
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
We won't starve to death.

877
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Anyway,

878
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
the fish is in my hands.

879
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
I'll go and eat

880
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
the fish.

881
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Come on.

882
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Tell me.

883
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
How should I help you?

884
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
I'll let you

885
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
go to the hospital with her.

886
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Don't worry.

887
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
It's all done.

888
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Do you want me to eat the fish?

889
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Do you want me to eat it?

890
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,480
That's what the people want.

891
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
It's like you.

892
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
It's like you.

893
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
Yu.

894
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Mun.

895
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Yan are we ready.

896
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:31,960

902
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,760
A boring street lights and championship

903
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,000
Beautiful people

904

907

A leave as a new house

908
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,920
Forget their worries

909
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,420
The honey-deaf preparing nets

910
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,500
and picnages

911
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:21,600
Train suit and immediately save transport
