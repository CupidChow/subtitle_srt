00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

Episode 1

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hurry up!

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's going on?

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Open the door!

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hurry up!

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hurry up!

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hurry up!

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's going on?

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who's the boss?

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The left one.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The left one!

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The right one!

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The left one!

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What's going on?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who's the boss?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The left one.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The left one.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He Gong! He Gong!

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let me do it!

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He Gong!

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The boss!

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He Gong!

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not going to get your shoes on even if you step on me.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you touch me, my heart will hurt.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My heart will hurt more.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The left one is already on the right.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He Gong is in a hurry.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I heard that you want to find a good master to teach you.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Zhang Canmu will be the best in a while.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
After two hours of searching, I'll help you to find a good master.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He Gong is here.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Take him to the palace.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Zhang Canmu.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I heard that you need a good master.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How do you know that I've found a master?

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's all men's business.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll wait for you.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Take care.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mr. Nan!

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The left one.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to drink with you.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Brother.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're so energetic.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's no wine everywhere in the west.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why do you have to come to me?

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I forgot.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
My business is the business of the Yangtze River.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Among the five seven kings,

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
the high-ranking and noble are the ones who can drink with me.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Zheng Ping'an, do you know who he is?

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He is Jin'an's minister Wu Huan.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The high-ranking and noble are the ones who can be examined.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He can drink the Yangtze River.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He'll catch you.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Lu Si Cheng.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was just joking.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't mind me, Lu Si Cheng.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
All right.

68
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,400
You

69
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,700
Well, today Zuo Xiang Yan residence

70
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,140
Ping An to the doctors

71
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,900
holder

72
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,540
Nice!

73
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,860
Don't you see that image?

74
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,460
uÃ©s you're really kind.

75
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,860
Zhi Ge Xi didn't even help the Lycable.

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,540
Now he's belongs to the East Canada.

77
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,220
Let me tell you, the right time for the right time

78
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,220
is when you will jump into the water.

79
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Good, good, good.

80
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Come on, come on, come on.

81
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,220
Come on, come on, come on.

82
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
You're afraid now?

83
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,220
The water is not bad.

84
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
Come.

85
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,220
I'll give you a cup of wine.

86
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
Come.

87
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Thank you, sir.

88
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,900
Oh.

89
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Oh.

90
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Are you up, Mr. He?

91
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Mr. Li, you came so early today.

92
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
You haven't come back yet.

93
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Why don't you stay a little longer?

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Oh.

95
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Oh.

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
Oh.

97
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Oh, so pretty.

98
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Mr. He.

99
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Oh.

100
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Oh.

101
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
Mr. He.

102
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,580
What's this?

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,580
The second day of the internal training

104
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,580
is indeed a new and new rule

105
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,580
for the White Household Department.

106
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
The documents were once

107
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,580
passed to the leadership of the South Korea.

108
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
I think it's a good idea to go to the Fourth Household Department.

109
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
But in your opinion,

110
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
the matter of the operation is true.

111
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Oh.

112
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
We need to help the government.

113
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Oh.

114
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
We can't hold it.

115
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
We can't hold it.

116
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
We can't use the new rule.

117
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes.

118
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
The leader is responsible.

119
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
I think this operation

120
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
is for the future.

121
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
The financial situation.

122
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
This is so bad.

123
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Give him some money,

124
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
and let him go.

125
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,940
No, no, no.

126
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
You can't give him money.

127
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
You can't do this or that.

128
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
What do you think of your father?

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,940
He has a good attitude.

130
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
But he doesn't help at all.

131
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
We are different.

132
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
We let him die.

133
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,940
We let him die.

134
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Oh.

135
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
Oh.

136
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
You are smart.

137
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
That's what I think.

138
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,620
You are smart.

139
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
I am smart.

140
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,620
But there is one thing.

141
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
You can't do it.

142
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Right?

143
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Look at him.

144
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,620
I can't do it.

145
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
I can't do it.

146
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,620
I can't do it.

147
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,620
I can't do it.

148
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Come on.

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Tonight,

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
we will eat green chicken.

151
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Master Li.

152
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
The leader of the imperial court

153
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
has confirmed your identity.

154
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Since you have confirmed my identity,

155
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
I am very happy to know that...

156
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Master Li.

157
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,980
Do you know where He Ci is?

158
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
Our leader

159
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
has been to Chang'an for many years.

160
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
He is very generous.

161
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
He is very rich.

162
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
The money he has spent

163
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
is not a small amount.

164
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
He Ci can only give up.

165
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
He can only give up.

166
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
The sky is not bright.

167
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
He is making money.

168
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
You are making money too?

169
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Of course.

170
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Master Li.

171
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
It's not much for you to know

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
the people who suffer from the famine.

173
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Other people ask us

174
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
whether we want money or not.

175
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
We really don't.

176
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
You are right.

177
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Chang'an is very rich.

178
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
The lord of the imperial court

179
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
loves the people.

180
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
You are the leader.

181
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
You are so generous.

182
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
You are so generous.

183
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
You are so generous.

184
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,340
The people are so generous.

185
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
The people are so generous.

186
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
The people are so generous.

187
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
I have a long life.

188
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
I am not familiar with it.

189
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I just bought it.

190
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
I hope I can cooperate with you.

191
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Master.

192
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Mother, I have prepared a gift for you.

193
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,340
It's not only expensive, but also a special gift.

194
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

195
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Thank you, Mr. He.

196
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Thank you, Mr. He.

197
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,340
This is a lucky gift from the capital.

198
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,340
You can take it anywhere you want.

199
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,340
It's not expensive, but it's not expensive.

200
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,340
We can help you with your work.

201
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Mr. He, I have a card for you.

202
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
It's so cheap.

203
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,340
You have a good job.

204
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,340
You see, it's a good idea to work hard.

205
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,340
It's a good idea to work hard.

206
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Mr. He, I am back.

207
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,340
Mr. He.

208
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
Brother-in-law.

209
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Come, eat.

210
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,340
I have to work overtime.

211
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Brother-in-law.

212
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Brother-in-law.

213
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,340
I am afraid of you.

214
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Brother-in-law.

215
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
I was serious yesterday.

216
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
You made me feel interested.

217
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
You didn't call me brother-in-law when you were alive.

218
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Now you call me brother-in-law.

219
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
I am afraid of being fooled.

220
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Brother-in-law.

221
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,340
I was so angry that I bought the box of the box.

222
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
I bought the box of the box of the box.

223
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,340
I bought the box of the box.

224
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
I am a god of the world.

225
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I am a god of the world.

226
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
You are so mean to my brother-in-law.

227
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,340
You are so mean to my brother-in-law.

228
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,340
Brother-in-law, we are still in the middle of the world.

229
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
Right?

230
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,340
You mentioned my sister.

231
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Let's eat.

232
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Don't let me beg you.

233
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
I am a very hard-working man.

234
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
You have to eat.

235
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
Go.

236
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,340
Brother-in-law.

237
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,340
You have to be careful about money.

238
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,340
You can't even throw it on them like a rotten rice.

239
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,340
Now,

240
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,340
the old man is going to kill you.

241
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,340
He is going to give you a butterfly.

242
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
What do you mean?

243
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
You can't go anywhere.

244
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
Don't bother him.

245
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
What else?

246
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,340
If you can help him,

247
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
you must help him.

248
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
What do you mean?

249
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,340
People can't help him.

250
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
What do you think?

251
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
What should I do?

252
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Brother-in-law,

253
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
you are a good man.

254
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
I can't count ten of you.

255
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
But you are going to learn from me

256
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,740
about this kind of old-fashioned

257
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,340
and old-fashioned things.

258
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,340
What do you mean?

259
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Brother-in-law,

260
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
I can help you

261
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
with the money.

262
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
But

263
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,340
I am also

264
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
a man of the country.

265
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
If you can help me

266
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,340
with this,

267
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,340
we can have a high-rise water field

268
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
and a high-rise lantern.

269
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
We can help each other

270
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,340
and make a joke.

271
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
I understand.

272
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,340
You are

273
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
a big man.

274
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,340
You need to use my bridge.

275
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,340
You are smart.

276
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
You are smart.

277
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,340
Then,

278
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
I will listen to you.

279
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
What is this?

280
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
You are a man of the country now.

281
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,340
I am your sister.

282
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,340
I will help you

283
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
with the money.

284
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
You can sell the school.

285
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
You can listen to me.

286
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
You can help me with the sugar.

287
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I will sell this.

288
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Did you dig this pit?

289
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,340
Why did I dig this pit?

290
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,340
Did you tell me

291
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,340
that the death of Pan Bao was you?

292
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
I don't know

293
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
if the death of Pan Bao is Lu Xia.

294
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
So, who is the person

295
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
who killed him?

296
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
Don't ask me.

297
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
I know too much about you.

298
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
If you say so,

299
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
I will know more.

300
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
I am in this country now.

301
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
I am not good.

302
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
I am not good.

303
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Where else can I go?

304
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,340
I really want to listen to you.

305
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
Tell me.

306
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
Then, I will tell you the truth.

307
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Qi Lang.

308
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,340
Dog, don't stop me.

309
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,340
In this world,

310
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
the person I love the most

311
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
is Xiou.

312
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,340
Right?

313
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
The person I love the most

314
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
is Dog.

315
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,340
You are my closest person.

316
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,340
Right?

317
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Since you want to listen,

318
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
I will tell you.

319
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,340
Even if you know

320
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
who Ma Guiyun is,

321
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,340
you will die immediately.

322
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
You will also be with us.

323
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
No.

324
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Don't be scared.

325
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I am a man who must die.

326
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
If you don't refuse to die,

327
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,340
you can refuse to die.

328
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
Brother-in-law,

329
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,340
I don't know who Ma Guiyun is.

330
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
You can still live for four months.

331
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
If you know who Ma Guiyun is,

332
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
you can live for four hours.

333
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,340
Just listen to me.

334
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,340
This is my good sister.

335
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,340
Is this Ma Guiyun's brother-in-law?

336
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
No, that...

337
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Ma Guiyun is not that...

338
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,340
I am curious.

339
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,340
Not that important.

340
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
When you are curious,

341
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
I will tell you.

342
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Okay.

343
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Say it.

344
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
How can I help you?

345
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
I don't know the death of Pan Bao

346
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,340
in Zhao Xinming.

347
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,340
You have to prove that I am not lying.

348
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Why are you still curious?

349
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Brother-in-law,

350
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,340
we are now the same kind of people

351
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
who are on the same boat.

352
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
We are not only you,

353
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,340
but also Xiu and Gao.

354
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
We are going forward with the boat.

355
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,340
We are going straight to the sea.

356
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Brother-in-law,

357
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,340
you have to help me.

358
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,340
I am sorry.

359
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,340
I am sorry.

360
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
It's all right.

361
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
This way.

362
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
Uncle Zhao.

363
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
Uncle Zhao.

364
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,340
I am here to tell you a story.

365
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
What story?

366
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,340
Like Fu'er.

367
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Dad.

368
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
It's okay.

369
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
I have investigated it.

370
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Ma Guiyun is indeed an excellent poet.

371
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,340
He came from Chang'ai.

372
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
According to you,

373
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Ma Guiyun is fine.

374
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
I will write the letter

375
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
to him.

376
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Then,

377
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
I will change the clothes.

378
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Okay.

379
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
Don't worry about Xiao Zhongxin.

380
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
His identity is fine,

381
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,340
but he has a big problem with the death of Pan Bao.

382
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
In your opinion,

383
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,340
he is fine.

384
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
It's not over yet.

385
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
It's still a guess.

386
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,340
Ma Guiyun sent a letter to him.

387
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Ma Guiyun is leaving?

388
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
He is going to the banquet tonight?

389
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Old Zhao.

390
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
You are here all day.

391
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,340
You are so stubborn.

392
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
I haven't arrived yet.

393
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
He is leaving.

394
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
You can come tonight.

395
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,340
You can't say anything.

396
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,340
Ask him if he will give it to you.

397
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
If he doesn't,

398
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
you can decide for yourself.

399
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
I don't believe he won't give it to you.

400
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Don't be so impulsive.

401
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
I am not impulsive.

402
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
After I am done,

403
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,340
I will take care of him.

404
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,340
I have arranged this banquet with you before the trip.

405
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
I have invited Master Li here.

406
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
That Li Zhishi?

407
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
Yes.

408
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Although I didn't see him this time,

409
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,340
I know very well

410
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
about the heart of the right-hand man.

411
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,340
But

412
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,340
I have a small thing to tell you.

413
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Okay.

414
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Tell me more about the palace.

415
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,340
Although Master Li is a man of honor,

416
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
he is very hidden.

417
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
As far as I know, he is very gentle.

418
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,340
But if he is open,

419
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
he should be careful.

420
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
Uncle Zhao.

421
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Master Li.

422
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,340
I am late.

423
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,340
I don't know if I have to disturb you.

424
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,340
No.

425
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
I am waiting for you to open the banquet.

426
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Come on. Sit down.

427
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Master Zhao.

428
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
I sit here.

429
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Here.

430
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Have a taste.

431
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,340
Sit here.

432
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
I will drink.

433
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
Then you can drink.

434
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
I sit here.

435
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
I sit here.

436
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Here.

437
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Master Zhao.

438
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
How much did you drink?

439
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Sit down.

440
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I am thirsty.

441
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Happy.

442
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
I am thirsty.

443
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
Master Li, we meet again.

444
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
We are family.

445
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
What are you buying?

446
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
If you don't understand, ask me.

447
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Ask me.

448
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Okay.

449
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Family is good.

450
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
Family is good.

451
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,340
If you don't understand,

452
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,340
I suddenly remember.

453
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
You said that

454
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,340
the clothes of Li Zhi changed in three days.

455
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,340
Why does the saint have to worry about

456
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,340
the Li Zhi of Lingnan?

457
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,340
The saint has his own reason.

458
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,340
He doesn't dare to take the test.

459
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,340
I suddenly got the wrong idea today.

460
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
The saint is worried about Lingnan.

461
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,340
Yes.

462
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
He is worried about Lingnan.

463
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
Yes.

464
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,340
So, He Ci Shi is back.

465
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,340
He Ci Shi is not back.

466
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Master Li is suspicious.

467
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
I am also suspicious.

468
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,340
I want to ask how Pan Bao died.

469
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,340
Pan Bao died in the hospital.

470
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,340
I will tell you when I come.

471
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Uncle Zhao, do you think

472
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,340
I can't take Li Zhi back to the factory?

473
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,340
The hospital is so boring.

474
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,340
I don't know

475
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,340
why I don't know anything about such a big thing.

476
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Don't you believe that I can take Li Zhi back to the factory?

477
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
Yes.

478
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
You should believe that

479
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Master Li is a good person.

480
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
Why?

481
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
You can do something.

482
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,340
Pan Bao is like this.

483
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,340
The saint has a piece of old cloth

484
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
in the hospital.

485
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
He likes it very much.

486
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,340
The saint has a snake in his right hand.

487
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,340
The saint has a piece of old cloth in the hospital.

488
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,340
No one can tell what happened

489
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,340
in the hospital.

490
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,340
But Pan Bao died in the hospital.

491
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
So, this is the truth.

492
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
He has a piece of old cloth in the hospital.

493
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Master Li,

494
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,340
why do you say that today?

495
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,340
I am not giving the saint a job.

496
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Am I?

497
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
I don't care about the situation.

498
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
And I have expressed my gratitude today.

499
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
I am here with a task.

500
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,340
I can do whatever I want.

501
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
I can do whatever I want.

502
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
Then,

503
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
Master Li,

504
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
do whatever you want.

505
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Do whatever you want.

506
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
Come on.

507
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,340
Cheers.

508
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Cheers.

509
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
As the saying goes,

510
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,340
there is only one way to survive in the sea.

511
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,340
Brother Xie,

512
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
after I get up tomorrow,

513
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,340
you should take good care of my friend.

514
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Brother Gui, wait.

515
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
I know that you are leaving Lingnan today.

516
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,340
I sent a message to He Zi Shi.

517
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,340
He is coming to Lingnan right now.

518
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
Please.

519
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,340
Please, Brother Gui.

520
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Stay for a day.

521
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,340
Tomorrow, you will go back to Lingnan.

522
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
Since that,

523
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
stay for a day.

524
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Lingnan's love.

525
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
Come on.

526
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Come on.

527
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,340
It's a good thing.

528
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Come on, Master Li.

529
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
Come on.

530
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Everyone, drink up.

531
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Drink up.

532
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
Drink up.

533
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
Let's get together to live a happy life.

534
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,340
He Zi Shi,

535
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,340
please come back to Lingnan.

536
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,340
Come on.

537
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Come on.

538
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Come on.

539
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,340
Come on.

540
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
Brother Xie,

541
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
please come back to Lingnan.

542
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,340
Come on.

543
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Come on.

544
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
Come on.

545
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
Come on.

546
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Come on.

547
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
Come on.

548
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
No.

549
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
Thank you, He Zi Shi.

550
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
I am not worried about you.

551
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,340
I have a bad news today.

552
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
No.

553
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
Really?

554
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,340
You are more worried about me than about you.

555
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
I am worried about you.

556
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I am worried about you.

557
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
I am worried about you.

558
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
I am worried about you.

559
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
I am worried about you.

560
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
He Zi Shi,

561
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,340
I have been here for a long time.

562
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,340
You have been here for a long time.

563
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
You have not been able to leave me.

564
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,340
I thought you didn't want to be a soldier.

565
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Dai Man,

566
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
I am really a real man.

567
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
I am not that deep.

568
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
In this way,

569
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
I will drink up and drink up to you.

570
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
I will drink up to you.

571
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
No need.

572
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
He Zi Shi,

573
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I want something that you have brought.

574
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,340
Why don't we...

575
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
exchange it?

576
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
Gui Yu, you are so cruel.

577
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,340
You know that I am really, really

578
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
need this soldier.

579
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,340
But the fact that I like this soldier now,

580
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I don't dare to ask for it.

581
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Why?

582
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,340
Because I am being watched by the left.

583
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Gui Yu,

584
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
you don't understand.

585
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Look,

586
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,340
a leftist wife,

587
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
she said she is a rightist,

588
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
and she killed Tan Wang.

589
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,340
Gui Yu,

590
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,340
you don't know who this person is.

591
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,340
When did you know?

592
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
Brother De,

593
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
you reminded me of something.

594
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,340
You made me realize and break it.

595
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
What did I say?

596
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
You said you made me

597
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
think of Li Jishi's words.

598
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
Li Jishi?

599
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Li Jishi's words?

600
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
He said Li Jishi,

601
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
a third-day plan,

602
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
is a Han Sha camp.

603
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,340
This is the south of the camp.

604
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
I have to let them know

605
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
that I know Li Jishi's mind.

606
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
He said that

607
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
we are in the south

608
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,340
while the emperor of the sky is in the fourth.

609
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,340
What?

610
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,340
There is a rumor that

611
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
the saint

612
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,340
is in the south.

613
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Why is he in the south?

614
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Because the saint is in the south.

615
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
He is a rightist.

616
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
He is trying to fool me.

617
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
He means that we are in the south

618
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,340
and the market is in the south.

619
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
He also said that

620
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
we should

621
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,340
make a promise

622
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,340
and make a promise.

623
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,340
This is the best.

624
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
He is in the south

625
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,340
and he is determined to use his brain.

626
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,340
He is trying to

627
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
make us feel guilty.

628
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,340
This is a rumor.

629
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
I have to say that

630
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,340
I am in the back of the water.

631
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
I have no way out.

632
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
You are right.

633
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,340
Listen.

634
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
You are right.

635
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,340
You are so mean.

636
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,340
I was shocked

637
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,340
by what I heard yesterday.

638
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
You are so mean.

639
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
You are so mean.

640
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Perfect.

641
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,340
So,

642
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
I think

643
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,340
the person who sent the portrait

644
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
is Yushan De.

645
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Yes.

646
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
Such a big thing

647
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
can't be

648
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,340
completely cheated.

649
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
My dear brother.

650
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
I want to ask you.

651
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
The whole Chang'an city,

652
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,340
who doesn't want me to get the uniform?

653
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Of course, the left.

654
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
If the left knows that I sent someone

655
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,340
to Chang'an to take the uniform,

656
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
what will he do?

657
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
Of course, he will kill me.

658
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
So, Pan Bao is dead.

659
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
The left killed Pan Bao?

660
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
The left got the order from Pan Bao.

661
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Yushan sent someone to the south

662
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
to exchange the uniform.

663
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
The one who just appeared in the south

664
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
was the one who appeared.

665
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,340
So, I decided that

666
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
the right one is the left.

667
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Brother Guiyun.

668
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
You are so mean.

669
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,340
I don't want to be cheated.

670
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
You should be careful.

671
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,340
You are telling us that

672
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
there is someone else in the top of Li Shan De.

673
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I and Chief Zhao

674
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
cheated for the whole night.

675
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,340
The left shot is the one who killed me.

676
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Brother Guiyun.

677
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Your kindness.

678
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,340
I am tired.

679
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,340
You two are so good at

680
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,340
calculating things.

681
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
But,

682
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Brother Guiyun.

683
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
I know

684
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
that you will come here

685
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
to take the filial piety of the old man

686
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
to go back to Chang'an.

687
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Otherwise, you can't pay the debt.

688
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,340
But Li Shan De

689
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
is here to take the risk.

690
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,340
It's a deal.

691
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
It's a deal.

692
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
It's a deal.

693
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Now, it's a deal.

694
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
There is no one else in the house.

695
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
I give you the medical uniform.

696
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
You give me the filial piety.

697
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
It's a deal.

698
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
It's so simple.

699
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,340
No.

700
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,340
I have to use the medical uniform

701
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
that I got from the right.

702
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Li Shan De is here.

703
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
How can I use it?

704
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
I have a better idea for you.

705
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
Just take it.

706
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
He is a good man.

707
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
He will teach us right away

708
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,340
as long as he dies.

709
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,340
How is it?

710
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Li Shan De is a good man.

711
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
He is so good at

712
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,340
doing things.

713
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,340
He is so good at acting.

714
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,340
If he really did this,

715
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,340
he would be a good man.

716
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,340
You continue.

717
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,340
If you really killed Li Shan De,

718
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,340
it would be a big deal

719
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,340
if you can't solve the problem.

720
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,340
If An Xian caught the 8th soldier,

721
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
it would be a big deal

722
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,340
if he could destroy He Si Shi.

723
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,340
What do you think?

724
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,340
I will go to the side

725
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,340
of Li Shan De.

726
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,340
If he doesn't leave,

727
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,340
I will know him.

728
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
He trusts me more

729
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
than I do.

730
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
I will think of a way

731
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,340
to get him out of here.

732
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
You are not guilty.

733
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
You are right-handed.

734
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,340
You are good at thinking,

735
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,340
thinking,

736
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,340
and caring.

737
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,340
We are all good at thinking.

738
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,340
If you can send Li Shan De away,

739
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
we will deal with him.

740
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
If you can't get him out,

741
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
I will be there.

742
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Why?

743
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Why?

744
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Why?

745
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Why did this happen?

746
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,340
What a great accident.

747
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,340
They are so smart.

748
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,340
They are so good at thinking.

749
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,340
They are so stupid.

750
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,340
They are making up stories

751
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
that are not easy to get.

752
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
Brother,

753
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
the master is still waiting for you.

754
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
He is not giving you money.

755
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,340
How can we explain it to him?

756
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,340
I will give him an explanation.

757
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Why should I give him an explanation?

758
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,340
This is not a big deal.

759
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,340
He is being cheated by Tong Chai.

760
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
He is the one who is in charge of the city.

761
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,340
He doesn't know why Tong Chai cheated him.

762
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Why he can be cheated?

763
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
He is the one who can be cheated.

764
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
He can only be cheated by me.

765
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
Why are you laughing?

766
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,340
Because I am stupid?

767
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
No, no.

768
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Because I am thinking about the show.

769
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I am a joke.

770
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
I won't get mad at him.

771
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
He is a fool.

772
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
He is a fool.

773
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,340
What should we do now?

774
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,340
I just came here.

775
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
I can't leave Leng Nan.

776
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
You can't leave him.

777
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,340
We should put all the blame on him.

778
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
He must listen to me.

779
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Brother Lishan.

780
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
I won't leave.

781
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Why should I leave when He Yougwang is going to steal my money?

782
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340
We are in a conflict.

783
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,340
We are in a conflict.

784
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Why should I leave?

785
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,340
You don't leave.

786
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,340
I am lucky.

787
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Lucky?

788
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,340
You said you are lucky before you met Zhao Ximing.

789
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,340
Why are you always lucky?

790
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Brother-in-law.

791
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,340
Don't be so formal.

792
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,340
You are not in the right now.

793
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,340
Brother Yan means we are not family.

794
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
I will tell you the truth.

795
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I met He Yougwang today.

796
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
He didn't do my business.

797
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,340
He won't give you the money.

798
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
Why?

799
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,340
I thought I was smarter than them.

800
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,340
But they are smarter than me.

801
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,340
You said last night

802
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,340
how we cooperated and were perfect.

803
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,340
I was already involved in Zhao Ximing's stocks.

804
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Then...

805
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
They gave me the money.

806
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
I have to find it.

807
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
It's useless if you go.

808
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
You won't get the money.

809
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,340
How about this?

810
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
I will help you.

811
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
But you have to promise me.

812
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,340
You will get the money and return to Chang'an.

813
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
I don't need the money.

814
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Why should I leave?

815
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,340
I will keep some more for Xiu Zan.

816
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,340
You don't know what is a weak generation.

817
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
You have to return to Chang'an.

818
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
That's the best way.

819
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
If you are out of your mind

820
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,340
I am worried that you won't see Xiu Zan.

821
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
You have to go back.

822
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
You have some time to accompany Xiu Zan.

823
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,340
I will do my business here.

824
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
I will do my business.

825
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
I will go back.

826
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I will help Xiu Zan.

827
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Xiu Zan.

828
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,340
I have been lucky to have you as my friend.

829
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,340
I was lucky to have you.

830
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,340
I was lucky to have you as my friend.

831
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Because I didn't follow your speed

832
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,340
when I drove with you from Chang'an.

833
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
I didn't follow your speed.

834
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
I didn't want to leave.

835
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
I didn't want to leave.

836
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,580
I chose this

837
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,340
Huai Xi Luo Zi in the right time.

838
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,340
I didn't expect that Luo Xiong is strong and firm.

839
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,340
I was shouting all the way.

840
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,340
I didn't want to go to the south.

841
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:00,340
I heard that you are the leader of the people.

842
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,340
You arranged a good battle for me.

843
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,340
You climbed up the wall and climbed up the wall.

844
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,340
You were so strong.

845
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,340
You were so strong.

846
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,340
You were so strong.

847
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,340
You were so strong.

848
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,340
You were so strong.

849
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,340
You were so strong.

850
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Even the saints can't have such a treatment.

851
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
When I have a good job,

852
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,340
I can go back and join Xiu soon.

853
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,340
I miss you so much.

854
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,340
I dream of you every night.

855
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Xiu.

856
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,340
You said that you didn't break the letter after you left Chang'an.

857
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,340
But you are so filial.

858
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,340
I don't know what I have met in your room.

859
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,340
I don't have Huai Xi Luo.

860
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,340
You are doing a job for the saints.

861
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,340
So you are here to help the people.

862
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
You are so filial.

863
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,340
I know that you are working hard.

864
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,340
When my mother was ill,

865
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:41,340
she asked me to take care of her.

866
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,340
She was so relaxed.

867
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,340
She had a lot of filial piety on her face.

868
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
When she left,

869
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,340
she was crying and crying.

870
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:02,340
This time, I saw her smile on her face.

871
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,340
I knew that you must have met a man who never had me.

872
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,340
I didn't want you to know that.

873
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,340
I pretended to know.

874
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,340
I can't let you be a good person.

875
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,340
You have to worry about me.

876
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
I don't want to be a good person.

877
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I don't want to be a good person.

878
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I will be here any time.

879
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
I will be here any time.

880
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Take care.

881
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,340
I will be here any time.

882
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,340
I will be here any time.

883
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
I will be here any time.

884
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,340
I will be here any time.
