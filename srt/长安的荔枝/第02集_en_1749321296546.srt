1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
The Blind

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,080
The

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
the

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,080
the

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,080
the

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,080
the

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,080
the

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,080
the

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,080
the

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,080
the

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,080
the

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,080
the

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,080
the

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,080
the

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
the

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,080
the

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,080
the

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
the

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,080
the

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,080
the

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
the

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,080
the

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,000
the

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,120
the

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
that

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,000
the

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,040
the

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
the

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,040
the

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
the

32
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Look, this is the flat we chose.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
This study room is really spacious.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
You can put a relative here.

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
You can stay here and take care of your family.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
We just passed Yong'an Qu.

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
It's really convenient to go out and get dressed.

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Next time, we can also get water for Xiu'er and Mu Yu.

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Look at the door.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
This is a very open space.

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
It's convenient to learn how to grow up in the future.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Yes.

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Bu Jun, do you think this taste is familiar?

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
It seems to be聞ed there.

45
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
You ask.

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
It's Xiu'er's taste.

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
I really think so.

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
It means that you are in a good mood.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
It means that you are in a good mood.

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Good.

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Actually, in my heart,

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
you are like a tree.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
You are loyal and reliable.

54
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I just want to marry you.

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
I just want to be happy.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I hope our family can have a peaceful and safe life.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Yes.

58
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,040
It's more important than anything else.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
We are all together.

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
When we grow up,

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
we will go out in the spring and go out in the summer.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
We will see each other in the summer and in the winter.

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
We will go out in the autumn and in the winter.

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
We will go out in the winter and in the summer.

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Xiu'er.

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
What are you doing?

68
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Get up.

69
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Get up.

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Get up.

71
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Get up.

72
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Get down.

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Don't let go of me.

74
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Get up.

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Get up.

76
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Get up.

77
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Get up.

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Get up.

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Mr. Lu.

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Mr. Lu.

81
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm a doctor.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Mr. Lu.

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Get up.

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
He still wants to get up.

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Get up.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,040
It's only a matter of death.

87
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I got a pain from a doctor yesterday.

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Please, Mr. Lu, please.

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Please.

90
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Mr. Lu.

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Mr. Lu.

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Mr. Lu.

93
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
It's a pity that he's dead.

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
He's only got a witness.

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,040
It's a pity that he's dead.

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Mr. Lu.

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Can you give me some news?

98
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
That's a secret.

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Then it's easy.

100
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
There's still a chance.

101
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
I heard the right-hand man yesterday.

102
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
He wanted to send the soldier to Linnan.

103
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Now he's dead.

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
I can take care of the right-hand man.

105
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
If I get the evidence,

106
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
I can move to the right-hand man.

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I can share the right-hand man with the left-hand man.

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
If I fail,

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
I won't be involved in the wrong.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
I'll do my best.

111
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm willing to punish you.

112
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Then I'll make sure that

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I've met the right-hand man before.

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
If he goes back to Linnan,

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
what will happen?

116
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Before I die,

117
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
I'll get rid of him first.

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Pan Bao went to the capital this time

119
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
to give His Majesty a few precious books.

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Today,

121
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
he'll be in the Leyou Garden.

122
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm Pan Bao.

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm the commander of the High State.

124
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm here to report to you.

125
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
But this Leyou Garden is a royal garden.

126
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
How...

127
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
How should I see you?

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Lu Si Cheng, don't worry.

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
You just need to give me a card

130
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
of the High State.

131
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I have my own arrangement.

132
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
What are you doing here?

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
We're the colleagues of the Li family.

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
The High State's family.

135
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
He said that

136
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
some of the leading men from Linnan

137
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
couldn't come over

138
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
to help us.

139
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Which Li family?

140
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Li Shan De.

141
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
His head is very big.

142
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
His head is very small.

143
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
His head is very big.

144
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
His head is very small.

145
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
He often treats the flowers

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
as his aunt.

147
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
What?

148
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Mudan,

149
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
you look more like a girl.

150
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
If I fail again,

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I'll kill myself.

152
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Lu Si Cheng,

153
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I'll go.

154
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Kill me.

155
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Okay.

156
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
This is Pan Bao's Bij BelONG located.

157
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Once he Mittel,

158
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
or else they will shoot you at that time.

159
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
I?

160
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Yes.

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
I must get him into residence.

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
It's not a big deal.

163
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
When you move,

164
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
the movement is fast and the sound is small.

165
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
You must deal with it like an accident.

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Did you hear that?

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Yes.

168
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Li Jian, why are you here?

169
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Didn't you come to Shaolin Academy?

170
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Shaolin Academy?

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
No, I have something else.

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Is there an internal affairs of Yu Chengen?

173
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Yu Chengen is in the house.

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Sorry.

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Yu Chengen.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
I am Shan De from Shaolin Academy.

177
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
I have met Yu Chengen.

178
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Shaolin Academy?

179
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Are you here to help the public?

180
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Yes.

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Then tell me, what is this book?

182
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
This is Lingnan's

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Black Tea.

184
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
It's also called Black Tan.

185
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
It's the most suitable for the disaster.

186
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,040
It's suitable for the big disaster.

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
It's really good.

188
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
It's a gift from Gao Zhou.

189
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
It's for the holy man.

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
When it's a disaster,

191
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,040
it's a rule that there must be a woman in the palace.

192
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
I asked the person from Lingnan to come today.

193
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
If you know these things,

194
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
it's not good enough.

195
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Yes.

196
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Actually, I came today

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,040
to ask you something.

198
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
I heard that you received a

199
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
holy man's order

200
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
saying that the holy man should eat the holy paper.

201
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Why do you ask this?

202
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I am not a businessman.

203
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,040
I usually take care of these things.

204
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Actually, I took the order to do the paper.

205
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I want to ask the consequence of the money.

206
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I can do it in a reasonable way.

207
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
So you are the unlucky paper.

208
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Actually, there is no consequence of the money.

209
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
It's just that the holy man wants to eat the new paper.

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,040
So he sent a paper to buy it.

211
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
That's all.

212
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,040
The holy man really wants to eat the new paper.

213
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
He doesn't use the paper to cover up the trouble.

214
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
There are too many paper in the palace.

215
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Why did he send you to buy such a paper?

216
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,040
The new paper is broken in three days.

217
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
No one reminds the holy man.

218
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
The holy man is a man of the world.

219
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
What did he say?

220
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
We are the only people who can do the paper.

221
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,040
You want to remind him that you are smarter than the holy man.

222
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
No.

223
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
If the holy man wants to eat the new paper,

224
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,040
then give him the new paper.

225
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
As for whether he can move here,

226
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,040
it's your paper that should be careful.

227
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
But it's really hard to move here.

228
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,040
It's harder than the holy man to go to the heaven to seek the new paper.

229
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
If it's really hard to move here,

230
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
then we can only apologize to him.

231
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Mother, I'm not just talking about the wind and the wind.

232
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm talking about the truth.

233
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,040
If he dies, the business will be over.

234
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,040
The situation is not like that.

235
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
The paper.

236
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Do I know you?

237
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
I know you.

238
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
I don't only know you, but also know you.

239
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Did you see that man yesterday?

240
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
No.

241
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Do you know him?

242
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
He's very angry.

243
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
He thinks he's been involved.

244
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
What does that man have to do with you?

245
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I...

246
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
How could I let go of fire?

247
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Let's talk somewhere else.

248
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
What's going on?

249
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
What's going on?

250
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Wake up!

251
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Wake up!

252
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Wake up!

253
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Come on!

254
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Come on!

255
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Wake up!

256
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Why did he go down again?

257
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I just pulled him out.

258
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,040
You're already dead.

259
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
You still want to save him?

260
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Brother Liang Yuan.

261
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Brother Liang Yuan.

262
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Brother Liang Yuan.

263
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Brother Liang Yuan.

264
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Brother Liang Yuan, you're so ignorant.

265
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
You don't know the power of the country.

266
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
You're a man of the people.

267
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
You don't know what happened.

268
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
The Ministry of Rites was given the position of Hexi.

269
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
But he pushed it.

270
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
That's why the right-wing, the law, and the military are in the same position.

271
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Although it's a dangerous position, it's a state of emergency.

272
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
The Holy People are in the good times.

273
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
The beauty stays in Chang'an.

274
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
There's always a way out.

275
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,040
I'm not willing to be the military.

276
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
It's for the sake of the people.

277
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Otherwise, the family will be in trouble.

278
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Mr. Wu Liu can't be the one to blame.

279
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
My heart is in a hurry.

280
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Don't say that.

281
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
You were brought up by the Holy People.

282
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
It's different from our laws.

283
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Don't laugh.

284
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
What's wrong?

285
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,040
You're so ridiculous.

286
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
It's hard to get away from the power.

287
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
The power can't be changed.

288
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Don't tell me...

289
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,040
You're talking about the Holy People.

290
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
The Holy People are in the bad times.

291
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
What's the point of him?

292
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Who dares to persuade the Ministry of Rites?

293
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Those Yashu people are pushing it.

294
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,040
No one dares to let the Holy People withdraw their lives.

295
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,040
The Holy People are in the bad times.

296
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
What a pity.

297
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
The system is still in the past.

298
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,040
The people are still in the bad times.

299
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
The Emperor's order is not to be cancelled.

300
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,040
The best way to find a good one is to find a good one.

301
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Take this job.

302
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
If you can't do it, you'll die.

303
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,040
That's the best way to find a good one.

304
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,040
You've played with mahogany before.

305
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:10,360
You're the most important

306
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,040
in the world.

307
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,040
I just borrowed 150 yuan from Pingkang's house.

308
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,040
I don't care about my death.

309
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,040
I'm afraid my family will be sold out.

310
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,040
You know, this kid has always been my rent.

311
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,040
It's hard to get him out.

312
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
I haven't seen Yueming yet.

313
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Maybe he's just a little bit too old.

314
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
How could I not know?

315
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm far away from Fengxian.

316
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm also suffering from a lot of hardships.

317
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
I'm so worried.

318
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
But if I leave Chang'an...

319
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Simei, don't be so anxious.

320
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Brother Liang, have you ever seen the line on the cliff?

321
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Have you ever seen the line on the cliff?

322
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,040
The line was made in June.

323
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Haven't you heard of it?

324
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Noble Consort, the production of the device was made in June.

325
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Then this new device was a gift from the saint to the Noble Consort?

326
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,040
If it was for the Noble Consort's production,

327
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I'm afraid it's more important than the saint's own business.

328
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Who dares to make a fool out of such a big thing?

329
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
What about after June?

330
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Put the child in a safe place.

331
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Give the child to a trusted man.

332
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
A trusted man.

333
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Another bowl of tofu.

334
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Let's eat.

335
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Grandfather, make some Fengshen.

336
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
We're celebrating today.

337
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I have two good things to tell you.

338
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
What good things?

339
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Legs.

340
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
They don't look like girls.

341
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
The first good thing is that

342
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I bought our old house.

343
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
I don't need to follow you anymore.

344
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
I can live in the East and West.

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Really?

346
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Yes.

347
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
When are we going back?

348
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Not yet.

349
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
There's another thing to do.

350
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Didn't you save your mother this time?

351
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
You've earned a lot of money.

352
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
You've earned the reward of the saint.

353
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
The saint said that

354
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,040
he would send me to do a more important job.

355
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
But you have to go out to the door.

356
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Only you can do this job?

357
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Yes.

358
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
You've earned a lot of money.

359
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
How can you do this?

360
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Can you take me out with you?

361
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,040
You have to focus on your work.

362
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
You can go back early.

363
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Right?

364
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,040
You may have to stay at the old house.

365
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,040
When I come back, we'll move out immediately.

366
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,040
But I can't do this often.

367
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,040
I will never do this.

368
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Take these money.

369
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
I can't guarantee that you'll be fine.

370
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,040
But it's enough for you to live for a while.

371
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
I've already changed the two levels for you.

372
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,040
From now on, you are free.

373
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Take it.

374
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Take the money.

375
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Go.

376
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I don't want it.

377
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,040
As a servant, I have the honor to be with you.

378
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Even if you were expelled from the royal family,

379
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,040
you would never leave me.

380
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Please don't be so modest.

381
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Today is different from the past.

382
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,040
You died in the south.

383
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,040
You have been with me for a long time.

384
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
I was in a grave danger.

385
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I didn't read any books.

386
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
But I was touched.

387
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
I named my son.

388
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I told him that I wanted to be a good person.

389
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I wanted to be loyal.

390
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Thank you for taking me to my family.

391
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
If I leave you,

392
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,040
I will have no family.

393
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,040
I will follow you forever.

394
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I will protect you by your side.

395
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
I will kill you.

396
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
You know nothing.

397
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,040
You are a child.

398
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,040
You are a child.

399
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Get out.

400
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I'm not afraid of death.

401
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Jilong, don't kill my son.

402
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Don't kill my son.

403
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't kill my son.

404
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Tell me.

405
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Can I go back to the city?

406
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I will go back to the city.

407
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
I will go back to the city.

408
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,140
Tell me.

409
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,040
My god,

410
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,040
I will leave my house to you.

411
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Even if I am not with you anymore,

412
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
you can still love me.

413
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
I am lonely.

414
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I am lonely.

415
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I am happy to have a girl like you.

416
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,040
She is kind and pure.

417
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
She is not shy.

418
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,040
I entrust my daughter to the seven brothers.

419
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Li Shande is the most talented man in all of the property.

420
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
He is very generous.

421
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,040
He is kind and generous.

422
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
He is very generous.

423
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,040
He is rich and generous.

424
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
He is a good man.

425
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Li Shande.

426
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Come with me.

427
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I am going to the kitchen.

428
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Let's go.

429
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Come.

430
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Come.

431
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Aunt.

432
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,040
The wife said that the house is here.

433
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
I am looking for her.

434
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I have to go to the garden.

435
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Xiul may live in her uncle's house.

436
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,040
My wife also wants to go to the garden.

437
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
She doesn't know the truth.

438
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
I am leaving.

439
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Dog.

440
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Dog.

441
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
No.

442
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Where is she going?

443
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
When will she come back?

444
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I don't know.

445
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
I am leaving.

446
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Dog.

447
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Dog.

448
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Aunt.

449
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Ping'an will come back first.

450
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Let her remember to go to the embroidery workshop.

451
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I know.

452
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Remember?

453
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Yes.

454
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Remember.

455
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes.

456
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Aunt, don't forget to pick me up.

457
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
I can't forget.

458
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Uncle.

459
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Uncle.

460
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Li Janshi.

461
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Congratulations.

462
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
You are blessed.

463
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Look.

464
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I just bought the house.

465
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
I am Li Janshi now.

466
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
I am so lucky.

467
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,040
My wife said that you are leaving.

468
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
She wants me to come here

469
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,040
to support you and your business.

470
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Think about it.

471
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
How can you

472
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
earn more wealth by spending less?

473
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,040
I am Li Janshi, the emperor.

474
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
I am the emperor.

475
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
I will return the money to you in June.

476
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I will return it in June.

477
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I understand.

478
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,040
It means that the merit is not the reward.

479
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
It is the time.

480
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Yes.

481
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,040
But it is said that you are blessed in June.

482
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
I am not saying that.

483
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
I am saying that.

484
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
I am saying that.

485
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,040
It seems that the 17th mother only gives up her life

486
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
and can keep the fortune.

487
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Fine.

488
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Thank you for your help.

489
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
You can give me the house.

490
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
I can't give you the house.

491
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
I will return the money in June.

492
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
The 17th mother said that

493
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
your daughter is going to school here.

494
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I advise you to learn more about fortune

495
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
and earn more money.

496
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
You are a woman.

497
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
You are a woman.

498
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
You are a woman.

499
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
I am telling you.

500
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
If you hit my daughter's idea,

501
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
I will not forgive you.

502
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Money.

503
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
I will pay for it.

504
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
But you are going to die here.

505
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
I will pay for the debt.

506
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
You are going to die.

507
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
You are going to die.

508
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
You are going to die.

509
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
You are going to die.

510
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Do you understand?

511
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Do you want to stay here?

512
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Do you want to stay here?

513
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
It is hot.

514
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
It is hot.

515
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
It is hot.

516
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Liu Shuling.

517
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Liu Mian.

518
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
What are you doing here?

519
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I am here.

520
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I am here.

521
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Don't talk nonsense.

522
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
I am busy here.

523
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I want to pay for it from Liu Shuling.

524
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
What?

525
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
The last Feng Lu was sold out.

526
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
It is not Feng Lu.

527
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I am not a good person.

528
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
It is hard to get a job.

529
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
It is a big deal.

530
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Money needs to be collected from the palace.

531
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Who will send you the money?

532
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Who will you find?

533
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Go.

534
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Don't bother me.

535
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Liu Shuling.

536
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
You asked me to pay for the debt.

537
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
You can't ignore it.

538
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
What are you talking about?

539
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
It is your own money.

540
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
I didn't pay for it.

541
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
You know

542
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
I have a daughter.

543
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I just borrowed money to buy a house.

544
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
You are so cruel.

545
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
You have to pay for it.

546
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
You can't give a chance to a person.

547
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Don't talk nonsense.

548
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,040
You can do it when the saint asks you to.

549
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
What are you doing here?

550
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
I want to pay for it.

551
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I need to pay for the debt.

552
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
I can't pay for it.

553
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,040
The saint is in charge of the royal family.

554
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I am the one who needs to pay for the debt.

555
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
It is the saint's job.

556
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I didn't do it.

557
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I mean it.

558
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
It has nothing to do with the saint.

559
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
You know

560
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Li Zhi can't get pregnant.

561
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I am dead.

562
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
You want me to die alone?

563
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Or do you want to die alone?

564
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
No.

565
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
What do you mean?

566
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Nonsense.

567
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Li Zhi can't get pregnant.

568
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
It is the saint's job.

569
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
You are the evil one.

570
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
You don't know Li Zhi.

571
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
You don't care about the saint's heart.

572
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
You have a purpose to the Noble Consort.

573
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
You don't want her to be late for Li Zhi.

574
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
You are the one who is dead.

575
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
You?

576
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Did you steal the Star Palace last year?

577
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
20 gold coins.

578
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
You are the one who is in charge of the rest.

579
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
I didn't do it.

580
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
You?

581
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
You are the one who is going to the temple to hunt the gold.

582
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Is it better to go there?

583
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
It is you.

584
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
It is you.

585
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Don't move.

586
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
And you.

587
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
You sold the Star Palace last year.

588
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
You are so good.

589
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
You are all crying.

590
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Is it you?

591
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
You.

592
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
You are all

593
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
the one who is in charge of the temple.

594
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
You are the one who is in charge of the rest.

595
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
You are bullying the teacher.

596
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I tell you.

597
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
You will get the money if you are in a hurry.

598
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
I am out of here today.

599
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
You don't give me money.

600
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
I tell you.

601
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
In the future,

602
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
if you are in charge of the temple,

603
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
you will be in charge of the rest of the temple.

604
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
You will die with me.

605
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
You are in charge of the rest of the temple.

606
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
You are in charge of the rest of the temple.

607
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Shut up.

608
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Shut up.

609
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Listen to me.

610
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Before the 6th month of the lunar month,

611
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
you all have to listen to me.

612
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,040
I am in charge of the rest of the temple.

613
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,040
I have been so happy to come to the military class.

614
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Even Mr. Zheng has not seen me for days.

615
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
It's dangerous.

616
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
The money is all in the boat.

617
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Which wall is the money transfer?

618
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
It must be 17 seconds.

619
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Who else can it be?

620
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Du Xiaoman.

621
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Du Xiaoman.

622
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
How can she have a back-up?

623
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Du Xiaoman is 100 degrees in the distance.

624
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
His strength is so strong.

625
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
We are the sky.

626
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
They will be here in a minute.

627
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
17 seconds.

628
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Don't panic.

629
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Find our boat.

630
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
We have merit and fortune.

631
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
It's not possible.

632
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
They are in charge of the rest of the temple.

633
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
They are 4.9% of the annual exchange rate.

634
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Let's go.

635
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
Let's go to the training.

636
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
The money transfer rate.

637
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
The business partner is good at helping.

638
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
The money transfer rate is found by Du Xiaoman.

639
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
Good at saving.

640
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Good at saving.

641
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,040
The money we earned before June 1st was here.

642
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
When June 1st comes,

643
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
I will return the interest to Chang'an.

644
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
I will pay you back the rest of the money.

645
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Half a life.

646
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
I was a man who wanted to marry me.

647
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
But he took half a life away.

648
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
I fell in love with Duan Qing.

649
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
I thought of Dongshan.

650
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
But I was a half-naked mother.

651
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
I had no charm.

652
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
I could only help the guests.

653
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I could make a loan for myself.

654
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
I could make a loan for myself.

655
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
I didn't expect that

656
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
I was a man who was only a couple.

657
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Uncle Han.

658
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
He has returned the interest to Chang'an.

659
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Why is my face so bitter?

660
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
It's bitter.

661
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
I will die if I want to die.

662
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
You are so stubborn.

663
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
What if I die?

664
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
All men like to lie to me.

665
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Mr. Zheng.

666
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
He came to Pingkao to find me.

667
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Since he became your treasure,

668
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
he can't see his shadow now.

669
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
If this is the last move,

670
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
I will become a dead man.

671
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
I just lost my life.

672
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Your daughter and I

673
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
will become slaves.

674
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
I tell you.

675
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
On the first day of June,

676
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
no matter how much I die,

677
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
I will not burn you even if I have money.

678
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
But before that,

679
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
you dare to touch my daughter's hair.

680
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
I will kill you and kill you.

681
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
What are you talking about?

682
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,040
You bought the house and you took the house.

683
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
I didn't take it.

684
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Then you only trust me.

685
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
You only trust me.

686
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
You only trust me.

687
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
I will keep your life.

688
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
You only trust me.

689
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
Listen to me.

690
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
You kids are all warning her.

691
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Okay.

692
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Look at the camera.

693
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Aunt.

694
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Don't forget our appointment.

695
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
When the expensive flowers bloom,

696
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
you must come back.

697
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
I can't forget.

698
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
I made this.

699
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Aunt, you put this on.

700
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
Just like Xiu'er has been with you.

701
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I will be with you.

702
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Aunt, you must come back early.

703
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
Listen to me.

704
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Xiu'er, come.

705
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
The expensive flowers bloom in August.

706
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
I remember that

707
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
the birthday ceremony of the princess was in June.

708
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
How did you lie to the child

709
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
that you will come back in autumn?

710
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Ziqing gave birth to a child.

711
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
I didn't want the child to be gone so early.

712
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Actually, I was in the house

713
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
and I was killed by the expensive flowers.

714
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
I will be with you.

715
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
I will be with you forever.

716
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Brother Liang Yuan, take care.

717
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
We know each other.

718
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
We are so different today.

719
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I don't know if I can see you again in my life.

720
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Brother.

721
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Why did you come so early today?

722
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:21,460
I am

723
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040

gan

731
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,180
Take your hand over this!

732
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,060
Becilia!

733
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:28,340
There's no way you could have survived since you hit her!

734
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,240
So he has already gone?

735
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,460
You can come along?

736
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,880
You can't leave the house until he turns up, dear!

737
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,280
We willists on our side manages to fight hard!

738
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,600
Huby, go to hell before he acts now!

739
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,100
We have installed all in a bit!

740
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
The next day

741
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,100
The next day

742
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,100
The next day

743
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
The next day

744
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
The next day

745
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
The next day

746
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Li Shan De

747
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Ping An

748
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,100
I'm Ma Kun Yun

749
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,100
Who's Ma Kun Yun?

750
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,100
I'm not Ma Kun Yun

751
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
You're drunk

752
