1
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:08,083
Black.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,333
White.

3
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:31,667
Grey.

4
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,292
and Purple.

5
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,125
How do I avoid it today?

6
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,833
What are you thinking?　-huh?

7
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,292
I asked you
what you wanted to have for dinner.

8
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,250
Ah...

9
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,125
Let's... have

10
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,125
Kimchi Jjim (Steamed kimchi and pork)
then.

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,000
Kimchi Jjim?　-Yeah.

12
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,458
Okay.

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,500
Am I broken somewhere?

14
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,250
Thanks for walking me home.

15
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,875
You didn't have to come all the way here.

16
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:07,917
What are you doing?

17
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:15,375
My breath smells like kimch.

18
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,208
So what?

19
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,583
I'm fine with that.

20
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,625
I'm not fine with that.

21
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,208
Okay.

22
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,583
I'm going home then.

23
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,250
Junhee.

24
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,542
Hug me.

25
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,958
You arem't mad, right?

26
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,333
I am not mad.

27
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,083
That's good.

28
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,167
Okay, then I'm going in.

29
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:21,167
It's late. You should get home soon.

30
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,458
Should I also stay a bit?

31
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,000
Ah, my sister's here
visiting from Gwangju.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,458
Ah I see.

33
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,833
I have no choice then.

34
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,083
I'm leaving.

35
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,542
Okay, get home safely.

36
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,375
(Are you at school?)

37
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,750
(Yes, you?)

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,542
(On my way. What are you up to?)

39
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,333
(Cramming for the exam with Mikyung.)

40
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,250
(Okay. I will talk to you later then.)

41
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,958
(Ok, see you soon, honey.)

42
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,667
See you soon, honey.

43
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,792
What are you doing?

44
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,917
Sweet times.

45
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,500
How long have you guys been together?

46
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,917
Hasn't it been a while?

47
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,917
It will be 200th day soon.

48
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you going to do
for your 200th day anniversary?

49
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,500
I don't know yet.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,125
Seriously.

51
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,542
You are so used to receiving, aren't you?

52
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,208
No It's not like that.　-I envy you.

53
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,125
What's there to envy.

54
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,875
After 3 years with Dongeun,

55
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,125
I feel like there's no freshness.

56
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,833
Freshness?　-Yeah

57
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,417
Mikyung　-Yeah?

58
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,750
I have something to say.

59
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,000
What is it?

60
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:53,625
You do... everything with Dongeun, right?

61
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,083
What are you talking about?

62
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,958
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

63
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,417
You know how long we've been together.

64
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,417
We do.

65
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,208
I thought you had something to say

66
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,208
but why are you asking me
this kind of question instead of saying ?

67
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,792
Do you... like it?

68
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:23,125
Hey, seriously?

69
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,375
I really want to know.

70
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,375
Why would I do it if I didn't like it?

71
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,833
Do you not like it?

72
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,250
I don't know.

73
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:41,167
It just hurts and it's dirty,
and I don't care for it.

74
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,500
You guys have moved quickly.

75
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,708
I am not talking about that now.

76
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,125
Junhee is your first, right?

77
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,375
It will get better.

78
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,333
Was that your case?　-Yeah.

79
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,958
This drives me crazy.
I don't understand a thing.

80
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,083
(What are you up to?)

81
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,500
(Just lying in bed. You?)

82
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,917
(Me, too. I'll sleep soon.)

83
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,125
(You must be tired. Go to sleep soon.)

84
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,042
(Yeah, good night. I love you.)

85
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,375
(I love you, too. Good night.)

86
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:19,042
(We are meeting tomorrow, right?)

87
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:22,167
(Yes, 3pm tomorrow.)

88
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,917
(Okay, I will see you there then.)

89
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:29,958
(See you tomorrow.)

90
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:16,833
(Wanna go watch a movie later?)

91
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:22,708
(I am not feeling well.)
(I will just stay home today.)

92
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:28,625
(Are you sick?)

93
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,125
Hello.

94
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,750
Hello.

95
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,292
Let me just order coffee and come back.

96
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,417
Okay.

97
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,542
We are the same age.
Let's just use the informal.

98
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,292
Sure. Let's do that.

99
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,125
What a coincidence.
We go to the same university.

100
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,750
I know, right?

101
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,833
(Are you okay?)

102
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,292
(Do you need any medicine?)

103
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,333
I think you look prettier in person
than in the picture.

104
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,708
Yeonhee

105
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,833
Sorry for being late.
Were you waiting for long?

106
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,042
No, it's okay.

107
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,917
You know it's like
you are always the same.

108
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:56,333
Yeah? I'm comfortable this way.

109
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,042
Is it weird?

110
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,125
No, it suits you well.

111
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,750
Thank you.

112
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,667
How was the exam?

113
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,792
I failed,
but not as badly because of you.

114
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,958
I probably did worse than you did.

115
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,167
Yeonhee.

116
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,833
Hello.

117
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,708
Hello.

118
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,125
Are you done with the class?　-Yes.

119
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,042
I think I should run for the other class.

120
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,000
Call me later.

121
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,625
Okay, Mikyung.　-Bye.

122
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,833
Do you have any plans?

123
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:43,750
No, not much. I'll go home soon.

124
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,333
I left something at the common room.
Let's stop by there.

125
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,958
Sure.

126
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,167
(What are you doing today?)

127
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,042
Are you feeling better?

128
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,458
Yes, I am better now.

129
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,458
Didn't you miss me?

130
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,125
I missed you.

131
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,667
What? I missed you so much.

132
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,250
Do you meet me only for my body?

133
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,458
No, I don't.

134
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,583
Yeonhee.

135
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,958
(Sorry for the late reply.)

136
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,500
(What a quick response.)
(What are you doing?)

137
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,042
(Just chilling alone.)

138
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:50,042
(Where are you?)

139
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,083
(At the bench in school.)

140
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:04,750
(Wait there for a bit.)

141
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,083
(What?)

142
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,792
Why aren't you going home?
Why are you still here?

143
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,875
I don't know. I just am.

144
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,167
This beer's good.

145
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,417
Yeah, true.

146
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,708
Let's go somewhere
and have another drink after this.

147
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,500
Sure.

148
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,083
Yeonhee　-Yes?

149
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:25,333
I want to take a shower, too.
Do you have any comfortable clothes?

150
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,083
Yes, I will give you one.

151
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,417
Yes?

152
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,167
Can I sleep in your bed, too?

153
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,667
(Why aren't you responding?)

154
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:50,500
(Call me when you see this.)

155
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,167
(Are you still mad?)

156
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,958
(I'm sorry.)

157
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,458
Hey.

158
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,875
What's the problem?

159
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,542
I'm sorry.

160
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,167
Sorry for what?

161
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,583
For not responding.

162
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,417
Why didn't you respond?

163
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,458
I'm sorry.

164
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,833
Were you playing with me?

165
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,083
No, I wasn't

166
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,542
Then What?

167
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:35,500
I was just...

168
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:49,708
Hey.

169
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:58,042
Hit me.

170
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,375
What?

171
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,708
Hit me.

172
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,542
What's wrong with you?

173
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,875
Hit me.

174
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,667
What are you doing?

175
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,917
It hurts, right?

176
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,250
It doesn't hurt for me.

177
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,125
It sounds crazy.

178
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,458
You won't understand,

179
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,542
because it hurts for you.

180
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,833
Hello.　-Yeonhee, where are you?

181
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,250
Mikyung,
I am not in the mood to talk right now.

182
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,875
Yeonhee, Yeonhee, don't hang up.

183
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,917
It's an urgent matter.

184
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,542
What's going on?

185
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,083
I really need your help. Please?

186
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,875
I'm begging as a friend.

187
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,417
Please come to the main lecture hall
