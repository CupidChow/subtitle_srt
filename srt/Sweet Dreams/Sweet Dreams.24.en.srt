51

Secretary Chen.

52
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,417
Sending coffee to Mr. Bo?

53
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,334
Let me do it for you.

54
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,375
My civet coffee.

55
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:19,250
Come in.

56
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,542
Coffee for you, Mr. Bo.

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:30,417
Thank you.

58
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,542
I hear adequate rest

59
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,876
improves the work efficiency.

60
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,250
Would you like to enjoy some coffee

61
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:36,250
and have a rest?

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,584
You’re done here.

63
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:38,250
Leave me.

64
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,000
You didn’t sleep well last night.

65
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,999
I want you to go to bed early.

66
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,375
I was drunk last night.

67
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,042
But I fell asleep when I was back in my room.

68
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,375
And I had a sound sleep.

69
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,125
So, you forgot

70
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:01,876
what had happened

71
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:02,918
after you went back?

72
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,000
What happened?

73
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,000
Nothing.

74
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:21,751
Secretary Chen.

75
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:22,834
Why are you still here?

76
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,459
I have something to tell you.

77
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:27,584
Some new experts

78
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,417
have come.

79
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,834
Go take care of them with Yi.

80
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,292
And please do me a favor.

81
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:34,334
What is it?

82
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:38,751
What happened last night,

83
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,125
please cover it up

84
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,083
for Zhou Xinyan.

85
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:43,042
If Mr. Bo asked about it,

86
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,292
tell him I was to blame.

87
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:45,542
I took the wrong room card.

88
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,292
Okay?

89
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,751
Don’t bother.

90
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,167
He doesn’t remember anything.

91
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:50,542
Really?

92
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,125
Finally, I plucked up courage

93
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,459
and told him I liked him.

94
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,250
But soon he forgot it.

95
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,334
Well, I’m experienced in

96
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,959
getting hammered.

97
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,751
He doesn’t remember it now.

98
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,959
But maybe he’ll remember it some other day.

99
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,292
Seriously?

100
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,584
How soon can he remember?

101
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:26,999
How soon?

102
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,375
I don’t know.

103
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,709
Baoni, you’re always resourceful.

104
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,083
Help me with it!

105
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:48,334
Why don’t you try reproducing the scene?

106
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,751
Reproducing the scene?

107
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,375
Reproducing the…

108
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:56,334
I’ll think it over.

109
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,125
No more lunch?

110
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,417
Reproducing the scene.

111
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,209
What are you eating?

112
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,709
Looks great.

113
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,125
Chicken.

114
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:33,501
Egg.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,584
Turnip.

116
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:35,876
Shredded potatoes.

117
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,501
Can’t you recognize them?

118
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,792
I love shredded potatoes.

119
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,792
Too… too many.

120
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:00,292
You love shredded potatoes.

121
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:02,709
I don’t love them.

122
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,834
These days, there’s some little problems

123
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,876
with marketing channels.

124
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:19,999
Several agencies

125
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,125
have a few complaints about

126
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,876
the regional price policy.

127
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,417
They want it to be flatter,

128
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:24,167
especially in first-tier cities.

129
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:24,751
What are you doing?

130
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,751
I’m saving you, understand?

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,626
You know what?

132
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,000
Bo Hai doesn’t remember

133
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,167
what happened last night.

134
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,834
Don’t bite the hook.

135
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,000
Xinyan.

136
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:34,417
You may leave.

137
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,375
Come with me.

138
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:48,501
I asked you here,

139
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:49,792
to tell you two things.

140
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,751
First,

141
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,334
I told Luo Xiannian

142
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,125
to cancel David’s bonus for this month,

143
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,959
because he made me drunk deliberately.

144
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:57,334
Besides,

145
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,000
I don’t want anyone to change my room

146
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,459
without telling me.

147
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:01,792
Hope nothing like this

148
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,167
will ever happen again.

149
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:05,709
Mr. Bo, I…

150
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,459
Let me finish.

151
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:08,542
Second,

152
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,876
I want to apologize to you.

153
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,792
Some of my behaviors

154
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,083
may have caused some misunderstanding.

155
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:20,667
But since we met,

156
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:21,667
I’ve been taking you

157
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,876
as my best assistant,

158
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,375
and most reliable friend.

159
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,876
But that’s all.

160
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:29,375
So,

161
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,167
don’t waste

162
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,501
your energy or love on me.

163
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,459
Have I made myself clear?

164
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:42,959
Yes.

165
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

166
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,834
Xinyan, why are you crying?

167
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,542
What did he say?

168
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:35,000
And that even made you cry?

169
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:35,876
Did he

170
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:36,959
still remember what happened?

171
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:54,751
All right. All right.

172
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,334
Stop crying.

173
00:08:58,667 --> 00:08:59,792
You like him.

174
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,250
But I have warned you before.

175
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,792
Well, you know.

176
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,709
He never does sweet talks.

177
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,459
But you two…

178
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:18,501
Anyway,

179
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,709
I will never give up.

180
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:08,667
How do you feel?

181
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:10,083
Do you feel like

182
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,709
opening the gate of time

183
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,751
and a lot of memories

184
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,751
rushing right into

185
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,209
your mind?

186
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:17,250
No!

187
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:31,292
How about this?

188
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,459
Shouldn’t props

189
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,292
help to get the memories back?

190
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,542
Why didn’t they work?

191
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,417
You fail to work attentively.

192
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,501
And you even come to disturb me.

193
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:49,459
Ling Lingqi.

194
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:50,626
Are you going to

195
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,918
lose the bonus for this month again?

196
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,125
No. No. I want it.

197
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,083
Continue with your work.

198
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,250
I’ll stay with you.

199
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:04,626
When you’re making noise,

200
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,167
how can I focus on my work?

201
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:07,792
Why?

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,959
What do you mean why?

203
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:13,792
Can you not

204
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,209
focus on your work

205
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,792
because you always think of me?

206
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,501
You...

207
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:25,959
You’ve got a ruddy nerve!

208
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,959
Didn’t I ask you leave early?

209
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:46,000
But you still waited for me.

210
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,125
How stubborn you are!

211
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,792
Because I’m your bestie!

212
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:54,459
Oh, dear.

213
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,083
What? Have a cold?

214
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,918
Come on. Come.

215
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,667
Here. A warm scarf.

216
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:05,876
Thank you.

217
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:14,459
Why are you staring at me?

218
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:15,250
I have a running nose?

219
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,959
I… I just wonder

220
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:22,375
what you’re thinking

221
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,459
in your mind.

222
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:25,667
Why are you entranced

223
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:26,918
by a mere man?

224
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,375
Let me put it this way.

225
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,459
If you like someone,

226
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,250
you feel more delighted

227
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,125
when he’s happy

228
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:36,918
than you are.

229
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,417
And when he’s sad,

230
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,792
you feel your heart aching,

231
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:41,250
sadder than him.

232
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,334
Sometimes it’s understandable

233
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,334
when you do stupid things for him.

234
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,459
Just because you like him.

235
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,542
Anyway, you will understand

236
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:50,459
when you like someone.

237
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,042
How do you know

238
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,375
I don’t like anyone?

239
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,250
But Qi,

240
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,584
love is about two of you.

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,209
If Bo Hai still

242
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,250
doesn’t respond to you,

243
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,501
will you still be stubborn for him?

244
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,667
Why don’t you try someone else?

245
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:19,626
I don’t know.

246
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,999
But don’t be so negative!

247
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,501
Have confidence in me.

248
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,000
I have super confidence in myself.

249
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,000
When I first

250
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,375
worked with you,

251
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,292
I found you annoying.

252
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,667
But gradually I realized

253
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,375
that was not the real you.

254
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,667
The more you like someone,

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,751
the colder you behave.

256
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,292
The more you care for someone,

257
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,250
the farther you stay away.

258
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,042
What on earth are you scared of?

259
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,584
But it doesn’t matter.

260
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,000
I’ll always protect you.

261
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,751
Because I like you.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,292
Morning.

263
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:50,834
Morning.

264
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:52,918
Morning, Baoni.

265
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,334
Morning.

266
00:14:59,334 --> 00:14:59,834
Mo Nan.

267
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,918
Morning, Baoni.

268
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:04,167
Well,

269
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,459
I have two film tickets.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,167
I wonder if you’re available.

271
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:12,250
I...

272
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,999
I’ve asked around, but no one is.

273
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
If you don’t go,

274
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,459
the tickets will be invalid.

275
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,792
It’s too bad.

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,334
All right. Thanks.

277
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,626
Shouldn’t he go with me?

278
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,918
I’m trying everything I can

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,125
to flirt with him.

280
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:49,751
But he remains indifferent.

281
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,751
Is he really insensible

282
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:52,918
or is he pretending?

283
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,626
I’m talking to you.

284
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:58,959
Do you hear me?

285
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,125
Do you think

286
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,125
I should remind him of

287
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,709
what happened in the hotel?

288
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,209
Or should I tell him I like him again?

289
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:13,667
Love is a puzzle.

290
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,626
It really infatuates us.

291
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,167
Have a walnut to make you smarter.

292
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,125
William has solved the problem

293
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,876
with the head office.

294
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,417
But in this way,

295
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,292
we’ll have more pressure.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,042
Do you have any plan

297
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,459
for next step?

298
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:47,999
Not yet.

299
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,083
I have a plan.

300
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,250
Why don’t we use Ling Lingqi?

301
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:58,584
I told you

302
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,584
not to get Ling Lingqi involved.

303
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:04,876
I will keep a balance

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,417
between her and the acquisition case.

305
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:09,918
You get me wrong.

306
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:11,167
I don’t mean stopping you

307
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,209
from chasing her.

308
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:13,751
I mean

309
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,334
since Ling Lingqi works

310
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,876
as Bo Hai’s assistant

311
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,083
and you like her,

312
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:19,459
why don’t you

313
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,584
persuade her

314
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:21,667
into helping us?

315
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:23,709
It will bring benefits

316
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,292
to you and to our company.

317
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,125
But we must be fast

318
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:32,999
so that we can carry out our plan

319
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:33,959
more smoothly.

320
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:04,918
Boss.

321
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,459
This is the album

322
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:07,000
we made

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,167
after the last team building.

324
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,125
Well,

325
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,792
Ling Lingqi told me that

326
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,417
you lost your memory

327
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:28,918
after we came back.

328
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,042
But I remember

329
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,584
she walked you back to your room.

330
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,417
Did anything happen

331
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,918
that you’re too shy to tell me?

332
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,250
It’s not what you think.

333
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,125
Then what is it?

334
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,834
None of your business.

335
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,209
I’ll guess then.

336
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:44,417
I’m good at imagining things.

337
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,542
She flirted with you?

338
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,751
You flirted with her?

339
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,042
Stop! What were you thinking?

340
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,459
Not the flirting thing?

341
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:56,959
Then did you tell her you liked her

342
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,999
when you were drunk?

343
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,999
Who told her? She told...

344
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:01,959
See? I knew it.

345
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,709
She told you she liked you, huh?

346
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, just admit it.

347
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,334
Why do you pretend you lost your memory?

348
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:11,292
I…

349
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,125
I don’t want to embarrass her.

350
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,584
But why did you

351
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:20,792
embarrass Zhou Xinyan

352
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,083
when you made her cry?

353
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,292
All right. Don’t be stubborn.

354
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,125
Just admit it.

355
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,042
Admit what?

356
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,667
♪ Love is nothing ♪

357
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,667
♪ But a common stuff ♪

358
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,876
♪ It’s not strange at all ♪

359
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,626
I’m warning you! Don’t tell anyone else.

360
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,042
Pretend to lose your memory? Naughty boy!

361
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,834
Threaten me, huh?

362
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,334
Do you believe I’ll yell

363
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,542
so that everyone else will hear?

364
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,417
Don’t you fear?

365
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,292
I dare you!

366
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:55,918
If you want me

367
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,083
to keep it secret, all right.

368
00:19:58,918 --> 00:19:59,709
It depends on what you do.

369
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:02,584
I…

370
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,999
♪ Love is nothing ♪

371
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,834
♪ But a common stuff ♪

372
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,167
Mo Nan.

373
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,709
Where did you go during lunch?

374
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,000
You didn’t even have lunch with us.

375
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,083
I had a talk with a friend.

376
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:24,375
Friend?

377
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,083
A man or a woman?

378
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:33,876
It’s a secret.

379
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:37,417
Secret?

380
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,792
A woman, I’m sure!

381
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:45,542
Can anything go wrong?

382
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,876
Don’t worry.

383
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,292
Just listen to me.

384
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,626
I’m very experienced.

385
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:51,375
Leave it to me!

386
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,083
It spills out!

387
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,834
What are you doing sneakily?

388
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:58,626
I’ll leave it to you then.

389
00:20:58,792 --> 00:20:59,209
First,

390
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:00,834
have no concern.

391
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,584
What?

392
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,000
As far as I observe,

393
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,584
Mo Nan remains indifferent

394
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:06,459
to me

395
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:07,542
for only one reason.

396
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,584
He likes someone else.

397
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,751
Someone else?

398
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:14,918
Why don’t I know?

399
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:16,667
It’s clumsy of you.

400
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:17,834
How will you know?

401
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,042
What are you going to do then?

402
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,250
To find out the girl he likes,

403
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,292
of course.

404
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:24,834
I’ll teach you carefully.

405
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,459
I gotta go. See you.

406
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:54,542
Baoni, what are you doing?

407
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:14,834
What the hell!

408
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:17,584
Be careful.

409
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:20,375
No?

410
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,209
No.

411
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,000
Try it again.

412
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,334
Take it off.

413
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:25,709
Take it off?

414
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:27,667
Be careful.

415
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,209
Watch out! Watch out.

416
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,375
Just take it off.

417
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:34,918
Stop!

418
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,250
When I took off my coat,

419
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,417
it hooked her hair.

420
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:48,918
I get the wrong place.

421
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,375
Go on. Go on.

422
00:22:59,459 --> 00:22:59,959
Secretary Chen.

423
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:01,167
A package for you.

424
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,125
Okay, thank you.

425
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:04,542
Secretary Chen.

426
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,999
Why does Sweet Dream Technology

427
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:07,918
send you a gift

428
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:08,918
every month?

429
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,667
Do you have a lover

430
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:12,834
who works there?

431
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:16,209
Ruan.

432
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:17,959
I must criticize you.

433
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,459
That was groundless talk!

434
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,292
A lot of girls

435
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,042
like my handsome face.

436
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,250
But I’m a pure man.

437
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,751
I’ve never been

438
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:31,042
in an improper relationship

439
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:31,999
with any girl.

440
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,042
Playing pure.

441
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:40,667
Yan.

442
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,375
That was nonsense.

443
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:43,459
I’m innocent!

444
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:45,083
This is a gift

445
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,167
in return for the dream bracelet

446
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,667
I applied for Bo Hai.

447
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,000
I don’t have any lover.

448
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,709
How many times have I told you?

449
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,584
Stop calling me Yan!

450
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,584
Yan, wait for me.

451
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,792
So, Chen Mo applied the bracelet

452
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,918
for Bo Hai.

453
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:17,125
Qi.

454
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:18,918
As my good friend,

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,751
it’s time to help me!

456
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,751
What do you want me to do?

457
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:23,999
A simple mission.

458
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,042
Get to Mo Nan

459
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:25,834
and help me to

460
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:26,667
figure out

461
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,542
who he really likes.

462
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:31,918
It’s about my happiness.

463
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,334
You will help me, won’t you?

464
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:35,876
All right, then.

465
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,000
Go! Go! Go!

466
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:39,959
Hurry!

467
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:42,626
Mo Nan.

468
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,042
Shall we go together?

469
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:46,459
Okay.

470
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:51,000
There are so many girls

471
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,542
in our company.

472
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:51,999
Do you find

473
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:52,959
anyone special?

474
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:54,751
Why do you suddenly ask?

475
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,626
Nothing. I just asked.

476
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,000
If you just asked,

477
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,292
I’ll just answer casually.

478
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:01,626
No.

479
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,999
I’m asking seriously!

480
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,584
Do you like any girl?

481
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,083
Answer me first.

482
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,876
Why do you suddenly

483
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,375
care about my love life?

484
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:16,209
All right.

485
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:18,209
If you don’t tell the truth,

486
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,918
you’ll not have the answer you want.

487
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:21,250
Baoni wanted me to ask.

488
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:24,584
She said you seemed to

489
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:25,375
like someone.

490
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:26,584
So, she asked me to find it out.

491
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:29,918
I told her!

492
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,876
You stay every day

493
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,626
with Baoni and me.

494
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,542
If you really liked someone,

495
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:33,918
we would have known.

496
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,626
Qi, I have something to tell you.

497
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,751
In fact, I like…

498
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:50,876
Get in the car.

499
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:54,709
I’m going home. I’ll drive you.

500
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:56,000
Mr. Bo.

501
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:56,584
Okay.

502
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:57,626
I’m her neighbor.

503
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,083
I’ll go with you. Thanks.

504
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:02,375
Sit in the back.

505
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,167
Shall we play some music?

506
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:45,250
Good idea.

507
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:54,918
Mr. Bo.

508
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Thank you for the ride today.

509
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:00,167
You’re welcome. It’s not out of my way.

510
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,125
I hear you live in the north of the city.

511
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,999
But we live in the south.

512
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,167
I think it’s out of your way.

513
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:10,751
After work,

514
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,584
I like driving around for fun.

515
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:15,918
It’s no big deal.

516
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,417
That’s really

517
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:20,667
a special hobby.

518
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,834
Why did you push me?

519
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,209
Stop that!

520
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:35,667
Oh, I remember.

521
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:37,501
Didn’t you say

522
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,292
you would teach me the floriculture?

523
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,626
Qi, it’s so thoughtful of you.

524
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:43,417
If you didn’t remind me,

525
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,250
I would have forgotten it.

526
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:47,250
How about this?

527
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,751
Still come to my home tonight.

528
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:50,501
I’ll see you there.

529
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:52,417
Don’t go!

530
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:57,918
I mean

531
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,999
if you have any confusion,

532
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,792
come to my office tomorrow

533
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,459
and I’ll teach you.

534
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,626
Mr. Bo, you’re always busy.

535
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:08,999
If I still disturb

536
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:09,959
for personal stuff,

537
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:11,083
I’ll feel sorry.

538
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:13,918
We don’t usually

539
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:15,250
have an aspirant employee like you.

540
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,209
I’ll train you personally.

541
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:46,334
Thank you, Mr. Bo.

542
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,375
- Bye-bye. - Ling Lingqi.

543
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,167
Go to bed early.

544
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,501
Don’t go anywhere.

545
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:56,626
Remember?

546
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:58,542
Naive.

547
00:28:58,584 --> 00:28:58,959
What?

548
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,375
Nothing. Bye-bye.

549
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:09,042
Mo Nan.

550
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:10,417
Mo Nan.

551
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:13,918
Why did you

552
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,292
stay that to Bo Hai?

553
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:17,083
You want to know

554
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:18,584
if he likes you, don’t you?

555
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:20,167
Jealousy is the best thing

556
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,709
to make someone tell the truth.

557
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:24,876
I hope you won’t

558
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,999
do the same thing again.

559
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:27,125
Why?

560
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,125
I know you did it for me.

561
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,501
But I don’t want any game

562
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:32,083
where people try to

563
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,209
sound out each other.

564
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:34,918
And I don’t want to

565
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,459
bring any trouble to Bo Hai.

566
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:38,626
You care so much for him?

567
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:41,542
Silly, aren’t I?

568
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,501
I find myself silly, too.

569
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,000
Bye-bye.

570
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:54,918
Bye.

571
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,209
Honey, be gentle!

572
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,209
Gentle? See how I’ll deal with you.

573
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:02,542
It hurts! Be gentle!

574
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:03,417
Stop yelling!

575
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,042
I’m not using my strength yet. So weak!

576
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:06,000
Qi!

577
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:07,584
What’s wrong?

578
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:09,417
We’re fine.

579
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:10,626
Nothing wrong.

580
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:11,876
Your dad sprained his neck

581
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,959
when watching others play card

582
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,209
for the whole afternoon.

583
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:17,918
How careless you are!

584
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:19,459
That’s what I just said.

585
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,083
We’ll replenish the stock tomorrow.

586
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,417
But he’s hurt.

587
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,125
What should I do?

588
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,542
I didn’t want this, either.

589
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:26,918
Well, tomorrow,

590
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:27,959
I’ll go and help you.

591
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,083
I’ll ask for a day’s leave.

592
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:30,876
No. No. Not necessary.

593
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,542
It’s not a big deal.

594
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,250
I can take care of it.

595
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,834
Why are you still stubborn?

596
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,000
It’s a deal, then.

597
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,751
Be gentle! Be gentle!

598
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:39,542
Honey! Honey!

599
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:40,417
Oh, dear.

600
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,000
Let me have a look.

601
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,501
Cut the branch and leaves.

602
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,292
Mr. Bo. What brings you here?

603
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:55,999
Nothing. I just come around.

604
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:56,834
Don’t bother.

605
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:57,999
Okay. Okay.

606
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:03,751
Mr. Bo.

607
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:12,959
Manager Li.

608
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,167
Mr. Bo.

609
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,792
Is everyone here?

610
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,167
Yes.

611
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:23,375
Really?

612
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:26,999
Yes.

613
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:31,876
Why isn’t Ling Lingqi here?

614
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,959
Oh, I forgot her.

615
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,334
She asked for a sick leave

616
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:38,792
and she can’t come.

617
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:39,876
Sick leave?

618
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:40,959
Yes. Sick leave.

619
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:41,709
What kind of sickness?

620
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,709
She didn’t say that.

621
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,542
Fine, then. Get back to your business.

622
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,125
Okay. Mr. Bo.

623
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:02,584
Have nothing to do again?

624
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:08,000
I’ve been waiting for you.

625
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,000
There’s a file you need to sign.

626
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,542
Any other plan for today?

627
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:17,459
We’ll have a meeting

628
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:18,667
with the Marketing Department.

629
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:20,042
Tonight, we’re going to meet

630
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:21,542
a flower supplier.

631
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:22,999
Cancel the meeting.

632
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,375
Go meet the supplier with Xinyan.

633
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:35,792
Where is he going?

634
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:37,417
He just leaves everything to us.

635
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,751
Welcome. Help yourself.

636
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,751
Isn’t she sick?

637
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,876
But she looks lively.

638
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:27,751
Do you enjoy it?

639
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:29,375
Kind of.

640
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,334
Lecher! Lecher!

641
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:34,834
Stop peeking! Stop!

642
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:35,626
You lecher!

643
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:36,000
Mom!

644
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:37,626
Don’t run! You lecher!

645
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:38,083
Mom!

646
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:38,584
Don’t run!

647
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:39,459
Somebody!

648
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:40,542
Here’s a lecher!

649
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:42,667
Catch him! Hurry! Somebody!

650
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:43,542
Aunt! Stop yelling! Aunt.

651
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:48,375
Bo…

652
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:50,751
Why is it you?

653
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,501
Bo Hai.

654
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:20,876
Mr. Bo, you come to check on

655
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
my daughter

656
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:23,999
because you know she’s sick?

657
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:29,751
Let me explain, aunt.

658
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:31,709
Every employee of our company

659
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:32,999
is a precious treasure.

660
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,042
Whoever is sick,

661
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:35,375
I will visit him.

662
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:37,584
Then why don’t you just come in

663
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:38,375
and see her?

664
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:39,709
Don’t be shy.

665
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,125
No one will laugh at you.

666
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,876
Mom. Enough! Stop it!

667
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,667
Say no more.

668
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,417
Mr. Bo, my daughter

669
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:52,584
is a total hottie

670
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:54,501
in our neighborhood.

671
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,292
Look!

672
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,167
She’s beautiful.

673
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:01,250
She is good at working and cooking.

674
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:03,000
And she’s well-educated.

675
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,292
The point is I think

676
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,584
she’ll bring fortune to her husband.

677
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:11,751
Thank you.

678
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,417
Are you really talking about our daughter?

679
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,334
Mom, beef balls are

680
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:20,626
forty yuan a kilo.

681
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:21,626
Eat it or it’ll be over-cooked.

682
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:38,334
Qi, this is your favorite.

683
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:39,709
Come.

684
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,000
Give! Give it to her.

685
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,209
Wait.

686
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,417
My parents scared you, huh?

687
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:01,375
No.

688
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,292
They’re fun.

689
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:06,042
I had a good time tonight.

690
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:07,834
Really?

691
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,792
In fact, since long ago,

692
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,042
I’ve been living alone.

693
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:15,292
When I saw you and your parents

694
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,959
lived such a warm and happy life,

695
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,083
I kind of felt

696
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,375
I was home.

697
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:24,000
Qi.

698
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,167
You’re back.

699
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:27,334
Mr. Bo?

700
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,083
We just had dinner.

701
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:30,167
Have you had dinner?

702
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,125
Not yet.

703
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,459
I’m starving, Qi.

704
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,125
We’re having the hot pot.

705
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:39,709
I’m not familiar with the neighborhood.

706
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,167
Walk me out.

707
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:57,250
Why are you walking so fast?

708
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:58,459
Stop!

709
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:00,417
Stop!

710
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:01,792
Stop!

711
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,000
What? Why are you going crazy?

712
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:06,626
I’m going crazy?

713
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I’m getting you out of trouble.

714
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,542
All right?

715
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,292
What trouble are you talking about?

716
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,667
You know what?

717
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:12,959
I saw him through!

718
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,667
He likes you, I’m sure!

719
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:17,959
You get him wrong.

720
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,417
Yesterday in your car,

721
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,250
he just tried to help me figure out

722
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:21,626
if you liked me.

723
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,167
He doesn’t like me.

724
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:26,459
That was what he said?

725
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,167
He didn’t say that.

726
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:28,834
But he always

727
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:29,959
takes me as his bestie.

728
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,167
So what?

729
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,751
Besties shall keep distance, too.

730
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,667
Remember?

731
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,042
Are you jealous?

732
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,501
I’m jealous?

733
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:42,375
No way!

734
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,667
How could I be jealous?

735
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:44,918
Diffident?

736
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,459
I’m not. What’s wrong with your eyes?

737
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:48,792
You’re obviously jealous!

738
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:49,292
Look at you!

739
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:50,334
You don’t even dare to look at me.

740
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:51,292
I’m not! I’m not!

741
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,042
Are you jealous?

742
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,792
Your eyes tell that!

743
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:54,209
I’m not!

744
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:54,792
You are!

745
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:17,167
When we were in the hotel…

746
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:18,999
Stop! When we were in the hotel,

747
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:19,584
I was drunk.

748
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:20,417
I don’t remember anything now.

749
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,042
I know you don’t remember.

750
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:24,709
So, I’m explaining to you.

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,125
In the hotel,

752
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:30,792
when you were drunk,

753
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:31,709
you told me that

754
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,375
you loved me

755
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:34,834
and wanted me to be your girlfriend.

756
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,167
Then I had no choice,

757
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:37,999
but to say yes.

758
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,167
So now,

759
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:40,417
we’re in a relationship.

760
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,000
What the hell!

761
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:44,292
You cried and yelled,

762
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,999
telling me you like me.

763
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,459
And I didn’t say yes.

764
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:47,918
You!

765
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,876
You pretend to lose your memory?

766
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:54,584
You remember everything!

767
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,876
Why don’t you admit it?

768
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:58,209
I…

769
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:01,042
I don’t want to embarrass you.

770
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:01,876
You’re a girl!

771
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:03,876
Can’t you restrain yourself?

772
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,417
When did I not restrain myself?

773
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:07,792
When did I?

774
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,626
When did I?

775
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,501
I have a meeting to attend.

776
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:12,125
I gotta go.

777
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:16,709
Come back, Bo Hai! You coward!

778
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,083
Meng! Meng!

779
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:30,250
Bo Hai pretended to lose his memory.

780
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,042
And he was jealous.

781
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,459
Does that mean he likes me?

782
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,584
Sounds crazy, but true!

783
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:51,999
I’m too shy!

784
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:57,876
Oh, dear.

785
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:34,459
Morning.

786
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:39,792
Morning, Lili.

787
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:42,876
Morning.

788
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:45,751
What makes you so happy?

789
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:46,999
I’m always happy, aren’t I?

790
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:47,999
Are you?

791
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:48,626
Morning.

792
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:51,709
Qi.

793
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:54,375
I asked you to help me with that.

794
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:55,375
What have you got?

795
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,876
What do you mean?

796
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,459
Mo Nan!

797
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:04,876
Don’t worry.

798
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,125
He doesn’t like anyone.

799
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,584
He told you that?
