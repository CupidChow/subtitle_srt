51
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,999
Hello, sir.

52
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,167
May I ask about someone?

53
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:51,959
Do you know where Zhou Anping lives?

54
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:52,999
Zhou Anping?

55
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,959
He moved away.

56
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:57,167
Look, he even sold his place.

57
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:02,792
Sir.

58
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:03,999
Do you know

59
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,292
where he has moved to?

60
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,584
I heard he went to America

61
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,167
to stay with his son.

62
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,209
He left in such a hurry

63
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,501
that he didn’t tell us

64
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,709
his new phone number.

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,999
We want

66
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,375
experienced shop assistants.

67
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,459
You have no experience in

68
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:23,834
attending customers.

69
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,125
But you did a great job in

70
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,542
table decoration with flowers.

71
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,292
Why don’t you try in the flower shop

72
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,250
next door?

73
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,918
Actually I chose to learn floriculture

74
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,292
and became fond of it,

75
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,751
till now,

76
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,375
I’ve become a real florist.

77
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,209
It’s all because of you.

78
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,834
You’re no longer my idol.

79
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:56,417
You’re

80
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,000
my ideal.

81
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,876
Don’t be barbaric!

82
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:57,709
This is where

83
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:58,459

During the urban reconstruction these years,

86
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,626
many people have moved away.

87
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:04,667
I don’t know if you can find

88
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:06,209
old employees.

89
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,334
Young man, try your luck.

90
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,375
Thank you, sir.

91
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,417
Hello, sir.

92
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:27,125
Hello.

93
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,375
May I ask you something?

94
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:30,209
Was here

95
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,834
Yunhe Flower Shop?

96
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,542
Yunhe Flower Shop?

97
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,209
You asked the right person.

98
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,250
I worked there.

99
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:38,918
You did?

100
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,125
Wait a second.

101
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,667
Do you know this man?

102
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,792
He’s Manager Liu.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You know him?

104
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,751
Yes. It’s him.

105
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,959
He was the finance manager Liu Yingjie

106
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,000
in Yunhe Flower Shop.

107
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,083
It’s been over twenty years.

108
00:04:58,334 --> 00:04:59,167
He’s getting old.

109
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,459
Why do you ask about him?

110
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,375
Oh, just for some understanding.

111
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,042
Could you tell me something

112
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,209
about him?

113
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,334
The more, the better.

114
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,918
Well...

115
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:14,125
It’s been years.

116
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,334
I wasn’t too close to him.

117
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,459
So,

118
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,417
we didn’t communicate too much.

119
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,083
But

120
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,626
he borrowed money from me.

121
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,125
Speaking of this,

122
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,792
Manager Liu

123
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,000
was in real trouble

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,626
in the past.

and representing the rebirth after death.

The day of revenge

131
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,209
finally comes!

132
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,042

You haven’t come together for long.

137
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,209
We’re too busy to meet.

138
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,125
Just now, the young man

139
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,542
who often came with you,

140
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:52,667
said the same thing.

141
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:53,959
He packed some spicy crawfish

142
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,000
for taking away.

143
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,417
Which direction has he gone?

144
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,209
To the riverside.

145
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:01,709
Come together next time.

146
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:02,999
I’ll give you a discount.

147
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:08,709
Didn’t you say

148
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,042
you only pretended to be

149
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,459
our friends?

150
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,167
If so,

151
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,667
why do you still miss the old time?

152
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:20,083
You’re lying, aren’t you?

153
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,417
You’re not what you said you were.

154

Right?

155

Oh, Lu Baoni.

156

Didn’t you say

157
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,751
you would forget Mo Nan?

158
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:56,751
In no time

159
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,542
you begin to wobble?

160
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,417
This is a false impression!

161
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,167

What’s your plan?

169

Do you think silence will help?

with a girl

I’m wrong about myself, too.

177
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,000
I thought

178
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,083
I could be a devil

179
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,959
who only wanted to take revenge.

180
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,250
But I can’t do that.

181
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,250
You can’t?

182
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,876
Then you’re going to give up?

183
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,709
What about my promise to

184
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:51,501
the board of directors?

185
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,375
How about DREAM’s strategic plan

186
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,167
in Greater China?

187
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,334
What about your blood feud

188
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:01,959
over the past twenty years?

189
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,417
William.

190
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,167
Sorry.

191
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,542
Stop saying that.

192
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,959
There’s no turning back.

193
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,334
You’d better do

194
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,250
what I tell you to.

195
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,459
Otherwise,

196
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:31,751
I’ll turn you into a devil myself.

197
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:39,083
William.

198
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,083
Are you doing this

199
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,542
only for DREAM,

200
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,167
and for me?

201
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,501
For pacifying those

202
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,792
in the heaven.

203
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:19,751
Don’t come to me again.

204
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,375
At tomorrow’s international exhibition,

205
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:24,751
I’ll perform the flower art

206
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:25,999
on behalf of our company.

207
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:28,792
Hope you can come.

208
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,834
I’ve got other business.

209
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:36,876
I can’t go.

210
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,083
Okay.

211
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,918
I’ll wait when you have time.

212
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:50,834
How many times do I need to tell you

213
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:51,918
before you understand?

214
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:52,999
We completely

215
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,334
broke up.

216
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,584
I don’t believe it!

217
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,417
I’ll be waiting for you.

218
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,042
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

219
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:09,876
The point is

220
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,209
I won’t go back to you.

221
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:41,083
Watch out!

222
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,292
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

223
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:53,250
Bo Hai!

224
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,420
= Emergency =

225
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,125
Qi.

226
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:17,626
Are you alright?

227
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:18,959
What did the doctor say?

228
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,250
Are you hurt?

229
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,209
Say something!

230
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:31,375
I’ve done everything

231
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,792
you asked me to.

232
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,375
Why did you still hurt him?

233
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,626
You’d better do

234
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,459
what I tell you to.

235
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:40,876
Otherwise,

236
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,959
I’ll turn you into a devil myself.

237
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,292
Because I want you to be with me.

238
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,167
You’re not a human! You’re a devil!

239
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,792
Yes.

240
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,918
You’re right. I’m a devil.

241
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:56,876
So, you have no right

242
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,209
to bargain with me.

243
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,292
You have to yield.

244
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:14,000
You’d better not resist.

245
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:15,334
After all,

246
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,042
I have the cheek to do anything.

247
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:25,542
Will you stop

248
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,667
if I agree to

249
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,375
be with you?

250
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:39,209
Fine.

251
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,209
I agree.

252
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:47,918
Qi.

253
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,334
Sorry. Sorry.

254
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,709
What I owe you,

255
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,292
I’ll use my whole life

256
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,042
to repay you.

257
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:14,167
Not a big problem.

258
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,250
The car crash happened on Jiangfei Road.

259
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,751
The driver wasn’t badly hurt.

260
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,083
Remember to change the dressing on time.

261
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:29,667
Come back in a week.

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,626
Okay. Okay.

263
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,375
Thank you, doctor.

264
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,125
Thank you.

265
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,626
Where is Qi?

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,209
She’s waiting in the hall.

267
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,209
Where is she?

268
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,042
She said she would wait

269
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:43,959
in the hall.

270
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,167
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

271
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:56,709
The point is

272
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,417
I won’t go back to you.

273
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,959
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

274
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,626
The point is

275
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,918
your mother is not coming back.

276
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,000
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

277
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,792
The point is

278
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,083
your mother is not coming back.

279
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,834
Your mother is not coming back.

280
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,918
Your mother is not coming back.

281
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,375
Your mother is not coming back.

282
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:36,959
Bo Hai?

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,876
Bo Hai!

284
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,125
Hai, stop waiting.

285
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,209
Your mother has run away.

286
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:04,999
She abandoned you.

287
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,167
I don’t believe it.

288
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,209
My mother won’t abandon me.

289
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,083
She will come back to me.

290
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,792
Why are you so stubborn?

291
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,000
Go home with me.

292
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,250
It’s going to snow.

293
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,000
I’m not going anywhere.

294
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,751
I’m waiting for my mom.

295
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,417
Mom!

296
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,709
Where are you?

297
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:52,709
Ms. Chen, he’s Hai!

298
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,042
Hai!

299
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,209
I’m Ms. Chen with the welfare home.

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
From now on,

301
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,876
you’re going to live in the welfare home.

302
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:03,292
I’m not leaving.

303
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:04,751
If I leave,

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,417
my mother can’t find me

305
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,626
when she comes back.

306
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,209
I’m waiting for her.

307
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:10,876
Stop waiting.

308
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,417
Your mother is not coming back.

309
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:13,667
You’re lying!

310
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,542
I don’t believe my mother would abandon me.

311
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,042
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

312
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,417
The point is

313
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,542
the police declared that

314
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:22,667
your mother was missing.

315
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:24,459
She is not coming back.

316
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,292
Go with me.

317
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,042
I’m waiting for my mother.

318
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,209
I’m not leaving.

319
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,709
- Hai! - I’ll wait for my mother.

320
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:34,792
I’ll wait for her!

321
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,250
- Hai, be a good boy. - I’m not leaving!

322
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,584
- I’m not leaving! - Go with me.

323
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,209
I’m not leaving!

324
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:39,999
Go, Hai.

325
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,292
I’ll wait for my mother!

326
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,209
Be a good boy, Hai.

327
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:47,626
Mom! Mom! Mom!

328
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,334
Mom!

329
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,876
I’m not leaving!

330
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:58,042
Mom!

331
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,083
Qi.

332
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,167
Baoni?

333
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,292
Hello, everybody.

334
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,459
The international exhibition this year

335
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:41,999
has set a record in the scale.

336
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,542
Delegations from over forty countries

337
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,918
are getting ready.

338
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,667
Today, more than thirty thousand people

339
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,959
come and enjoy it.

340
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:48,876
The opening ceremony begins

341
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,417
in ten minutes.

342
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:51,834
We will present you

343
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,959
such a brilliant business event

344
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,000
in all directions.

345
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,042
Why do we come here?

346
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:58,459
Since we’re in a relationship,

347
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,209
we should come

348
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,709
and tell Bo Hai about it.

349
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:04,417
I’ve already agreed to

350
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,250
be your girlfriend,

351
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,000
why do you still push it?

352
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,083
If Bo Hai

353
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:10,459
doesn’t know it,

354
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,125
he will still harass you

355
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,459
every now and then.

356
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,167
You know me.

357
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,083
I’m impatient and grumpy.

358
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,292
If he harasses you,

359
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,209
I’ll have to hurt him.

360
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:26,459
You’d better cooperate.

361
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:28,584
Nasty!

362
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:33,334
Mr. Mo.

363
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:34,709
Qi?

364
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:35,918
It’s been a while.

365
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,042
What brings you here?

366
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:38,751
Come with Bo Hai?

367
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,250
Thank you for helping last time.

368
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,292
Excuse me, I have to go.

369
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,209
Okay.

370
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:44,918
She comes with me.

371
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,375
Mo Nan.

372
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:48,834
You’ll know.

373
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:58,792
I don’t know why,

374
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,083
but I feel very uneasy.

375
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,209
Yesterday, you comforted Bo Hai nicely,

376
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,584
didn’t you?

377
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,417
I couldn’t just discourage him.

378
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:06,542
There’s not a reason,

379
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:07,918
but my right eyelid twitches.

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,999
Could something go wrong?

381
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,083
Right eyelid twitches?

382
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,792
That’s muscle spasm.

383
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,125
You have superstition!

384
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:14,999
You do!

385
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,167
Miss Ling.

386
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,417
How graceful you are!

387
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,751
But you don’t look well.

388
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:27,667
It’s okay.

389
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,042
Let me help you wear some makeup.

390
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,167
This way, please.

391
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,959
Miss Ling, what’s wrong?

392
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:10,042
The flower art performance

393
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,459
is going to start.

394
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:13,375
Hope you won’t

395
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,709
miss the chance.

396
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,375
I see.

397
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,250
A secret is a secret,

398
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,083
only because

399
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,250
it brings massive destruction

400
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,125
to whoever around it.

401
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,667
There was peace.

402
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,876
But the peace would be broken

403
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,959
with only one tiny crack.

404
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,459
If you fail to open the tiny crack

405
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,083
on Bo Hai,

406
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:41,209
all of us will have to

407
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,292
pay a big price.

408
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,918
This isn’t only alarmist talk.

409
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:09,959
Who’s there?

410
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:17,834
You heard us?

411
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,918
When are you going to tell everyone?

412
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,709
Do you think I don’t want to tell them?

413
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,334
I knew your evil plan.

414
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,876
I knew you would do

415
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:34,125
irretrievable damage

416
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,584
to Bo Hai and his company.

417
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,876
But I can’t do that.

418
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:42,999
Because I don’t want to

419
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,918
see you defeated.

420
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,959
I hate myself.

421
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,125
Reason can’t prevail over my emotion.

422
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,834
I’m too weak!

423
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:17,959
My feast

424
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,918
is going to start.

425
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:29,626
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

426
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,584
Today, we’re honored to have

427
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:34,876
the famous florist Mr. Bo Hai,

428
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,709
CEO of FlowerPlus,

429
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,334
give us a wonderful

430
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,083
Chinese-style flower art performance.

431
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:43,501
Let’s hear it for him.

432
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:53,334
Thank you, host.

433
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,459
Thank you, the organizing committee.

434
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,042
Hope my performance

435
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:57,834
will make you relax

436
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,584
at the interval.

437
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,209
And let you experience that

438
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:02,751
though the traditional Chinese-style
flower arrangement

439
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:03,959
is designed by florists,

440
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:05,584
it looks natural.

441
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,209
Chinese flower arrangement values
nature and emotion.

442
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:10,417
Why does she come?

443
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,709
Valuing nature means we learn from nature.

444
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:14,584
Valuing emotion means...

445
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:15,083
Screwed!

446
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:16,667
…during the flower arrangement,

447
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:17,959
the creator must put in

448
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,209
strong emotion

449
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:22,584
and make different bouquets
for different situations.

450
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,375
Let me introduce you.

451
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:39,751
This is Mr. Mo Nan,

452
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,250
the general manager of DREAM

453
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,334
in Greater China.

454
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:43,876
Mr. Mo,

455
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,459
are you the assistant

456
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:46,667
for Mr. Bo’s performance?

457
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,584
Mr. Bo just mentioned

458
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,125
different situations.

459
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:55,999
I’d like to

460
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:57,459
give an interlude,

461
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,501
providing a perfect situation

462
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,999
for his performance.

463
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,792
Qi, marry me!

464
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,542
Marry him! Marry him!

465
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,459
Marry him! Marry him!

466
00:31:49,626 --> 00:32:05,918
Marry him! Marry him!

467
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,000
Want me to marry you? In your dream!

468
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,250
I’m not asking,

469
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:11,501
but ordering you!

470
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,292
You don’t have a choice.

471
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:14,584
Let go of me!

472
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:18,959
Don’t resist.

473
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:22,334
Or you can’t afford the consequences.

474
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:39,792
She accepted!

475
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,667
Let’s bless them together.

476
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:43,876
Hope they’ll be happy forever!

477
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:49,542
Mr. Bo.

478
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,709
I want to use your flowers

479
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,209
to congratulate on

480
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,584
our new relationship.

481
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,834
Hope our love will be

482
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:02,042
as warm and beautiful as roses.

483
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:17,834
Mr. Bo,

484
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,501
I believe you’ll complete

485
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,542
this work perfectly, won’t you?

486
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:25,250
Seems like

487
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,584
Mr. Bo is touched, too.

488
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,501
Mr. Bo, the clock is ticking.

489
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,626
Please get started.

490
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,584
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

491
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:42,501
The point is

492
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:43,542
I won’t go back to you.

493
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:45,918
It doesn’t matter if you believe.

494
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:47,751
The point is

495
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,375
your mother is not coming back.

496
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,918
Mom!

497
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:22,501
Let go of me!

498
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,042
Let go of me!

499
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:25,834
Qi!

500
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,709
If you don’t want him to be worse,

501
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:31,209
you’d better not be stupid.

502
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:36,250
Are you all right?

503
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,626
Bo Hai can’t make bouquets.

504
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,292
Because he’s colorblind.

505
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,334
- Colorblind? - He’s colorblind?

506
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:54,125
Exactly.

507
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:55,959
Rumors about Bo Hai

508
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
are true.

509
00:34:57,709 --> 00:34:59,709
According to an informant,

510
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:02,834
we’ve even found the substitute

511
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:04,209
who works for Bo Hai.

512
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:05,209
And today,

513
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,959
he comes here.

514
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,292
Director Zhou and Secretary Chen

515
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:16,709
with FlowerPlus

516
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,542
hired me as Mr. Bo’s substitute

517
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,751
because he didn’t feel well.

518
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:21,709
Codswallop!

519
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,709
Director Zhou,

520
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,501
we signed the confidentiality agreement.

521
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:25,667
But as a creative artist,

522
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:26,876
I believe

523
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,834
my respect matters more than

524
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,501
the confidentiality agreement.

525
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,250
Everybody, look at the screen.

526
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:33,792
I completed this piece of work

527
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:35,292
for Bo Hai.

528
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:36,501
That’s the evidence!

529
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,125
This is

530
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,834
how much FlowerPlus paid me.

531
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:40,626
I worked with FlowerPlus

532
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:41,459
to cheat the public.

533
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:42,959
I’m truly sorry for this.

534
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,959
But as the cause of this,

535
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,751
Bo Hai should be blamed more.

536
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,626
Mr. Bo, is he telling the truth?

537
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:50,209
Did you

538
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:51,125
pay him?

539
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,000
Did you pay him personally

540
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,042
or did FlowerPlus pay him?

541
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:53,959
Sorry, everybody.

542
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:54,751
For today’s event,

543
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,167
we haven’t arranged any time

544
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:56,250
for spot coverage.

545
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,167
Please keep order!

546
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:57,959
Thank you.

547
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:58,876
Reporter friends,

548
00:35:58,999 --> 00:35:59,959
please let me explain.

549
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:00,667
In recent years,

550
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:01,834
Mr. Bo has had some eye disease

551
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:02,918
because of overwork.

552
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,334
To complete this piece of work

553
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:04,375
in a better way,

554
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,542
he had to communicate

555
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:06,334
with this man

556
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,417
for some working stuff.

557
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:08,375
You mean

558
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,918
the substitute thing is true?

559
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,083
There’s some misunderstanding.

560
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:11,918
This man

561
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:12,667
was only entrusted

562
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,209
to carry out the project.

563
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:15,334
Mr. Bo provided

564
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,417
the core designs.

565
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:17,209
We don’t want your explanation!

566
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,375
Ask Mr. Bo to explain!

567
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,667
Mr. Bo, does your attitude

568
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:20,292
prove that

569
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:21,375
the man was telling

570
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,501
all the truth?

571
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:24,083
Mr. Bo, say something!

572
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:25,751
Yeah. Say something!

573
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,751
Facts are stronger than arguments.

574
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,042
What Bo Hai does today

575
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,999
explains the phase

576
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,375
tacit consent.

577
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:45,250
Liar!

578
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:46,999
Bo Hai, you’re a liar!

579
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:47,501
Yeah.

580
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:48,876
You shouldn’t have lied!

581
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:49,542
Liar!

582
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,720
We want the truth!

583
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:51,817
We want the truth!

584
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,540
= International Exhibition Entrance Hall =

585
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:19,042
Bo Hai!

586
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:20,459
What else do you want?

587
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:22,959
Haven’t you hurt him enough?

588
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:23,918
I didn’t expect you

589
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:24,876
to be so cruel!

590
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:25,792
For you,

591
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:26,667
Bo Hai finally overcame

592
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,250
his mental problem.

593
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,167
But you betrayed him!

594
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,250
How ingrate you are!

595
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:30,250
Get lost!

596
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:31,042
Go enjoy your romance with Mo Nan!

597
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,542
Get lost! Now!

598
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,375
I curse you! Go!

599
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:35,959
Go way!

600
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:38,542
Ling Lingqi, get out!

601
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:49,417
Sorry! Sorry!

602
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,542
Sorry! Sorry!

603
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,459
Sorry! Sorry!

604
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:09,918
He’s out! He’s out!

605
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,209
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

606
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,292
Hurry!

607
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,584
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

608
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:15,375
At this year’s international exhibition,

609
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,999
there has just been a scandal.

610
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:17,918
Famous florist Bo Hai

611
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,542
was exposed to use a substitute.

612
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,999
He deceived the public for fame.

613
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,292
He refused to give any comment

614
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:23,334
on this matter

615
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:24,375
and fled in a flurry

616
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,000
from the exhibition.

617
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Get away! Don’t take photos!

618
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,334
I thought I sacrificed myself

619
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,584
so that you would let go of Bo Hai.

620
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,042
I didn’t expect you to use me

621
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,584
to stab him!

622
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:14,125
I knew

623
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,542
what kind of man you are.

624
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,083
But I still trusted you!

625
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:20,999
I believed you would let him go

626
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:23,167
as you promised.

627
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,292
He hides his health condition to the pubic

628
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,417
and uses a substitute.

629
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:31,834
I don’t think

630
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,167
I’ve done anything wrong.

631
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,125
He has only himself

632
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:38,999
to blame.

633
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,125
You knew

634
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:44,000
what you had done

635
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,542
to frame Bo Hai up.

636
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,167
To fight a mean man,

637
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,959
I must be meaner.

638
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:53,584
If you think

639
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:54,876
I should be sorry,

640
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,167
I’m only sorry to you.

641
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,042
I lied to you

642
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,751
and hurt you.

643
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:04,709
Sorry, Qi.

644
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:07,918
Sorry?

645
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:12,042
Is this the start of

646
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,542
another lie?

647
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,334
No, Qi.

648
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,209
Let me explain. Bo Hai...

649
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,334
Stay off me!

650
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,709
You make me sick!

651
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:24,250
I even helped

652
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:25,792
such a man like you!

653
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:26,876
I never hated myself

654
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,292
like I do now!

655
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,209
