Look at Liu Yingjie!

52
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,209
He’s totally ruining FlowerPlus!

53
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:46,501
Once someone is buying

54
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,292
our stocks,

55
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,959
stockholders begin to sell them.

56
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:50,584
Our plan

57
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:51,792
is going very smoothly.

58
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,000
It won’t be long

59
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:53,999
before we reach

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the expected target.

61
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:57,334
I can’t wait to

62
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,751
see him kneel and beg for mercy!

63
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,125
We’ll let him know

64
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,709
what goes around comes around.

65
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:03,834
We’ve been working hard

66
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:04,709
for days.

67
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:05,876
Why don’t we

68
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,209
celebrate tonight?

69
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,083
Good idea. How about barbecue?

70
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,417
Barbecue again?

71
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,626
Couldn’t we have something better?

72
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,834
How about the steak?

73
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,209
Okay. My treat.

74
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,167
Good.

75
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:20,792
Let’s bring Qi and Baoni.

76
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:28,667
Hello?

77
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,125
Is that Bo Hai?

78
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:31,999
Yes, this is.

79
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,250
This is the police station of Xishan District.

80
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,501
We’re sorry to tell you that

81
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,000
we just found

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,542
your mother’s body.

83
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,000
Please come as soon as possible

84
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:41,876
for the check

85
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,709
and related formalities.

86
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello, Mr. Bo Hai?

87
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:49,626
Did you hear me?

88
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,626
Hello, Mr. Bo Hai?

= Grave of Lu Yunqing By Bo Hai =

90
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,000
According to the technical check,

91
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,959
there isn’t any external damage

92
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,125
on her car.

93
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,584
The braking and steering systems

94
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:48,417
still have complete structures.

95
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:49,417
Your mother

96
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,667
wasn’t poisoned, either.

97
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:52,375
So,

98
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:53,918
we basically confirm that

99
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,125
when she was alive

100
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,417
and driving the car,

101
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,417
some accident happened.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,250
The car fell into the sea

103
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:00,792
and she drowned herself.

104
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,000
We’re still investigating

105
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,626
the details.

106
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,250
We found this box

107
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:07,918
in her bank safe.

108
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,334
She saved it before she died.

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,876
All personal stuff.

110
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,918
Before the car accident,

111
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:15,959
there was a fire

112
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,209
in Yunhe Flower Shop.

113
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,542
We also found a firefighter

114
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,250
who fought the fire.

115
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,999
He told us something

116
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,209
related to you.

117
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:25,918
According to him,

118
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,000
that night...

119
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,083
Mom, help!

120
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:30,667
Hai!

121
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,667
Mom, help!

122
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:32,792
Hai!

123
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,417
Hurry! Someone is in there! Help him!

124
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,209
Help me!

125
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:45,417
Mom! Mom!

126
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,167
In the past twenty years,

127
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,083
I’ve lived a life,

128
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,792
hating my mother.

129
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,626
I hate her for abandoning me

130
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,709
and making me an orphan.

131
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,792
And my childhood was filled with

132
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,918
loneliness and betrayal.

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,125
It’s been twenty years.

134
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:20,626
The hatred

135
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,959
has turned into

136
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,417
some chronic disease.

137
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,959
I try hard not to think about it.

138
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,042
But it still exists

139
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,751
in my memory

140
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,000
in the most ferocious way.

141
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:41,751
But you know what?

142
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,959
I hate her,

143
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,959
just because I love her.

144
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:53,834
The more I care,

145
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,667
and the more I depend on her,

146
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,709
the more I hate her.

147
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,834
I couldn’t remember

148
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,959
how many nights

149
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,209
I woke up from the nightmare.

150
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:27,417
I dreamed that

151
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,417
she left me mercilessly.

152
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:39,834
When I knew

153
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,167
she was dead,

154
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,000
I wish it were wrong.

155
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,375
How I wish

156
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,542
it were another nightmare.

157
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,042
In this world,

158
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:23,792
no mother wants to

159
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,375
abandon her own child.

160
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,375
I wish

161
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,000
she really abandoned me

162
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,000
or she were a criminal

163
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,751
who had run away.

164
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,125
As long as she is still alive.

165
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,542
It’s been so many years.

166
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,083
And you finally know the truth.

167
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,125
When your mother knows

168
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,000
you forgive her,

169
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,751
she’ll be relieved in the heaven.

170
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,125
I hated her for twenty years.

171
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,375
It turns out that

172
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,709
she never abandoned me.

173
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,959
I haven’t ever lost

174
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,209
the love from my mother.

175
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,667
What I care for most

176
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,334
and cherish most

177
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:45,834
has always been with me,

178
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,042
defending me

179
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:52,792
and has never left me.

180
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,334
This is my mother and me.

181
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,999
We’ll always be together.

182
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:08,626
Mom.

183
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,375
I washed your handkerchief today.

184
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,459
Does it look clean?

185
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,834
This is the ship model I made.

186
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,292
For your birthday.

187
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,709
So,

188
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,834
to your mother,

189
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,667
the most valuable thing

190
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,584
is the memory with you.

191
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,834
Mom.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,792
If I could turn back the clock,

193
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,459
how I wish I could

194
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,501
say sorry to you.

195
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:21,083
Hai, still sleeping?

196
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:23,584
Time to get up!

197
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,542
Have some breakfast and don’t be late.

198
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,584
Hai, sit down.

199
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,167
Sit.

200
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:52,584
Have some breakfast. Come.

201
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,584
Hurry. Come for your breakfast.

202
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,167
Have a dough stick.

203
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,542
It’s my signature dish.

204
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,918
Try if you like it.

205
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,083
Come on! Eat more,

206
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,584
when you’re growing up.

207
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,125
Come on. Have some beef.

208
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,375
It’s your favorite.

209
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,792
I specially made it for you.

210
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,042
Try if it tastes good!

211
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,959
Four major factors for wedding flowers.

212
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,751
Big, colorful,

213
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,584
fresh and propitious.

214
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,375
But look at what you’ve made.

215
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,918
Doesn’t look generous at all.

216
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:42,501
Mom!

217
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:44,626
It’s the 21st century.

218
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:45,667
People no longer want

219
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,792
too colorful flowers.

220
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:49,999
How many days have you worked?

221
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,918
And you dare to argue with me?

222
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,417
I’m teaching you,

223
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,999
with my experience.

224
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:58,083
Listen carefully!

225
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:00,959
For a wedding,

226
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,292
we usually use the lily,

227
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,584
representing the harmonious union.

228
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,250
And the rose, representing love.

229
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,209
Love.

230
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,959
Strelitzia represents a happy couple.

231
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,792
The flamingo flower represents mutual affinity.

232
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,209
Oncidium represents

233
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,167
a pleasant mood.

234
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,792
Generally,

235
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,125
we adopt a western style

236
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,751
to do the decoration.

237
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,751
We use more leaves

238
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,125
to made up

239
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,584
a regular pattern,

240
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,501
so that people will find it

241
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,876
generous, warm and lucky.

242
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:47,792
Got it!

243
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,459
I’ll use the lily, then.

244
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,209
No way.

245
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,083
So few flowers!

246
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:04,209
How could you give

247
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,375
a jubilant atmosphere?

248
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:12,626
How about this?

249
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,876
Hai.

250
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,792
I will sooner or later

251
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,584
hand over my company to you.

252
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,334
But you’re far from

253
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:25,751
being a boss

254
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,792
for a flower company.

255
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,918
Yes. I must learn from you

256
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,834
for some more years.

257
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,125
But Mom...

258
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,542
I’m a little tired.

259
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:42,959
Could you make me some chicken soup?

260
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,584
All right. As long as you learn carefully,

261
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,375
I’ll make you anything you want.

262
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,083
Okay. Keep working!

263
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,542
Mom!

264
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,542
You’re getting old.

265
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,834
Silly boy.

266
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,501
You’re taller than me.

267
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,918
I must have been older.

268
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,292
How I wish I could always stay with you

269
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,999
like this.

270
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,709
You stayed with me as I grew up.

271
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,709
I’ll stay with you as you grow old.

272
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:43,959
Mom.

273
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,209
If I blamed you wrongly

274
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:50,417
for a long time,

275
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,250
would you forgive me?

276
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:57,959
Sure.

277
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,209
You’re the only one I care for.

278
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:02,792
And you’re my precious

279
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,083
in this world.

280
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,209
Sorry, Mom.

281
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:18,501
Sorry.

282
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:24,334
Hai, I’m sorry.

283
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,167
Sorry for not staying with you.

284
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,209
You suffered so much

285
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,292
at a young age.

286
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:39,626
Mom.

287
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,709
Don’t leave me again, will you?

288
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:49,959
Hai.

289
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,501
I am

290
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,501
always with you.

291
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:47,751
Boss, here he is.

292
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,042
Leave us.

293
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:53,083
Didn’t I ask you

294
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,042
to hide yourself?

295
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,542
Why are you coming to me?

296
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,459
Lu Yunqing’s body

297
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,125
was got out of the sea.

298
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:00,667
The police went there.

299
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,542
You didn’t kill her, did you?

300
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,000
No.

301
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,459
Don’t lie to me.

302
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:09,959
If I hadn’t been greedy

303
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,417
and taken some money from you,

304
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,667
I wouldn’t have been

305
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:14,167
your accomplice

306
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,792
and I wouldn’t have lived

307
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:16,125
such a fearful life.

308
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,000
You really didn’t kill her?

309
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,584
I’m old enough.

310
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:26,667
I don’t want to...

311
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,501
Shut up!

312
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,709
You didn’t hesitate at all

313
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:30,999
when you took money from me.

314
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:32,959
Now there’s trouble.

315
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:35,334
And you’re going to

316
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,918
get out of everything?

317
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,834
What... What do you mean?

318
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:39,918
I didn’t kill her!

319
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,250
But I’m haunted with fear.

320
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,999
Mo Nan and Bo Hai are looking for me.

321
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,626
So are the police.

322
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:46,918
How about this?

323
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,250
If you really didn’t kill her,

324
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:49,417
let’s go and surrender ourselves.

325
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,834
Are you crazy?

326
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,709
Do you think you’ll live a better life

327
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,042
in jail?

328
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,501
You’d better shut up!

329
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,000
Or

330
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,542
you’ll never manage to talk.

331
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,834
Hide yourself

332
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,375
and let no one find you.

333
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,542
Get out!

334
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:36,792
Mom.

335
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,209
I remember

336
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,420
this is your favorite color.

337
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,667
= Grave of Lu Yunqing By Bo Hai =

338
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,209
= Grave of Lu Yunqing By Bo Hai =
When I was little,

339
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,250
I didn’t understand

340
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:50,584
why you simply liked green

341
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,125
while there were so many

342
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,999
colorful flowers.

343
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,501
You told me

344
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,083
green was the color of

345
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,667
mountains and rivers.

346
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,083
Green represents

347
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,542
the rebirth and hope

348
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,125
when all plants grow.

349
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,125
It’s not warm or blazing.

350
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,083
But it has a magic power

351
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,626
to heal.

352
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,542
I think now I understand.

353
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:27,042
Mom.

354
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:30,459
Rest in peace.

355
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,626
I’ve grown up.

356
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:50,792
Aunt.

357
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:52,834
Don’t worry.

358
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,792
We will find out the truth.

359
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,959
I’ll take back everything

360
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,042
that has been taken away.

361
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,000
And the bad guys will go to hell.

362
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,375
You’ll be proud of us

363
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,626
in the heaven.

364
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,083
Time to go back.

365
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,334
Our company isn’t doing well lately.

366
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:42,918
Some stockholders

367
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:43,834
have sold their stocks

368
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:45,834
to other companies.

369
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:47,999
But new stockholders

370
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,834
haven’t come today.

371
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:51,751
What?

372
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,459
Not even to the stockholders’ meeting?

373
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,999
Look what a mess we’re in.

374
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:57,751
I’m afraid

375
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:59,209
they’re too disappointed

376
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,459
to come.

377
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,709
I also want to sell my stocks and leave.

378
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,542
But no one wants

379
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,584
such a hot potato.

380
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,667
According to the regulations,

381
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:11,417
if someone doesn’t come,

382
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,250
he will voluntarily abandon his right.

383
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,959
That’s his own problem.

384
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,834
So,

385
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:16,999
they’ll have to regret

386
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,459
for not coming.

387
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,125
Time is running out. Let’s get started.

388
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,042
In this season,

389
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,501
our cost

390
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:28,999
is 0.57 billion yuan.

391
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:30,709
The year-on-year growth

392
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,125
is 43.7%.

393
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:35,334
But the total revenue

394
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,250
is merely 0.39 billion yuan.

395
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:46,918
What are you coming for?

396
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,083
For the stockholders’ meeting, of course.

397
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:51,459
What? Are you kidding?

398
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,459
Are you qualified

399
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,626
for this meeting?

400
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:58,751
In the past month,

401
00:24:59,125 --> 00:24:59,999
seven companies,

402
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,042
including Meitai Technology, Zhongtian Industry,

403
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,375
and Tianheng Trade

404
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,626
bought the stocks of FlowerPlus

405
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,834
from stockholders.

406
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:08,375
What?

407
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,209
Mr. Mo and I

408
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,584
are the actual controllers of

409
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:12,709
these seven companies.

410
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:14,626
The stocks I have

411
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:15,459
are more than

412
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:16,709
those you have.

413
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,709
Don’t you think

414
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:19,999
I’m qualified to come?

415
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,042
Well, if so,

416
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,042
Mr. Bo is qualified

417
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,083
to attend the meeting.

418
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,501
You’re a strong stockholder.

419
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:34,834
But you must obey the rule, too.

420
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:41,292
Don’t forget. I’m the chairman.

421
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,042
That’s your rule.

422
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,626
Not mine.

423
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,375
I have a suggestion.

424
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,459
Why don’t we

425
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:48,501
reform the board of directors

426
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,000
at this meeting

427
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:52,250
and select a new chairman?

428
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:54,876
We have hope!

429
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:55,417
Yeah!

430
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,042
Have you heard of it?

431
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,000
Mr. Bo is back!

432
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:05,918
Really?

433
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,167
So is Mr. Mo.

434
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:07,918
Really?

435
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,542
When they work together,

436
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:11,918
they’ll certainly defeat William

437
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,292
all over!

438
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,876
Well,

439
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:17,584
according to the votes,

440
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,584
Bo Hai is selected as the chairman

441
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,542
with a 9-1 victory.

442
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:40,792
I think you should

443
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,584
give back my seat.

444
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:04,999
Mr. Bo is much better.

445
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:14,751
Good news! Good news!

446
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:15,918
Mr. Bo is

447
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:16,709
our chairman again!

448
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,042
Terrific!

449
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:18,834
Awesome!

450
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:20,542
Great!

451
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:21,417
Awesome!

452
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:22,584
Wonderful!

453
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,876
Mr. Bo! Mr. Bo! Mr. Bo!

454
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:37,292
Everybody, how are you doing?

455
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,167
Not well.

456
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:48,209
Sorry to keep you suffering this year.

457
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,999
When our boss is back,

458
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,792
someone can no longer

459
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,167
act wildly.

460
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:54,999
Let’s work hard together!

461
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,626
We will get over the difficulty

462
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,751
and succeed again!

463
00:27:58,999 --> 00:27:59,375
Okay!

464
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:00,083
Okay!

465
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,000
Even if we order many dishes

466
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:12,626
and enjoy ourselves,

467
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,792
it won’t cost much.

468
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,334
Well, our boss has been

469
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,959
buying our stocks.

470
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,209
He feels the pinch now.

471
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:19,876
Sorry for that.

472
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,334
But I can guarantee you.

473
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:22,584
After we return to normal,

474
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,417
we’ll buy you the most expensive food!

475
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:24,999
Okay?

476
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,000
To the most expensive restaurant!

477
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:26,876
Okay!

478
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:27,959
Then deduct

479
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:28,751
the extra cost

480
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:29,751
from Secretary Chen’s pay.

481
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You sound like

482
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,292
you’re the wife of our boss!

483
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:33,876
You!

484
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,292
Have something to eat!

485
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,792
Stop talking!

486
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,792
I want to propose a toast to you.

487
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,709
Hope you can

488
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:50,501
forget what I have done

489
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,334
and forgive me.

490
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:53,751
Cheers.

491
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,792
Xinyan, what are you doing?

492
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,459
Don’t be mean.

493
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,501
Sorry.

494
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:04,000
I can’t easily forget things.

495
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:10,667
Xinyan.

496
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:15,584
In the past,

497
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,334
I did many wrong things.

498
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,125
That’s why I hope

499
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,626
I can work with Bo Hai

500
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:22,999
and defeat William

501
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,125
and atone for my mistake in my own way.

502
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:28,167
Fine, then.

503
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:31,292
Drink all the wine on the table

504
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,334
and I’ll forgive you.

505
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:35,334
Oh, what an evil woman!

506
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,292
Bo Hai, why do you help him?

507
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,000
He’s my buddy.

508
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,417
I should take the blame with him.

509
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,209
We’re glad when he corrects himself.

510
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,709
Come on. We support you.

511
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,334
All right. Don’t be sentimental!

512
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:45,709
Cheers.

513
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:48,999
To our first victory!

514
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:51,375
To our final victory!

515
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:52,083
Come on!

516
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,876
Hope we can defeat Liu Yingjie

517
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,042
and make him beg!

518
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:57,167
Cheers!

519
00:30:58,584 --> 00:30:59,167
Xinyan.

520
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:06,292
Come on!

521
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:13,501
Qi and Bo Hai

522
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,626
are having a great time.

523
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,209
I’m so jealous.

524
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,999
We used to imagine

525
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,042
what our boyfriends

526
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,209
would be like.

527
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:23,709
Handsome?

528
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:24,959
Rich?

529
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,626
Smart?

530
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,209
Or talented?

531
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:31,999
Not at all.

532
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:34,125
When a girl meets

533
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,292
his Mr. Right,

534
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,125
she’ll know

535
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,751
nothing else matters.

536
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,417
Just because it’s him.

537
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:47,292
Don’t worry.

538
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,292
You’ll meet your Mr. Right.

539
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,999
What’s your next plan?

540
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,834
I’m thinking about

541
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,125
how I can

542
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,999
defeat Liu Yingjie.

543
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,167
Come on!

544
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,834
I’ll always be with you.

545
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,918
Thank you, Baoni.

546
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,000
I’ll walk myself back.

547
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,501
I live down there.

548
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:22,000
Tell me

549
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,334
after you get home.

550
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,709
Bye-bye.

551
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:31,417
If it’s late and I forget to tell you,

552
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:38,709
don’t wait for me.

553
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,334
I had planned to be romantic.

554
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:38,959
If I knew it,

555
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,584
I would have driven you back.

556
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:41,667
If you had,

557
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:42,918
we would have been home.

558
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,876
But now we can walk

559
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:44,876
for more minutes.

560
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:45,709
Let’s go.

561
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:47,125
Go.

562
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:50,999
I regret.

563
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,125
Like this.

564
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,000
Come on.

565
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:06,459
Does it remind you

566
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:07,834
what you did?

567
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,834
Girls like us

568
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:10,709
sometimes are born

569
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,542
to be drama queens.

570
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,167
You know what?

571
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,834
If a boy comes to us,

572
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:17,999
and he’s handsome,

573
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,167
plays basketball and rides a bike,

574
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,459
maybe he has hair

575
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,334
with the same color as the sky.

576
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:23,250
Then we will easily

577
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,918
fall in love.

578
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,751
And we’ll imagine

579
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:28,626
how we can meet him in a dramatic way

580
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:29,999
and how we fall in love

581
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,542
in a romantic way.

582
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,542
After getting married,

583
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,792
we’ll have three babies.

584
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,250
I even think of what kind of carpet

585
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,334
we’ll use.

586
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:39,375
But in fact,

587
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:40,709
it takes only a few minutes

588
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:42,000
to meet this guy.

589
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:43,792
He has gone far.

590
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,459
And he doesn’t know me at all.

591
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:46,792
And everything is

592
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,375
just my imagination.

593
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:51,417
You’re the guy to me.

594
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,501
What do you mean?

595
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:56,751
I want to tell you.

596
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,584
I’ve understood everything.

597
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,459
You’re the man who gave me flowers,

598
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:01,751
who showed off

599
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,042
in the flower industry,

600
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:04,334
who was rude

601
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,876
and tortured me,

602
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,918
who tucked me in secretly,

603
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:11,334
and

604
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,459
who made every effort for his employees,

605
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:14,751
who didn’t explain

606
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,042
even if he was misunderstood.

607
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:17,709
All are the true you.

608
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:19,209
But I like

609
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,751
the one who gave flowers to me.

610
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:24,417
You haven’t changed.

611
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,250
But I have.

612
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,417
The true you

613
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:31,999
make me true, too,

614
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,083
even if I like to imagine.

615
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,918
So, I want to tell you.

616
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:43,209
I love the true you,

617
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:44,918
and the whole you.

618
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:03,250
What do I do?

619
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,876
I think I love you more.

620
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:34,834
Please enjoy yourselves.

621
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,292
They must be

622
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:43,751
celebrating the victory.

623
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:45,167
Boss.

624
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,209
You didn’t see

625
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:47,918
how arrogant they were today!

626
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,834
They’re too young

627
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,000
and have their hearts on their sleeves.

628
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,709
I just can’t let it go!

629
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:07,876
You just realize

630
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,250
you can’t let it go.

631
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:10,417
But it’s too late.

632
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:23,375
The globefish tastes great.

633
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:24,000
Have a try.

634
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,667
It’s a funny fish.

635
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,667
It tastes delicious,

636
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:35,250
but it’s also toxic.

637
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:36,751
The cook

638
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,876
must be very skilled.

639
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:40,542
Otherwise,

640
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,375
customers will just kill themselves.

641
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:46,417
Try it.

642
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,834
Obviously, the young men

643
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:56,292
overestimate their skills.

644
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:03,626
FlowerPlus,

645
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:04,709
which enjoyed a high popularity,

646
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,125
has been stuck in

647
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,209
a tight spot

648
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,709
because of poor management

649
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:09,918
since it was acquired by DREAM.

650
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,334
According to an insider,

651
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,083
FlowerPlus fails to pay

652
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,000
a huge debt in time,

653
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,999
so that all creditors bring a suit.

654
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,876
According to its current financial status,

655
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,542
once the court thinks

656
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:20,459
FlowerPlus is unable to pay its debt,

657
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:22,000
it may have to

658
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
go bankruptcy proceedings.

659
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,209
According to all information,

660
00:38:28,626 --> 00:38:29,834
creditors ask for proper resolution.

661
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,209
The debt is clear.

662
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,083
The judge is very likely to

663
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,292
give us the involuntary bankruptcy.

664
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,209
If we go bankrupt,

665
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:39,167
all our stocks

666
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,667
will be wasted.

667
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:42,542
Now I think about it.

668
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:43,501
Everything was going

669
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,042
too smoothly.

670
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:46,751
Could this acquisition

671
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:47,334
be another trap

672
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:49,125
set by William?

673
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,834
Calm down and think about it.

674
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,042
It’s really his style.

675
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,292
I was too careless.

676
00:38:58,918 --> 00:38:59,542
Yeah.

677
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,125
He paid no attention

678
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:02,209
when we bought the stocks.

679
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:03,834
After we use all our money,

680
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,250
he will make FlowerPlus go bankrupt

681
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:06,751
so that all our efforts

682
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,042
will be wasted.

683
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,125
But that doesn’t feel right.

684
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:10,834
That day,

685
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,375
when he gave up the seat of chairman,

686
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,000
he looked

687
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:13,999
rather angry.

688
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,375
Worse than a ghost!

689
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,751
He’s always a great actor.

690
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,083
But we were blinded

691
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,501
by our anger.

692
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:25,000
We have

693
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:27,209
underestimated him.

694
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,626
It’s been twenty years.

695
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,292
I thought your son

696
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:41,667
should have been smarter than you.

697
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:42,834
Unexpectedly,

698
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,667
he’s far more stupid.

699
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,140
= Grave of Lu Yunqing By Bo Hai =

700
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,542
What?

701
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:58,876
Not convinced?

702
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,709
If he weren’t stupid,

703
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,751
he shouldn’t have fought back against me.

704
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:09,876
I had planned to stop

705
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,876
after I destroyed FlowerPlus.

706
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,626
He got a worse result,

707
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:18,000
only because he was ungrateful

708
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,918
and he asked for trouble.

709
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:26,709
Today is

710
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,834
a day to celebrate.

711
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:35,083
I avenged my son.

712
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:37,834
And you son

713
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,876
lost everything.

714
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,292
Equinox flowers for you.

715
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:48,125
They were said to

716
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,334
go to the nether world voluntarily.

717
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,250
After sent back,

718
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,250
they lingered on the way to the nether world.

719
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,042
Demons were moved,

720
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:57,751
and allowed them

721
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,042
to bloom along the way.

722
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,792
People go to the nether world along the way

723
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:08,626
with equinox flowers on both sides.

724
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:15,626
Your son

725
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:20,667
is coming to you soon.

726
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,250
I know you must be hiding here.

727
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,292
I’m not hiding.

728
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,459
I just come to see

729
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,000
if the flowers can heal me.
