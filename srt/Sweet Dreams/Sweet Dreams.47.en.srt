51
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,667
Equinox flowers for you.

52
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:44,626
They were said to

53
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,959
go to the nether world voluntarily.

54
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,626
After sent back,

55
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,584
they lingered on the way to the nether world.

56
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:52,459
Demons were moved,

57
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:53,999
and allowed them

58
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,542
to bloom along the way.

59
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,292
People go to the nether world along the way

60
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:04,918
with equinox flowers on both sides.

61
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,125
I know you must be hiding here.

62
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,167
I’m not hiding.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,167
I just come to see

64
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,792
if the flowers can heal me.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,918
Do they heal you then?

66
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,751
A four-leaf clover!

67
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,000
You know what?

68
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,417
The probability to find a four-leaf clover

69
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:52,292
among the clovers

70
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,584
is hundred thousandth.

71
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:54,250
You’re the

72
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,626
very lucky guy.

73
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,083
Aren’t you awesome?

74
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,042
Not... Not bad.

75
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,626
What do you mean “not bad”?

76
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:03,918
The four-leaf clover is also known as

77
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,000
Lucky Clover.

78
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:06,584
Whoever has it

79
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,125
will always be lucky.

80
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,959
Oh, turns out

81
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,334
it’s the magic power of flowers!

82
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,751
Don’t tease me!

83
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,250
So, you will

84
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,125
go through the difficult period.

85
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:40,876
Don’t rob!

86
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:41,459
Don’t let them in!

87
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,626
Don’t take it! No!

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,042
Put it down!

89
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,542
Don’t take it away! Give it back!

90
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,876
Make way!

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,292
Don’t squeeze!

92
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,209
Why did you knock her down?

93
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:53,375
Compensate for our loss!

94
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,417
Pay back the debt! Don’t you know?

95
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:56,751
Take them away!

96
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:57,501
Ignore them!

97
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,334
Take as much as we can!

98
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,167
If we don’t,

99
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,918
we’ll be screwed after they go bankrupt!

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,751
Hurry! Take them away!

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,751
Take everything away. Hurry!

102
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:05,626
- Hurry. - Stop!

103
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,417
Stop snatching!

104
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,209
Put it down!

105
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:08,918
Put it down!

106
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,083
Stop snatching!

107
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,584
We’re looking at what is happening

108
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,876
at the headquarters of FlowerPlus.

109
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:13,792
The rumor about bankruptcy

110
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,125
panics the suppliers.

111
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,792
They come to plunder

112
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:16,999
the inventories in FlowerPlus.

113
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:17,667
They’re obviously

114
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,792
breaking the law.

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,042
But the suppliers

116
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,250
are also pitiful.

117
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,459
What are you doing?

118
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,620
= Mo Nan =

119
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,000
Sorry, our boss isn’t in.

120
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:21,876
What?

121
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,292
Don’t dare to come in?

122
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,375
It’s not time to celebrate yet.

123
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:40,876
Young man!

124
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,751
When you’re not strong enough,

125
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,334
you should be modest,

126
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,709
and learn to give up.

127
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,459
Whatever trick you use,

128
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,834
I’m not going to give up.

129
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,709
That sounds familiar.

130
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:56,751
Twenty years ago,

131
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,083
Lu Yunqing said

132
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,292
the same thing.

133
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:02,292
Seems like you inherit her way of

134
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,751
talking big.

135
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,083
I guess if you also inherit

136
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:10,959
her bad luck.

137
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,709
I’m different from my mother.

138
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:20,999
Being kind to a bad guy

139
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,083
is being cruel to myself.

140
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,083
Remember.

141
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:26,918
Whatever you have done,

142
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:29,542
I’ll double it and take revenge.

143
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,751
Look at the investors.

144
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:48,667
They used to urge us

145
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,417
for investment opportunities.

146
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,375
Now they avoid us

147
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:51,542
as if we were the pestilence.

148
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,709
How heartless!

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,751
All the banks refuse to

150
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:55,999
provide a loan.

151
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,042
They don’t want to take a risk

152
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,542
because our company

153
00:06:58,542 --> 00:06:59,209
doesn’t have a clear financial position.

154
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,542
Bo Hai and Mo Nan

155
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:02,792
can do nothing,

156
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,292
but sell themselves.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,709
What a situation we’re in!

158
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,375
Why are you still kidding?

159
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,542
All creditors refuse to

160
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,834
extend the payment days

161
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,292
or do debt-for-equity swaps.

162
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,167
They’re

163
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,667
pushing us!

164
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:15,999
Do we really

165
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,501
have no way out?

166
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:29,626
Thank you.

167
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,626
Does your leg still hurt?

168
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,918
No. It’s much better.

169
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,083
Sorry, Baoni.

170
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,000
It’s not your fault.

171
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,167
William is to blame.

172
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:49,959
He’s sinister and he used dirty tricks

173
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,209
to ruin our company.

174
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,334
Luckily, Bo Hai is here.

175
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,959
And you’re so talented.

176
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:57,959
You will find a way

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,209
to deal with him, won’t you?

178
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,292
William has been working

179
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,626
in the business world for dozens of years.

180
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,709
He’s very careful.

181
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:10,083
And he’s merciless.

182
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,999
It’s hard to deal with him.

183
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,459
I don’t understand much

184
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:18,209
about the business.

185
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,959
But I know

186
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,209
what goes around comes around.

187
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:23,626
He’s such a bad guy.

188
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:24,542
I believe

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,876
we’ll have something

190
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,125
on him!

191
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,584
He’s so cunning that

192
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:32,334
it’s not easy

193
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,834
to have something on him.

194
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,667
Yeah. It’s smart of you.

195
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,167
But he still cheated you for long.

196
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,042
Yeah.

197
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,292
I was also cheated for long.

198
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,959
He seems to be a bad ass.

199
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:07,584
What are you thinking of?

200
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,792
You can’t be trying to suicide!

201
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,999
What are you talking about?

202
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,250
You watched too many soap operas.

203
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:14,584
Let me guess.

204
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:15,709
You’re thinking

205
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,250
what we’re going to have for dinner.

206
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:18,250
Right?

207
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,209
You know what?

208
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,292
I miss the osmanthus cake

209
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,209
you made for me.

210
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,083
That was when

211
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,542
you chased me shamelessly

212
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:28,667
and made some for me.

213
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,167
That’s easy!

214
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,918
Easy?

215
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:34,459
But in such a long time,

216
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,083
you only made it for me once.

217
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:37,834
Did you ask someone else

218
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:38,751
to make it?

219
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,626
Your mother, for example?

220
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:43,709
Wait.

221
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:44,792
I’ll go buy the ingredients

222
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,334
and show you

223
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,459
how I create a miracle.

224
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:02,417
Have a try.

225
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,042
How does it taste?

226
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,083
It tastes

227
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,709
too sweet.

228
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,375
We eat sweet things

229
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,667
because life is always bitter

230
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:25,709
instead of being sweet.

231
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,334
We need something sweet.

232
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:28,792
Besides,

233
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,584
sweets secrete dopamine,

234
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,542
so that we’ll feel better.

235
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,083
That’s what I’ve experienced.

236
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,083
It sticks.

237
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,501
Do you feel better now?

238
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:58,834
I made sweets

239
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,250
to make you happy.

240
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:01,876
Why don’t you say something

241
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:02,918
to make me happy, too?

242
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:11,918
Now I feel better.

243
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,459
Have some drink with me.

244
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:35,209
Waiter, water, please.

245
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,999
Changed your flavor?

246
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:38,667
No more vodka?

247
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,083
I don’t feel very well.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,334
And I shouldn’t drink

249
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:43,918
in recent days.

250
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,501
Take care of yourself.

251
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:47,834
If you die,

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,083
you’ll have nothing.

253
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:51,417
Don’t worry.

254
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,459
I’ll try living a longer life than you.

255
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,083
Young man.

256
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,626
Don’t bother arguing meaninglessly.

257
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:05,709
Mo Nan.

258
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:07,709
If you weren’t the son of

259
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:08,959
my enemy,

260
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,626
I would appreciate you.

261
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,667
Anyway,

262
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,959
I trained you personally.

263
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,000
Unfortunately,

264
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:20,501
you haven’t learned

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,792
anything useful.

266
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:28,167
Being selfish is the way to survive.

267
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:29,834
A man,

268
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,501
however gentle he pretends to be,

269
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,542
is a selfish demon

270
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,042
in essence.

271
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,292
For selfish interests,

272
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,209
he would rather kill people,

273
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,918
than regret.

274
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,959
This is the scariest thing of

275
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,083
human nature.

276
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,417
But it’s also the only pass

277
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,834
to success.

278
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:02,417
Does a man only live for himself?

279
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,501
Sure.

280
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,000
That’s what Lu Yunqing and Yin Changhe

281
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,250
taught me.

282
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,959
To live,

283
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,000
you can just kill others?

284
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,626
If I hadn’t driven you and Bo Hai

285
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:19,792
into a desperate situation,

286
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:21,501
would you let me go?

287
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,167
You would still kill me.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,125
Since we have to

289
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,667
fight desperately,

290
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,667
I don’t think

291
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:33,584
I have another way out.

292
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,375
Man would rather kill people,

293
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,709
than regret.

294
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,501
Good point.

295
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,459
It doesn’t matter who dies.

296
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,501
In a life-and-death struggle,

297
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:03,709
there’s no success

298
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,000
unless someone is dead.

299
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,667

will find a way out.

Yeah. We don’t want to leave!

At present,

we can’t afford it.

00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,083
We don’t want the liquidated damage.

351
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,250
We witnessed

352
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,709
how our company was developed.

353
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,000
We don’t want to

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,751
watch it disappear.

355
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:12,292
Yeah!

356
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,209
- Yes! - Yes!

357
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,584
We don’t want to leave!

358
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,584
We’re not leaving!

359
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:16,918
Why must we go?

360
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,292
As a stockholder of FlowerPlus,

361
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,876
I’m really moved

362
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,834
by what you said.

363
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:31,999
But this company

364
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:32,876
has come to

365
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,999
its end.

366
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:36,167
The bankrupt procedure has started.

367
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:37,626
Please cooperate with us.

368
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,834
We all know

369
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,167
who has been behind all this.

370
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:43,042
Don’t pretend

371
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:44,292
to be helping us.

372
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,834
Mr. Bo is always our boss!

373
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,417
We’re going to defend our company.

374
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:49,459
- Yes! -Yes!

375
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:49,918
Exactly!

376
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,417
Some bad guys

377
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,083
will get the retribution soon!

378
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,042
If you keep arguing,

379
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:01,959
you’ll be sorry.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,334
They’ve been fired.

381
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,000
Kick them out.

382
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:08,375
Go. Go kick them out.

383
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:10,000
What are you doing?

384
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,042
What are you doing?

385
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,375
What are you doing?

386
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,167
What are you doing?

387
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,959
Stop! She’s a girl!

388
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,792
Let go of me!

389
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,125
Stay off her! Let her go!

390
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,542
Stop!

391
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:19,834
Let go of me!

392
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,000
What on earth do you want?

393
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,667
The bankrupt procedure is paused.

394
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:50,999
What happened?

395
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,209
Mo Nan

396
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,459
surrendered himself to the Flower Art Association.

397
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,542
What?

398
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:02,959
He confessed

399
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,334
what we did

400
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,334
when acquiring FlowerPlus.

401
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:06,959
The Flower Art Association thinks

402
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,751
DREAM did a business fraud

403
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,417
and illicit competition.

404
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So, they applied to the court

405
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,209
to pause the bankrupt procedure.

406
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:14,250
And they’ll make

407
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,167
a profound investigation.

408
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,834
What a life-and-death struggle!

409
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,375
How stupid Mo Nan is!

410
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,000
He sacrificed himself.

411
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:28,083
Oh,

412
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:29,292
Boss.

413
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,167
This is s letter from Mo Nan.

414
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,292
A man is always selfish.

415
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,918
But in this world,

416
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,626
there is still love,

417
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,417
except money and interest.

418
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,667
It makes people unselfish

419
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,792
and generous.

420
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,700
= Flower Art Association =

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,167
Why didn’t you discuss with me?

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,125
You wouldn’t agree.

423
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,834
Once you’re guilty,

424
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,959
you’ll have to pay a huge compensation.

425
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,209
And...

426
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,501
your career

427
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:50,542
will be influenced, too.

428
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,626
I know.

429
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,709
I’m doing this,

430
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:55,459
just to pay a price for

431
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:56,334
all the mistakes

432
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:57,667
I have made.

433
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,709
I did so many wrong things

434
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,709
and I had so much pressure.

435
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,375
This makes me feel relaxed.

436
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,667
I told you.

437
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:12,709
Bo Hai and I

438
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,375
don’t hate what you have done.

439
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,542
But I do.

440
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:20,626
I hate it

441
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:21,834
when I was so stupid

442
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,083
that I was cheated by William.

443
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,584
I hate it when I brought an immeasurable loss

444
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,667
to FlowerPlus.

445
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,000
Most importantly,

446
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:32,459
I hate it

447
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:33,792
when I hurt you

448
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,459
so much.

449
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,167
I’m sorry, Qi.

450
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,959
If I didn’t do this,

451
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,334
I wouldn’t have felt at ease

452
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:46,751
all my life.

453
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:52,584
So, Qi,

454
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:54,999
you must be happy.

455
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,167
Unexpectedly,

456
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,542
it is Mo Nan

457
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:09,709
who saved our company.

458
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:10,542
Yeah.

459
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,000
We cursed him.

460
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,375
What a shame.

461
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,375
I respect him.

462
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:17,834
He’s a real man!

463
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,042
Baoni, you’re Mo Nan’s good friend.

464
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,334
Why don’t you ask him out

465
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,959
and we’ll treat him to dinner?

466
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:31,876
Baoni?

467
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:33,667
We were talking to you.

468
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:35,999
Baoni.

469
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:38,834
What’s wrong?

470
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,250
Qi has blamed me

471
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:04,751
for all of you.

472
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,876
Please show some mercy

473
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:08,626
and let me go.

474
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:12,334
I’m not coming to blame you.

475
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:16,542
I just come to tell you that

476
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,959
I said I would forget you,

477
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,042
but I didn’t really mean that.

478
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,000
In my heart,

479
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:33,709
you’re always

480
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:34,751
the most important guy.

481
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:39,542
So,

482
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,876
whatever punishment you may get

483
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:42,959
from the Flower Art Association,

484
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,209
I will always

485
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,167
support you.

486
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,584
Thank you, my fairy.

487
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,292
Enjoy it, or it’s getting cold.

488
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:06,709
It smells good!

489
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:21,792
Uh...

490
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,125
I think

491
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,167
I’m going to lose my job.

492
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,250
And in quite a long time,

493
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:31,792
no one dares to hire me.

494
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,751
Could you pay

495
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:36,626
for this meal?

496
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,334
I paid last time!

497
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:43,751
No way!

498
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,042
Do you think

499
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,334
I’ll take advantage of a girl?

500
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,167
Shall we check the transaction record?

501
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,209
Why not?

502
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:53,667
My card is cancelled.

503
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,000
I’m a poor man.

504
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,250
Check as you wish.

505
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:57,667
Poor? Then why did you

506
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:58,876
buy such expensive lunchboxes?

507
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,834
We’re good friends.

508
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:05,959
Don’t be mean.

509
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,751
Or why don’t you sell me?

510
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:09,709
I’m not worth too much, anyway.

511
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:14,876
Don’t enjoy it then.

512
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:15,792
Give the meat to me.

513
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,834
That’s mean!

514
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:21,792
Have some vegetables.

515
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,375
All right. Have this sausage, too.

516
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,125
Could you give me your broccoli?

517
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,876
Life is too hard.

518
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:41,501
All right.

519
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,459
It feels so good,

520
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:03,125

00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:30,959
Boss, let me introduce you.

533
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,209
This is Lawyer Liu Boming.

534
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,167
He’s good at litigations,

535
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,459
concerning contract law, property law and tax law.

536
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,209
He has won many complicated cases

537
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,834
concerning a large amount of money.

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,876
And this is Lawyer Lucas.

539
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,709
He used to work as the counselor-at-law

540
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,375
for many transnational corporations.

541
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:46,334
He has very rich experience

542
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,918
in international cases

543
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,125
as well as a deep social relationship.

544
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:52,709
We must

545
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,083
win this case.

546
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,999
We have a rough understanding of

547
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,292
this case.

548
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:01,999
Please tell us

549
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,417
what you mean

550
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,250
by winning the case.

551
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:06,999
DREAM and I

552
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,542
must get out of it

553
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,292
without any stain.

554
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,417
A business elite?

555
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:18,876
The best businessman in Europe?

556
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,125
What a stupid way

557
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,334
you have used!

558
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:27,375
How jealous!

559
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,334
Are you jealous of me

560
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,167
because I’m going to

561
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,626
steal your thunder

562
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,959
and you can’t find a solution?

563
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:35,999
Be serious!

564
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:37,792
Is that worth it?

565
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:39,250
Sure.

566
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,292
I heard William has hired

567
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:43,417
the best lawyers

568
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,626
in the legal profession.

569
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,999
I believe

570
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:46,918
they plan to

571
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:48,250
blame you for everything.

572
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,459
I knew that.

573
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:52,751
If we didn’t

574
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:53,918
have enough evidence,

575
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,876
you would have been sacrificed in vain.

576
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,751
Do you think I’m so stupid

577
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,209
that I’ll hurt myself?

578
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,167
First,

579
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,834
I disturbed them.

580
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:05,584
They didn’t expect me

581
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:06,834
to do this.

582
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:08,876
Most importantly,

583
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,125
according to my experience,

584
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,709
this case

585
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,501
will not be over in a short time.

586
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:13,959
And now,

587
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,834
the bankrupt procedure is paused.

588
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:17,626
You have more time

589
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:18,626
to think about

590
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,542
how to save FlowerPlus.

591
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,542
It’s your company.

592
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:22,542
I can’t really steal

593
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,292
your thunder.

594
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,042
That’s all I can do

595
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,000
to help you.

596
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,834
You’ll have to take care of the rest.

597
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,250
Be the real Bo Hai

598
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,542
who dares to advance bravely!

599
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:48,083
By the way,

600
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:50,751
take good care of Qi.

601
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:53,125
Or I won’t let you go.

602
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:07,999
I will.

603
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:11,876
The investigation of the Flower Art Association

604
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:13,334
is a perfect chance for us.

605
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:14,375
People turn

606
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,876
less hostile to us.

607
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:16,417
And we have a chance

608
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,999
to further tell the truth.

609
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,292
We must do a perfect

610
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,167
public relation planning.

611
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:23,209
Try to win a good reputation

612
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:24,501
from the public.

613
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:25,667
Okay.

614
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,417
I’ll go take care of the proposal.

615
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,667
And confirm with you

616
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,542
on the press releases

617
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:30,667
and the media interviews.

618
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:31,626
Okay.

619
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,167
Bo Hai, someone wants to talk to you.

620
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,083
Hello? Who is that?

621
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,584
I’m Zhou Anping.

622
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,042
The problem is getting serious.

623
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,876
The truth will come to light.

624
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,584
I don’t want to be involved in anymore.

625
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,709
I have the evidence that

626
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,584
Liu Yingjie stole money from Yunhe Flower Shop.

627
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,584
Where are you?

628
00:30:58,792 --> 00:30:59,709
I’m coming to you right away.

629
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,042
Why are you coming?

630
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:38,918
What do you want?

631
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:41,792
Nothing.

632
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:46,167
William thinks you’ve been too idle

633
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,542
and wants to invite you to a vacation.

634
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,334
I’m not going! I’m not!

635
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,334
I’m not going!

636
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,501
Liu Yingjie?

637
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,167
Mr. Bo, come for sightseeing, too?

638
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,042
What a good mood!

639
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:13,334
Where is Uncle Zhou?

640
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:14,834
Where did you keep him?

641
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,626
Uncle Zhou? Who do you mean?

642
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:19,876
Liu Yingjie.

643
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:21,584
You’ll be cursed!

644
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:22,959
Cursed?

645
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:25,417
I don’t think so.

646
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:29,042
I’ve been living a very good life.

647
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:30,209
Maybe,

648
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,125
that’s the heaven-sent compensation for me.

649
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:34,542
I guess

650
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,250
you’ll be cursed.

651
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,417
Heaven doesn’t have such a twisted value

652
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,000
as you do.

653
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,834
Liu Yingjie.

654
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:45,959
You’re sued,

655
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,334
and in all trouble.

656
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:49,250
But you still sound arrogant!

657
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,334
Zhou Anping.

658
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,375
You’re not going to see him.

659
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:02,167
Mo Nan wants to be a hero.

660
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,250
I’ll let him be.

661
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:05,250
My lawyers

662
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,876
will make him take all the blame.

663
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,751
The bankrupt procedure of FlowerPlus

664
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,042
will also be restarted.

665
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:14,709
You’re just giving dying kicks.

666
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,375
A man isn’t cursed by the heaven,

667
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,125
but by human.

668
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,709
We’ll wait and see

669
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,083
who is giving dying kicks.

670
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,042
I’ll beat you! Liu Yingjie!

671
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,375
You bastard!

672
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:03,626
I’m wrong!

673
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,792
Who do you think you are?

674
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,876
Impressive!

675
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,083
Enough! Stop the show!

676
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:12,250
How is it?

677
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,501
Do you feel better?

678
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,667
I had thought

679
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,459
Uncle Zhou could help us.

680
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:16,959
But we failed to find him.

681
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:18,292
When I

682
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,334
think of Liu Yingjie,

683
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:20,125
I’m so pissed off!

684
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:20,876
Kneel!

685
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:23,709
He dares to act absurdly,

686
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:24,375
just because he has the support

687
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,999
from DREAM.

688
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:28,417
Nominally,

689
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:29,999
Liu Yingjie rules DREAM.

690
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,584
He seems to be domineering.

691
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:32,709
But in fact,

692
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,167
DREAM is controlled by

693
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:34,751
a European consortium.

694
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,501
Liu Yingjie is a mere puppet.

695
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,083
They bear it

696
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,459
when Liu Yingjie acts wildly,

697
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,334
only because

698
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:41,792
they want the super profits

699
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,334
from acquiring FlowerPlus.

700
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,417
If they know

701
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,167
their representative Liu Yingjie

702
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:47,876
was the initiator

703
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,042
who caused the fire in

704
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:49,959
Yunhe Flower Shop,

705
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:50,918
they will abandon him

706
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:52,125
without hesitation.

707
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,542
Yes. They care for dignity.

708
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,209
But they love money most.

709
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:57,250
So,

710
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:58,584
the truth of twenty years ago

711
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:00,626
will be the key to reversing the case.

712
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:02,501
But what about the evidence?

713
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,667
We had planned to

714
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:05,918
count on Uncle Zhou.

715
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,626
But he could no longer help.

716
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:11,999
If we fail to

717
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:12,918
solve the problem today,

718
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:13,834
we don’t need to

719
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:14,542
be too anxious.

720
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,167
Maybe, we still can’t

721
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,083
solve it tomorrow.

722
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,042
Didn’t we make a deal that

723
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,626
we won’t say anything negative?

724
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:26,209
All right.

725
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,209
Now, it’s time to

726
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:27,999
knock off.

727
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,042
Go back home and have some rest.

728
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:29,918
You’ve stayed up

729
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:30,584
for many nights.

730
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,667
You’ll be weak.

731
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,709
I remember

732
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,542
when Bo Hai and I first started the company,

733
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:43,417
we didn’t want to spend money on taxi.

734
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,999
We rode bikes, instead.

735
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,417
When we were riding,

736
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,250
all parts of bikes rang,

737
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:53,501
expect the rings.

738
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:54,999
That was cool!

739
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,250
Do you remember the wonton stand?

740
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:58,876
Four yuan for a big bowl of wonton.

741
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,167
We were so poor that

742
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:01,959
we had wonton every day.

743
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:06,501
Also,

744
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,125
we couldn’t afford a big office.

745
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,459
We hired the cheapest basement

746
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,667
as our office.

747
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:13,042
That was not an office!

748
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,125
That was a storehouse.

749
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,375
A storehouse as our office.

750
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:19,042
It was so small.

751
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:20,250
I wrote PPT

752
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:20,918
on the small box.

753
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:21,667
Do you remember that?

754
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,751
It was very cold in winter.

755
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:25,584
It seems only yesterday

756
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,167
when we did that.

757
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,876
Unexpectedly, we’re back to

758
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,167
the poor life again.

759
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,834
Our company hasn’t gone bankrupt yet.

760
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,876
Don’t jinx it.

761
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,542
Yes. Yes. You’re right.

762
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,125
Tomorrow morning,

763
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:03,501
I’m going to the Flower Art Association

764
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:05,000
to accept the final judgement.

765
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:09,751
Let me go with you.

766
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:20,334
Baoni.

767
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,876
I think

768
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:22,999
I still need to say it again.

769
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:23,542
All right.

770
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:25,876
You don’t need to

771
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,626
say thank you again and again,

772
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:27,918
all right?

773
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,000
I’m always

774
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,334
a loyal girl.

775
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:32,834
Unlike Qi,

776
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,918
who only cares for her boyfriend.

777
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,417
Dates before mates!

778
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:44,876
Spicy crawfish!

779
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:00,167
Baoni.

780
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,709
I don’t want you to

781
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,292
waste your time on me.

782
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:11,709
Spending time on a man

783
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,751
I adore

784
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,083
isn’t a waste of time,

785
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,459
but giving.

786
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,250
In this world, so many things

787
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,375
aren’t perfect.

788
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,167
You can’t always take back

789
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,792
what you give.

790
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:30,501
I know.

791
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,751
But a person

792
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,375
must give all she has

793
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,709
for at least one time.

794
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:38,083
Please get on with me

795
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,959
as a friend.

796
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,626
Don’t have any burden.

797
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,292
I already feel happy

798
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,375
when I can stay with you.

799
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:51,042
So spicy!

800
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:08,250
Stop cleaning around.

801
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:10,209
Okay. In a second!

802
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:17,459
What?

803
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:19,834
Have something to eat, or you can’t sleep.

804
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:23,417
It’s your experience, isn’t it?

805
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,459
When you eat something before sleeping,

806
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,459
the blood in your body

807
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:28,501
will flow back to your stomach

808
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:29,125
and there’s insufficient blood supply

809
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,125
in your brain.

810
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:30,959
Then you can sleep

811
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,000
all night long.

812
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,083
Come on. Open your mouth.

813
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:34,584
Be a good boy!

814
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:36,584
Eat them all!

815
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:40,584
I’m taking a taxi home.

816
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:42,584
Don’t!

817
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,626
Uh... Well...

818
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,918
Look at you!

819
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,167
Why don’t you

820
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,709
get over the difficulty with your boss?

821
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:52,000
Our company is in trouble.

822
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,834
You’ll take a taxi? What a waste!

823
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,042
What should I do then?

824
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,834
Walk home in the middle of night?

825
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:02,918
You know what?

826
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,167
You work better

827
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,125
than the lavenders

828
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:11,501
and snacks.

829
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:17,501
I don’t know why,

830
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,542
but whenever I’m with you,

831
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,876
I feel

832
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,751
very calm.

833
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,584
You mean you want me to stay?

834
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,292
Yes! Smart girl!

835
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,876
What a bad excuse!

836
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:39,999
Stay!

837
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,667
That’s okay.

838
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:44,334
But...

839
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,334
I’m a serious girl.

840
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:50,959
Okay, uh...

841
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,709
Let’s sit over there.

842
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,584
Seems like science is always reasonable.

843
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:24,375
Why would I like

844
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:25,751
a girl like you?

845
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:33,167
I just like you for no reason.
