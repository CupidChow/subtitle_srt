We’ve tried the whole day,

but still find nothing.

60
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:53,999
How about this?

61
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:54,709
Let me take you to the Cafe.

62
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,584
Have some coffee

63
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,876
before we continue, okay?

64
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,542
I’m anxious for Qi.

65
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,209
I’m not in a mood for coffee.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, let’s continue, then.

67
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:03,626
Okay?

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,083
Well, let’s not

69
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,125
go back to company.

70

Tonight, I’ll take you to see a film

00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:08,375
to relax you.

72
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:09,918
You must be tired.

73
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:11,209
Look at you.

74
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,584
How weird you are!

75
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,083
I just refused to have coffee with you.

76
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,918
Why do you still want to see the film?

77
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,751
He doesn’t want to help you.

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,209
He just wants to take this opportunity

79
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,209
to date with you.

80
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:28,167
Don’t talk nonsense.

81
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,042

his design.

00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:31,834
Didn’t Yi

84
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,626
just call you

85
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:33,959
and ask you to stop?

86
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,417
But you still take her around.

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,918
What the hell do you want?

88
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,709
No, Baoni.

89
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:41,834
How dare you!

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,167
How dare you cheat me!

91
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,334
Baoni. Baoni. You know what?

92
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,375
I’m not cheating you,

93
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,250
for the sake of love.

What the hell! True?

96
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,709
I’m so pissed off!

97
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:57,959
Calm down.

98
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,334
I’ll take you back to the company

99
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,334
with my true friendship.

100
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,292
Aunt.

101
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:14,501
Mr. Bo isn’t in.

102
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,459
What do you want?

103
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:17,334
Since he’s away,

104
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,334
I’ll just give them to you.

105
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,417
I picked them up in the trash can.

106
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:22,667
Ling Lingqi said

107
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,334
someone swapped her receipts.

108
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,918
I guess

109
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,292
these are the original receipts.

110
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,417
Last night,

111
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,834
when I checked the list,

112
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,459
I accidentally spilt the biscuit butter

113
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,876
on the paper.

114
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:35,834
Does

115
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,000
anyone else know about this?

116
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:37,751
No.

117
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,334
Fine, then.

118
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:40,709
Leave this to me.

119
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,000
This concerns the secret

120
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,999
of our company.

121
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,542
If you tell others, you’ll be sued.

122
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,542
Please keep it secret.

123
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,167
Okay.

124
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,667
You really are useless

125
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,459
and naive.

126
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,000
You’re beautiful, but silly.

127
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:30,584
No wonder those men

128
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:31,375
take advantage of you!

129
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,834
Who takes advantage of me?

130
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,876
I take advantage of them, okay?

131
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,125
They bought me

132
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,334
the watch, necklace,

133
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,626
and all the other things.

134
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,459
You really have

135
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,209
twisted

136
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,542
and unacceptable values.

137
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,959
You should get into a relationship for love,

138
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,709
but not for rings or bags.

139
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:53,292
I know.

140
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,584
I used to be careless

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,250
in love.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,584
All right.

143
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,125
I’ve made up my mind.

144
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,083
I’m going to give all the gifts

145
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:08,999
back to them.

146
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,959
But I want to keep the bag for two more days.

147
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,334
I’ll give it back after I can afford a new one.

148
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:19,918
Okay?

149
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,250
No!

150
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,375
When I correct my error,

151
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,999
it takes time.

152
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,542
Don’t be so harsh.

153
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,918
I’ve seen many guys who admit mistakes

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,834
but never correct them.

155
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:40,459
Come.

156
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,626
Don’t look down on my bag.

157
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,501
I just bought it last week.

158
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,584
I got it in a small shop

159
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,417
with 70% off.

160
00:06:59,292 --> 00:06:59,459
For the sake

161
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,918
we’re good friends,

162
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,459
I’ll give it to you.

163
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,876
Baoni, promise me.

164
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,626
Stop playing in love, okay?

165
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:14,834
If you continue,

166
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,584
you’ll ruin your life.

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,542
Find a boyfriend carefully

168
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,459
who really cares for you.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,459
Okay?

170
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:30,834
Come.

171
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:35,250
Look!

172
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:36,584
The bus station is right ahead.

173
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,751
Take Bus No. 52 for five stops.

174
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:39,999
Didn’t you say

175
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,292
you would go with me?

176
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,918
I’m going to help Qi.

177
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,834
You can help her?

178
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:47,542
Count on me. Don’t worry.

179
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:48,584
I gotta go.

180
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,000
Be careful on your way.

181
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:24,918
Miss.

182
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:27,542
Yes, you.

183
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,709
Our actress hasn’t come yet.

184
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,834
We want to take the panorama first.

185
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:35,959
I think you a similar figure

186
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,667
to the actress for granny.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,334
Do us a favor. Thanks.

188
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:40,834
Granny?

189
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:42,918
Come. Ask everybody to stand by!

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,876
Everybody, stand by!

191
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,000
What the hell!

192
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,417
I was the granny in the dream.

193
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:54,584
And I’ll act like one in the day.

194
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,999
Luckily, Bo Hai isn’t here.

195
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,667
Or that’ll be awkward.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,876
What’s happening? Where shall I stand?

197
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:11,959
Up the tree. Go!

198
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,125
Thank you.

199
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,584
Stand up! Stand up.

200
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:30,876
Stand up.

201
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:31,959
Stand up?

202
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:32,751
Yes. Yes.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,751
Put your hand down.

204
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,125
You look pretty.

205
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,751
Put your hand down. Thanks.

206
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,083
Why is he back?

207
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,209
Look! Look at her hair.

208
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,417
What are you doing? Could you be faster?

209
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:42,834
Thank you. Thank you.

210
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:49,626
Ling Lingqi.

211
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,667
Doomed.

212
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,626
Did he recognize me?

213
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:55,667
I have something to tell you.

214
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,417
You’ve made a big mistake.

215
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,792
You get the wrong person, sorry!

216
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,334
Sorry. Sorry…

217
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,209
What the hell are you talking about?

218
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,000
I… I just want to tell you that

219
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:15,709
you failed to

220
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:16,792
boil the flannel.

221
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,626
It’s dewatering.

222
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:23,334
Oh, it hurts!

223
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:50,999
Thank you.

224
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,000
Shouldn’t you say sorry?

225
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,834
Thank you for trusting me,

226
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,250
indulging my sentimental feelings

227
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,292
and not bothering about

228
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,542
my carelessness.

229
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,626
It’s okay. It doesn’t hurt now.

230
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,709
Oh, dear.

231
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,626
He smiles so sweetly!

232
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:28,459
Director Zhou

233
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,918
asked us to tell her

234
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,959
what happened on site.

235
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,000
However sweetly he smiles,

236
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,250
it has nothing to do with me.

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,626
That is

238
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,751
an ugly smile!

239
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:03,584
Really?

240
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,626
She’s quite sentimental.

241
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,292
But most artists

242
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,083
are sentimental.

243
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,167
So am I.

244
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:25,626
Bo Hai

245
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:26,626
is smart.

246
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,000
The injured girl and her families

247
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:28,959
have calmed down.

248
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,542
The studio is being redecorated

249
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,042
with new flowers.

250
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,334
That’s not a surprise, is it?

251
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,876
You know what to do next.

252
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:41,792
Sure.

253
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,209
Hello?

254
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,700
= Love Without Borders =

255
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,209
You must come here

256
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,042
for something special.

257
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,292
For the accident in the studio,

258
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:04,751
I have a plan.

259
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:06,125
I wonder

260
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:07,167
if you want to listen.

261
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,417
I told you

262
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,292
to ignore all interviews.

263
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:17,459
Director Zhou.

264
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,792
Just refuse all interviews.

265
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,626
You should think about a solution.

266
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,334
Director Zhou.

267
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:31,584
Early tomorrow morning,

268
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,542
there will be a grand

269
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,834
press conference

270
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,292
waiting for you.

271
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,667
= Marketing Director =

272
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:53,740
= Marketing Director =
Director Zhou, you asked to see me?

273
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:53,751
Director Zhou, you asked to see me?

274
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:55,959
Fire Ling Lingqi immediately

275
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,209
and circulate a notice.

276
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,250
But the employee’s superior should tell us

277
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,834
before he’s fired.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,375
HR Department just cooperates

279
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,250
with the procedure.

280
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,584
Ling Lingqi’s superior

281
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,501
is Mr. Bo.

282
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:07,792
I can’t skip him.

283
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,834
Tomorrow,

284
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,459
Wen Guangqi is taking the media to us.

285
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:12,834
Are you still waiting

286
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,167
to fire a mere employee?

287
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:15,459
You know what?

288
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,167
If we don’t

289
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,042
fire her actively,

290
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,667
we’ll be cursed!

291
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:20,792
By then,

292
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,167
what procedure do we still need?

293
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,584
Director Luo must have some difficulties.

294
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,125
I think

295
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,584
there’ll be a better solution.

296
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,751
Yes. Well…

297
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,542
I’ll leave you alone.

298
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:30,999
I still have a lot to do.

299
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:32,709
Director Luo.

300
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:33,250
Xinyan.

301
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:35,459
Ling Lingqi

302
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,584
made such a big trouble!

303
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:37,334
Why are you all

304
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,792
protecting her?

305
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:47,959
You know

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,250
she’s innocent.

307
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,000
Why do you still want to fire her?

308
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,584
How do I know she’s innocent?

309
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,584
What you just said

310
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,209
to the cleaner,

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,792
I heard that.

312
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,375
I don’t care who did that.

313
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,209
She must be blamed,

314
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,667
as the person in charge.

315
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,083
Bo Hai always tells me

316
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,167
you manage the company better than me.

317
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:21,459
Because you have

318
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,626
a sharp business sense

319
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,834
and you’re capable and experienced.

320
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:25,959
But I think

321
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,542
you’ve lost your mind today.

322
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,042
Are you going to

323
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,959
tell Bo Hai about it?

324
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:41,876
Xinyan.

325
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,167
I told you this,

326
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,542
not to threaten you,

327
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,167
but to tell you

328
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,918
you shouldn’t mix your selfish desire

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,876
with your work.

330
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:56,959
And you shouldn’t lose yourself

331
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:58,667
just for love.

332
00:16:58,792 --> 00:16:59,459
Got it?

333
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:07,918
Think carefully about it.

334
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:34,792
Bo Hai agreed.

335
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,083
I didn’t expect him

336
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,667
to agree so quickly.

337
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,792
He’s a smart guy.

338
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:46,918
How could he

339
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,334
let Wen Guangqi take control?

340
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:50,417
Besides,

341
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:51,626
he planned

342
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:52,792
to deal with Wen Guangqi.

343
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,751
My offer just

344
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:55,709
satisfied him.

345
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:00,375
But…

346
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,375
I think Bo Hai realized that

347
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,918
there was another guy from DREAM,

348
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,292
except Wen Guangqi.

349
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,667
And I think he has

350
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:09,918
suspected you.

351
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:11,626
What you did

352
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,417
may sell you out.

353
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,417
This is a risky step.

354
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,959
But if I succeed,

355
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:19,751
he will

356
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,999
no longer suspect me,

357
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,417
but will even trust me more.

358
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,584
Have some rest.

359
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,083
Thank you.

360
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,209
The set is done.

361
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:50,751
But I’m afraid

362
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,042
the person in charge will…

363
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:53,792
How is your performance skill?

364
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,918
Better than my skill in flowers, I think.

365
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:58,792
Since you’re so confident,

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,999
what are you worried about then?

367
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,125
Let me teach you how to relax.

368
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:10,125
So hot!

369
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:10,626
Be careful.

370
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:18,999
This is your way to relax?

371
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,667
Yeah.

372
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,918
Whenever I feel unhappy,

373
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,042
I play the game.

374
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,626
Sometimes,

375
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:24,667
I play with Chen Mo.

376
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:27,584
How childish!

377
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,918
How could you say that?

378
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,918
It means you haven’t felt

379
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:32,918
the charm of the game.

380
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,292
Come and have a try.

381
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:35,876
Come on. Hurry.

382
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:37,834
Take this.

383
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,626
This. This.

384
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:40,125
This button?

385
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,751
Yes. Yes.

386
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,022
- Why isn’t it moving forward? - Yes. Yes.

387
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,959
Walk over there.

388
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:44,792
You should avoid it.

389
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,542
What does this mean?

390
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,709
- Like this. This way. - This…

391
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,999
Yes. Yes.

392
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,042
How stupid! Give it to me.

393
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,542

Go back for some rest.

398
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:18,918
Okay, Mr. Bo.

399
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,292
Okay, so much for today.

really feels better than that in the city.

431
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,542
Yeah.

432
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:35,125
What’s wrong with the flowers?

433
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:36,999
What… What happened?

434
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,292
What happened?

435
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,083
How come?

436
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:44,876
Go and tell Mr. Bo!

437
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:45,667
Okay.

438
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,501
Go.

439
00:23:58,876 --> 00:23:59,250
Mr. Wen.

440
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:00,834
Everything is ready.

441
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,751
Beethoven’s Third Symphony

442
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,792
is also known as

443
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,626
Funeral March.

444
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,375
Perfect for today.

445
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,542
You’re late.

446
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:50,834
I’m just in time.

447
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,042
The show hasn’t started yet, huh?

448
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,584
Well, stay and watch.

449
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:02,375
Mr. Wen

450
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,417
asked us to wait here,

451
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:04,751
saying there will be a result.

452
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:05,584
- We… - Everybody.

453
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,292
I’m Wen Guangqi,

454
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:09,751
the convener for today’s conference.

455
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,417
As the delegate of DREAM

456
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,292
who is sent to FlowerPlus,

457
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,584
I’d like to

458
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:16,918
make the strongest protest

459
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,209
against Bo Hai

460
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,709
and FlowerPlus

461
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:20,959
on behalf of

462
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,167
families of the girl

463
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,292
who got injured in the accident

464
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:24,501
and the film production company

465
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:25,834
that suffered heavy losses.

466
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:26,709
Yes.

467
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:27,584
And we ask them to

468
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,292
take compensatory measures

469
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:31,334
and punish the person in charge.

470
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,000
Could you tell us

471
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,334
the whole story?

472
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,125
Please come with me.

473
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,542
A press conference in the studio?

474
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:47,751
What a plan!

475
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,375
He warned me yesterday.

476
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,417
I should have thought of that.

477
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:06,626
This way, please.

478
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:17,876
Why are the plants

479
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,125
all withered?

480
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:19,918
Yeah.

481
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,626
Yesterday, Mr. Bo

482
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:24,792
promised two things

483
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,042
to He Minglang and me.

484
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,334
First, he’ll redecorate

485
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:29,501
the set of the studio

486
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:31,083
to retrieve the loss.

487
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,167
Second, he’ll give out

488
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,292
the person in charge,

489
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,542
to relieve the injured girl and her families.

490
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,584
Yes. Yes.

491
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:41,292
Now you see.

492
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,125
Mr. Bo failed to

493
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:44,918
keep his first promise.

494
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,042
Mr. Bo, how about the second promise?

495
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:58,876
Since Mr. Bo keeps silent,

496
00:26:59,459 --> 00:26:59,959
I’ll help him

497
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:01,292
to do this.

498
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:07,292
She is the person in charge

499
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,167
for this accident.

500
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,209
I can’t help laughing.

501
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:22,584
Mr. Bo.

502
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:23,959
What’s happening here?

503
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:31,292
Let me answer

504
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,000
your first question.

505
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,667
The set has been redecorated

506
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:35,751
and completed.

507
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,542
The crew started to work

508
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:38,834
early this morning.

509
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:40,542
Everybody, please come with me.

510
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:44,709
What…

511
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,501
What’s going on?

512
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:47,542
Go.

513
00:27:58,876 --> 00:27:59,167
This way.

514
00:27:59,292 --> 00:27:59,876
Take photos. Go.

515
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,501
This way.

516
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:07,959
Stop. Cut to close shot.

517
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:09,751
Get the make-up.

518
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:10,459
Look!

519
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:11,292
Okay.

520
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,417
Mr. He and his crew

521
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,292
are satisfied with

522
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:25,417
our new set.

523
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:27,667
Mr. Bo, you’re one of the top artists

524
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,167
in the set decoration.

525
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,042
But why did you

526
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,042
take us to

527
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,209
another studio

528
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,250
and mislead us?

529
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:35,792
Without the contrast,

530
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:36,918
how could you enjoy

531
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,334
such a good play?

532
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:39,999
Just like Chinese small iris.

533
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,083
It grows in a perilous environment.

534
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:44,000
Every time it blooms,

535
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,501
people cherish it more.

536
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:48,083
You make a great point, Mr. Bo.

537
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:49,459
Since everything

538
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:50,709
has returned to normal,

539
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,000
that’s a happy ending then.

540
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:56,626
Mr. Bo.

541
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,375
Did you just mean

542
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,667
someone tried to

543
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,626
mess up with your project?

544
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,209
Does it have anything to do with

545
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:03,999
Mr. Wen from DREAM?

546
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,501
Mr. Wen, rumors go that

547
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:06,959
you always hate Mr. Bo.

548
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,250
Is that true?

549
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:12,709
Mr. Wen.

550
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,709
Don’t you want to explain?

551
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,167
Mr. Bo.

552
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:14,959
Could you

553
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,250
explain the set to us?

554
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,042
I’ll let Miss Ling Lingqi,

555
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:18,834
the person in charge,

556
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,918
to explain to you.

557
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,501
Mr. Wen.

558
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,459
I’ve confirmed the flowers

559
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:25,459
again and again.

560
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:26,292
I didn’t know

561
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:27,292
Bo Hai had a Plan B.

562
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,626
It doesn’t help now!

563
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,542
You totally humiliated me!

564
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,209
Loser!

565
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:38,792
For the accident,

566
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:39,999
we can work with the media

567
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:40,999
to hype it up.

568
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:48,667
The families of the injured girl

569
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:49,959
are most easily instigated.

570
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,292
With a hint,

571
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:52,292
they dare to

572
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,125
make all trouble.

573
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,292
And we left no evidence

574
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,417
when we framed them up.

575
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:56,417
Just do that.

576
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:57,999
Even if they suspect

577
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,292
we played a trick

578
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,250
in the checklist,

579
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,918
they’ll never get any evidence.

580
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,918
It’s Wen Guangqi?

581
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,292
It’s him! It’s him!

582
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:13,959
So, he hurt my daughter!

583
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,167
That’s the best part.

584
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:17,209
He blamed them first

585
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,042
and held a press conference.

586
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,125
What was he thinking?

587
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,501
This is the second thing

588
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:22,417
I promised you.

589
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,334
It’s not time to celebrate.

590
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,959
I’m not losing yet.

591
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:31,959
Mr. Bo, did you know it

592
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,000
before us?

593
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:33,918
Did you

594
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,542
set the trap for him?

595
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,626
William is dissatisfied with what you did.

596
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:38,918
What do you want?

597
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:40,125
I want you

598
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,083
to pay for what you did.

599
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:43,584
Now,

600
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,918
everything is cleared.

601
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,209
But the injured girl is still in hospital,

602
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:47,501
and there’s no compensation yet.

603
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:48,626
What are you

604
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:49,876
going to do

605
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,876
to punish the wrongdoer?

606
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,042
Don’t worry, everybody.

607
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,834
We will certainly take care of

608
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:55,792
the injured girl.

609
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,584
And we’ll give

610
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,792
whatever her families deserve.

611
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,417
For this,

612
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:01,584
we will certainly do

613
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:02,626
whatever we should.

614
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:33,250
So merciless, huh?

615
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:34,876
Don’t you fear

616
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:36,542
I may pull you down?

617
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:40,709
You’re an abandoned chessman.

618
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,083
You’d better behave yourself.

619
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,501
Fight against DREAM?

620
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,459
You can’t afford it.

621
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:52,125
You did all this for Ling Lingqi, right?

622
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,918
I didn’t expect you to be so merciless

623
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,209
just for a woman.

624
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,125
Shut up!

625
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:03,999
She will

626
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,834
ruin you sooner or later.

627
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,083
You will not

628
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,375
have a better result.

629
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,459
Are you Wen Guangqi and Shi Ji?

630
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:37,876
We’re from the police station.

631
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,660
= Arrest Warrant =
This is the arrest warrant.

632
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,042
You’re suspects

633
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,083
for an injury case.

634
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:43,042
We’re now

635
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:43,751
arresting you.

636
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,042
Oh, Gosh.

637
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,125
What did we miss?

638
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:54,459
What happened?

639
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:58,125
He suffers from his own scheme.

640
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:06,626
Go.

641
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:16,083
My poor daughter! Let go of me!

642
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:28,709
Mo Nan?

643
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,167
Mo Nan!

644
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,209
You’re avoiding me, aren’t you?

645
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,459
Do you think you can get rid of it

646
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:50,584
by saying nothing?

647
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,083
You must explain to me!

648
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:53,042
Why are you angry?

649
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:54,250
How did I annoy you?

650
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,250
I know you’re sulking.

651
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:03,834
But you still take me

652
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:04,834
as your friend, huh?

653
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,542
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have

654
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,125
helped me with Bo Hai.

655
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:10,125
Sure.

656
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,501
If I didn’t take you as my friend,

657
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,542
I wouldn’t have helped you.

658
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,083
How did I annoy you?

659
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,459
Not your fault.

660
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:29,042
I just quarreled with my mother

661
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,584
when I called her

662
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,709
the other day

663
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:34,751
and I don’t feel good.

664
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,584
You’re a man.

665
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:39,584
Why are you so sad

666
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:40,959
just because you quarreled with your mom?

667
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,083
Are you a real man?

668
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,501
How sentimental you are!

669
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,167
I’ll stop being sentimental.

670
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,125
All right?

671
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,709
What should a friend do, huh?

672
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:49,292
You should have

673
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:50,626
told me about that.

674
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,667
A big meal

675
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:56,125
solves everything, dude.

676
00:34:56,501 --> 00:34:56,999
Let’s go!

677
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:57,918
You pulled my head off!

678
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,417
Wen Guangqi and Shi Ji

679
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:03,167
have been arrested,

680
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,751
as suspects of the studio case

681
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,417
and they’ll be sentenced.

682
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:07,459
Besides,

683
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:09,751
upon the negotiation of the board of directors,

684
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:10,584
DREAM

685
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,083
will no longer send delegates

686
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,501
to interfere with our operation.

687
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:14,709
Excellent!

688
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:15,626
Awesome!

689
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:16,375
Great!

690
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,000
Another thing.

691
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:19,334
Mr. He Minglang

692
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:20,417
thinks highly of

693
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:21,959
our design.

694
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:22,999
Except the contract amount,

695
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:24,292
he decides to give

696
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:25,792
another bonus

697
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,292
for the team building of all employees

698
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,959
on the weekend.

699
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:35,459
Team building?

700
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:36,501
That sounds great!

701
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:45,000
Mr. Bo.

702
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:45,999
We had a nice cooperation.

703
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,334
I just gave a little piece of advice.

704
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:49,125
You made

705
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,459
the final decision.

706
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,334
You managed to expose

707
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,417
what Wen Guangqi did.

708
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:55,000
That’s not a little piece of advice.

709
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:57,292
Mo Nan.

710
00:35:57,876 --> 00:35:59,250
You’re talented.

711
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:00,667
Don’t you feel aggrieved

712
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,417
to be a marketing guy?

713
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,125
Boss, I don’t know

714
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,501
how to answer this question.

715
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,083
I came up with this idea,

716
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:07,918
just trying to

717
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,417
help my friend.

718
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,334
It was just my luck

719
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:11,417
that it worked so well.

720
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:14,876
You’re still modest. Good.

721
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,000
Boss.

722
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:21,999
If you really think highly of me,

723
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,125
I do have something

724
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:25,542
to tell you.

725
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,167
Go ahead.

726
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,334
I’ll pay the rent by the end of this month.

727
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,083
You know.

728
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:33,167
We seldom have any saving.

729
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:37,709
Could I have some bonus…

730
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,292
That’s just a little advice.

731
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,792
You’ll make the final decision.

732
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:43,834
Don’t worry.

733
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,125
I’ll tell the HR.

734
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:46,959
Work hard!

735
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,542
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Bo.

736
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,042
Mo Nan from the Marketing is good.

737
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:10,209
In case of trouble,

738
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:11,918
he’s calm and thoughtful.

739
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:13,209
I strongly recommend him.

740
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,167
I think

741
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,000
we should

742
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,125
promote him,

743
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,125
so that he’ll make more contributions.

744
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:22,834
Such lithops

745
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,292
look like cobblestones

746
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,584
when they don’t bloom.

747
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:27,584
They deceive

748
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,292
all herbivores

749
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,209
so that they are protected to the most.

750
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,667
Boss, I’m talking about business.

751
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,417
Why are you talking about flowers?

752
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,000
Do you remember I told you

753
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:41,042
there was another man from DREAM,

754
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:42,292
except Wen Guangqi?

755
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,626
And he may have a higher position

756
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:45,667
than Wen Guangqi.

757
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:47,209
You mean,

758
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,083
he disguises himself,

759
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:50,834
just like the flower

760
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,375
and hides among us.

761
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:58,501
You suspect Mo Nan?

762
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:00,417
Shouldn’t I?

763
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,000
It doesn’t make sense.

764
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:03,501
He just helped you

765
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:04,751
to kick away Wen Guangqi.

766
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,501
Yeah. I haven’t

767
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:08,959
figured that out yet.

768
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:11,542
Anyway, keep an eye on him.

769
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,584
It brings no harm.

770
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:13,834
Okay.

771
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,459
According to my love experience

772
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,709
over so many years,

773
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,083
Bo Hai kind of

774
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:25,626
likes you.

775
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:27,250
Really?

776
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:29,459
Or why would he help you?

777
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:32,751
I think so, too.

778
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:37,959
That explains.

779
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:39,751
I think so.

780
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,375
Let me think about it.

781
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:42,125
If he didn’t

782
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:42,959
like me,

783
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:43,667
why would he

784
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:45,501
help me like that, right?

785
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,292
I also think he likes me.

786
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,250
Wen Guangqi always wants to make trouble.

787
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,167
Everyone in the company

788
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:55,584
knows that.

789
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,375
But Chomper

790
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,751
just sent you

791
00:38:58,959 --> 00:38:59,626
to take care of

792
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:01,292
the film set.

793
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:03,501
Guess why?

794
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,459
He thinks highly of me.

795
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:14,209
He thinks you’re silly.

796
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,334
You just have good luck.

797
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:19,209
And you have

798
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:20,459
such a good friend as me.

799
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,292
Otherwise,

800
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,709
you would have been screwed!

801
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,501
William handed over

802
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:47,501
the acquisition project on FlowerPlus

803
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,000
totally to you.

804
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:50,834
Without Wen Guangqi,

805
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,501
you can

806
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:53,125
handle it as you wish.

807
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,083
But think about Wen Guangqi.

808
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:02,918
What’s wrong with him?

809
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,542
He’s no longer young.

810
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,959
But he’s still so irritable.

811
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,792
Anyway, Wen Guangqi

812
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,542
was sent by DREAM.

813
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,792
Did you

814
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,000
kick him out

815
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,501
because of Ling Lingqi?

816
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:28,417
Ji Bin, have you ever had a girlfriend?

817
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,334
I had one when I was in college.

818
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,000
You’re right.

819
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:39,667
Wen Guangqi hurt the girl

820
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:40,626
he shouldn’t have hurt.

821
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:42,834
So, I had to kick him out.

822
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:45,999
But through this case,

823
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,125
I’ve realized my true heart.

824
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:52,250
I can

825
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,292
shut down a company

826
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,584
within one month,

827
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,375
turn expensive shares

828
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:00,626
into useless paper,

829
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,999
and even fire thousands of employees

830
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,250
once at a time,

831
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:08,292
but I can’t let go of Ling Lingqi.
