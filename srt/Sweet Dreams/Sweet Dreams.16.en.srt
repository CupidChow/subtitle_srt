51

Qi, Qi.

52
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,626
Are you all right?

53
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:06,999
Your feet all right?

54
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,083
What are you laughing at?

55
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,292
OK, OK.

56
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:15,751
Easy. Easy.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,292
Impulsiveness is the devil.

58
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:18,584
He’s just a kid.

59
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:21,417
Qi,

60
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,709
can you not abuse yourself?

61
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,709
This Chomper

62
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,709
is extremely venomous.

63
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,250
I think

64
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,709
you don’t have to worry.

65
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,584
Worst case scenario, you change a job.

66
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,334
It’s no big deal.

67
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,334
As for uncle,

68
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,417
the flowers are counterfeits,

69
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:45,209
but he didn’t sell any.

70
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,083
Even if he’s called to account,

71
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,250
the worst is being fined.

72
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:50,876
Or,

73
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,334
revoke the license.

74
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,167
Our shop

75
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:04,709
is on clearance sale already.

76
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:11,667
I’ll back you up a little.

77
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:13,751
Help me buy some daily supplies

78
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:14,999
in your shop.

79
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,375
They’ll come in handy anyway.

80
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,626
I…

81
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:22,542
Forget it.

82
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:23,959
Qi and I have been eating and drinking

83
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:24,834
in your place.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You’ve spent a lot on us. Just save it.

85
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,667
You know that.

86
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,834
Here, take it. No password.

87
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:35,209
Your bank card has no password?

88
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:37,959
Don’t you think it’s not necessary

89
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,709
to use a 6-digit to

90
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,125
protect a 4-digit?

91
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,918
Small gift, deep affection.

92
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,125
You tell me,

93
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:54,792
is there something wrong

94
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:55,709
with my brain?

95
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,751
Why was I so stubborn

96
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,250
to get into FlowerPlus?

97
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,375
Yes, there is.

98
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:00,876
That’s because

99
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:02,918
you were in love

100
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,209
with Chomper!

101
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,584
Love.

102
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,292
Do you think this word

103
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,876
is a bit weird?

104
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:20,042
The left half reminds me of load,

105
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,584
and the right half reminds me of vegetable.

106
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,709
Both of them have bad meanings.

107
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,100
= LO VE =

108
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,000
But it’s too late for me to find out.

109
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,375
The best food in the world

110
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,417
is coming!

111
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:58,292
Here.

112
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,999
Instant noodles?

113
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:03,834
Instant noodles.

114
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:06,459
It’s good stuff, honey.

115
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,584
I’m telling you,

116
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,667
the more we eat these stuff,

117
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,667
the less loss we’ll have in our shop.

118
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,125
Right?

119
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:13,542
Yeah.

120
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,709
It’s called benefits should always be kept
for one’s own people.

121
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,167
If we sell it to

122
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,751
Carrot Li Lijun and others,

123
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,501
at a discounted price,

124
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,542
we’ll sustain losses.

125
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,751
I heard Ling Lingqi

126
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,209
pissed Miss Su off.

127
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:20,792
Not only pissed her off,

128
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,334
but totally offended her.

129
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,417
Why she always makes trouble?

130
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:26,709
This time,

131
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,626
even Heaven can’t save her.

132
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,417
Chomper, don’t you forget

133
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,375
our interests

134
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:43,667
are mutual.

135
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:44,834
If you make me unhappy,

136
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,292
I’ll make you cheerless.

137
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:49,876
You’re messing with the wrong person.

138
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:58,834
Boss,

139
00:06:59,125 --> 00:06:59,584
this is a letter

140
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:00,626
from Miss Su.

141
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,209
It’s 21st century. Who still writes letters?

142
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,042
Unbelievable.

143
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,375
Why not make a call?

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,876
What did she write?

145
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,000
Lawyer’s letter?

146
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:12,751
Let me check.

147
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:17,876
Love letter?

148
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:20,167
Use your imagination

149
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,417
in work, OK?

150
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,584
Chomper,

151
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,209
you’re outrageous. You know that?

152
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,959
I’ll help you lose some weight.

153
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:54,918
Last week,

154
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,667
the company’s overall operation is good.

155
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,459
Especially sales data, which have

156
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,918
a slight increase over the previous year.

157
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:01,167
Several market activities also have

158
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,167
been carried out successfully.

159
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,209
The results are to be further evaluated.

160
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,501
Supply chain goes smooth too.

161
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,042
Just the logistics and distribution

162
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,042
need to be improved.

163
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,459
So there are

164
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:16,167
a few questions

165
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,292
we’ll discuss later.

166
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,083
Ling Lingqi,

167
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,375
I got another thing to announce.

168
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,042
It’s about you.

169
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,209
Secretary Chen, read it to everyone.

170
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:31,876
OK.

171
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:39,417
Mr. Bo, I’m writing to you

172
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,375
to formally apologize to you and your company

173
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,834
for what happened before.

174
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:44,959
In the last call

175
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,501
with your company,

176
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,125
my emotions got out of control,

177
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,375
and my manners were

178
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,709
also inappropriate,

179
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,209
which must make you

180
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,792
embarrassed and uncomfortable.

181
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:57,083
I sincerely apologize for this.

182
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,042
There were many

183
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,626
misunderstandings and accidents

184
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,834
in this conflict.

185
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:06,626
Keep reading.

186
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,125
In fact,

187
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,209
Miss Ling is a

188
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,334
excellent

189
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:17,959
florist.

190
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,959
I really appreciate her.

191
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:25,959
The King Protea symbolizes an independent

192
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,083
and noble soul,

193
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,209
just like you.

194
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,959
Be your own Queen.

195
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:30,709
Don’t take your dignity

196
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,250
to pursue someone who doesn’t love you.

197
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,834
It’s also a waste of time to wait for

198
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,709
someone who’s not worthy of your love.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,999
I’ve been indulged

200
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,918
to feelings that don’t belong to me.

201
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:39,918
It was Miss Ling

202
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,334
who made me find myself

203
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:43,375
with her floral works.

204
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,375
I feel ashamed

205
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:47,584
of my recklessness before.

206
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,667
Please convey my gratitude

207
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,584
and deep apologies to Miss Ling.

208
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,834
She is indeed a very good florist

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,417
in your company.

210
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,375
I’m done reading, boss.

211
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:05,375
Well done.

212
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:08,334
Ling Lingqi

213
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:09,834
is not a florist,

214
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,542
but she got the high recognition

215
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:12,709
from our client.

216
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:14,209
I think we should hold

217
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:14,999
a small

218
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,584
experience exchange meeting

219
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:17,417
so that everyone can

220
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,459
learn from her.

221
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:29,751
Wait a moment.

222
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,125
Wait. Wait.

223
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:31,876
Wait a minute.

224
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:33,042
I added some

225
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:33,626
beauty and healthcare

226
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,417
products

227
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,042
in this coffee.

228
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,167
I’ll change one for you.

229
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,125
Healthcare product?

230
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,042
Healthcare product.

231
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,999
Will he fire me?

232
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:53,876
Fire you?

233
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,000
Why?

234
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:55,834
No.

235
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:57,542
What about

236
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,209
my dad’s shop?

237
00:10:58,417 --> 00:10:59,501
What’s the relationship

238
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:00,375
with your dad’s shop?

239
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,709
What expression is that?

240
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,626
It’s out of my expectation.

241
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,959
I don’t know how to do.

242
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,876
Didn’t you see it?

243
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,876
I don’t think

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,501
Mr. Bo is torturing you.

245
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,584
He’s training you in his own way.

246
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:16,375
He’s helping you.

247
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:17,167
Say,

248
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,626
your success this time.

249
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,000
Didn’t he make you to do it?

250
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,501
He’s helping me?

251
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,667
You didn’t see it, did you?

252
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,167
Not only you,

253
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,334
I didn’t see it, either.

254
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,375
You all right?

255
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:45,792
I’m telling you.

256
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,959
You tell Ling Lingqi to wait

257
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,375
for me to rejuvenate myself.

258
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,459
I won’t give her a chance to kneel down

259
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:54,209
and beg for me.

260
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,459
She’s regretting it.

261
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,083
She returned evil for good.

262
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,959
See, she’s embarrassed to see you.

263
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,250
So she asked me

264
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,667
to give you this antidiarrheic.

265
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,167
Look at it. How similar you are.

266
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,709
I’d rather die to eat this!

267
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:19,751
Let’s go.

268
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:22,918
It comes again.

269
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,042
If it wasn’t me who let it be,

270
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,167
she’s committing a crime.

271
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,250
Boss,

272
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,584
you better eat that.

273
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:32,667
It’s not the right time

274
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,000
to flaunt your superiority.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,792
Why are you looking at me?

276
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,459
I’m asking you! Answer me!

277
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,459
Hello, Qian?

278
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,375
Why do you have time to call me?

279
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,459
I want to ask you something.

280
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,125
What is it?

281
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,501
I want to go back to FlowerPlus

282
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,584
to be a florist again, like you.

283
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,876
You still want to come back?

284
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,250
Haven’t you had enough of Chomper?

285
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,417
Qi, we

286
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,083
misunderstood Mr. Bo.

287
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,209
He fired me,

288
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,584
but he asked Secretary Chen

289
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,250
to send my brother’s tuition fee.

290
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,209
He also introduced my dad

291
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,584
to work in floral materials

292
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:40,334
planting base.

293
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:44,959
Chomper…

294
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,375
Would he be so kind?

295
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,209
Of course it’s true.

296
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:52,250
And it was my fault

297
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,459
at that time.

298
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,792
So I thought it over.

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,167
He fired me with reason.

300
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,542
I can understand it.

301
00:13:59,292 --> 00:13:59,999
Qi,

302
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,584
Mr. Bo

303
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:02,959
is a good boss.

304
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,584
Okay, then, cheer up.

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,334
Wish your dream come true.

306
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:12,209
Bye.

307
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,751
Chomper is a good boss.

308
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,209
You took Ling Lingqi for a business trip.

309
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,709
Are you cultivating her?

310
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:55,709
You took her to the trip

311
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:56,751
but you came back yourself,

312
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,334
letting her face

313
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,417
the unruly client alone.

314
00:14:58,918 --> 00:14:59,417
Since when

315
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:00,334
you started to spend so many time

316
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,667
and efforts on a small employee?

317
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:06,209
This butterfly orchid

318
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,042
was delivered days ago.

319
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:08,918
It’s gone through

320
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,042
long-time low temperature

321
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:11,667
so it was in a very bad state.

322
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,209
I trimmed it

323
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,250
and used high-intensity fluorescent lights

324
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,042
to supplement light for it for 1.5 hours

325
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,000
every day after it gets dark.

326
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,542
Now it’s vitalized again

327
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:24,918
and blossomed.

328
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:26,209
Such beautiful flowers.

329
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,083
I took better care of it

330
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,584
because

331
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,751
it’s a very

332
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:32,751
rare plant,

333
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,709
and it has

334
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,876
won gold medal

335
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:37,918
in foreign competition.

336
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,542
You mean Ling Lingqi

337
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,792
is like this plant

338
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,375
worthy of your attention?

339
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,125
But you can transfer her

340
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,334
to Design Department,

341
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:46,459
giving her to Li Boqing.

342
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:47,792
I have my plans.

343
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:48,918
Also,

344
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,000
I don’t have to

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,417
explain everything to you,

346
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,417
do I?

347
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,334
The way you do it

348
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:54,501
is easy to cause misunderstanding.

349
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,542
They think you have feelings for Ling Lingqi

350
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,000
which is not as simple
as a superior to a subordinate!

351
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,334
Can you stop being unreasonable?

352
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:13,083
Bo Hai.

353
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,334
Mr. Yu is waiting in the meeting room.

354
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:44,375
Run, run.

355
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:45,459
The wolf is here.

356
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:46,999
You’re crazy.

357
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,834
So dangerous.

358
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,501
I’m entangled.

359
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,209
I can see that.

360
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,042
The Bo Hai I know is fake?

361
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,334
He’s not that bad.

362
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,250
It’s true that

363
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,375
he has his own thoughts

364
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,083
on floriculture.

365
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,167
In floriculture,

366
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,751
he is indeed the top florist in China.

367
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:12,876
Forget about it.

368
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:13,959
He used…

369
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,000
Used what?

370
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:24,709
I…

371
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:26,584
He used media

372
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,667
to hype himself.

373
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,584
Who knows he has real talent or not.

374
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,042
How do you know

375
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,292
he has real talent or not?

376
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,292
How do you know?

377
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,334
Why you care about Bo Hai so much?

378
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:45,501
Bo Hai is a gay?

379
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,334
Just asking.

380
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:52,250
Can’t I?

381
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:02,918
Bo Hai

382
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,792
is such a mysterious guy.

383
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,417
Anyway,

384
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,876
after these days,

385
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,167
I feel myself interested

386
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,042
in floriculture again.

387
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:18,792
Didn’t you say these

388
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:19,918
years ago?

389
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:20,918
At that time,

390
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,167
I was just a teenage girl.

391
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:23,584
Really?

392
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:33,000
Baoni,

393
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:34,792
Mo Nan.

394
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,250
I want to be

395
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,209
a real florist.

396
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:42,918
Every florist

397
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,918
is a messenger of nature.

398
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,999
They communicate with flowers and

399
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:50,501
plants with their heart

400
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:52,250
to heal the souls nowhere to place,

401
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:57,709
and to make them feel the light and warmth.

402
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:01,709
You know?

403
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,542
When I made the bouquet

404
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:05,876
myself

405
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:06,751
and delivered

406
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:08,167
love and warmth to my client,

407
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:09,334
I felt

408
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,000
a sense of accomplishment.

409
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:21,417
What?

410
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,959
Do I look not serious?

411
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,459
This is cheaper than they sold

412
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:26,167
during the new year promotion last year.

413
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,042
Yeah.

414
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,667
What’s wrong with Ling?

415
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,334
He usually squares accounts

416
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,584
in every detail.

417
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,542
Doomed.

418
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:37,667
What?

419
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,542
I can keep the shop now?

420
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:42,584
Right.

421
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:45,751
You all right? Dad?

422
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:48,709
Stop! Stop! Stop!

423
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,501
Not sell anymore!

424
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,626
Leave! I don’t sell anymore!

425
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:51,292
What are you doing?

426
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:51,584
Not sell!

427
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,209
Leave!

428
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:52,751
What’s wrong with you?

429
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:53,542
Not sell anymore!

430
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:54,792
What are you doing?

431
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:55,584
- What’s wrong with you?
- It’s not on sale.

432
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,292
I tell you,

433
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,209
the clearance sale ends now!

434
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,918
What’s wrong with you?

435
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,209
The sign is still here.

436
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,292
How to end? Give it to me.

437
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,542
No, I don’t sell.

438
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:04,709
The final right of interpretation

439
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:05,542
of this event belongs to the shop!

440
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:06,918
Not sell anymore! Go!

441
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,626
Go! Leave!

442
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:08,918
You’re such a profiteer!

443
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,459
You’re a profiteer!

444
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:10,125
So what?

445
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:10,667
Profiteer!

446
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,459
I’m a profiteer, so what?

447
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,000
Leave!

448
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:12,834
I don’t sell anymore!

449
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,667
What the hell!

450
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:13,999
Go!

451
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,209
I’ll sue you to the Trade and Industry Bureau!

452
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,292
As you please! I don’t sell!

453
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:17,999
Cheater!

454
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,860
= Clearance Sale =

455
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,709
I don’t sell it!

456
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,250
Don’t move!

457
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:25,250
Put it down.

458
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:28,999
Xinyan.

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,375
What?

460
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,125
Eight flavors for your choice!

461
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,792
There is always one for you!

462
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:50,334
Try this.

463
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,834
You know Bo Hai.

464
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,125
He’s crazy for flowers.

465
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,542
I mean,

466
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:01,834
he’s a workaholic

467
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,292
in floriculture.

468
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:04,626
So once he finds

469
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,042
a talented employee,

470
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,584
he will pay special attention to him.

471
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,918
This is him.

472
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,584
Right?

473
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,334
So, don’t think

474
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,292
too much, all right?

475
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,918
Orange milk.

476
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,250
New flavor, have a try.

477
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,417
Wen Guangqi is right.

478
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,667
I also think Ling Lingqi

479
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:37,042
might know something.

480
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,167
So,

481
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:40,751
Mr. Mo, you got the chance.

482
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:43,000
Don’t get Ling Lingqi involved.

483
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,292
But Ling Lingqi

484
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,959
might be our breakthrough.

485
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:49,959
If Bo Hai is really

486
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,292
hiding something,

487
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,459
he will leave traces.

488
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:55,292
There are no impenetrable walls

489
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:56,709
in the world.

490
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,667
I’ll use my way

491
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,709
to find it out.

492
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:02,626
OK.

493
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,834
What?

494
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,209
The shop is saved,

495
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,209
so is your job?

496
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:18,501
Yeah.

497
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,999
Qi, your boss

498
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,667
is so nice to you!

499
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,209
In front of everyone,

500
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:31,959
he acts like a boss.

501
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,667
But behind everyone’s back,

502
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,000
he’s affectionate

503
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,292
and soft-hearted.

504
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:46,042
It’s a pattern. All are his patterns.

505
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,167
Qi, you don’t know,

506
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,584
but I know it.

507
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,042
Trust me, I’m right.

508
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,083
Golden Pack 250ml milk

509
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:01,167
was bought in 4.3 yuan.

510
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,792
Qi, in this case,

511
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,000
you can’t be

512
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,083
distracted by Mo Nan.

513
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,292
You must focus on Bo Hai.

514
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,375
All I’m thinking about now is

515
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,083
how to face him tomorrow

516
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,167
when I go to office.

517
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,542
Do I have to say thanks to him?

518
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:15,000
Of course.

519
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,501
Really?

520
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,417
It’s embarrassing.

521
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,209
How could it be?

522
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:21,834
To grow up, you must

523
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,834
be adaptable to all circumstances,

524
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,375
and be able to bear your shame.

525
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,334
Your boss is nice to you.

526
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,584
You should thank him.

527
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:30,999
For example, you can

528
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,751
make a good dessert

529
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,792
and give it to him

530
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:34,834
to strengthen

531
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,292
your relationship.

532
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,792
1378.8 yuan!

533
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,792
I lost 1378.8 yuan

534
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:47,209
for only one day!

535
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,501
Honey, I got something to discuss with you.

536
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:52,417
You see your boss

537
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:53,417
is so nice to you.

538
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:54,751
He was not teasing you

539
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,083
but cultivating you.

540
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:57,584
Now our shop has

541
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:58,959
lost so much,

542
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,417
can you ask your boss

543
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,167
to reimburse it?

544
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,209
Ling Guoliang,

545
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:03,584
you’re so shortsighted.

546
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:05,417
No wonder

547
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:06,751
you only managed to open a small shop

548
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,250
in your whole life.

549
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,876
You only deserve a small shop.

550
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,501
You know what?

551
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,125
I’ve been to Mr. Bo’s house once.

552
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,375
His house is just like him,

553
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:22,459
so cold.

554
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,375
You know what’s the strangest?

555
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:24,876
What?

556
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,751
The strangest thing is that

557
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,667
he doesn’t even have a kitchen.

558
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,167
Really?

559
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,667
How does he eat?

560
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,083
Yeah, what does he usually eat?

561
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,083
Seems Mr. Bo

562
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,626
puts all his passion

563
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:36,417
in the creation

564
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:37,792
of floriculture.

565
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:38,834
He barely has

566
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:40,751
joy of life.

567
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:41,709
To find a better job,

568
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,000
you have to find a better boss.

569
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:43,876
You tell me.

570
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,417
If you got a Virgo boss

571
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,792
like Mr. Bo,

572
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,000
then you’re looking troubles for yourself.

573
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,501
He demands perfection in everything,

574
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,375
nearly insane in details.

575
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,501
What are you saying about our boss?

576
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:54,334
What do you mean nearly insane?

577
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:55,918
Come on. It’s very insane!

578
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:56,667
I’m telling you.

579
00:24:58,626 --> 00:24:59,334
I remember once

580
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,501
during a fire safety inspection.

581
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:02,918
The fire brigade

582
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,834
has said

583
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:04,751
we already had

584
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,083
the number of standard equipment

585
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,167
by 1.5 times.

586
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:08,083
- That’s OK. - Yeah.

587
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:09,709
But when Mr. Bo heard it,

588
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,250
he asked the Administration Department right away

589
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:12,626
to get one more set.

590
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,042
Can you understand him?

591
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,667
I also remember once

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,542
the HR Department

593
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:18,292
took a lot of trouble

594
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,626
to hire a designer.

595
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,417
But he was fired

596
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,959
just because he smoked

597
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:23,501
in front of Mr. Bo.

598
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:24,792
As I see it,

599
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,375
he’s no master florist,

600
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,125
but Master Fussy.

601
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,250
Do you have an improper thought

602
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,834
to Mo Nan?

603
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:11,918
What are you thinking about?!

604
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,542
What improper thought?

605
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,083
Maybe.

606
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:20,792
Lu Baoni, your pursuers

607
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,375
have lined up to the Mars.

608
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,709
You and he are not fit with each other.

609
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:32,292
I’m hungry.

610
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,542
What did you make today?

611
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:34,667
This is not for you.

612
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,375
For Chomper?

613
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,584
Give him or not?

614
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,000
So embarrassing.

615
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:54,792
Don’t give him.

616
00:26:58,959 --> 00:26:59,751
What are you doing?

617
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:03,250
I… This…

618
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:06,709
Wait.

619
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,042
Boss, someone’s here for you.

620
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,042
Let him in.

621
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,375
Mint osmanthus cake, I made it myself.

622
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,083
My treat.

623
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,626
I don’t eat anything unclear.

624
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,125
What if it’s like last time?

625
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,125
Eat it or not,

626
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,584
I’ll leave it here.

627
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:07,125
About last time,

628
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:08,709
I forgot to say…

629
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,125
Thank you.

630
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:18,584
And,

631
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,584
I just forgot to tell you that

632
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:21,292
it was out of mint

633
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,626
when I made the cake

634
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:23,667
yesterday.

635
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,626
So I added some toothpaste in.

636
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,751
I think it’s OK.

637
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,834
OK, I’ll go back to work then.

638
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:38,876
OK, this is OK.

639
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:39,250
OK.

640
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:40,125
OK.

641
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,780
= Relief Flower Shop =

642
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,042
Relief Flower Shop?

643
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:48,375
Yours?

644
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,792
No, Ling Lingqi’s.

645
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:52,918
Mr. Relief florist

646
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,667
picked Ling Lingqi?

647
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,042
How didn’t I know?

648
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:58,292
But,

649
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,751
why you need to know?

650
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:03,125
Nothing.

651
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,042
What story she got?

652
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:07,959
Just

653
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,584
how she started to learn floriculture.

654
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:10,876
And

655
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,292
Mr. Relief florist sent her these flowers

656
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,125
to encourage her.

657
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,501
Now Ling Lingqi

658
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:15,626
finds them withered,

659
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,000
so she asked me to make them into

660
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:17,959
dried flowers as a souvenir.

661
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,751
OK, good.

662
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:37,459
I heard that

663
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,584
someone anonymously sent a girl flowers.

664
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,626
My job is to send people flowers,

665
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:44,999
no matter they’re men or women.

666
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,626
You’re stealing concept.

667
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:50,000
Did you send Ling Lingqi

668
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:50,667
a bunch of flowers

669
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,459
in the name of Mr. Relief florist?

670
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,501
I did it

671
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,125
to encourage her to work hard.

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,834
Encourage her?

673
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:02,250
Then why

674
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,083
I ordered

675
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,209
for over two months

676
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:05,667
but you ignored me?

677
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,292
And for Ling Lingqi,

678
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:08,459
you dressed up

679
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:10,125
and sent her flowers right away?

680
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,209
The friendship between us

681
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,209
has gone through many years,

682
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,999
but what am I in your heart?

683
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,584
I feel so sad.

684
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,459
Compared with giving you flowers

685
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:19,751
to coax those innocent girls,

686
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,876
I’d rather spend time

687
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:21,751
to encourage my employees.

688
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:22,999
Any problems?

689
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,334
I always thought

690
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:27,334
you’re a harmless boy

691
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,501
who doesn’t know about love.

692
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:30,834
It turns out that

693
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:31,542
you’re calculating and

694
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:33,459
you put hoes before bros.

695
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,250
But boss,

696
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,375
I like the way you’re now.

697
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,083
I don’t like

698
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,417
the way you’re now.

699
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:43,626
A high-standard

700
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:44,709
visual feast.

701
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,792
The cruelest and

702
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,209
the most testing competition.

703
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:49,167
The Olympic Games of floriculture,

704
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,417
International Floriculture Competition

705
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,417
will be held in China this year.

706
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,292
Are you ready for this?

707
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:58,250
How’s it, everyone?

708
00:30:58,584 --> 00:30:59,501
Are you ready?

709
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,167
International Floriculture Competition

710
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:03,167
will be held in Hangzhou this year.

711
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,792
I’ll go to the scene to observe.

712
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,083
Observe?

713
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,959
You’re a florist.

714
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,876
Why don’t you sign up for it?

715
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:10,999
Stop.

716
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,792
It’s a master competition

717
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:13,626
in the world.

718
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:15,167
Look at the florists in our company.

719
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,626
Only Mr. Bo has the capability
to participate in it.

720
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,417
We don’t have to

721
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,709
ask for a snub.

722
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,667
You don’t know Mr. Bo.

723
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:23,751
He won’t participate in it.

724
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,125
Why?

725
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:26,667
Is he afraid of losing

726
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,000
with his ability?

727
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,209
This is his principles.

728
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,042
No matter what competitions,

729
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,417
big or small,

730
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,250
= Floral Treasury =
national or global,

731
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,626
= Floral Treasury =
he won’t participate.

732
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,020
Maybe

733
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,667
this is the artist’s lofty and pure of mind.

734
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,250
Self-glorification.

735
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,417
Looking down upon others.

736
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:44,709
No way.

737
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:47,959
Mr. Bo is self-confident, not pretentious.

738
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,501
If he meets someone excels himself,

739
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:51,083
he’ll be sincerely convinced.

740
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,501
Ask Bo Hai to participate in the

741
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,959
International Floriculture Competition.

742
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,042
But,

743
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,083
he never participated

744
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,292
in any competitions.

745
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:13,918
That’s what’s suspicious.

746
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,250
Participating in
International Floriculture Competition

747
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,209
is always a good chance

748
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,250
for floriculture companies to gain publicity.

749
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,334
Everyone is eager

750
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:22,459
to do so,

751
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,417
but Bo Hai never participated in it.

752
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:25,999
Doesn’t it look abnormal?

753
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:29,709
Makes sense.

754
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:32,751
He must have

755
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:33,999
some hidden reasons.

756
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:35,751
If we can make him

757
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:37,375
touch his own taboos,

758
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,709
he will soon show his true colors.

759
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:42,501
But how to make him

760
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,042
participate in the competition?

761
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It’s all up to him.

762
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,417
I heard we got

763
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,250
a big order recently.

764
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,417
We got many good female florists

765
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,292
in our Design Department.

766
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,209
Everyone has her expertise.

767
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:10,334
About

768
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,792
wedding floristry,

769
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,542
I recommend you…

770
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:13,792
Right, Su Cheng

771
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:14,792
is my bestie.

772
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,167
She recommended me a florist

773
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,876
who worked for her before.

774
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,250
Her name is… Ling Lingqi.

775
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:22,876
Sorry,

776
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,292
Ling Lingqi is on leave these days.

777
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,375
How she’s on leave?

778
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:30,125
This is Sisi.

779
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,209
She has rich experience

780
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,584
in wedding floristry.

781
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,292
I believe she will make you satisfied

782
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,292
in every aspect.

783
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:36,250
Hi,

784
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,667
I’m florist Xu Sisi.

785
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:38,959
Let’s talk in the meeting room.

786
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:39,626
OK.

787
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:40,334
Please.

788
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:45,209
Qi,

789
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:47,751
Director Zhou

790
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:48,667
did it right.

791
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,792
You’re not a florist.

792
00:33:59,334 --> 00:33:59,709
I thought

793
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,751
Bo Hai would raise Ling Lingqi’s salary

794
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:01,751
or get her promoted,

795
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,959
but he still asks her to do chores.

796
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,584
Looks like,

797
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,042
Ling Lingqi is just a lame duck.

798
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,542
You can’t say.

799
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:09,876
What do you mean?

800
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,751
Our Mr. Bo is a Drama King.

801
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:13,751
I’m worrying that

802
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,125
if he keeps playing,

803
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,626
he would get identity disorder.

804
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:17,918
This is to

805
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,083
cultivate Ling Lingqi too?

806
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,459
He treats Ling Lingqi

807
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,334
with better care than he does to butterfly orchid.

808
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,375
We just don’t know

809
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:27,959
if Ling Lingqi can understand him.

810
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,125
Thanks.

811
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,501
Did I do a great job

812
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,876
in front of Miss Su?

813
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,626
It’s not for me

814
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,000
to judge.

815
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:54,459
It’s up to the client.

816
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:57,125
But the client wrote a letter of thanks.

817
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,876
It wrote that

818
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,542
I did do a great job.

819
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:03,459
I’m thinking

820
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:04,584
if it’s time for me to change the position

821
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:06,334
which is more suitable for me?

822
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,667
Like a florist, or anything.

823
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You want to be a florist?

824
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,042
If I remember it correctly,

825
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,334
you failed the exam

826
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,292
for three years, didn’t you?

827
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,334
Yes, it’s my history.

828
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,167
Do I need to remind you

829
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,375
why you failed

830
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:32,876
for three times?

831
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,000
I was out of my mind at that time.

832
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:39,626
Correct.

833
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,375
Because you have bad intentions.

834
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,292
You’re here being an anthomaniac,

835
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:45,459
not to be a florist.

836
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,542
People like you

837
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,459
will never become

838
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,834
a real florist.

839
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:51,792
But now I have taken you

840
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,459
as a dirt, all right?

841
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,375
The cleaner in our company

842
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,250
looks more handsome

843
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,250
than you.

844
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:58,626
Really?

845
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,751
Yeah, absolutely true.

846
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:19,250
You liar!

847
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:22,792
It’s true

848
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,167
you have some petty tricks

849
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,375
in floriculture,

850
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:27,292
but you still need to be honed.

851
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:28,959
Floriculture demands

852
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,501
a calm mind.

853
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,292
When you can

854
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,167
move your eyes

855
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,417
off me,

856
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:35,959
then you would probably

857
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,292
become a real florist.

858
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:41,459
You bully me.

859
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:42,584
So what?

860
00:36:58,792 --> 00:36:59,918
Have a look at these materials.

861
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:00,417
OK.

862
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:02,459
You can go back to work now.

863
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:03,876
OK, I’m leaving.

864
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,167
Mr. Mo, it’s me.

865
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:18,292
Yes?

866
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,292
I’ve already done as you said

867
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:21,125
and contacted the big client who has

868
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,876
nailed the business with FlowerPlus.

869
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,292
Now they hesitated about the order.

870
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:28,000
Later

871
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,125
they will sign the official contract

872
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,292
with Bo Hai in the Cafe.

873
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,626
Whether our plan works or not,

874
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,459
it depends on today.

875
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,417
OK.

876
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,918
Mr. Zhang, the weather is good today.

877
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:45,584
I heard you play golf

878
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:46,542
very well.

879
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:47,709
Well,

880
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:48,459
Mr. Bo

881
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:49,959
is also an expert in it.

882
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,459
How about today,

883
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:52,834
after we finish

884
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:53,501
the contract,

885
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,542
let’s go make some swings

886
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,125
to celebrate, OK?

887
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:58,999
Business is business.

888
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,000
There is not so much

889
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:01,167
leisure time.

890
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,209
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

891
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,334
Mr. Bo,

892
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,834
I’ve been thinking over it these days.

893
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,834
We still have some details

894
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,250
to discuss.

895
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:14,959
You know,

896
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,083
Aoteng is

897
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,417
the biggest exhibition company in China.

898
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:21,751
The amount in this contract

899
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:22,876
is no small figure

900
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:24,501
for both you and me.

901
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:26,501
I made it clear

902
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:27,959
when I was bidding.

903
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,918
I screen partners

904
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:33,501
not by low prices.

905
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:34,626
Yes.

906
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,834
You’re correct.

907
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:37,834
That’s why we say

908
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:38,626
you two make

909
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:39,501
the best partners.

910
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:40,751
Mr. Bo

911
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,000
cares about quality very much,

912
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,667
nearly paranoia.

913
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:45,417
You two are perfect for each other.

914
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:46,292
In business,

915
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,918
I’m paranoia for sure.

916
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,751
But Mr. Bo,

917
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:54,584
I doubt it.

918
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:55,918
Well…

919
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,584
Mr. Zhang,

920
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:58,584
you might as well come to the point.

921
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,167
I heard some rumors.

922
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:02,584
They say Mr. Bo

923
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:05,292
has an unearned reputation.

924
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,042
You are very good at hyping and publicity,

925
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,083
but lack of real strength.

926
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,125
You worried too much.

927
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:16,626
I started from scratch

928
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:17,959
based on my strength and the credit

929
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,542
my clients spread from mouth to mouth,

930
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:20,209
so the company

931
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,667
grows to this scale.

932
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,042
Then why

933
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,042
you dare not participate in

934
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,167
any kind of floriculture competition?

935
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:27,959
About this,

936
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,876
I can’t be clearer.

937
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,125
It’s not Mr. Bo dare not participate in it.

938
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,751
It’s because the company develops so fast

939
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:34,876
and he doesn’t have the time.

940
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:35,501
My strength

941
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,083
and my team’s strength don’t

942
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:38,999
have to be proved by competition.

943
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:39,876
Yeah.

944
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,125
It’s reasonable.

945
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,459
But I’d rather believe

946
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,292
the publicly recognized strength.

947
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,334
Aoteng will

948
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:48,501
reconsider

949
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,918
the owner of this contract.

950
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:51,375
To be fair,

951
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,667
we will consider to give it

952
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:54,999
to the No.1

953
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:55,959
Chinese florist

954
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:58,417
and his team

955
00:39:58,626 --> 00:39:59,709
in the International Floriculture Competition,

956
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,292
as a special reward.

957
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,000
This is

958
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,417
considerably fair.

959
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,999
Mr. Zhang, this is a big order,

960
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:08,167
not a game.

961
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,000
How can you back and fill?

962
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:12,209
This is not back and fill.

963
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,042
Your company

964
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,751
hasn’t lost this opportunity.

965
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,542
If Mr. Bo

966
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,250
can prove himself

967
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,042
in this competition,

968
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:23,626
you can still

969
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:24,709
win this order.

970
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:32,250
How could you promise him

971
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,209
to participate in the competition?

972
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,542
What if your illness relapse

973
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:35,209
during the competition?

974
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,292
Are you gonna broadcast your secret

975
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,250
to the whole world?

976
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,083
Yeah.

977
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:39,250
It’s just an order.

978
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:40,626
We can give it up.

979
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,584
No, you can’t go.

980
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,501
Have you ever thought about

981
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,667
why Mr. Zhang suddenly

982
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:48,584
changed his mind?

983
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:52,459
You mean…

984
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:53,876
You suspect

985
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,667
it’s about DREAM and Wen Guangqi?

986
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,125
Yes.

987
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,959
They want to make me participate

988
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,584
in the competition through Mr. Zhang.

989
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,292
If it’s true,

990
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:07,999
you absolutely can’t do it.

991
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,417
On the contrary.

992
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,209
They’ve learnt

993
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,542
something about this.

994
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:14,999
If I don’t go,

995
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:16,501
it means

996
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:17,918
I’ve admitted it myself.

997
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,167
But if you go there,

998
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:21,626
what if you get sick in the scene?

999
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:22,626
Then you’re really

1000
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:23,792
caught in their trap.

1001
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:28,876
I want to have a gamble with DREAM.

1002
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,083
If I win,

1003
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,125
all problems we have now

1004
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,542
will be solved.

1005
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,292
Can you stop

1006
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:40,626
worrying about me?

1007
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,375
I’m always in luck.

1008
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,125
OK,

1009
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,626
Chen Mo and I will go with you.

1010
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:46,042
If anything happens,

1011
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:46,959
we can take care of it.

1012
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:47,667
No need.

1013
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,209
If it really happens,

1014
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:50,375
no one will be helpful.

1015
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,000
Stop arguing for this.

1016
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:53,292
I’ll go with him.

1017
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:54,375
You stay here.

1018
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:55,751
The company needs you here.

1019
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:57,334
