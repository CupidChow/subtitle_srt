Or

56
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,999
a sweet kiss

on a summer afternoon?

58

Let’s break up.

59
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:20,501
I fell in love with Jiahui

60
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:21,501
in the class next door.

61
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,584
So much for our relationship.

62
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,876
Love is a red rose with thorns.

63
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,250
It’s breathtaking.

64
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:49,999
But it also

65
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,292
tears you apart.

66
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:58,542
You think

67
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,834
it’s a lovelorn story?

68
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,751
The sun can’t shine through

69
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,542
unless there’s a crack.

70
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,501
Dark nights never last forever.

71
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,667
The dawn will come.

72
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,542
This is

73
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,709
a story about sweet love.

74
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,083
A long adolescence

75
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,167
always comes with

76
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,501
nail-biting frustration.

77
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,667
As a result,

78
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,042
most adolescents

79
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,000
have the obsession for idols

80
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,999
to relieve themselves.

81
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:04,459
Don’t get me wrong.

82
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,042
I have no obsession

83
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,167
for singers or film stars.

84
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,209
Hi, everyone. I’m Bo Hai.

85
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,751
Welcome to

Today, we’re going to

88
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,292
talk about love.

89
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,375
Speaking of love,

90
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,667
we’ll come to roses

91
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,667
that represent love.

92
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,042
He is my idol.

93

Let me show you.

This bouquet has a nice shape.

95
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,125
We’ll specially use it.

96
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,584
Adoring someone

97
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,876
and even imagining him

98
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,375
as the dream lover

99
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:40,918
greatly make up for

100
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,292
the expectation and sentiment

101
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:42,999
in adolescents’ hearts.

102

But if one is addicted to that,

103
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,834
he will have psychological disorder

104
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,918
and then mental problem.

00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,792
can knock me down,

178
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,292
you really are

179
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,459
underestimating me.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,626
How about

181
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,250
working in the hospital?

182
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:42,834
That’s the only option.

183
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:44,626
I have no time for that.

184
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,042
I must get prepared for formal exam

185
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:46,834
in six months.

186
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,959
I must be admitted to FlowerPlus!

187
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,125
The first step was miserable.

188
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,542
But the first step always costs.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,667
Whatever.

190
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,209
There’s only one theme

191
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,918
for this story.

192
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,709
Dream

193
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,292
will come true!

194
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,860
= Shop =

195
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:38,626
Qi, come over!

196
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,209
Shopping online again?

197
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,375
Wasting money when you have no job.

198
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,417
Dad, I’m not wasting money.

199
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,792
I’m making money!

200
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:48,250
I applied to be an experiencer

201
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,959
for Sweet Dream Technology.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,083
I have subsidy every month.

203
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,292
Don’t you think I’m making money?

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,918
I’m relieved, then.

205
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,292
I must reward you.

206
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:56,999
- Wait. - What reward?

207
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:58,999
A box of milk.

208
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,250
= Pure Milk =

209
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,584
= Pure Milk =
Is it expired again?

210
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,125
Two days from the expiry.

211
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:07,167
Take it.

212
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,000
Don’t get yourself choked.

213
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,501
Take it.

214
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:11,792
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

215
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:12,959
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

216
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:18,876
Song!

217
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,083
What a nice dress!

218
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,292
Where did you buy it?

219
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,292
This one?

220
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:23,626
I bought it ten years ago.

221
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:25,834
Oh my goodness. Ten years ago?

222
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,209
And you still wear it?

223
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,334
I thought of dumping it.

224
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,584
But my daughter knew how to match it.

225
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,000
What do you think? Fashion?

226
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,250
Your daughter has great ability.

227
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,042
Yeah.

228
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,250
Why is she great?

229
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,000
She went to an ordinary university.

230
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,459
And had a less ordinary major.

231
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,083
She has no job after graduation!

232
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,375
Speaking of ability,

233
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,918
my son has!

234
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,375
He hasn’t graduated yet.

235
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,584
But many big companies want him!

236
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,417
Who believes?

237
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:53,565
Mom!

238
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:55,965
- Mom! - Qi.

239
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:56,876
Aunt Li.

240
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:58,417
Hello, Qi.

241
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:00,209
Aunt Li.

242
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,000
What’s wrong?

243
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:03,417
Aunt Li.

244
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:04,334
Why are you wearing

245
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,751
like a carrot?

246
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,250
Carrot?

247
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,959
Carrot demon.

248
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,042
What are you laughing at?

249
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,292
You look like a ladybird!

250
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,334
What the hell!

251
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,000
Carrot demon.

252
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,042
Stop laughing!

253
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,375
Hollywood superstar Nicolas...

254
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,459
Look! Nicolas!

255
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,417
Nicolas!

256
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,709
He’s so cool! Gosh!

257
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:41,542
It’s top news in the entertainment circle.

258
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,083
Nicolas is really generous

259
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,375
in preparing his wedding.

260
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,083
Nicolas

261
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,000
is remarkably handsome!

262
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,167
His smile is so charming.

263
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,792
And it stuns me!

264
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,417
Famous Chinese florist Bo Hai

265
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,501
will take care of the wedding,

266
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,918
as the design director.

267
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:56,959
He’s handsome, talented,

268
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,999
competent and charming.

269
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,542
Sedate and classy!

270
00:11:58,626 --> 00:11:59,167
He gives a new meaning

271
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,292
of a handsome guy.

272
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:01,042
Am I right?

273
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,375
Bo Hai is so handsome!

274
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,792
Super handsome!

275
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:10,876
Wait a minute!

276
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,334
Wait!

277
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:27,834
Our company takes care of

278
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,417
the flowers design for this wedding.

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,876
We mainly use

280
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,167
one hundred thousand white roses.

281
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:33,792
It’s a beautiful design.

282
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,000
Each water-storage tube

283
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:35,626
must be fixed

284
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:36,334
with two Oasis cords.

285
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:36,918
Chen Mo.

286
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:38,194
Hi!

287
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:39,375
By the way,

288
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,876
don’t forget the heat insulation.

289
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:41,292
Okay?

290
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,417
I need an electric saw.

291
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,667
For this,

292
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:57,918
you have to do it yourself.

293
00:12:58,709 --> 00:12:59,334
The foreign guy

294
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,751
said he needed an electric saw.

295
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,417
Electric saw saves your breath.

296
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:04,042
But the precision will fail.

297
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,083
Maybe,

298
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,834
the whole design will be ruined.

299
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:09,709
You’re fired.

300
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:15,417
Put it on.

301
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:18,834
How is it going in China?

302
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:20,209
As you expected,

303
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,584
DREAM offers deep cooperation.

304
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:23,250
On the surface,

305
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:24,626
they offer to cooperate with us.

306
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,584
But it’s sweet talk.

307
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,584
In fact, they want to merge us.

308
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:30,667
In foreign countries,

309
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,167
DREAM is notorious.

310
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:32,792
It appears to be

311
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,792
a good-looking transnational enterprise.

312
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:35,667
But privately,

313
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,709
it makes a fortune by hostile merger.

314
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,292
They don’t mean good.

315
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:42,375
The design for this wedding

316
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:43,876
is a great chance

317
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:44,999
to improve the brand value

318
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,042
and cheer our employees up.

319
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,918
DREAM attacks us

320
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:48,501
at this moment.

321
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,501
Seems like they put a bet.

322
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:53,709
The media pay great attention

323
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,292
to Nicolas’s wedding.

324
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,999
Once we make a mistake,

325
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,501
stockholders will make a fuss

326
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,292
and sell their stocks to DREAM.

327
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,375
Let them go to hell!

328
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:04,083
We’ll rely on ourselves.

329
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,375
The wedding bouquet for Madeline

330
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,209
will be special and big,

331
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,459
consisting of dozens of snow roses

332
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:16,626
in a simulative way

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,542
that real roses

334
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,959
make up.

335
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,000
Rattans will be

336
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,167
twined around the bouquet,

337
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,876
for contrast of different senses.

338
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,375
Embellished with light moth orchid,

339
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:26,459
the bouquet

340
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,959
will look more vivid.

341
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,042
I’ve imagined

342
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,918
countless possibilities for my dream to come true.

343
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:32,167
But I didn’t expect such a…

344
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,125
Miss?

345
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,834
Miss?

346
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:11,876
Are you all right?

347
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:21,125
Sorry.

348
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,209
Thank you.

349
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,876
Sorry. Sorry.

350
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,042
Don’t have too much pressure.

351
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:28,584
The wedding hasn’t started yet.

352
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,000
Don’t get sick.

353
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,000
I bought you the sleeping bracelet.

354
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:32,709
Did you use it?

355
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,000
You have nightmares,

356
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:34,834
because you have

357
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:35,626
too much pressure.

358
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:36,417
Understand?

359
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:37,918
Deep in your heart,

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,918
you’ve been worried

361
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,999
if something will go wrong.

362
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,000
That is the point.

363
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,125
I don’t want these!

364
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,334
It’s difficult, Miss Madeline.

365
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,709
Here comes Murphy’s Law.

366
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:46,918
I told you

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,751
I don’t want white roses.

368
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:52,042
What’s wrong?

369
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,459
Miss Madeline

370
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,751
doesn’t like white roses.

371
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,083
We’re asked to

372
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,125
change one hundred thousand white roses

373
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:58,626
into pink roses.

374
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,417
How is it possible?

375
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:01,999
Change one hundred thousand roses?

376
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,876
I don’t care how you do it.

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,375
This wedding

378
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,250
is the most important event of my life.

379
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,209
It must be perfect.

380
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,959
We discussed our design proposal

381
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,918
with Mr. Nicolas before.

382
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,459
And Mr. Nicolas

383
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:15,334
replied with

384
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,751
an affirmative answer.

385
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,167
So the wedding day is tomorrow.

386
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,999
There is no single floriculture company

387
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,083
can transfer even one thousand pink roses

388
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,792
within such a short time

389
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,999
at this critical moment.

390
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,209
That’s your concern! All of you!

391
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:31,792
Xinyan.

392
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:32,876
Stop arguing with them.

393
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:33,918
Tell them!

394
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,292
I’ve been working so many years.

395
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,667
I met unreasonable clients.

396
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:37,334
But I’ve never seen

397
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,292
such an unreasonable one like them!

398
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,042
Never!

399
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:39,334
Chen Mo!

400
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:40,709
What should we do?

401
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,334
Look what kind of people you have hired!

402
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:44,209
I told you

403
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,584
a Chinese florist won’t do it all.

404
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:46,792
But you just won’t listen!

405
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,375
’This is all your fault!

406
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,667
Madeline! Madeline! Madeline!

407
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,792
I know.

408
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,292
It’s actually a bit preposterous

409
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,792
to change the flowers unexpectedly.

410
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,584
But listen, I love my wife.

411
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,834
She’s the most important person in my life.

412
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,999
And this wedding… It’s just once in a lifetime.

413
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,334
I don’t want anything to go wrong.

414
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:16,751
I don’t want her to regret

415
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,167
for the rest of her life.

416
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,501
Every requirement of the customer is reasonable.

417
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:25,083
If there’s any unreasonable request,

418
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,375
that’s obviously because of
our lack of capabilities

419
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:32,459
and unable to meet the demand.

420
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:37,125
I knew that choosing your team
was a wise decision.

421
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:38,292
After all,

422
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,167
your company is the strongest.

423
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,459
And no other company

424
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:42,876
competes with you to get this job.

425
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,375
You’re the biggest client of FlowerPlus

426
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,125
for the first half year.

427
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,918
Also, it’s our live ad.

428
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,125
Anyway, I have nothing against

429
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,083
fame and fortune.

430
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:55,709
Very good.

431
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,250
But I still have to remind you.

432
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,167
I’m sure you heard about

433
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,792
Madeline’s cranky temper

434
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,083
when she isn’t happy.

435
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:05,918
If things go wrong,

436
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,792
it could be bad and embarrass everyone.

437
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,083
She’s your Goddess.

438
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:14,167
And client is my God. You have my word.

439
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,292
Tomorrow’s wedding

440
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,918
is going to be perfect.

441
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,042
Thank you.

442
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,209
My pleasure.

443
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,459
Spain, Belgium, Italy,

444
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,459
or any neighboring countries

445
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,334
can allocate pink roses.

446
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,334
We’ll send bands

447
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,709
for urgent transportation.

448
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:38,459
Thank you.

449
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,792
I will try

450
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,918
another flower company then.

451
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:41,876
Goodbye.

452
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:59,167
I’ll call you later.

453
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:00,292
What have you got?

454
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,042
When we’re away,

455
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,292
Vice President Wen

456
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:05,626
has taken people from DREAM

457
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:06,209
to visit

458
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,417
other stockholders.

459
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,876
As we expected,

460
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,501
those fence-sitters

461
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,209
are interested in DREAM.

462
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:13,083
What should we do?

463
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,417
Vice President Wen

464
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:15,334
is poor in managing the company.

465
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,417
But he’s an expert in betraying us.

466
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,667
We’re working hard.

467
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:19,959
But they are pulling us down.

468
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,125
What the hell!

469
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,709
It’s okay. Let them be.

470
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,083
DREAM is always astute.

471
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,375
We’re too far away to help.

472
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:31,751
If we want to help,

473
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,542
our energy will be distracted.

474
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:34,417
Sure,

475
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,375
that’s what DREAM wants.

476
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:37,999
But I’m not as stupid as they think I am.

477
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,334
I’ll shove in

478
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:39,834
all my chips

479
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,250
in Nicolas’s wedding.

480
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,209
When the wedding ends tomorrow,

481
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,250
those dishonorable guys

482
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,542
will beg me in all ways.

483
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:21,542
What do you think?

484
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:23,999
Surprised?

485
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,042
Did no one tell you

486
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:26,751
this was

487
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:27,834
a rather old trick?

488
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:28,667
Don’t you remember

489
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,209
what day it is?

490
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,083
Your birthday?

491
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:33,834
Today is

492
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,375
the commemoration day

493
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,375
that we’re in love for two months.

494
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,308
Let’s

495
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:38,083
get somewhere

496
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,375
for celebration.

497
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,209
I have a date.

498
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:41,918
Sorry.

499
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,667
Change the date.

500
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,667
I’m the one you care for most.

501
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:47,501
Not anymore.

502
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:48,584
What do you mean?

503
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:50,083
I’m breaking up

504
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:52,083
with you.

505
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,626
Ma’am.

506
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:55,709
Be right there!

507
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:58,375
Eighteen.

508
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,667
Not the bill, ma’am.

509
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,209
I’m not full yet.

510
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:03,584
Not full?

511
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,751
Here I am! Here I am!

512
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,125
Miss Lu Baoni!

513
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:08,876
You’re breaking the record

514
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,250
of being late.

515
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:11,626
You know what?

516
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,417
It’s Ximen’s fault.

517
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,042
He stopped me on my way.

518
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,876
He wanted me to celebrate

519
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,167
the commemoration day for two months in love.

520
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,125
Oh, dear.

521
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:21,125
You know what?

522
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,042
I was just upset with him.

523
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,417
So, in a fit of anger,

524
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:26,834
I broke up with him.

525
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,542
Broke up with him?

526
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,876

I’m free, all right?

According to

572
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,584
human brain engineering,

573
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,876
the functional MRI equipment

574
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,250
sends back the brain wave

00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:19,709

when someone is in his dream

00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,459
and interferes with it purposefully.

581
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:33,125
During the process,

582
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:34,125
there is

583
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,709
very little chance

00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,375
that different brain waves

585
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:38,209
may run into

586
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,626
the same scene

587
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,167
just because

588
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:44,959
they’re at the same frequency.

With the help of MRI equipment,

That’s serious!

All right.

You know what?

You should worry about yourself.

I’m still working.

699
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:46,542
I’ll get punished.

700
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:56,000
Come on!

701

Bring out the energy

702
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,250
that you fought the dragon with last night.

703
00:38:58,834 --> 00:38:59,459
I support you!

704
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:03,918
How about something practical?

705
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:05,792
A kiss for you!

706
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,834
I give you my daughter’s hand.

707
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:55,834
Thank you.

708
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,834
Madeline, I’ve been waiting for you.

709
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:02,292
Three years ago,

710
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:03,751
when Nicolas asked me out

711
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,042
for the first time,

712
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,167
he arrived hotfoot from the set,

713
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,083
without any

714
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,209
exquisite gift.

715
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,000
But before he left,

716
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:18,959
he bought me a bouquet of pink roses,

717
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,999
and then told me that he fell in love with me.

718
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,000
I don’t really like pink.

719
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,042
But I love the moment

720
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:31,459
he told me he loved me

721
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:32,959
for the first time,

722
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,250
that night,

723
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,999
and that bouquet of pink roses.

724
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:40,999
Madeline.

725
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,459
Thank you, Bo Hai.

726
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,542
Thank you for

727
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,834
making my unrealistic dream come true.

728
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,125
You’re not a florist.

729
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,042
You’re a magician.

730
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,042
The grand wedding

731
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:01,292
for Hollywood superstar Nicolas

732
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,834
and the marchioness Madeline

733
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,334
is going on

734
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:05,792
in Le Château d’Ussé, France.

735
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:07,999
The famous Chinese florist

736
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,167
Mr. Bo Hai

737
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,751
decorated the castle

738
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,083
into a stunning

739
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:13,626
Garden of Eden

740
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:14,999
