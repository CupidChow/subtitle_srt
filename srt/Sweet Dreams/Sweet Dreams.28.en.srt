51
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,667
Let me tell you.

52
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,417
You can’t break through

53
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,083
the barriers in your heart.

54
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,792
You can’t forget,

55
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:51,209
forgive

56
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,083
or love someone.

57
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,000
Because the lying and hatred

58
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,918
in your heart

59
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,626
is the curse of

60
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,125
your whole life.

61
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,250
You have to believe it,

62
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:14,000
because the curse comes into effect.

63
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,667
Anyone who wants to come to you will

64
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,792
finally

65
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:20,417
become ashes in the fire

66
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,959
of hatred.

67
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,125
Bo Hai. Bo Hai!

68
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:50,918
Who are you?

69
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:52,709
Why are you in my seat?

70
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,250
I’m the new florist.

71
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:54,999
HR Department

72
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,167
assigned me to sit here.

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,501
Here. These are you things.

74
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,000
I already packed them for you.

75
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,626
What?

76
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,417
Ling Lingqi is going to be transferred

77
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,709
to be the shop manager?

78
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:09,709
Yes.

79
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,709
This is a direct order

80
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,709
from Mr. Bo.

81
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,417
But she won’t agree with this.

82
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,918
She won’t?

83
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,459
It’s only been a few months.

84
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:21,709
Her promotion speed

85
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:22,375
has already broken

86
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,751
our company’s record.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,876
Well, for her,

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,209
this is not a good thing.

89
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:47,709
Bo Hai!

90
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,167
You know you did

91
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,876
something wrong,

92
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,792
so you’re avoiding me,

93
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:52,501
aren’t you?

94
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,334
Qi, I’m sorry.

95
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:02,000
I know

96
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,209
why you couldn’t save me.

97
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,375
And I don’t blame you.

98
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:05,792
I don’t remember

99
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:06,876
what happened before.

100
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:07,584
Why are you still

101
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:08,834
holding on them?

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,292
I can’t let it go.

103
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,501
I almost got my loved one

104
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,751
killed.

105
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,375
I have never hated myself

106
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,584
like this.

107
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,999
I can help you with anything.

108
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,751
Love can solve everything.

109
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,584
I read that in the book.

110
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,459
The book must not say

111
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,792
that love can make people blind.

112
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,542
Love even makes him unable to see himself,

113
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,751
and almost think

114
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,959
a man like him

115
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,375
could really get love.

116
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,584
Bo Hai, you said before.

117
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:56,209

118
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,417

119

You transferred Ling Lingqi away.

148
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,125
You like her so much,

149
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,876
then why do you have to drive her away?

150
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,000
How can you live so stubbornly ?

151
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,918
She’s like a tree.

152
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,250
I am vine.

153
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,876
The closer I get to her,

154
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,375
the tighter it gets.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,959
Until she can’t see the sun,

156
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,125
and she can’t breathe.

157
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,083
In the end,

158
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:36,334
it will kill her.

159
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:39,292
Boss, you are too pessimistic.

160
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,042
Why can’t you think about

161
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:41,876
the brighter side?

162
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:43,918
You can’t just

163
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:44,792
give up.

164
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,375
I tried.

165
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,209
But after this time,

166
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,751
I really don’t have the courage

167
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,042
to try again.

168
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:03,292
But don’t you think

169
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,542
you are too cruel to Ling Lingqi?

170
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,375
I can’t

171
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,501
love someone.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,792
I don’t deserve love.

173
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,334
My love

174
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,501
will only hurt

175
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,626
the one I love.

176
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,000
But in this way,

177
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,751
you feel more painful inside.

178
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:55,250
Qi,

179
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,334
you are so careless.

180
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,542
You are scaring me.

181
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,375
Don’t hold everything in your heart.

182
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:09,501
Cry if you want, and eat if you want.

183
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,417
I think Bo Hai

184
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,584
is too outrageous this time.

185
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,250
Don’t hold back and hurt inside.

186
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:18,834
You are killing me.

187
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,667
Say something.

188
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,667
Something.

189
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,876
Qi, call me

190
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:30,834
if you need anything.

191
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,834
Seems like Ling Lingqi

192
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:36,959
gives up.

193
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:39,626
She gives up

194
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:40,626
doesn’t mean that

195
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:41,667
you’ll have a chance.

196
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:42,584
How do you know

197
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,417
that I don’t stand a chance?

198
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:49,209
Faced with grim reality and still won’t give up.

199
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,334
Nothing goes well.

200
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,209
Must because of the Mercury Retrograde.

201
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:08,542
Everyone is here.

202
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:10,626
Today is the day

203
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,542
for our company’s routine activity,

204
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,459
Self-cleaning Day.

205
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,209
Mr. Bo hopes this activity

206
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,334
could help raise our awareness of

207
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,999
environmental protection.

208
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:18,959
Next,

209
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,167
I’m going to assign tasks.

210
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,334
David and Sisi

211
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,626
are in charge of meeting room.

212
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,250
Zhenqi and Yi

213
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,334
are in charge of reception room.

214
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:27,959
Mo Nan and Baoni

215
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,334
are in charge of

216
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,250
open-air garden.

217
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:34,999
Secretary Chen,

218
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,292
can I exchange with Zhenqi?

219
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,167
Sure, sure.

220
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,250
No one is asking you.

221
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:40,959
Of course,

222
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:41,626
as long as you two teams

223
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,834
have no problem.

224
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,542
Aren’t they two the closest?

225
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:46,751
What happened today?

226
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,501
I smell a distinct whiff of

227
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,626
gossip.

228
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,792
I went through a long way,

229
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,834
yet I’m back to the start.

230
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:39,792
Qi, what are you doing here?

231
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:42,167
You are our

232
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,292
new shop manager.

233
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,125
Come, follow me.

234
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,667
Let me introduce

235
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,375
to you.

236
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,584
This is our new shop manager,

237
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,459
Ling Lingqi.

238
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:54,292
You know,

239
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,042
in several months,

240
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,751
she is promoted from a salesperson

241
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,501
to our shop manager

242
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:00,959
with rocket speed.

243
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:02,999
It’s like the myth of our company.

244
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:04,626
Manager,

245
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,209
I look up to you so much.

246
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,292
I made a decision.

247
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,292
I’ll take the manager as an idol

248
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,292
and work hard.

249
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:11,292
Go back to work.

250
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:12,083
Yes.

251
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:16,751
Welcome to FlowerPlus.

252
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,209
Is there a florist here

253
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,375
just transferred

254
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,125
from headquarters,

255
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:22,959
who was in charge of movie scene set

256
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:23,959
of He Minglang?

257
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,292
Yes, it’s our manager.

258
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,209
Hello.

259
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:29,292
Great.

260
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,292
I saw your design

261
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,751
on TV.

262
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,209
I really appreciate your work.

263
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,834
I want to hire you as my florist.

264
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:37,167
Here is the thing.

265
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:39,334
My wife just gave birth.

266
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,167
I got children

267
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,542
in an old age.

268
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,792
Much more,

269
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,626
I’ve got a boy and a girl.

270
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,292
They all say that this is

271
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,501
a good blessing from my previous life.

272
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,501
Don’t you think so?

273
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,209
Hello?

274
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,999
- Yes, yes. - Yes, yes.

275
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:07,792
Yes.

276
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,999
This month’s mysterious hidden theme bouquet

277
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,792
is called Winter Sun.

278
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:18,542
We use eustoma

279
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:19,250
and eucalyptus leaves

280
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,083
with warm pincushion flowers

281
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,918
and double-petaled tulips.

282
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:24,876
The warm orange tone brings

283
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:26,584
sunshine-like enthusiasm

284
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,459
and vitality.

285
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:30,083
I…

286
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,834
Actually, the Design Department

287
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,250
is not very

288
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,584
satisfied with this plan.

289
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,125
Because it is

290
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,042
too similar to the theme

291
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,083
at the end of last year.

292
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:48,584
Mr. Bo,

293
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:50,125
do you think we should…

294
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,999
Then do as the plan.

295
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,542
If nothing else, dismiss.

296
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,501
Sure, I understand.

297
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,125
Look at the flowers you sent.

298
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:17,375
They are worse than the grocery market’s.

299
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,125
What are these crap?

300
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,042
This flower is too ugly.

301
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:20,042
I don’t care.

302
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:21,250
I don’t want it.

303
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,250
Give my happiness back!

304
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,000
Give my girlfriend back!

305
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:26,125
We will

306
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,250
be responsible for this.

307
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,000
I will take care of it.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,626
What kind of flower is this?

309
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,334
Calm down.

310
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:29,959
Both white and yellow.

311
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:30,584
Are you doing this on purpose?

312
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:31,626
Take it back and see for yourself.

313
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,125
Look, what are these?

314
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,626
Are you insulting my aesthetics?

315
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,250
My friend works on art.

316
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,709
He is not a hooligan.

317
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:38,918
Please calm down.

318
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:40,999
What are these?

319
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,000
What the hell are these?

320
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:12,501
Boss,

321
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,209
about the training of new florists,

322
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,000
when….

323
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:16,999
Let them wait.

324
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:25,542
What’s wrong?

325
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:26,250
Mr. Bo,

326
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,167
HR Department just got

327
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,292
complaints from clients.

328
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,667
One of our shop managers

329
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,459
who has negative work attitude,

330
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,042
and has been complained

331
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,042
for five times in three days.

332
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,250
According to the company’s rules and regulations,

333
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,959
she will be fired directly.

334
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,459
Director Luo said he couldn’t decide,

335
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:46,667
so, he sent me here to

336
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:47,667
ask your opinion.

337
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,709
Which manager? So outrageous.

338
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,709
Ling Lingqi.

339
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:52,542
No!

340
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,209
Tell Luo Xiannian.

341
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,292
Give Ling Lingqi a week off.

342
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,584
None of her complaints will be handled.

343
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:06,167
Yes. Sure.

344
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,918
No distinction between public and private.

345
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,209
If he continues doing this,

346
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:26,959
these staff

347
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,292
will gossip.

348
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:29,751
Please try to understand.

349
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,083
These loveless men

350
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:31,959
are the same.

351
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,834
The mouth is saying no,
but the body is saying yes.

352
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:35,876
What kind of sickness is this?

353
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,250
It is a sickness, which should be treated.

354
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:40,999
Do you have any special medicine?

355
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,250
Give me some.

356
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,709
I’m not going to treat you.

357
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,459
But Bo Hai’s sickness must be treated by me.

358
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,042
I think you are sick, too.

359
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,417
It’s called emotional poisoning.

360
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,584
Delusional.

361
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,792
It’s called emotional strategy. See?

362
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,334
You dumb men

363
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,250
know nothing.

364
00:16:58,918 --> 00:16:59,292
OK.

365
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,751
I’m going to make a good plan.

366
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:03,959
Goodbye.

367
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,709
I am dumb.

368
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,584
That’s why I like

369
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,083
a dumb woman like Xinyan.

370
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,375
Seriously?

371
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,834
I finally got a cab

372
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,417
and ran into

373
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,542
such an unreasonable man?

374
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,459
Such bad luck.

375
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,417
Recycle all kinds of little beauties,

376
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,417
middle beauties, big beauties,

377
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,584
little cuties and domineering ladies.

378
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,334
Are you a little cutie?

379
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,667
Do you want a ride?

380
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:18,417
Thank you.

381
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,000
OK, here we are.

382
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:23,918
Qi,

383
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:26,876
my friend owns a floriculture company

384
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:27,667
and it’s hiring.

385
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,375
The salary is better than now.

386
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,918
I kind of like it.

387
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:32,751
If you are not

388
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,999
happy here,

389
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,876
let’s switch jobs together.

390
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:42,667
It’s OK.

391
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,334
This is important.

392
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:45,083
Take your time.

393
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,042
Think about it.

394
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,292
I’ll wait for you, OK?

395
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,000
Goodbye.

396
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:49,751
Goodbye.

397
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:15,868
♪ May you be prosperous ♪

398
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,360
♪ May you be wonderful ♪

399
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,751
These young people today

400
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:21,459
have a very different way

401
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,083
of falling in love from our times.

402
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:24,751
Once the relationship is settled,

403
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,000
the progress is going fast.

404
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,626
Not like us when we were young.

405
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,792
We fell and fell,

406
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,292
and nothing happened.

407
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:32,125
Does this mean

408
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,667
your Qi and Bo Hai

409
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:34,918
are getting married?

410
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:35,999
And you

411
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:36,876
will be

412
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,501
a mother-in-law of a CEO?

413
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:39,792
Thank you for your lucky words.

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,959
Come to my store later,

415
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:42,667
and I’ll give you a 5% off.

416
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:44,918
Quit the shop.

417
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,083
The whole flower shop

418
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,501
and the listed company

419
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:48,959
will be yours.

420
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:51,584
I heard your daughter

421
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,250
was transferred to

422
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,292
a faraway shop

423
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,459
to be a manager.

424
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:55,417
That

425
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,417
is because the CEO promotes

426
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,459
and likes her.

427
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,667
He is doing everything he can to make her grow.

428
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,125
Promote her?

429
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,209
Make her grow?

430
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,626
He didn’t promote her in headquarter

431
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:05,709
but sent her to a

432
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,876
faraway shop to be a manager.

433
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:09,501
Usually, people who fall in love

434
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,209
are trying to be closer.

435
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,334
They are doing everything they can

436
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,792
to push away.

437
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,177
♪ May the best come ♪

438
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:22,667
I don’t understand.

439
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:23,626
You’re going to take her.

440
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,042
Why is she hesitating?

441
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:26,834
Doesn’t she know

442
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,667
how much you’ve sacrificed for her?

443
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,918
You know what?

444
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,292
I like this one very much recently.

445
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,459
Yamasaki 25.

446
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,834
I think it has a wonderful

447
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:42,959
soft taste.

448
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,876
Although the wine is strong,

449
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:49,083
it tastes smooth.

450
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:52,167
The aftertaste comes slowly,

451
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,834
not aggressively.

452
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:57,250
It’s like my mood now.

453
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,876
If I remember correctly,

454
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,584
not long ago,

455
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,083
your favorite was vodka.

456
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:08,918
Was it?

457
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,584
Maybe I’m changed.

458
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,000
You are changed indeed.

459
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,375
In the past, no matter for career

460
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:19,083
or feelings,

461
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,792
you have been attacking all the time

462
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,999
without knowing fatigue.

463
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:23,959
But now?

464
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,042
Recently you have been dodging,

465
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,709
even running away.

466
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:30,542
I don’t understand.

467
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,999
Why can’t you summon up your courage?

468
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,709
Go ahead

469
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,083
and rush through, OK?

470
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:40,042
Ji Bin,

471
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,292
love is not like a trade in market.

472
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,751
Attacking all the time

473
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,334
won’t give you pleasure.

474
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,375
Sometimes,

475
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,417
it’s more reassuring

476
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,209
to guard silently.

477
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,000
Even if you can’t have it in the end,

478
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:05,959
it’s worth it.

479
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:20,459
Qi, I’m asking you.

480
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,125
Is that

481
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,792
jinx Li Lijun

482
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:24,584
right about you?

483
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,334
Aren’t you good?

484
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,375
You were so close to it.

485
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,083
What happened?

486
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,292
He has a problem.

487
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:32,501
What problem?

488
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:33,792
He is sick.

489
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,125
What kind of sickness?

490
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:36,751
Something trivial.

491
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:38,292
Trivial?

492
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,167
Qi,

493
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,334
you can’t abandon him

494
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,667
because he has something trivial

495
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,709
and give him up.

496
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,000
In the face of great love,

497
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,959
how can you become so utilitarian?

498
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,042
I’m telling you.

499
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,042
I’m not satisfied.

500
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:05,751
Mo Nan.

501
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,334
Baoni?

502
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,959
Mo Nan, I’m lovelorn.

503
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,918
Before, every time I’m lost,

504
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:19,334
you would try your best

505
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,459
to comfort me.

506
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,292
Now

507
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,459
I really feel helpless.

508
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:32,417
Can you hug me?

509
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:35,501
I…

510
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:36,709
Like a sister.

511
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,417
Thank you, Mo Nan.

512
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,292
I think a lot these days.

513
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:02,626
I finally got it.

514
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,042
Don’t you say

515
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,000
you have someone you like?

516
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:11,167
Well…

517
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:13,918
Baoni.

518
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,751
The person I like is actually…

519
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:17,999
I don’t care who you like.

520
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,167
But I made a decision.

521
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,751
I want to compete fairly with her.

522
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:29,667
There are seven billion people

523
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,167
on this planet.

524
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:34,375

It’s hard for me

to meet the person I really like.

527
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,375
Don’t do

528
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,417
anything impulsive.

529
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:42,667
How could I

530
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,834
give up easily?

531
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:47,876
I have confidence.

532
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,709
With my beauty,

00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:51,918
my charm

534
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:53,709
and so many years

of experience in love,

536
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,250

Go for it.

572

Go please Bo Hai again?

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,876
Back off.

574

Don’t delay my pursuit of happiness.

575

Leave me alone.

583
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,125
It’s not your business.

sacrifice myself

something I’ve hidden for long.

Soymilk will be cold in a moment.

597
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,751
Dad, I made a decision.

598
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,501
I’m not giving up on Bo Hai.

599

grows up now.

603
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,334

00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:14,375
No.

Man himself

611
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,459
is an advanced animal.

Besides,

613
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,501
I also learned medicine.

614
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,792
Yes, your daughter has also learned

615
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:27,209
veterinary medicine.

616
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:28,959
The methods are not the point.

617
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,709
The point is to be willing and determined.

618
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:33,083
Where there is a will, there is a way.

Good morning.

622
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:52,083
I thought about

623

your proposal yesterday.

624
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,334
I’m not leaving FlowerPlus.

625

But if you stay,

626
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,209
what’s the point

627
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:58,542
except to upset yourself?

628
00:29:59,209 --> 00:29:59,959
I’ve figured it out,

629
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,876
and I’m not upset now.

630
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,999
I’m going to fight with Bo Hai till the end.

631
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:05,999
He treats you like this,

and you still want to be with him?

636

Such a rare relationship.

I have to do my best.

638
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,292
Ling Lingqi, you’re…

639
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:22,375
So simple.

640
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,709
Simple mind, simple life.

641
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,042
Please let me be

642
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,125
a fool for love.

643
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:29,542
As long as you are happy.

644
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:31,167
I am happy.

645
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:33,918
I have to work

646
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,125
for the man I like.

647
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,167
Cheer up, Ling Lingqi!

648
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:37,250
Bye.

649
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:52,959
Just sprinkle some water

650
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,042

Good morning, everyone.

- Manager. - Manager?

654
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:04,626
Why are you here?

655
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,292
Aren’t you on vacation this week?

656
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:07,459
I felt sick

657
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:08,584
the other day.

658
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:09,167
But I’m

659
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,209
all right now.

660
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:11,542
Because I, your manager,

661
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:12,417
have studied medicine.

662
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,334
I can not only arrange flowers,

663
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,709
but also heal people.

664
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:15,999
Yes.

665
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,542
I’ve heard from Mr. Bo before

666
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,918
that these flowers and grass

667
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,626
can soothe people’s hearts.

668
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:23,918
I’ve heard these days that

669
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,792
the number of complaints is on the rise

670
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,292
and our sales

671
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,375
are on the decline.

672
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:38,459
I’m sorry, guys.

673
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:39,626
It’s all because of me.

674
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:40,918
But I’m

675
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:41,999
up for it now.

676
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,792
Let’s work together in the future.

677
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,125
For sales! For performance!

678
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:45,834
For Mr. Bo!

679
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,334
Come on, work hard!

680
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:57,292
Come on, work hard!

681
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,042
Dismiss!

682
00:31:59,125 --> 00:31:59,626
Dismiss.

683
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:02,876
Good.

684
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,167
Is this the new Clematis?

685
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,042
It needs to change water every two days.

686
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:09,584
Haven’t you changed the water

687
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,417
for a long time?

688
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:12,626
Go and see if there are any new ones.

689
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,250
OK, I’ll go to the warehouse.

690
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,209
We need to replace this one.

691
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:19,959
Please check for me

692
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:20,834
how much we’ve stocked.

693

00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:31,083
Take a look.

702
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:32,375
You can send them as a gift to your friends

703
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:33,501
or decorate your office.

704
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,667
It’s all good choices.

705
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:35,417
Wipe this off.

706
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,292
Don’t let the customer see.

707
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,083
Welcome.

708
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:47,000
Secretary Chen is here to inspect the work?

709
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,083
This is our warehouse.

710
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,334
I’m here to buy flowers.

711
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,667
Buy flowers?

712
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:54,959
Bo Hai.

713
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:56,792
I want you to make a bunch of flowers for me.

714
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,375
A bunch of flowers for love.

715
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:00,626
A bunch of flowers for loveless.

716
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:02,709
Are you in love?

717
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:04,375
Don’t I look like in love?

718
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,459
Although I have always

719
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,042
shown myself as a rigid,

720
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:08,959
serious and

721
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,375
unsmiling man.

722
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,083
I am also

723
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,918
a gentle

724
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,918
and emotional man.

725
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,083
I take him as a friend,

726
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,292
and he wants to make a move on me.

727
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:20,000
How absurd!

728
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:20,709
I want him

729
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:21,709
to give up entirely.

730
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,125
I’m looking for you

731
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,125
to be my florist

732
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:25,792
because I think

733
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,501
you know me best.

734
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,792
Bo Hai, you should know

735
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:30,584
how I feel.

736
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,542
We are not that close.

737
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:34,709
Wrong! We are the same.

738
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:36,292
We are

739
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,501
poor people in love.

740
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:39,959
We are the same.

741
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,292
We both have a

742
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,042
love burden that we want to get rid of.

743
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,292
We have been in love with them

744
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,250
for so many years.

745
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:47,292
When we summoned up the courage

746
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:48,834
to express our love to them,

747
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,999
all they said was

748
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,083
“you are insane”.

749
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:53,876
Since there is no result,

750
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,459
it’s better to get out as soon as possible,

751
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:56,959
which is good for everyone.

752
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,209
When Xinyan rejected me,

753
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,292
my heart was broken.

754
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,083
You love Zhou Xinyan?

755
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:26,292
Zhou Xinyan?

756
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,209
My bouquet theme

757
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:56,959
is eternal love.

758
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:07,792
My theme is

759
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,459
mourning love.

760
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:20,918
You said that

761
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:22,709
excellent flower art works

762
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,083
are emotional sustenance

763
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,125
with strong emotional expression

764
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,042
and healing power.

765
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,375
I think I can definitely

766
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:30,501
beat you this time.

767
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:32,709
Do you dare to accept my challenge?

768
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,250
I’ve never lost.

769
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,918
It’s not disgraceful to lose

770
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,167
to such a lovely girl as me.

771
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,980
= You’ve been unfriended =

772
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,918
How can he blacklist me?

773
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:23,375
Let’s wait and see.

774
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,250
I will make you cry and beg me

775
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,292
to add you as a friend.

776
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:41,667
Unrequited love

777
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:42,667
is the most stupid thing

778
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:43,792
in this world.

779
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,876
I can’t be that stupid any more.

780
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:47,876
Have you been told

781
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,167
that you look funny now?

782
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,125
I need to stop this

783
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,250
unrequited love.

784
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:54,792
Let’s get a battle.

785
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,375
You will definitely fail.

786
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:57,459
Go away

787
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:58,626
before you

788
00:36:58,751 --> 00:36:59,501
get hurt.

789
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,542
This would be my final advice

790
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,584
as your friend.

791
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:02,792
Don’t talk tall.

792
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:04,250
As long as I stick to it,

793
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,626
you will fall in love with me

794
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,292
sooner or later.

795
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:10,000
You are insane.

796
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:10,751
Xinyan,

797
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,375
even if I give up the whole world,

798
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:13,792
I won’t give up you.

799
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,209
Your lines are too much.

800
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,626
What about changing some lines next time?

801
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,167
Baoni, Baoni, coffee!

802
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:37,000
Baoni, nuts, nuts!

803
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:38,417
Don’t please

804
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:39,501
me anymore.

805
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,167
I am into someone.

806
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,834
Baoni, we made up our minds

807
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:44,709
to you.

808
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,334
Even if you refuse us,

809
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:47,999
we won’t give up chasing you.

810
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:48,751
Right,

811
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,167
you can like the one you like.

812
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:51,542
We will still like you.

813
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,999
We won’t interrupt each other.

814
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,751
The one I like is in the company.

815
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:56,959
He will be angry if

816
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,083
you behave like this.

817
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:00,167
No way, Baoni,

818
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,667
you can’t always refuse us

819
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:02,542
with the same excuse.

820
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,584
Is it real this time?

821
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,417
Tell me who is he?

822
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,501
He is…

823
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,167
Please help me press the 3rd floor, thanks.

824
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:27,542
Yi, help me press the 3rd floor.

825
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,792
Mo Nan, listen,

826
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,292
from now on,

827
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:47,584
you are the enemy

828
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:48,375
of all men in company.

829
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:49,417
Remember it.

830
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,860
= Success Is Not By Chance Li Ka-Shing =

831
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:07,292
Ling Guoliang.

832
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,375
Wait, wait.

833
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,250
I want to tell you something.

834
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:12,542
I have thought about it.

835
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,542
It’s not reliable

836
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:15,876
to let Qi cure Bo Hai.

837
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,167
Think about it.

838
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,501
License is needed even if

839
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:19,542
curing a cat or a dog,

840
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,209
much less than a person, right?

841
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,709
So we can’t

842
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,042
allow Qi do it.

843
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:25,292
What if she

844
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,667
treats Bo Hai worse?

845
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:28,000
Or something bad happened?

846
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,792
You think too much.

847
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:32,709
I know

848
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:34,375
the disease can’t be cured by anyone.

849
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:35,876
I said that in the morning.

850
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,667
I want to encourage Qi.

851
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,083
Why don’t you tell me!

852
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:40,792
It’s the first time that we

853
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:41,626
thought the same

854
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:42,459
over the past years.

855
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:44,876
The son of Mr. Xue in second building

856
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,000
works in the hospital.

857
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,626
Can we ask him to introduce an expert

858
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,125
to cure Bo Hai?

859
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,042
No need.

860
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:52,209
I already found someone.

861
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,042
Really?

862
00:39:59,125 --> 00:39:59,751
See?

863
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,167
Specialists in solving every

864
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,250
difficulties in love, such as

865
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:04,334
cheating,

866
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,375
and lying.

867
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:06,417
All can be solved.

868
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,167
What magic medicine?

869
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,709
Quiet.

870
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,292
Love amulet.

871
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:12,250
It is very useful.

872
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:13,417
I gotta go.

873
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,667
I prepared a long speech

874
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:38,542
to make you happy.

875
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:39,417
But look at you!

876
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:41,292
You’re lively so soon!

877
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,209
I shouldn’t have wasted my time.

878
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,918
Sure. Who am I?

879
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:47,584
By the way,

880
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:48,918
are you still going to chase Mo Nan?

881
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:51,000
After all this time,

882
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:52,167
I fall in love with a man.

883
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:53,709
If I fail to be with him,

884
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,334
how humiliating!

885
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,125
Where have you got to?

886
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:58,626
Tell me about it.

887
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,209
Today, in the company,

888
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,083
I officially announced that

889
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,542
I like Mo Nan.

890
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:08,292
I believe the strong public opinion

891
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,417
and mental suggestion

892
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:10,959
will directly influence

893
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,626
Mo Nan’s feelings,

894
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,751
so that he will gradually

895
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,292
fall in love with me.
