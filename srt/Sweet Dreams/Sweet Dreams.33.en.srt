51
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,459
For this bad flower incident,

52
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,542
if we fail to

53
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:47,000
fully explain about it,

54
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,417
there’ll be consequences.

55
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:49,959
The company’s reputation

56
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,626
we’ve been maintaining

57
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:51,626
for years

58
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,918
will be ruined.

59
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,167
We’ll no longer

60
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,709
establish ourselves in this industry.

61
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,667
And it’s so strange

62
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,375
that they even released

63
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,542
what happened to Yunhe Flower Shop.

64
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:02,083
They’re leading the public opinion

65
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,709
in a wrong direction.

66
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,709
The one behind all this

67
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:08,000
should be the one

68
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,501
that sent me the express.

69
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,417
If I guess correctly,

70
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,000
that man is with DREAM.

71
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,250
But how did he know

72
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,375
what happened

73
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,501
twenty years ago?

74
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,417
And he also knew

75
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,918
you would be assaulted.

76
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,375
I just figured out that

77
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:22,417
Xingli Flower

78
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,918
was deeply in debt

79
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,375
before doing business with us.

80
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:26,250
Without the help of

81
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,292
other powers,

82
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,209
Huang Xingfa couldn’t have

83
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,584
cornered the flower market.

84
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:30,918
What was worse,

85
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:32,417
Huang Xingfa

86
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,125
fooled so many flower shops

87
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,626
with bad flowers,

88
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,250
except us.

89
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,167
He wanted to pass the buck to us.

90
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,250
You mean Huang Xingfa has

91
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,083
set a trap for us

92
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,250
since the very beginning?

93
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,542
Yes. One more thing.

94
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,250
After the incident happened,

95
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,334
someone on the Internet named CJ

96
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,542
kept breaking the news that

97
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,542
Bo Hai and Huang Xingfa

98
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:55,542
were close friends.

99
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:56,918
She also exposed that

100
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,999
Bo Hai was Lu Yunqing’s son.

101
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:02,334
In this way,

102
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,834
we can hardly vindicate ourselves.

103
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,083
Wasn’t it the day

104
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,167
when we ordered flowers from Huang Xingfa?

105
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,375
Oh, I remember.

106
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:17,876
I was drunk.

107
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,792
When I went to the toilet,

108
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:19,999
I knocked into a girl

109
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,167
and her camera fell on the ground.

110
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,501
Could she be CJ,

111
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,292
the informant?

112
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,334
If you guess correctly,

113
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,083
she’s the only clue

114
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,209
we have now.

115
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:31,167
Chen Mo.

116
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,918
Find out the girl,

117
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,167
whatever it takes.

118
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:34,999
Okay.

119
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,125
By the way,

120
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,292
something else is more urgent.

121
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:39,292
Those small flower shops’ owners

122
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,417
formed a right-defending group,

123
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:41,792
asking us for compensation.

124
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,459
What we want is simple.

125
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:49,375
You must compensate us

126
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,459
for all losses,

127
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,125
and make a public apology.

128
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:53,709
We refuse!

129
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:54,876
Don’t go too far!

130
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,083
Do you think we’re pushovers?

131
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:56,834
Yeah!

132
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,042
We feel truly sorry

133
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,542
for your losses

134
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:00,709
and we will help you.

135
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,584
But for an unwarranted charge,

136
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:04,501
we’re not going to apologize.

137
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,375
You claim that

138
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,334
you have nothing to do with this incident.

139
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:09,334
But all evidences show that

140
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,584
you’re behind it.

141
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,918
We didn’t know

142
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,167
your CEO Mr. Bo

143
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,417
was Lu Yunqing’s son.

144
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,501
What Yunhe Flower Shop did

145
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:17,626
was so mean!

146
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,209
Bo Hai is just like his mother.

147
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,542
Don’t talk nonsense.

148
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:21,999
Yunhe Flower Shop has nothing to do

149
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,083
with our company.

150
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:24,542
Director Zhou.

151
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,709
This is the truth.

152
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:27,667
The way you reply

153
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,417
doesn’t help to solve the problem.

154
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:31,667
In this problem,

155
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,083
we’re the victim, too.

156
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,125
Huang Xingfa and the one behind him

157
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,042
were the offenders.

158
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,209
So, everybody,

159
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,584
please give us more time

160
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,792
to vindicate ourselves

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,417
and to bring justice to you.

162
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,209
She means they’re not solving it?

163
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:43,751
Yeah.

164
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:44,792
What do we do?

165
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,167
Well, we’re not going to wait

166
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,000
without a deadline.

167
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,250
Two days.

168
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,999
You have two more days.

169
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,459
If you still can’t show us the evidence by then,

170
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,876
you’ll be sorry.

171
00:04:59,167 --> 00:04:59,709
Okay.

172
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,980
= Monitoring Center of Millennium Hotel =

173
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,420
Stop!

174
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:12,876
It’s her!

175
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,667
Can’t see her face clearly.

176
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,959
Is this the best we can get?

177
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:17,792
Yes.

178
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,999
The answer is zero, then.

179
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,125
By the way,

180
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:23,334
do you have the surveillance video

181
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,167
for the garage?

182
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:24,876
Yes.

183
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,584
Okay. Let me check.

184
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:34,709
Car number.

185
00:05:58,999 --> 00:05:59,375
Sir.

186
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,042
What would you like?

187
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:05,709
Sir.

188
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,375
Sir.

189
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,209
What would you like?

190
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,083
Coffee, please.

191
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,125
Waitress.

192
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,709
Where is the bathroom?

193
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,542
Go straight and turn left.

194
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:27,751
Thanks.

195
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,584
You must be CJ.

196
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,334
Don’t be scared.

197
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:45,959
We just want a talk with you.

198
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,167
I have nothing to talk with you.

199
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,083
You know what?

200
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,792
Nothing is absolute.

201
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,375
Before we found you,

202
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,083
we made a research.

203
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,375
The bank statements

204
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,709
clearly show that

205
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,709
there are transactions

206
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,167
between you and DREAM.

207
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,125
Tell me!

208
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:09,542
Did DREAM

209
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:10,167
hire you

210
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:10,792
to slander us

211
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,959
on the Internet?

212
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,042
What the hell do you want?

213
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,792
It’s simple.

214
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,292
As long as you vindicate us

215
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,334
by admitting that

216
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,250
you forged the evidence

217
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,375
and instigated the public opinion,

218
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:21,751
we’ll not pursue

219
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:22,959
your act of slander.

220
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,020
= Contact =

221
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,083
Why don’t you answer it?

222
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,501
What if there’s an emergency?

223
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,792
It must be

224
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,042
one of my relatives.

225
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,959
They keep asking about our gossip.

226
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,459
They nearly

227
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,834
blow up my phone.

228
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,792
I read some posts

229
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,751
on the Internet

230
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:45,876
with a lot of details.

231
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,417
Do you think

232
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,834
Mr. Bo really did that?

233
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:50,667
Can he be

234
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,876
Lu Yunqing’s son?

235
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:53,125
What nonsense are you talking about?

236
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,918
I was just kidding.

237
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,000
Mo Nan.

238
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,167
Do you think

239
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,334
Bo Hai is innocent?

240
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,375
No one knows

241
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,459
the truth.

242
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:15,834
Since the Flower Association

243
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,334
has begun the investigation,

244
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,709
we’ll wait and see.

245
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:21,834
Oh,

246
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,626
Qi said we didn’t need to help in the shop

247
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,000
because the Valentine’s Day was over.

248
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,375
I have something else to do. See you.

249
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,209
Director Zhou. Secretary Chen.

250
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:07,751
Manager.

251
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,167
We’re leaving then.

252
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:09,709
Okay.

253
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:10,375
You had a long day.

254
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,167
- See you tomorrow. - Bye-bye.

255
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,375
Be careful on your way. Bye-bye.

256
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,999
Manager, everything is cleaned up.

257
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:14,876
I’m leaving, too.

258
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,250
Okay. Thank you. See you tomorrow.

259
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:16,667
Bye-bye.

260
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:17,584
Be careful.

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,542
Good news.

262
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:48,542
Everything is ready

263
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,542
for the news conference.

264
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:50,999
We have hidden

265
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:51,999
the informant

266
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,709
in a very safe place.

267
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,209
DREAM will never

268
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:56,250
find her.

269
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,709
Well done! Thank you.

270
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,167
However hard they rack their brains,

271
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,626
they’ll not expect us

272
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,292
to find out the informant.

273
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,292
Hope everything will die down

274
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,501
after tomorrow.

275
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,042
Isn’t he the fraud?

276
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,626
Yes. Yes. It’s him.

277
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,042
It’s him!

278
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,000
The dishonest businessman!

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,375
He sold bad flowers!

280
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:18,292
Yes. Yes.

281
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,490
- We can’t judge a man by his appearance.
- Sold bad flowers?

282
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,209
But he looks so handsome!

283
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:23,750
= Dishonest =

284
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,459
There are all kinds of fish in the sea.

285
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:26,959
Yeah.

286
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,542
Whatever we do,

287
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,417
we should be cautious.

288
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:29,167
Yes.

289
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:30,876
What the hell did he do?

290
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:31,626
So many dishonest businessmen!

291
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,334
Yeah, they’re in power.

292
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:34,417
What?

293
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:35,501
What is she doing?

294
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:36,542
Why is she wiping?

295
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:38,834
Yeah.

296
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,584
What does it concern her?

297
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:44,667
Why is she wiping for him?

298
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,125
Maybe she’s his friend.

299
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:47,626
She must be a bad guy, too.

300
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:00,334
Hello? Who is that?

301
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,709
Mr. Bo, I’ve heard a lot about you.

302
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,626
You must be with DREAM.

303
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,375
It’s smart of you.

304
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:10,459
Unfortunately,

305
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,459
you still have weaknesses.

306
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,000
What do you mean?

307
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,000
I hear you took away

308
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:16,792
one of our guys.

309
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,042
I’ll deal with you in the same way.

310
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,542
I’ve prepared a surprise

311
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,292
for the girl you like.

312
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,042
I’m warning you!

313
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:25,626
Come to me if you dare!

314
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,042
Don’t hurt anyone else!

315
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:29,792
Hello?

316
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:01,359
- What are you doing? - Thank you, sir.

317
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,375
Wait a minute.

318
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,042
All right. It’ll be okay soon.

319
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,834
Sorry.

320
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,083
Some accident over here.

321
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,000
Please wait.

322
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:08,999
When can we go?

323
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,167
In a minute! In a minute!

324
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,125
What are you doing over there?

325
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,000
It’ll be okay!

326
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:12,792
Sorry. Sorry.

327
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,709
Hurry! Hurry!

328
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,542
Why is your hand hurt?

329
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:36,334
It’s okay.

330
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:37,125
What happened?

331
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:38,626
I was just walking,

332
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,083
but why did a flowerpot fall?

333
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,501
Go! Have your hand bandaged.

334
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:43,417
Weird.

335
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,417
It was a little warning.

336
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,417
If you insist on

337
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,667
holding the news conference,

338
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:02,999
I’m not sure

339
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:04,542
if there will be

340
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,125
similar accidents.

341
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,584
Thank you for saving me.

342
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,501
For you,

343
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,292
it doesn’t matter at all.

344
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:38,667
Didn’t we agree

345
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,375
not to bring it up again?

346
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,626
Sorry.

347
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,709
All right, then.

348
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:52,876
Are you taking revenge?

349
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,125
Remember to change it.

350
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,250
I’m getting down.

351
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:01,959
I’ll help my dad with the accounts.

352
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,000
Qi, you’re back.

353
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,292
We got these for you.

354
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,375
These companies are recruiting florists.

355
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,125
Come and see

356
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,209
if you want any job.

357
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,375
Mom, what are you doing?

358
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:33,083
Look what a mess

359
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,292
in your company.

360
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,626
You should find a new job.

361
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,918
Or you’ll have no income.

362
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,740
= Hangzhou Greenhouse Co., Ltd. =

363
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:39,918
Mom, could you stop

364
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,542
finding me another job?

365
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,083
Our company is going to be okay.

366
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,626
And I’m not going to find a new job.

367
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:47,876
Qi.

368
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,792
Don’t be ungrateful!

369
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:53,834
Our daughter is grown up.

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,334
She has her life to live.

371
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,375
She knows how far to go.

372
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:57,667
Calm down.

373
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,334
Our daughter is just

374
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,459
as stubborn as you.

375
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:02,542
Neither of you

376
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:03,626
keeps me from worrying.

377
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,792
Neither of you!

378
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:11,999
Mr. Mo.

379
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,542
Everything has been handled.

380
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:14,792
I think

381
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,125
Bo Hai will have a sleepless night.

382
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,209
I’m sorry about CJ.

383
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:22,501
I didn’t know

384
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:23,834
they could find her so fast.

385
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,083
If Bo Hai still

386
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,542
cares for Qi,

387
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,042
his company

388
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,000
will lose everything,

389
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,209
as we have planned.

390
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,125
Be careful next time.

391
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:42,209
I see.

392
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,334
For this bad flower incident,

393
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,334
if we fail to

394
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:53,792
fully explain about it,

395
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,250
there’ll be consequences.

396
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:56,542
The company’s reputation

397
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,542
we’ve been maintaining

398
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:58,375
for years

399
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,542
will be ruined.

400
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,542
We’ll no longer

401
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,000
establish ourselves in this industry.

402
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,709
I decide to like you.

403
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,417
I need no one else to take responsibility.

404
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:09,999
Also,

405
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,584
no one else

406
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:12,417
can change my mind.

407
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,876
If you insist

408
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,876
on holding the news conference,

409
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:20,918
I’m not sure

410
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,459
if there will be

411
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,999
similar accidents.

412
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:38,501
Hello?

413
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:39,292
Hello?

414
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,292
What’s up?

415
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,125
Nothing.

416
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,000
I saw many missed calls

417
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,125
from you.

418
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,667
I thought there was something wrong.

419
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:58,250
I’m fine.

420
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,292
Everything is okay.

421
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,834
I’m fine, too.

422
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,999
I just worry about you.

423
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:09,584
I’m doing okay.

424
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,167
I gotta go, then.

425
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:12,918
Wait a sec.

426
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:14,918
Bo Hai.

427
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:18,542
Everything will be all right.

428
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:19,250
Won’t it?

429
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:49,042
It’s okay. Carry it out.

430
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:49,918
Yes, Director.

431
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,751
The bad flower incident

432
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:53,876
has a major impact

433
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,501
on our company.

434
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,375
Hope we can...

435
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,375
Director Zhou, please have a look.

436
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,417
Okay. Go carry it out.

437
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:10,999
Okay.

438
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,083
Hope we can...

439
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:14,709
Director Zhou,

440
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,709
Mr. Bo wants to see you.

441
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:18,125
Continue the meeting.

442
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:25,334
We took all the trouble

443
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,209
to find the witness,

444
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:27,751
and the news conference is ready.

445
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:28,918
Why are you going to

446
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,250
give up the chance to vindicate yourself?

447
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,167
You know what?

448
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:34,209
I don’t think

449
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,584
they dare to

450
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,999
hurt Ling Lingqi.

451
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,751
They just threaten us.

452
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,584
I don’t care

453
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:41,834
if they mean real or not.

454
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:42,918
I can’t let Ling Lingqi

455
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:44,250
take the risk.

456
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,083
But...

457
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:50,250
the deadline

458
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:50,959
we promised the shop owners

459
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,000
is coming.

460
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,000
If we cancel the news conference

461
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,125
at this time,

462
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,042
we can hardly vindicate ourselves.

463
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:02,626
Bo Hai.

464
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,459
We built FlowerPlus with painstaking care

465
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:05,709
over years.

466
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,042
You should

467
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,083
care for Ling Lingqi,

468
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:09,876
but you should also

469
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:10,999
care for all loyal employees

470
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,584
in FlowerPlus.

471
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,250
I know.

472
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,667
I owe you.

473
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,125
I’ll make it up for you later.

474
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:20,834
But the decision

475
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:21,667
to cancel the news conference

476
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:22,751
will not be changed.

477
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:24,250
Oh,

478
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:25,542
don’t tell anyone else that

479
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:26,751
DREAM threatened me

480
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,334
with Ling Lingqi.

481
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:33,959
I’ll go check on her.

482
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,834
DREAM really has

483
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:42,876
a useful trick!

484
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,667
Ling Lingqi is

485
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:44,709
the bane of Bo Hai!

486
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,042
He is always vigorous

487
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,292
in work.

488
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:47,959
But he’s a coward

489
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,709
when it comes to Ling Lingqi.

490
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:49,792
Even heroes fall for beauties.

491
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,000
Why are you walking so fast?

492
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,209
To communicate with the media.

493
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:53,250
Under the command of Mr. Bo,

494
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,209
I must do the legwork.

495
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,042
What hard work!

496
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:57,876
Have a lollipop

497
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:58,792
to replenish yourself.

498
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,459
Didn’t we make a deal?

499
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,125
But Director Zhou just said...

500
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,167
Attention, please.

501
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:04,501
The news conference is cancelled.

502
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:06,417
Cancelled?

503
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,125
But why?

504
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:10,584
Mr. Bo has

505
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,375
his own plan.

506
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,626
Stop gossiping!

507
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,125
Clean the room up.

508
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:16,999
Okay. Fine.

509
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,083
Latest information says that

510
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,334
the news conference

511
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:26,876
FlowerPlus had planned to hold at two

512
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,667
is suddenly cancelled.

513
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:29,709
The media and the public

514
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:30,751
are surprised.

515
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:31,667
FlowerPlus gives

516
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,083
no explanation so far.

517
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,542
We believe the decision

518
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,876
will be more harmful to FlowerPlus

519
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,042
in the eye of the storm.

520
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,876
I thought the problem would be solved

521
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,584
after the news conference.

522
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,626
But it’s cancelled.

523
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:47,834
Did anything bad happen?

524
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,083
Why are there

525
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,626
so many stickers out there?

526
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,125
Let’s go remove them.

527
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,850
= Monopolize the Flower Market Bo Hai =

00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:38,167
Congratulations.

529
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:40,584
It’s a complete victory.

530
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,834
I didn’t expect

531
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:47,417
Bo Hai to give up this chance

532
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,584
just for Ling Lingqi.

533
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,501
What? Having sympathy?

534
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:57,250
Absolutely no!

535
00:21:58,918 --> 00:21:59,542
As your senior,

536
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,042
I must remind you.

537
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,542
There is no turning back.

538
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,292
We’ve come so far.

539
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:06,417
Don’t give up.

540
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:07,999
We mustn’t let Bo Hai

541
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,667
make a comeback.

542
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,709
Don’t worry.

543
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,751
I’ve got everything ready.

544
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,125
This time,

545
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:16,667
Bo Hai will have no chance

546
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,042
to fight back.

547
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,918
Whatever you do,

548
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,083
DREAM and I

549
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,042
will be your strongest support.

550
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:27,459
Come in.

551
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:32,584
This is

552
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,918
the love lunchbox

553
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Ling Lingqi made for you.

554
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:39,959
Why do you stare at me?

555
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,292
Don’t get me wrong.

556
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:42,542
I didn’t sell you out.

557
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,375
Ling Lingqi made it for you

558
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,709
on her own initiative.

559
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,751
You don’t even meet her.

560
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:52,751
But she still made a lunchbox

561
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,083
and cooked soup

562
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,167
for you.

563
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,209
Why don’t I have this kind of treat?

564
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,751
I’m touched,

565
00:22:58,918 --> 00:22:59,999
though I’m an outsider.

566
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,501
Why are you still so indifferent?

567
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:02,834
Since you’re touched,

568
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:03,918
enjoy the lunch.

569
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,209
What are you talking about?

570
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,626
I don’t dare!

571
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:08,751
I know

572
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:09,792
I’ll have retribution

573
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,000
if I break a couple.

574
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,417
But look at you!

575
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,834
Funny!

576
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,626
To protect Ling Lingqi,

577
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,167
you even gave up our company.

578
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,667
But now,

579
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,834
you refuse to admit it.

580
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,501
And you insist that

581
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,751
you don’t want to see her.

582
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,626
Why are you so stubborn?

583
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:24,667
What brings you here?

584
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,334
You’ve been avoiding me.

585
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,083
If I don’t come to you,

586
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,876
I guess I can’t even see you this year.

587
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:32,918
You’re exaggerating!

588
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,876
What bad luck I have!

589
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,542
You refused to be my girlfriend.

590
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:39,876
And even my friend.

591
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,292
Aren’t I miserable?

592
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:47,792
Qi.

593
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,417
Are we still friends?

594
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,042
Sure.

595
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,000
Promise me.

596
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:55,751
Don’t avoid me, will you?

597
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:05,999
I know

598
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,000
something will make you unhappy.

599
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:13,834
But I still want to tell you.

600
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:17,042
You shouldn’t

601
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,292
waste your time on Bo Hai.

602
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,042
The employees think

603
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:23,709
he has been framed up.

604
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,000
But there is no smoke without fire.

605
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:27,501
It’s true that

606
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:28,542
he’s Lu Yunqing’s son.

607
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,167
Whatever Lu Yunqing did

608
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:32,999
has nothing to do with Bo Hai.

609
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,125
I don’t want you to have prejudice

610
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,083
against Bo Hai.

611
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,083
Qi.

612
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,334
I know

613
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:38,751
you always think of others positively.

614
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,792
That’s not wrong.

615
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,959
But people are different.

616
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:41,626
You...

617
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,167
Look!

618
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,292
This time,

619
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,042
maybe Bo Hai is innocent.

620
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,792
But what about his feelings for you?

621
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:52,709
He said he cared for you.

622
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,459
But he can give you nothing.

623
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,167
Isn’t it worse than not caring for you?

624
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:57,209
Could you shut up?

625
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:57,709
I...

626
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,792
Okay. I’ll say no more.

627
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,417
I just don’t want you to be hurt.

628
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:18,667
Qi!

629
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,167
I’ve communicated with the media.

630
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,709
What is happening

631
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:41,584
is very bad for us.

632
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,209
Almost all media blame us.

633
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,792
Even some media

634
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:45,667
in a good relationship with us

635
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:46,626
refuse to release positive news

636
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:47,667
for us.

637
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:50,584
I just knew

638
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:51,918
a shop in the west of the city

639
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,000
has been smashed

640
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:53,834
by angry flower shop owners.

641
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,834
Tomorrow morning,

642
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,042
the deadline for two days

643
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:57,918
is approaching.

644
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,250
If you fail to explain,

645
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,959
the shop owners will hunt you down.

646
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:05,334
I don’t think

647
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:06,250
we should give up

648
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,292
the evidence from CJ.

649
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,876
Stop bringing her up!

650
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:10,876
I have an idea.

651
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,250
Why don’t we ask HR Department

652
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,417
to find you two masters

653
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:15,542
as your body guards?

654
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,250
Shut up!

655
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:17,375
All right.

656
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,501
I have an idea.

657
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,083
Maybe it will help.

658
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:22,876
Xinyan.

659
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:24,083
Go communicate with

660
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,709
the flower shop owners.

661
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:33,792
I just want to advice you.

662
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:35,167
Don’t waste your time

663
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:36,375
on me.

664
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:38,709
No matter how long you wait

665
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,709
or what you do,

666
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,999
I will never change my decision.

667
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,959
He said he cared for you.

668
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,751
But he can give you nothing.

669
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,083
Isn’t it worse than not caring for you?

670
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:55,709
Oh, dear!

671
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,834
What’s in the soup?

672
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,417
Spicy gluten!

673
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:07,292
Why is it in the soup?

674
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,792
Is it the wicked cuisine

675
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:10,751
she specially made for me?

676
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,626
On behalf of FlowerPlus,

677
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,209
I just went to the Trade and Industry Bureau

678
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,334
with you guys

679
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:52,667
and complained about the deceit that

680
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:53,834
Xingli sold bad flowers at high prices.

681
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,292
We also submitted relevant evidence.

682
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,626
I believe it won’t be long

683
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,042
before the Trade and Industry Bureau

684
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,542
gives a fair judgement

685
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,751
on this matter.

686
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,209
Everybody, now you can see

687
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,667
we’re really trying to help.

688
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,334
We urgently hope

689
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,834
the truth will be found out soon.

690
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:11,167
So far as I can tell,

691
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,083
someone must have

692
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,083
shifted the blame on us,

693
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,584
to cause conflicts

694
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:17,584
between us.

695
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,626
Even if someone shifted the blame on you,

696
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:20,667
we were also

697
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,584
incriminated by you.

698
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,125
Exactly. Speaking of this,

699
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:23,959
we suffer the most.

700
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:24,999
We suffer the most!

701
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,292
You’re right.

702
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,459
As the market leader,

703
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:29,792
we decide to

704
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:30,918
sell you the roses

705
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,042
which were recently imported

706
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:34,042
with 50% off

707
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,209
the purchase price,

708
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,042
as the compensation for you.

709
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,459
What do you think?

710
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:43,042
50% off the purchase price?

711
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,459
In consideration for

712
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,501
transportation and storage cost,

713
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:47,709
you will

714
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:48,876
lose a lot.

715
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,209
We will.

716
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,167
But compared to you,

717
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,125
we still have a chance

718
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:55,250
to handle the losses.

719
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:56,751
This is

720
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:57,876
what we can do

721
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,876
to help you.

722
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:00,709
- It’s okay. - I think so.

723
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,167
What do you think?

724
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:03,667
Okay.

725
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:03,999
Yes.

726
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:04,834
No problem.

727
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I’m okay with it.

728
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:08,375
Okay. Mr. Bo,

729
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:09,334
we accept your offer.

730
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:11,375
This time,

731
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:12,584
hope nothing will go wrong

732
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:13,542
during the process.

733
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,459
So many hairpins! How cute!

734
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:21,042
Look!

735
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:23,834
This is nice!

736
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,667
Feels like a cat girl.

737
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:28,792
Does it look good?

738
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,083
Little demon.

739
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:35,501
Taro balls! Yes!

740
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:37,042
Put in many taro balls.

741
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,375
Okay. Okay.

742
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:39,999
Thank you.

743
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:43,709
Doesn’t taste that good.

744
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,292
Thank you, Baoni.

745
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,292
I no longer

746
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,292
feel that bad.

747
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:54,209
You’re welcome.

748
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:55,751
Good friends help each other

749
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,042
to get over the difficulty, right?

750
00:31:59,167 --> 00:31:59,959
Do good friends

751
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,626
keep no secrets from each other?

752
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:02,709
Sure.

753
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,876
What if

754
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,501
the secret makes the other one unhappy?

755
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:11,999
Qi.

756
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:13,000
It’s getting late.

757
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,292
Why don’t we go back home?

758
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:16,250
Baoni.

759
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,125
I have something to tell you.

760
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,918
Talk later.

761
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,209
Oh, I just remember.

762
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,459
I have a date tonight.

763
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,292
I gotta go.

764
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:28,209
Wait, Baoni.

765
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:30,042
I must

766
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,334
tell you about it now.

767
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:34,250
There’s always no secret

768
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:35,751
between us.

769
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:37,959
I can’t keep it from you.

770
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,209
Qi, stop!

771
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,417
Baoni, you know Mo Nan...

772
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:48,918
I ask you to stop!

773
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,709
I know what you’re going to say!

774
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:00,751
You want to tell me.

775
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,417
Mo Nan likes you,

776
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:06,626
instead of me.

777
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,584
I want to tell you,

778
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,667
because I don’t want to hide anything from you.

779
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:17,125
Yeah.

780
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:20,375
I knew it.

781
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,459
It’s hard...

782
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,542
It’s hard to keep pretending.

783
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,000
I must pretend

784
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I know nothing about it.

785
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:31,501
But you insist on

786
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:32,334
telling me about it.

787
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,709
Once you do,

788
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,417
how can I face you

789
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:41,626
or face Mo Nan?

790
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,209
Baoni, scold me.

791
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:46,918
Or punch me.

792
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:47,542
Come. Punch me!

793
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:48,417
Qi!

794
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:50,918
You do nothing wrong.

795
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:53,751
Nor does Mo Nan.

796
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That’s why

797
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,375
I’m feeling worse.

798
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,584
I don’t know who I should be angry with

799
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:04,751
or who I should blame.

800
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,792
I’m the one to blame.

801
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,918
I used to

802
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,626
be careless in love.

803
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:19,751
So, Mo Nan is sent from God

804
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,834
to punish me.

805
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:23,501
You’re wrong.

806
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:24,542
Don’t think like that.

807
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,751
Leave me alone.

808
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:32,459
Baoni.

809
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:54,501
Secretary Chen.

810
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:55,584
Here are

811
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:56,334
all imported roses.

812
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay.

813
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:58,876
These flowers

814
00:34:58,918 --> 00:34:59,876
are purchased in our name.

815
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:00,709
But they’re sold to

816
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:01,834
different flower shops.

817
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:03,000
You must be careful.

818
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:03,542
It concerns

819
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:04,375
our reputation.

820
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:05,501
Okay. Don’t worry.

821
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:06,918
Before eight tomorrow morning,

822
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:07,959
all the flowers

823
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,417
must be sent to our storehouse.

824
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:10,083
Okay.

825
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,083
Go. Carry them up.

826
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:12,999
Ask them to handle the flowers gently.

827
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,918
Don’t damage any.

828
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:16,083
Don’t worry.

829
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,042
Baoni is so nice to me.

830
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,959
But I made her cry.

831
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:34,626
And Bo Hai…

832
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,292
He doesn’t want to talk to me.

833
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:43,834
How stupid I am!

834
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,626
I fail to do anything well!

835
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,501
Son, what are you doing?

836
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:50,250
Here.

837
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,083
Dad.

838
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,375
It smells so bad!

839
00:36:58,584 --> 00:36:59,667
It must be awful!

840
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,959
When you grow up,

841
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,918
you can drink with me.

842
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,999
By then,

843
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,375
we will enjoy ourselves!

844
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:13,667
Come.

845
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,083
Let’s go to bed!

846
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,876
Go! My son! How heavy you are!

847
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:32,999
Dad.

848
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:37,542
A toast to you!

849
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,542
Boss, bad news!

850
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,042
The imported roses for those shops

851
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,626
went missing!

852
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:28,501
How come?

853
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:29,542
Something is wrong

854
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:30,417
with the transport company!

855
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:31,584
The driver was fake!

856
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:32,876
We can’t contact him!

857
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:34,959
Tell Xinyan

858
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,709
to go and find substitutes.

859
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:37,167
Okay.

860
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:38,209
Go!

861
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,060
= Chairman of the Board =

862
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:47,959
Hello?

863
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,334
Mr. Bo, hope that you are all well.

864
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:53,918
You did it again, didn’t you?

865
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,584
Do you think

866
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,584
our company will just wait

867
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,626
and do nothing?

868
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,000
You managed to calm

869
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,042
the flower shop owners down.

870
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:03,167
We also can manage to

871
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:04,501
make you

872
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:07,042
shoot yourself in the foot.

873
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,250
Qi, what are you coming for?

874
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:19,334
Isn’t there a meeting?

875
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:20,626
It’s canceled.

876
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:21,876
Didn’t you see the notice?

877
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,501
No.

878
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:23,751
Maybe I didn’t notice it.

879
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:24,918
I heard

880
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,209
something happened.

881
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,417
Secretary Chen, what happened?

882
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:32,876
The imported roses for flower shops

883
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,626
went missing.

884
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,334
Finally, we calmed the shop owners down

885
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,000
and sold them flowers with losses.

886
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:39,709
If something goes wrong

887
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:40,876
this time,

888
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,667
all our efforts will be wasted.

889
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:43,375
No.

890
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:44,959
We’ll have worse consequences.

891
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:46,834
What… What can we do

892
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:47,834
to make up?

893
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:48,918
Bo Hai and Zhou Xinyan

894
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:50,125
have gone to find substitutes.

895
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,125
I just heard

896
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:52,042
a new batch of flowers

897
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,667
arrived at the neighboring city Anzhou.

898
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,167
I’m going to try my luck.

899
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,542
Well, stay here.

900
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:57,542
I’ll go take care of this.

901
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,083
It’s raining hard. Be careful!

902
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:00,667
Okay.

903
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,209
Marketing Department has sent guys

904
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,459
to calm the shop owners down.

905
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,584
Let’s try somewhere else.

906
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:10,209
Try to find some other flowers.

907
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,375
Okay. Take it easy.

908
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:14,209
Chen Mo just called.

909
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:14,999
He said someone was sent to

910
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:16,042
the neighboring city Anzhou.

911
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:17,876
Even if it’s raining,

912
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:18,959
she can go and come back

913
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,334
within a day.

914
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:23,375
Here is news for

915
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:24,834
the latest road conditions.

916
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,417
There was a landslide

917
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:27,626
in the south of Anzhou National Highway.

918
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:28,751
It has caused

919
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:30,083
several serious car accidents.

920
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,167
Hope all drivers can...

921
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:32,334
Who did Chen Mo send to Anzhou?

922
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:34,834
Ling Lingqi.

923
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:35,876
It’s slippery on rainy days.

924
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:36,999
Drive carefully!

925
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,584
Stop!

926
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,000
Bo Hai, calm down.

927
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,334
It’s raining hard!

928
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:55,125
You don’t know what happened.

929
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,459
Let Chen Mo go for you, okay?

930
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,834
Bo Hai!

931
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:07,292
Hello? Chen Mo!

932
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,292
Bo Hai went for Ling Lingqi!

933
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,375
Go find him!

934
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,000
Sir.

935
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,292
Under the premise of safety,

936
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,292
please drive faster.

937
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,542
We’re in urgent need of the flowers.

938
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:47,417
Okay. All right.

939
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,709
Take it easy. I’ll try my best.

940
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:49,667
Okay.

941
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,626
