00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:50,042
Here.

84
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:51,918
Careful, it’s hot.

85
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,876
Have some sleep.

86
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:14,584
Sleep.

87
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,375
I don’t want to.

88
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,334
I’m afraid if I fall asleep,

89
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,459
you’ll disappear again.

90
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,167
I won’t.

91
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,417
I was at the dock

92
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:31,959
delivering flowers,

93
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,501
not leaving.

94
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,999
Just stay with me for a little while.

95
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,334
Just a little while.

96
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:53,792
Sleep.

97
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:13,417
Move.

98
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,626
What a meal!

99
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,667
But what do you usually make for me?

100
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:21,792
Noodles with pickles.

101
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:25,751
You’re putting gals before pals.

102
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,209
He’s not.

103
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,417
He’s respecting his teacher.

104
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,083
I taught him all this.

105
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,792
Looks like you two have

106
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,250
a pretty convoluted story,

107
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,292
probably missing tens of thousands

108
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:44,584
of words here.

109
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:46,167
Eat your food.

110
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,000
I’ll take care of the flower stand today.

111
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:54,626
You just stay with

112
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,584
Miss Ling.

113
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:09,792
When I’m free,

114
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,918
this is where I like to come.

115
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,292
Facing the ocean,

116
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:14,999
although there are no spring flowers,

117
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,375
you can put your head empty,

118
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,375
and forget all the troubles.

119
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,709
You don’t have to carry a load

120
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,792
or run for your life.

121
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,918
Insipid life

122
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,999
but simple happiness.

123
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,375
In fact, the little happiness we often

124
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,375
talk about

125
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,876
is right around us.

126
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,000
We just don’t have

127
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,292
the time to really

128
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:44,417
feel them.

129
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,125
Actually…

130
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,250
There was a misunderstanding the other day.

131
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:55,209
I…

132
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:56,459
I know.

133
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,375
I already knew that.

134
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:01,709
At the time,

135
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,042
I was lost.

136
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,083
Then I calmed down and thought about it,

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,626
I think I know

138
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:10,876
what happened.

139
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:14,876
It’s all my fault.

140
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,000
You must hate me.

141
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,125
How could it be your fault?

142
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,584
I never hate you.

143
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,417
I only hate myself.

144
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:33,959
It was my own incompetence

145
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,000
that made it so.

146
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,167
Come back.

147
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,042
We’ve been waiting for you for a year.

148
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:46,292
When you get back,

149
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,959
we can start over together.

150
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:55,876
I told you

151
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,834
I’m not going back.

152
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,626
I’m a failure,

153
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,083
both in love

154
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,501
and in business.

155
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,667
So don’t waste your time.

156
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:15,959
Who are you to say

157
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:16,834
you’re incompetent?

158
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:18,501
Everyone’s been waiting for you

159
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:19,751
at the company for a year.

160
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,542
Now you’re saying you’re incompetent.

161
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:22,999
And you said

162
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,501
you found your little happiness.

163
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:25,125
Are you taking responsibility

164
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,209
for all of this?

165
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,334
How can you be so selfish?

166
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,709
Yes, I am being selfish.

167
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,125
Then tell me,

168
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:31,751
how can a man

169
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,042
with no sense of color

170
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,083
lead you to

171
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,042
defeat DREAM and reclaim FlowerPlus?

172
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,250
My color vision

173
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,209
hasn’t returned since that day,

174
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,584
and I’m afraid it never will.

175
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,209
That house is empty.

176
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,083
Uncle Zhou has been moved by William.

177
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:13,792
It’s not gonna be easy

178
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,083
to find him again.

179
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,959
Looks like we acted rashly and alerted the enemy.

180
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:22,209
I tried calling

181
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,167
my source

182
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,250
on William,

183
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,209
but I couldn’t get ahold of him.

184
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:27,167
I think

185
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,250
William found out about him.

186
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,250
We were too impatient.

187
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,209
We let the enemy know

188
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,125
our pace.

189
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,292
Hold everything off for a while.

190
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,375
Let’s see what happens.

191
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,042
What?

192
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,660
I’ve worked hard for the company

193
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:46,900
for three years.

194
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,700
= Layoff List =
for three years.

195
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,209
I can’t believe they’re firing me.

196
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,459
It’s too arbitrary.

197
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,709
They are laying people off so suddenly.

198
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,542
Right.

199
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:54,501
I haven’t paid

200
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,751
my mortgage this month.

201
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,542
Firing so many people out of blue.

202
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:58,417
I don’t know what the company

203
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,334
was thinking.

204
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:00,751
This is too much.

205
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,250
They promised to wait till Ling Lingqi

206
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,792
get back from the supplier meeting.

207
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:04,792
How could they go back on that

208
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,250
and fire 30 people so suddenly?

209
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:06,999
There’re only

210
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,417
80 of us in the headquarters.

211
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,417
Liu Yingjie is so hateful!

212
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,999
He has no work ethic at all.

213
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:12,918
What can we do?

214
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,000
How could they do this?

215
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:14,876
Wait for me!

216
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:44,334
Oh, right.

217
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,709
Here’s Longjing Tea
picked before Qingming Festival.

218
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,584
Would you like some?

219
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:49,501
Mr. Liu,

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,417
why is there a sudden layoff?

221
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:53,709
Sudden?

222
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,459
You all know the situation.

223
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,792
We can’t make ends meet.

224
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:05,792
How to save cost without laying off staff?

225
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,000
Ling Lingqi has found a supplier

226
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,417
at a good price, which will

227
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,792
greatly reduce the cost of procurement.

228
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,167
Why do we have to lay off the staff?

229
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:12,501
The savings in Ling Lingqi’s

230
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:13,584
procurement cost were

231
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,751
not enough to cover the company’s losses.

232
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,167
I thought we had a meeting

233
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,417
about this.

234
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,250
Also, her negotiations with the supplier

235
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,876
were approved by you.

236
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,876
The market changes quickly.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,626
The company’s going downhill.

238
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,584
I’ve done a rough calculation

239
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,000
of the losses of several branches.

240
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,459
If there are no layoffs,

241
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:33,751
there’s only one way to go,

242
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:35,501
and that’s bankruptcy.

243
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,375
Business isn’t charity.

244
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,375
It has to be profitable.

245
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:44,959
I think I got the message.

246
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,918
You’re determined to downsize.

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,584
And you can do whatever you want.

248
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,083
You’re cold-blooded!

249
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,626
Director Zhou, Secretary Chen.

250
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,792
Mind your manners.

251
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,876
I wouldn’t mind

252
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,083
adding a few more names to the list.

253
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,667
What’s the matter, Chen Mo?

254
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,000
When are you coming back, Qi?

255
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,375
I might need a few more days.

256
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:40,709
I’m here to discuss

257
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,250
a rather important strategic partnership.

258
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,250
Forget about partnership.

259
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:45,375
Liu broke his promise

260
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,667
and suddenly decided to lay off staff.

261
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:47,375
What?

262
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,459
How could he suddenly go back on his word?

263
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,417
Calm down.

264
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:55,417
When I get back,

265
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,542
we’ll figure something out.

266
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:57,375
Okay.

267
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:11,167
Something on your mind?

268
00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:16,792
Bo Hai

269
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:18,876
has stayed here for a year,

270
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,626
and all he does every day is drink and stare.

271
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,417
If I hadn’t been kind enough

272
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:25,501
to keep him here

273
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,501
and give him a job,

274
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,334
he’d be

275
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,250
a mess by now.

276
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,584
Actually,

277
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:34,876
the sky

278
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,250
is higher here than in the city.

279
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,125
The stars here are brighter than that in the city.

280
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,209
Away from the world,

281
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,334
it is cozy.

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,876
But

283
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,125
he is not happy.

284
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,751
He has been here for a year,

285
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,709
selling flowers and stocking every day.

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,667
He won’t

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,584
talk to anyone but me

288
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:54,834
and the kids.

289
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,876
You call that cozy?

290
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,709
Right, he hid something

291
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,876
like a treasure.

292
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:02,918
I’ll find it for you.

293
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,876
Well, look.

294
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,584
These are for floriculture, right?

295
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:31,959
Why would he do this?

296
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:32,999
Unbelievable.

297
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:38,834
Are you crazy?

298
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:39,751
I am crazy!

299
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,918
You’re numbing yourself.

300
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,999
You don’t even belong here,

301
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:42,584
Bo Hai.

302
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:43,751
So what?

303
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,834
The old Bo Hai was a florist.

304
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:46,626
But now,

305
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:47,626
he’s just a color-blind

306
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:48,751
flower vendor.

307
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:52,709
I just want to live my life

308
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,918
in peace.

309
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:55,959
I couldn’t save anyone,

310
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:57,999
myself included.

311
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,000
Bo Hai!

312
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:44,999
Each flower

313
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,501
in the moment it was cut off

314
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,459
from the branch,

315
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,209
its fate seems to have been doomed.

316
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:52,876
They will bloom in the bottle

317
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,792
in its final brilliant life.

318
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,125
After that comes death.

319
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:01,751
But some flowers

320
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,125
are not at the mercy of fate.

321
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,250
At the moment when the flower falls,

322
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:10,167
it reveals a new fragrance.

323
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,334
A life without imperfection

324
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,042
is imperfect.

325
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,584
We come to this world

326
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:27,292
not to be

327
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,083
a simple perfect angel,

328
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,501
but to feel the ups and downs,

329
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,542
partings and reunions.

330
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:35,918
Although the flowers are beautiful,

331
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,000
the tenacious show of the new life

332
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,000
let life shine out

333
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,626
more dazzling bright.

Mr. Liu, I heard FlowerPlus is going to

347
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,876
lay off a third of the staff, is that true?

348
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:36,459
It is said that there are even

349
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:37,751
pregnant employees on the layoff list.

350
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,959
How do you explain that?

351
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:40,876
FlowerPlus has been struggling

352
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,083
since it was acquired by DREAM.

353
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:42,792
Anything you’d like to say

354
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,501
as a president?

355
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:44,334
Friends from press,

356
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,751
I’m sorry that

357
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,042
we don’t have time

358
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,042
for your interviews today, okay?

359
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:48,584
Say something.

360
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:49,334
Please explain.

361
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:00,125
I don’t know who

362
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,250
tipped off the reporters

363
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,501
about the layoffs.

364
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,667
Isn’t that just a layoff?

365
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,083
Why are these reporters

366
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,584
making such a big deal out of it?

367
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:09,584
Boss.

368
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,501
Well, with all the media attention,

369
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,876
do you want

370
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:15,626
to hold off on the layoffs?

371
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:29,667
Mr. Stone.

372
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,584
As for the layoff,

373
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:36,959
it is a business necessity.

374
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,417
As you know,

375
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,167
FlowerPlus has had

376
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,918
a very bad year at home.

377
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:49,751
Okay, I get it.

378
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,709
Of course

379
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,375
I will obey the headquarters.

380
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:03,292
Is everything all right?

381
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,792
Headquarters received

382
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,083
a letter from the staff,

383
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,999
and said in the large-scale layoffs,

384
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,876
there are serious management loopholes,

385
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,167
causing very bad

386
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,167
brand damage and public opinion.

387
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,417
We’re asked to stop the layoffs immediately.

388
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,380
= Notice =
= Layoff List =

389
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:22,459
- What? - What’s that supposed to mean?

390
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:23,250
What’s going on?

391
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:24,584
Did you hear?

392
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:25,626
The layoffs have been

393
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,999
called off at DREAM headquarters.

394
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,375
Really?

395
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:28,834
It’s true.

396
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,709
My mortgage!

397
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:33,751
It seems the foreigners

398
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:35,292
still know right from wrong,

399
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,334
unlike that William.

400
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,000
We

401
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,751
dodged a bullet on this one.

402
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:42,292
I heard

403
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:43,417
someone called

404
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:44,083
the press.

405
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:45,709
Really?

406
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:46,417
Someone else

407
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,209
wrote an anonymous letter to HQ.

408
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:49,334
Who is it?

409
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:49,959
Who is it?

410
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,417
I don’t know.

411
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:53,042
Was it you?

412
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:55,709
No, you...

413
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,334
What are you looking at me for?

414
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,542
It’s not me.

415
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:01,959
Well, whoever it is,

416
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,209
he’s the man to thank for this.

417
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,042
Right.

418
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:10,542
Let’s make a toast

419
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:11,334
to our hero.

420
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:12,918
Cheers!

421
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:13,667
Cheers!

422
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,834
Start a press campaign,

423
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,542
then use headquarters to shut him down.

424
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,459
Ling Lingqi,

425
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,167
we’ve all seen

426
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,709
how far you’ve come this year.

427
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:29,542
I don’t want to flatter you,

428
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,125
but your methods,

429
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:33,792
I’ll bet Xinyan’s head

430
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:34,876
that I wouldn’t have thought of them.

431
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,125
Chen Mo.

432
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,083
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

433
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:41,334
I didn’t

434
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,459
come up with that.

435
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:48,792
Is there someone behind the curtain?

436
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,042
Where have you been?

437
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,209
You just left without saying!

438
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:30,626
Do you have any idea

439
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,959
what we’ve been through?

440
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,167
You said

441
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,709
brothers for life!

442
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:40,834
I’m sorry.

443
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:44,459
Oh, my goodness.

444
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:45,959
Am I dreaming?

445
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:55,292
Come.

446
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,584
Are you worthy of us, Bo Hai?

447
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,375
I have a lot of apologies

448
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,417
and guilt.

449
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,459
I’m the one to blame.

450
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,626
But I’ll save

451
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:24,876
those apologies

452
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,250
for later.

453
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,209
What’s important now

454
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:29,709
is that we find a way

455
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,250
to deal with Liu Yingjie.

456
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,876
Yeah, we’re still here.

457
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,709
The company’s still here.

458
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,209
Now that Bo Hai is back,

459
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:39,209
shouldn’t we

460
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,083
be happy?

461
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:42,501
Right.

462
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:51,125
We’ve

463
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,042
waited a year for this day.

464
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:58,959
Come on.

465
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,250
I’m so happy today.

466
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,542
This year we really

467
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,000
suffered a lot of injustice,

468
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,459
but now it’s different!

469
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,042
Our boss is back!

470
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,209
We’re stronger than ever!

471
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,542
Commander in chief, say the word!

472
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,334
Talking about stronger,

473
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:20,667
we still need a general.

474
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:50,959
What are you doing here?

475
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:52,292
Baoni

476
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,667
told us all about you.

477
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:57,918
Then you must hate me.

478
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:01,417
Our parents

479
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,834
were business partners.

480
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:06,751
If nothing had happened,

481
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:10,751
we would have been

482
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,584
like-minded brothers.

483
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,999
I’m sorry.

484
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,334
I don’t accept your apology.

485
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,918
After what you did to me,

486
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:29,834
you’re just gonna

487
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,501
write me off with a sorry?

488
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,334
You have every right to want more.

489
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,167
Whatever I can give you,

490
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:39,918
I’ll make it up to you.

491
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:42,751
I don’t need any compensation.

492
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,042
Men make up for

493
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:47,667
their own mistakes.

494
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:49,709
Mo Nan.

495
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,501
Come with me and take back FlowerPlus.

496
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,792
You think I don’t want to?

497
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,834
All this year,

498
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,250
I’ve been thinking about

499
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,751
how to deal with Liu Yingjie.

500
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,375
But not only

501
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,584
did I fail,

502
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:08,918
I compromised the people around me.

503
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,334
You should know more about William than I do.

504
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,667
He’s like a time bomb.

505
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,083
Every day we don’t get rid of him,

506
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:18,999
he threatens us.

507
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,792
In face of such an enemy,

508
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:21,959
compromise and concession

509
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,584
will only put yourself and those around you

510
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,918
in danger.

511
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,667
The only way to do

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
is throwing that bomb into a secure area

513
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,375
and detonating it as soon as possible.

514
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,626
Call me when you’re ready.

515
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:37,417
I’ll be waiting.

516
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,751
Look who it is.

517
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:20,584
What?

518
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,083
You scumbag,

519
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,042
what are you doing here?

520
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,042
Uncle.

521
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:24,834
Wait a minute.

522
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,125
Please don’t call me uncle.

523
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,417
I have nothing to do with you.

524
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,292
- I want… - What?

525
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:34,042
Are you

526
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,334
after our Qi again?

527
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:39,083
Uncle, I…

528
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:39,834
Dad.

529
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:45,876
Qi.

530
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:48,375
Come up and talk.

531
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:51,834
I’m sorry, uncle.

532
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,792
Don’t be silly, Qi!

533
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:59,083
You have to see him for who he really is!

534
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:08,000
Qi.

535
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:11,042
I know you don’t want to talk to me.

536
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:16,999
I already know about your story.

537
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:18,834
I’m sorry.

538
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,584
But I’m not here

539
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,542
to ask you to forgive me.

540
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:29,167
Because I’ve done

541
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:29,959
so many wrong things.

542
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:30,792
I have no right

543
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:31,792
to ask your forgiveness.

544
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:38,417
I’ve come to tell you that

545
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,417
I’ve decided to join forces with Bo Hai

546
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,876
against Liu Yingjie.

547
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,542
Bo Hai’s right.

548
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:48,584
Maybe it’s the only way

549
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:51,167
I can make up for

550
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,083
some of my mistakes.

551
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,125
He’s back now.

552
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:01,000
You’re back together.

553
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:01,459
I…

554
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,042
I’m happy for you.

555
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,125
I wish you happy.

556
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:20,876
That’s all I have to say.

557
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,125
Take care of yourself.

558
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:32,542
Wait.

559
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,709
The hyacinths we planted together

560
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:53,334
are in flower now.

561
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,792
The purple hyacinth represents

562
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,334
forgiveness and understanding.

563
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,542
Bo Hai, tell me about your plan.

564
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:40,751
For a year,

565
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,792
Liu Yingjie had no interest

566
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:42,709
in running the company.

567
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,584
Company’s performance went from bad to worse,

568
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,250
and its share price fell in a row.

569
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:48,459
And all of this

570
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,459
just created an opportunity for us.

571
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,999
Now, led by Mo Nan,

572
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:54,959
we split up, in the name

573
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,542
of a number of small companies,

574
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:57,459
to buy a lot of

575
00:36:57,626 --> 00:36:59,042
FlowerPlus’s shares on the secondary market.

576
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,042
Mo Nan will be in charge of the pace,

577
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,834
trying not to draw attention.

578
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,792
What are you doing?

579
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,292
Come, come.

580
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,751
You’ll see.

581
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:20,167
Okay.

582
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:20,834
Are we there yet?

583
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:22,000
Here we are.

584
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,209
One, two, three.

585
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:30,709
You...

586
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:32,083
I don’t know

587
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,542
what happened to me that night.

588
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,334
I was dying to get this poster

589
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,459
back.

590
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,334
I later learned that

591
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:42,501
this was the exact time

592
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,751
you were going to leave.

593
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:47,918
But

594
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:49,876
no matter how I looked for that piece,

595
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,292
I couldn’t find it.

596
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:55,501
Wait here.

597
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,220
= When Immortal Flowers Meet French Romance =

598
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,620
= FlowerPlus =

599
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:24,584
How…

600
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,792
How could you have it?

601
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,834
You’re the missing piece

602
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,918
of my life.

603
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,709
The roses are especially in bloom this year.

604
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:49,000
Rose Eden

605
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,083
has been flowering for three months.

606
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:52,626
They say

607
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,167
it’s probably to celebrate

608
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,083
my promotion.

609
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,792
I’m the director now.

610
00:38:58,334 --> 00:38:59,918
You must be happy for me, too.

611
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:02,667
Director?

612
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:04,709
Looks like while I’m gone,

613
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,459
they’re letting the promotion

614
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:07,959
slide.

615
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:09,751
What slide?

616
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:11,042
I am now

617
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,375
the main strength of the company, okay?

618
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,042
Okay.

619
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,250
There are some small daisies

620
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:19,999
on the lawn outside the company.

621
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:22,792
I miss you.

622
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,083
The daisy represents

623
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,417
the love hidden in the heart.

624
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,501
But if I have another chance,

625
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,125
I will never hide my love for you

626
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,125
in my heart again.

627
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,626
I’m gonna tell you how I feel again.

628
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:41,083
To share…

629
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,250
Stop it.

630
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:42,918
… my most beautiful secret

631
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:44,250
with you again.

632
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:45,918
To show you

633
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,167
just how much I love you.

634
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:49,709
No, don’t read that.

635
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:50,292
I can’t even remember

636
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,417
when I wrote it.

637
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,999
Why is it so mushy?

638
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:10,584
I love you, Qi.

639
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,959
Not just for the way you look,

640
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,083
but for the way I look

641
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:17,999
when I’m with you.

642
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,918
I love you,

643
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,709
not just for what you’ve done for me,

644
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:26,292
but for what

645
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,501
I can do for you.

646
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:31,792
Because you pass through

647
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,417
the wilderness of my heart

648
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:35,417
as easily as

649
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:38,292
the sun through the crystal.

650
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:05,667
This is it.

651
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:06,918
It’s a beautiful day.

652
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:07,709
Of course.

653
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:08,918
It’s a good time to be at sea.

654
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:11,667
Why

655
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:12,876
the boat isn’t here yet?

656
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:14,417
What’s the hurry?

657
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:15,667
It’s not time to fish yet.

658
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,626
Let’s put them all here.

659
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,042
Give me a hand.

660
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:25,626
