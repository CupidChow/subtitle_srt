OK,

52
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,501
I’m telling you.

53
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:54,375
We

54
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,542
just want to amicably express

55
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,417
our concern for you.

56
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,792
Amicably?

57
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,834
We were a bit anxious.

58
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,375
And a bit excessive.

59
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,167
Don’t cut in.

60
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,417
You want to

61
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,626
show your concern?

62
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:15,626
You’re like

63
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,751
a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey.

64
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,125
Show your concern?

65
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:19,792
You’re right.

66
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:20,709
We were

67
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,501
a bit excited at that time.

68
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:24,667
You were

69
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,334
embarrassing me.

70
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,209
Little girl,

71
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,042
if you’re so easily to be embarrassed,

72
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,667
how can you

73
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,834
get your Prince Charming?

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,918
Let me ask you.

75
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,709
Since when

76
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,083
did you make

77
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,751
such a progress with Bo Hai?

78
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,709
How can I meet him tomorrow?

79
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,667
I’m so embarrassed.

80
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,417
Your mom really scratched Bo Hai?

81
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:10,999
I heard

82
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,667
the legend of your mom.

83
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,292
But I’ve never seen it with my own eyes.

84
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:18,459
Last night

85
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,626
must be exciting.

86
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:20,959
Wish I were there.

87
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:24,999
I’m here to ask

88
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:25,542
for your help,

89
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,167
not telling stories.

90
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,250
What shall I do to heal

91
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,083
Bo Hai’s psychological trauma,

92
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,918
so he can love me?

93
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:38,584
Excuse me.

94
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,959
I got an appointment. I’m leaving.

95
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:40,999
Wait,

96
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,042
it’s about my lifetime happiness.

97
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,542
What kind of friend you are!

98
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,667
I can’t make any help

99
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,667
on this.

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,584
I

101
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:53,959
support you spiritually.

102
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,250
That’s it?

103
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:09,417
As for the

104
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,876
technical support,

105
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,417
it’s on me,

106
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,083
Lu Baoni, the stunner.

107
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,167
Boss, this is

108
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,334
the marketing scheme for next month.

109
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,042
This is your breakfast and lunch.

110
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:30,792
It’s all here.

111
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,042
What is that?

112
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:51,584
This… Well…

113
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,751
Say it!

114
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,959
A girl made it?

115
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:54,959
Ling Lingqi?

116
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:55,542
No.

117
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,918
Her mom did it.

118
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:00,459
This news

119
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,709
really shocked me, boss!

120
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,626
How could her mom

121
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:04,542
do that to you?

122
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:05,209
What wicked things

123
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,167
have you done to her daughter?

124
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,501
You got nothing to do?

125
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,334
Go check

126
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,334
last month’s financial

127
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,000
statement, hurry up.

128
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,876
Hey, I’m helping you

129
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,042
solve problems.

130
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:18,709
You always

131
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,501
keep it to yourself.

132
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,667
Don’t you feel oppressed?

133
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,375
Don’t I have to share it with you?

134
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,375
Threatening me, huh?

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,459
I don’t really care about it.

136
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,125
But if Xinyan sees it…

137
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,125
The thing you smear on your face

138
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,999
when you’re on camera,

139
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,209
can you borrow it to me?

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on.

141
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,751
What shall I do to heal

142
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:06,876
Bo Hai’s psychological trauma,

143
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,334
so he can love me?

144
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,584
Mr. Mo, where are we going?

145
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,209
We had many big difficulties

146
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,042
in these acquisition cases,

147
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:30,501
but I’ve never seen you

148
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,417
so worried before.

149
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:34,959
Is it

150
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,125
because of Ling Lingqi?

151
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,709
If you’ve been acting too long,

152
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:44,834
you’ll get used to the

153
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,125
people and things in the play.

154
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:49,999
You get to think

155
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,042
that’s your real life.

156
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,918
We never thought this case

157
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,250
would last so long

158
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,667
in the beginning.

159
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,792
I’ll calm down

160
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,334
and keep distance

161
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:06,334
with Ling Lingqi.

162
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,667
That’s good for both of us.

163
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:22,999
Speaking of appearance,

164
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,876
Qi, you’re prettier than me.

165
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,125
But why I am a stunner,

166
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:29,751
but you’ve been pursuing a guy

167
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:30,751
for so long but failed?

168
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,792
You don’t know how to flirt.

169
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:45,751
What are you doing?

170
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:53,709
Qi,

171
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,918
you know nothing about flirting.

172
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,417
Listen to me.

173
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:06,709
Flirting

174
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,626
is not just a single gesture or motion.

175
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:11,999
It’s a

176
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,292
mysterious temperament

177
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,709
emitting from within.

178
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:16,667
Of course,

179
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,334
it also is the basic skills in relationship

180
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,667
to take a preemptive opportunity.

181
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,459
We should start from appearance.

182
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:29,709
Men are visual creatures.

183
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,918
You gotta have

184
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,584
a feminine and

185
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,334
fascinating appearance.

186
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,125
This is our first step to success.

This is the activity schedule

232
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:22,501
for this season.

233
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,918
I think the marketing scheme

234
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,125
for next quarter is quite good.

235
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,626
You can follow it.

236
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:28,959
The activity department

237
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,417
attended in an international exhibition.

238
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:31,959
The digital marketing scheme

239
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,501
is in the design and making.

240
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,167
They’ve arranged six interviews

241
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,000
for you for this season.

242
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,292
I’ve settled with them.

243
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,459
Why you were in a hurry

244
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,459
yesterday?

245
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,334
It’s my private affairs,

246
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,375
do I need to report to you?

247
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,000
How could it be private affair?

248
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,209
You’re a workaholic.

249
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,501
What private affairs you have?

250
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,626
Were you dating a female colleague…

251
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,501
He’s with me

252
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,375
last night.

253
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:10,542
We were

254
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,375
having a sauna yesterday.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,667
He massaged me,

256
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,334
and I kneaded him.

257
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,292
Were we?

258
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,667
What a hobby you have.

259
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:26,751
Who massaged you?

260
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:27,876
Did you reveal this?

261
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:28,999
Let me see.

262
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,751
Powder more.

263
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:42,709
There is no reporter.

264
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:43,959
What are you powdering for?

265
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,751
Just to see you.

266
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:50,999
Nauseous.

267
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,667
Well, Chen Mo,

268
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,167
I found some errors

269
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,876
in last season’s

270
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,250
audit…

271
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,292
How’s it?

272
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:27,999
My look.

273
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:28,751
Not bad.

274
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:29,999
Not bad?

275
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,959
Look at their face!

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,292
That’s “not bad” to you?

277
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,167
Dress too long?

278
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,209
Lipstick not good?

279
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,459
Neither.

280
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,125
Actually I’m in hurry for a business trip.

281
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,918
I don’t have time to appreciate your look.

282
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,125
See you.

283
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:53,999
I think it’s nice.

284
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,083
Too boorish. Forget it.

285
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:11,876
Put it back.

286
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:28,667
What?

287
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:30,751
What the hell?

288
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:46,209
Boss,

289
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,167
these are the newly introduced

290
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,959
eight species of Austin Rose

291
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,000
from Europe.

292
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,584
These flowers are very popular

293
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,042
in Europe.

294
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:57,417
Come on,

295
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,751
take a look and leave.

296
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:00,792
Look good.

297
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,751
Pay attention to watering and ventilation.

298
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:03,375
They’re just seedling.

299
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:03,792
OK.

300
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,417
I must have forgotten to

301
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,751
check the almanac today.

302
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,792
Small mistake.

303
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,999
Don’t mind.

304
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,459
I don’t,

305
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,584
but he does.

306
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,709
I wanted to play

307
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:48,459
Miss Charming

308
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,459
and show myself in front of him.

309
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,834
But what I looked just then

310
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:51,999
was like a ghost.

311
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,709
No! Look at you now,

312
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,292
you’re like

313
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,501
a little fairy shinning again!

314
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,125
What to do?

315
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,209
Check this.

316
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,420
= Chairman Work Schedule =

317
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:08,417
What is it?

318
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,167
I’m playing my role

319
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,792
as an HR and helped you

320
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,417
get Bo Hai’s private whereabouts.

321
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,042
The third step to hook up
with your Prince Charming

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,542
is to cater to his pleasure.

323
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,042
This is a covert and effective

324
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,375
secret weapon.

325
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,542
People’s hobby

326
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,667
is always the point

327
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,709
which is easily to break through.

328
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,459
1 hour fitness at 7 o’clock.

329
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:37,751
Here’s your chance.

330
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,542
Dear goodness, he must see me

331
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:57,792
so miserable this morning,

332
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,334
so he gave me a

333
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,459
special gift tonight to

334
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,709
soothe my broken heart.

335
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:13,125
Hi.

336
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:16,501
How are you here?

337
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:17,876
Yeah.

338
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:20,209
Sorry for last night.

339
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:21,626
My parents mistook us.

340
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,167
It’s OK. I don’t mind.

341
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,501
You like fitness too?

342
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,959
I ate too much.

343
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,292
What’s your speed?

344
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,209
15.

345
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,834
15?

346
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,280
This is my first time

347
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:03,354
seen a girl runs 15.

348
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:05,751
Ling Lingqi,

349
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,167
you just brought

350
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,334
yourself a trouble.

351
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,375
Yeah, I’m used to it.

352
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:19,042
Come on.

353
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:21,999
How’s your neck?

354
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,542
I’m fine.

355
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,000
Forget it.

356
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,459
Just make every possible effort.

357
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,167
You all right?

358
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:12,792
Is this your first time

359
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,083
on a treadmill?

360
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:18,709
And you entered a speed

361
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,125
you can never reach?

362
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:21,959
And you didn’t even wear an emergency stop watch.

363
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:23,292
That one over there.

364
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,375
The small black clip.

365
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,375
Sprained your ankle?

366
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:41,876
Can you move?

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,626
Does it hurt?

368
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,751
Ouch.

369
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,209
And here. It hurts.

370
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:39,792
You leg?

371
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:42,584
Here?

372
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,125
Not here.

373
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,209
Here, it hurts here.

374
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:46,667
And your waist?

375
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,209
Did you sprain your waist?

376
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,918
I can’t move.

377
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:53,667
What to do?

378
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:54,501
Can you turn over?

379
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:55,459
OK.

380
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,334
Yeah, this is my first time on the treadmill,

381
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,751
and I embarrassed myself. So what?

382
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,292
This is just the essence of date.

383
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:08,375
Ouch…

384
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:12,542
It hurts.

385
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,792
The hand, so soft and gentle.

386
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,918
It’s a bit hurt.

387
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,334
Wait… Wait a minute.

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,626
Ouch…

389
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,209
No, it doesn’t hurt anymore.

390
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,918
No. Stop.

391
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,100
= GYM =

392
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,250
Wait, wait a minute.

393
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:07,584
What the hell.

394
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:08,375
I sacrificed so much

395
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,959
but got nothing.

396
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:12,000
I’m so out of luck!

397
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:20,876
What does that mean?

398
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,959
How can I be such unlucky?

399
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,334
You haven’t left yet?

400
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,999
Didn’t catch the taxi.

401
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,209
See you later in my home.

402
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,459
OK.

403
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:48,959
You left?

404
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,667
My waist is wounded, bro!

405
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,375
So is my leg!

406
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,751
And my heart! Bro!

407
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:10,125
Come.

408
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:19,209
Baoni, I’ve been pursuing

409
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,417
for over three years.

410
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:23,876
I never expected

411
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,626
you could be my girlfriend someday.

412
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,626
Just think that

413
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:31,709
you have won a lottery.

414
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:33,626
You’re right.

415
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,125
I think I’m the luckiest

416
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,459
person in the world.

417
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,459
How does it taste?

418
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:44,709
Very good, thanks.

419
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:45,250
Good.

420
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:46,751
Here, Baoni.

421
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,417
This goose liver was airlifted

422
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,459
this morning.

423
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,626
I ordered it especially for you.

424
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,542
Have a taste.

425
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,626
I’m on diet.

426
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,292
It has too much calorie.

427
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,417
I’d be a fat ass.

428
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,918
I bought it for you.

429
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:06,334
Have a look.

430
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:09,334
I’m sure you will like it.

431
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,876
The limited edition for this year.

432
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:34,501
It feels strange.

433
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,250
I should have loved it.

434
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:38,709
What are you saying?

435
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,501
You’re talking about that

436
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:41,999
or me?

437
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,209
Baoni,

438
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,292
take your time.

439
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,083
We’ve just started.

440
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:51,209
We need time

441
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,834
to get along with each other.

442
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:55,125
Here, one more drink.

443
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,501
This is an art concept plan.

444
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,125
This is the script, and that is original work.

445
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:03,667
The movie

446
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:04,792
A Chinese Ghost Story

447
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,167
is the highlight of the big star

448
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,167
He Minglang.

449
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:08,792
They ask us to be the floral designer,

450
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,209
so to get more gimmicks

451
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:11,167
in movie promotion.

452
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:13,918
Sounds pretty good.

453
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,751
Now movie promotion is

454
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,083
in the most popular time.

455
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,792
They promote their films,

456
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:19,751
and we take the opportunity

457
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,667
to promote our company.

458
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,167
Achieve two things at one stroke.

459
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:24,584
Kill two birds with one stone.

460
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,626
That’s it.

461
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:49,876
You had it coming.

462
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,375
This Ning Caichen clearly wanted

463
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:58,751
to have a wonderful encounter

464
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,167
before rushing to Lanre Temple.

465
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,709
Tell me, if you were him,

466
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,042
the temple is so gloomy

467
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:04,709
and people died in there,

468
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:05,501
will you live there?

469
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,000
You can’t say that.

470
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,834
If there is

471
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,542
a lively beauty Xiaoqian

472
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,751
waiting for me there,

473
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,834
I think I will.

474
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:12,751
So

475
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,042
he was simply tempted by beauty.

476
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:15,834
You know,

477
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,042
even if the monster kills him,

478
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,167
he had it coming.

479
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,459
What makes you

480
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:20,626
think of that?

481
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,584
People buy tickets to see

482
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,167
the story of a ghost,

483
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:24,834
who could think about

484
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,083
what made Ning Caichen

485
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,042
stay in the temple?

486
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,584
You are too sensible

487
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,834
and not romantic at all.

488
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:31,083
No wonder you’re still single

489
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,209
in such age.

490
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,834
You’re not single, isn’t it?

491
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,042
I’m afraid you feel alone.

492
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,209
Just admit it, no one likes you.

493
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:38,334
No one will love you!

494
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:39,375
You got endocrine disorders!

495
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,709
You freak Chomper.

496
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:07,792
Boss,

497
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,626
are you done?

498
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:13,834
Back to work.

499
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,820
= Lanre Temple =

500
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,626
Lanre Temple?

501
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:38,584
A Chinese Ghost Story!

502
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,000
Ning Caichen.

503
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:58,542
Caichen!

504
00:26:58,542 --> 00:26:59,999
It’s me, Nie Xiaoqian.

505
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:03,999
Caichen!

506
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,459
It’s me, Nie Xiaoqian.

507
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:08,792
Are Nie Xiaoqian’s clothes

508
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:09,876
white?

509
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:13,626
Wait for me.

510
00:27:15,605 --> 00:27:18,908
♪ How many ways in a sweet dream ♪

511
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:24,980
♪ Can you find your true love ♪

512
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,834
The plot next

513
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:26,751
is you flinging upon me,

514
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:27,959
not escaping from me.

515
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,125
OK, if you don’t do that,

516
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,042
I’ll do it to you.

517
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:44,918
What… What do you want?

518
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,501
What’s your name, pretty?

519
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,334
You know my name.

520
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,667
I forgot.

521
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,417
Don’t be afraid. I’ll protect you.

522
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:12,083
Look at me.

523
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:15,834
Ghost!

524
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,083
I’m a ghost.

525
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,876
But I’m a pretty and amorous ghost.

526
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:26,000
And I’ll be your girlfriend.

527
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,417
Granny is over there.

528
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:05,250
I’m Granny?

529
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:16,292
If I’m a ghost,

530
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:16,959
I must be Nie Xiaoqian,

531
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,459
how can I be a tree monster?

532
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:19,751
She got almost no scenes.

533
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:20,999
No one will know her existence.

534
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,125
Bloody Bo Hai, you’re the tree monster!

535
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,501
So is your whole family!

536
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:40,792
Is it suggesting me that

537
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:44,834
I’m only a costar?

538
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:54,999
Xinyan, what are you doing?

539
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:55,999
Discussing publicity video program.

540
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,167
Why come here?

541
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,292
It’s hot here.

542
00:29:58,292 --> 00:29:59,167
My fair skin

543
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,584
would get burnt.

544
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,000
Is Ling Lingqi

545
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,459
pursuing Bo Hai?

546
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,292
You got too many imaginary enemies.

547
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,375
Ling Lingqi.

548
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,083
She got many projects

549
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,959
to discuss with Bo Hai,

550
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,042
and that’s why

551
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:15,209
they’re always together.

552
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:17,667
I see.

553
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,125
Don’t do anything you would regret.

554
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,292
Ling Lingqi

555
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,501
is in unrequited love.

556
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,918
There are many girls

557
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:24,918
in love with Bo Hai.

558
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:26,542
You know Bo Hai.

559
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,626
He’s like a monk,

560
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,334
sexually continent.

561
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,834
You’re worrying for nothing.

562
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,209
I know she’s daydreaming.

563
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,667
But if those girls like her

564
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,751
gather around Bo Hai all day long,

565
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,834
he would get upset.

566
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,582
I gotta solve this

567
00:30:38,611 --> 00:30:39,474
big problem for him.

568
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:40,250
Move.

569
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,542
You’re solving this big problem

570
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,834
for yourself.

571
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:09,167
Hello?

572
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,042
I’ve washed your underwear

573
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:15,042
and put them

574
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,584
in the second drawer of the closet.

575
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:22,334
I also made you some bread.

576
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,209
It’s in your bag.

577
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:25,667
Don’t forget it.

578
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:28,501
No, I’m not tired.

579
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:31,792
Office romance, I understand.

580
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,209
And you’re the chairman.

581
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:35,542
Chairman?

582
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:36,667
Bo Hai?

583
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,167
I know people will gossip.

584
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,876
Zhou Xinyan and Bo Hai?

585
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:41,542
As long as you care for me,

586
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,709
I’ll be relieved.

587
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,918
I don’t care it’s secret love or not.

588
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:48,876
Secret love?

589
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,083
OK, bye.

590
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,459
No way!

591
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:26,250
Liar.

592
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:28,501
I don’t believe it.

593
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,417
Liar.

594
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:35,167
Liar.

595
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:38,083
Liar.

596
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,792
Baoni, I bought it to you.

597
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:42,626
Please keep it.

598
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:43,334
No.

599
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,792
David, I’ll say it again,

600
00:32:44,918 --> 00:32:46,375
I have a boyfriend.

601
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:46,999
I don’t believe it.

602
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:48,501
Believe it or not.

603
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:49,667
Baoni,

604
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:50,999
I won’t give up on you.

605
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,459
Don’t fool me with that.

606
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,501
Take it, Baoni.

607
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:55,209
Let go.

608
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:56,834
If you dare harass me again,

609
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,292
I’ll never talk to you anymore.

610
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,125
- No… - Harass?

611
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,709
That’s pursuing love bravely.

612
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,334
Yes, I am.

613
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,167
How to prove one loves someone else?

614
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,584
Yeah, how?

615
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,292
No proof.

616
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,375
Prove it.

617
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,125
Hello, director?

618
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:14,918
I’ll be in the meeting room soon.

619
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:16,918
I’ll get back to you later.

620
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,918
The company develops so fast

621
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,792
that all department managers

622
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,000
told me that

623
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:31,959
they’re short of hands

624
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,292
for current business.

625
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:34,626
So I think

626
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:35,999
we need to arrange

627
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:37,709
another official recruitment fair.

628
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,876
OK, I’ll make it done.

629
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:41,876
But I think

630
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,999
for some positions,

631
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,542
we can hire some part-timers

632
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,751
or interns,

633
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,709
which can relieve our pressure

634
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:50,834
in emolument.

635
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,042
OK, do as you say.

636
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:56,667
So we have no problems in year-end bonus.

637
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,834
- Baoni! - Baoni!

638
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,542
Are you all right, Baoni?

639
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,792
- Baoni? - Baoni?

640
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,417
Baoni, do you have a stomach problem?

641
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:06,918
Is it serious?

642
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,542
Could it be acute gastroenteritis?

643
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:10,751
Hello? 120?

644
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,918
We got someone fainted here.

645
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,167
Can you send an ambulance?

646
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:14,501
Yeah, FlowerPlus.

647
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,334
Hurry up!

648
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:16,334
Baoni, don’t worry.

649
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:17,667
The ambulance is here soon.

650
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:19,000
What happened?

651
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:20,375
She’s sick.

652
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:21,959
Sick?

653
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,417
You haven’t had lunch, have you?

654
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,876
No, I’ve gained

655
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:29,792
two catties this month,

656
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,042
I can’t eat anymore.

657
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:33,918
Low blood sugar!

658
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:35,999
Low blood sugar…

659
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,459
I have chocolate. I’ll go get it.

660
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:38,375
Hurry.

661
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:40,000
Your way to lose weight

662
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,042
is unhealthy.

663
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,626
And it bounces back.

664
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:51,792
You can’t skip lunch.

665
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,042
It will harm your body.

666
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,167
Have some hot water.

667
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,209
Baoni, chocolate.

668
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:56,999
How much does she need to take to

669
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,292
get the blood glucose normal?

670
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:01,626
Oh right,

671
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,417
I got

672
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:04,667
glucose tablets.

673
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,125
It helps blood glucose rise very fast.

674
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,375
Much better than chocolate.

675
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,250
What… What tablets?

676
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:21,375
You guys

677
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,250
never got to know Baoni at all.

678
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:24,626
How dare you said

679
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:25,959
you’re her super fans?

680
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:27,876
Who would believe it?

681
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,501
Well…

682
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,375
I got work to do, I gotta go.

683
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:36,083
It’s all your fault.

684
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:37,209
You only

685
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:38,209
care for Baoni’s appearance.

686
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,626
What about you?

687
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:41,000
Guessing her BWH all the day.

688
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,626
You…

689
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,292
Hello? 120?

690
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,501
No need for ambulance.

691
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,834
Since when

692
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,083
I can stop worrying about you?

693
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:53,542
I just got back from a trip,

694
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:55,167
and now I’m in your

695
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:56,459
emergency rescue.

696
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:57,584
Good.

697
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:00,626
Thank you.

698
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,334
Don’t.

699
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:03,667
Good sisters, are we?

700
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,417
But

701
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,626
if you’re to find a boyfriend,

702
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,751
you need to be careful.

703
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:12,834
None of them

704
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,083
are reliable.

705
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,167
I just got the news

706
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:25,792
that Bo Hai is the floral designer of

707
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,042
the movie A Chinese Ghost Story

708
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,167
specially invited by He Minglang.

709
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,584
Good.

710
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,292
He Minglang is the award-winning actor.

711
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,042
His movie will attract

712
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:36,375
high level of attentions.

713
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,584
So will Bo Hai.

714
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:40,751
But if something goes wrong,

715
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:42,542
those press and fans

716
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,918
will blame him for this too.

717
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:46,000
Mr. Wen,

718
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:47,209
I’ll arrange.

719
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:48,292
Let’s see if we have any chance.

720
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:48,792
OK.

721
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,083
Ling Lingqi,

722
00:36:57,501 --> 00:36:59,292
Mr. Bo asked you to go to his house

723
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,626
and get a file for him.

724
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:02,417
Me?

725
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:03,334
Yeah.

726
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,125
You helped him clean his house,

727
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:05,042
didn’t you?

728
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,501
He said you know where the file is.

729
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:08,792
OK.

730
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:12,999
Let’s go.

731
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,292
Go.

732
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:21,999
Excuse me.

733
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,042
Xinyuan’s contract.

734
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,751
Contract.

735
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:46,876
Aunt, I’m Mr. Bo’s assistant.

736
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:48,209
I’m here to find a file for him.

737
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,417
I won’t disturb your cleaning.

738
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,417
I’m leaving right away.

739
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,334
This is your file.

740
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:01,959
Bo Hai put it on the night table.

741
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,334
What? Scared you?

742
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:18,959
Since you’ve seen it,

743
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,083
I’ll tell you.

744
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:22,834
I’ve been in love with Bo Hai

745
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,292
for years.

746
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:26,918
We didn’t go public because

747
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:28,459
we’re afraid it would affect Bo Hai’s work.

748
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,167
Please keep the secret for me,

749
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:32,834
will you?

750
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:37,876
Your file.

751
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:46,834
Bo Hai, are you at home?

752
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,209
Hold it.

753
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:07,292
Hold it.

754
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,042
Hold it.

755
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:15,250
Ling Lingqi, don’t cry.

756
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,042
Be strong.

757
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:52,042
I have no chance.

758
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:54,667
Bo Hai and Zhou Xinyan

759
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:55,834
are together.

760
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:57,792
What?

761
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,083
Never thought Bo Hai is such a jerk.

762
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I thought the dark cloud above my head

763
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,709
has moved away.

764
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:06,000
My goodness.

765
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,375
You gotta

766
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,334
be kidding me.

767
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:11,626
It’s not funny at all.

768
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,042
Are you free these days?

769
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,375
Qi,

770
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:18,250
look,

771
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,918
you’re cute and adorable.

772
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:22,959
If Bo Hai doesn’t love you,

773
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,250
you still have someone else

774
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,999
waiting for you.

775
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,083
What are you worrying about?

776
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:31,417
I’m not particular about food,

777
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,667
but for love, I am.

778
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,250
But since it happened,

779
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,709
don’t be too sad.

780
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:43,959
I wish I were you.

781
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,042
In your whole life,

782
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,459
men are crying for you.

783
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:48,709
You don’t understand how I feel.

784
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,000
Ma’am, beer!

785
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,417
Take it easy.

786
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,375
OK.

787
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:03,834
Here.

788
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,918
Thanks.

789
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:06,542
It’s OK.

790
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,209
You say I don’t know how you feel.

791
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,375
No,

792
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,667
I didn’t.

793
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,000
But now

794
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,501
I understand it.

795
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,292
I’ve never been in love

796
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,375
with those guys,

797
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,167
so I never cared

798
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,167
about them.

799
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:27,334
You’re right.

800
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,209
I didn’t know love

801
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,626
before.

802
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,459
Now you do?

803
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:33,834
Because of Mo Nan?

804
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,375
Love is not sending gifts,

805
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,083
bags, or perfume.

806
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,334
It’s when you’re fainted,

807
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:47,292
he knew

808
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:48,709
you got glycopenia

809
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:51,584
and ran to the drug store

810
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,918
to buy you glucose tablets.

811
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,417
You’re stuck, really.

812
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,167
But it feels good.

813
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,042
Thanks to Mr. Mo Nan,

814
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,000
who’s finally subdued you little monster

815
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,667
for the sake of all guys in the world.

816
00:42:12,584 --> 00:42:13,709
Stop talking those jerks.

817
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:15,209
- Yeah. - Let’s drink.

818
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:15,626
Here.

819
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:16,999
Cheers.
