Oh no, Chomper!

00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:53,918
Trim the leaves

53
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,000
of these flowers.

54
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:56,125
Okay, Mr. Bo.

55
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:05,918
These gotta be finished.

56
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,542
Spray water evenly

57
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:07,417
on those flowers.

58
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,209
Okay, Mr. Bo.

59
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:37,876
Ling Lingqi, three days’ wages

60
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,375
deducted for neglect of duty.

61
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:43,667
What the hell!

62
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:45,626
I’m hidden well,

63
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,667
how can he see me?

64
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,042
He got a X-ray vision?

65
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:00,792
I’m done.

66
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,876
Three days’ wages.

67
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:08,125
Thanks.

68
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

69
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:18,792
Guard!

00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:20,542
Baoni.

71
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:21,417
- Baoni. - Leave it to me.

72
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:21,999
Leave it to me.

73
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:34,792
What are you doing?

74
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,667
There are two strong labors.

75
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:37,999
Are you silly?

76
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,417
They only help you

77
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,834
for some

78
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:42,209
ulterior motives.

79
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,959
Only your soulmate

80
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:46,542
would do anything for you

81
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,417
for nothing.

82
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,876
Cut the crap!

83
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:51,542
You don’t believe me?

84
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,000
Then there is no one to trust.

85
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,417
But you’re a girl,

86
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,709
better watch your behavior.

87
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,417
I’m a stunner,

88
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:01,417
shouldn’t I

89
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,209
create some imagination space

90
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,250
for those nerds?

91
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,292
I’m benefiting the society.

92
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,167
Why don’t you benefit the mankind?

93
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,918
Why are you here?

94
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:14,876
Vampire Zhou sent me to deliver some files.

95
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,167
Otherwise this is the last place I wanna go.

96
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,167
Hey bro, we can help.

97
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:22,209
Yeah.

98
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,918
They’re all mine. Don’t you ever think about it.

99
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:29,584
Niggard!

100
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,999
Such an ass.

101
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,542
Mr. Wen, I’ve checked around

102
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,459
the venue here.

103
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,918
What do you think,

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,709
if we add some

105
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:00,959
allium cowanii and miscanthus,

106
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,125
will it look better?

107
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,042
It’s a bit stiff now.

108
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:08,751
It’s you again, Ling Lingqi.

109
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:09,918
Don’t you know

110
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,125
your position here?

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,167
What makes you think

112
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,542
you can criticize my work?

113
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,501
Who does she think she is?

114
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,334
Just a flower remover.

115
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:31,459
Mr. Bo.

116
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,042
Hi, Mr. Bo.

117
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,876
Too many bright colors

118
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,083
make it stiff and rigid.

119
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,459
I think a few

120
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,918
white and green stripes

121
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,292
separating those colors

122
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:45,000
would be better.

123
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,459
Try allium cowanii and miscanthus.

124
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:50,209
Mr. Bo.

125
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,000
Someone just gave us

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,209
the same suggestion.

127
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:53,999
Is that so?

128
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:56,417
Go find that person.

129
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,292
My assistant is not good enough.

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,000
Replace her.

131
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:58,375
OK.

132
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,167
She’s a green hand.

133
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:02,334
And she’s

134
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,501
no florist.

135
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,250
I don’t care.

136
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,083
You can stay in FlowerPlus not because

137
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,000
who you are but what you can do.

138
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,167
Go.

139
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,709
OK.

140
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,000
Try allium cowanii and miscanthus.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,501
OK.

142
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:23,918
Come in.

143
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,667
Boss.

144
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:27,167
Boss.

145
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:29,334
She is

146
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,042
the special assistant

147
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,334
appointed by you,

148
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,959
who just gave some advice to Xiaofang,

149
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,792
our salesperson in Jixiang Road.

150
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:37,959
Her name is…

151
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:38,542
I know her.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,334
Special assistant?

153
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,125
It’s her again!

154
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,334
Destiny!

155
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,000
I should check on almanac

156
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,709
before going out.

157
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,209
You chose her by yourself.

158
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:06,918
Mr. Bo.

159
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,292
I’m sloppy and bad-tempered,

160
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,709
and too careless for such an important position.

161
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,250
Please give this chance

162
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,334
to other colleagues.

163
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:16,542
Start working.

164
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:22,834

You heard of this?

196
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,083
It is Ling Lingqi who is Mr. Bo’s

197
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,209
assistant now.

198
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,375
Oh my goodness!

199
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,709
What, what?

200
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,042
Did I hear it wrong?

201
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,250
They’re saying Qi is gonna be

202
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,125
Chomper’s assistant?

203
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:55,083
No!

204
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:56,667
Where are you going?

205
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,042
To save her.

206
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:58,959
How?

207
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,083
I don’t know yet.

208
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:06,209
Mirror Lake,

209
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,584
derived from the large scale painting

210
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:09,417
of Mr. Li’s.

211
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,083
It converts plane to solid,

212
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,709
virtuality to reality,

213
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,501
quite appealing.

214
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:15,667
Even if

215
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,375
the flower on paper,

216
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:18,292
makes you feel like

217
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,792
being there personally.

218
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,876
The wind, chirp, sunshine, rain and dew,

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,125
the exuberant vitality

220
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,501
in vibrant nature,

221
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,792
are what Mr. Li Qingzhu is delivering,

222
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:27,999
and also what FlowerPlus

223
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:28,709
wants to share

224
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,292
with the audience.

225
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,667
So convictive.

226
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:36,709
Such a pleasant voice.

227
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:39,834
And his look

228
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,292
is so gentle.

229
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:57,876
Watch out!

230
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,250
Am I dreaming?

231
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,000
No, definitely not.

232
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,667
Watch out the flowers.

233
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,542
So embarrassing!

234
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,083
Ling Lingqi,

235
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,584
why you’re always in bad luck?

236
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,501
Boss, isn’t it too cruel?

237
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:38,667
It seems hurt a lot.

238
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:41,542
Looks like I gotta find you

239
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,459
a new assistant.

240
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:49,250
What happened?

241
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,042
Does it hurt?

242
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:54,959
My heart was

243
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,334
just haunted

244
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,709
by Chomper.

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,542
Just haunted.

246
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:04,584
You know why

247
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,042
we call him “Chomper”?

248
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,083
Chomper is a weird plant

249
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,667
growing

250
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,042
in the virgin forests and swamps

251
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,209
of the Amazon River in the Americas.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,125
Its delicate appearance

253
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:19,876
also reveals

254
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,834
a seductive fragrance of orchids.

255
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:23,999
Animals

256
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,042
who don’t know about it

257
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,626
will also be attracted and absorbed into it.

258
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,751
Even those who escaped by chance

259
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,501
would still be attracted again

260
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:33,959
for their bad memories.

261
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:37,042
But if you accidentally touch

262
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,250
its petals,

263
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:41,292
it will truss you up

264
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,459
like a bird’s claws,

265
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,125
and then swallow you,

266
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,667
without spitting out your bones.

267
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:55,834
So,

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,334
calm yourself.

269
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,209
Don’t be fooled

270
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,125
by Chomper’s beauty.

271
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:00,751
Otherwise…

272
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:01,501
No “otherwise”!

273
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:02,501
I swear to God,

274
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:03,751
I’ll never

275
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:04,501
do anything stupid

276
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:06,417
to Chomper,

277
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,209
or I’ll be struck by lightning and thun…

278
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,209
Never mind, it’s a coincidence.

279
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:20,042
I’ll

280
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,000
never do anything stupid to him.

281
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:28,834
It’s OK.

282
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:56,834
What do you think

283
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,125
was happened just now?

284
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,209
She finally

285
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,083
took her eyes off you.

286
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:05,334
No one thinks you’re dumb

287
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,375
if you don’t talk.

288
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,209
Only check the apartment at this time

289
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,209
can we figure out

290
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,999
the occupancy of this community.

291
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:17,542
Oh yeah?

292
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,125
Yeah.

293
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,375
I’ll wash it up.

294
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:25,709
But, you…

295
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,125
Shouldn’t you

296
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,459
pay attention to your image?

297
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:30,918
I’ve been tired of

298
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:31,834
acting goddess.

299
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:32,626
Can’t I relax myself

300
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:33,876
after work?

301
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:35,751
Moreover,

302
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:37,667
I never take you as a man.

303
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:38,292
If your fans

304
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,417
see you like this,

305
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,167
they’ll give you hell.

306
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:44,792
Anyway,

307
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,751
I’m so glad

308
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,918
to have a friend like you.

309
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:50,918
Take your smelly hand

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,709
off me.

311
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,375
You said you live

312
00:13:58,501 --> 00:13:59,667
here in East Heping Road?

313
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,042
Yeah.

314
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,083
I live around.

315
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,792
This is a prime lot,

316
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,542
all are mansions.

317
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:10,000
Which…

318
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,042
Which community you’re in?

319
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:13,834
I…

320
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:15,542
It’s not true.

321
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,167
There are many old communities

322
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,751
except the mansions.

323
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:19,667
I live in an old community.

324
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,542
Well, you’re home.

325
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,209
Are you gonna invite me up

326
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,209
for hot tea?

327
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,375
I don’t think so.

328
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:31,626
My kennel doesn’t match

329
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,292
your goddess temperament.

330
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,167
You are insincere.

331
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,959
How much you pay

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,834
for one month rent?

333
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,167
It’s joint rent.

334
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,459
3,000 for one month.

335
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:41,667
What?

336
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,209
3,000 for an old apartment?

337
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:46,792
You think it’s expensive?

338
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,375
Your landlord is taking you

339
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,042
as an idiot.

340
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,709
No, I can’t leave it be.

341
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,250
Let’s go talk to him.

342
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,999
Hey, my fairy.

343
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,000
I finally got settled up

344
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:00,918
in this city.

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,792
If you rush over

346
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:02,876
to fight with him,

347
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,125
no, to reason with him,

348
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,250
what if the landlord

349
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,626
is not a reasonable person?

350
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:08,626
If he kicks me out,

351
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,999
I’ll be sleeping in the streets.

352
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:11,792
Right?

353
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:14,250
Okay, not tonight then.

354
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,501
Now we’re friends,

355
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,250
I won’t let anyone to bully you.

356
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,709
I’ll figure out a way with Qi.

357
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,834
We’ll find you a

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,709
cheap and fine kennel.

359
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:30,417
Thanks you.

360
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:31,167
Let’s go.

361
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,083
Ouch, my waist!

362
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:16,709
What’s that?

363
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:26,709
For what reason?

364
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,459
The transformer in this street

365
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,334
is down.

366
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:30,417
The electricity bureau says

367
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:31,626
they’re working on it.

368
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:34,959
Okay, I see.

369
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,792
Dear gods and ghosts,

370
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:48,792
please don’t come out.

371
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:49,792
My courage is poor.

372
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,417
You’ll scare me to death.

373
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,375
Hello? Qi.

374
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,667
Baoni, the power

375
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,918
is off here.

376
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:25,959
Qi?

377
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:26,959
Hello?

378
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:29,542
Qi? Qi?

379
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,125
- What happened? - What to do?

380
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,209
Qi is in trouble.

381
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,000
Let’s go.

382
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:35,292
Slowly.

383
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:11,751
Get out if you’re awake.

384
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,334
Don’t disturb my work.

385
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,751
I fainted out

386
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,375
because I was over nervous.

387
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,167
I’m not always like that.

388
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,459
Not interested.

389
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,459
Get out of my office.

390
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:34,584
These are all

391
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,125
electric lights for the exhibition.

392
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,626
The battery won’t last long.

393
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,000
We’re changing for new.

394
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,167
The cost will be deducted from your wages.

395
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:43,626
Why

396
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,042
deduct from my wages?

397
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:46,751
Now you’re using my lights,

398
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,334
shouldn’t you

399
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,542
pay me rent?

400
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,250
- Qi! - Qi!

401
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:58,501
- Qi! - Qi!

402
00:18:58,918 --> 00:18:59,626
Qi!

403
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,542
- Qi! - Qi!

404
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:02,792
Qi!

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,792
I’m here!

406
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:12,834
Qi!

407
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:18,667
Mr.…

408
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:23,584
Are you all right?

409
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:25,626
Yeah.

410
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,709
You’ve

411
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,501
occupied my time

412
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,459
for 40 minutes.

413
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,584
I’m leaving now!

414
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,918
Such an ass.

415
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,125
This way.

416
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,334
Let’s go.

417
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:42,125
Go to hell.

418
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:43,959
Go.

419
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,751
Nothing happened.

420
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:04,584
Just…

421
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,501
Have we asked you anything?

422
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:11,709
Qi,

423
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,000
you swore an oath.

424
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,334
Are you breaking your words

425
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,292
again?

426
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:19,042
Of course not.

427
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,667
Your denial

428
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,626
is quite clumsy.

429
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,000
I mean it. Let’s go.

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,459
We’re late for the last bus.

431
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:35,250
My bro and sis.

432
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,083
Hurry up.

433
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,000
It’s here.

434
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:55,999
Anyone outside?

435
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,334
Come on.

436
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:10,709
I’m impressed.

437
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:11,709
You’re a boss now.

438
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:12,959
But you have bad taste.

439
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,042
I quitted those junk foods

440
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,459
from junior high.

441
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:21,209
Yummy.

442
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:24,667
Have some.

443
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,042
No.

444
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:27,334
I’m on diet.

445
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,000
Come on.

446
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,209
No.

447
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:31,167
Just one.

448
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:31,918
Stop.

449
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:43,375
Good?

450
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,125
Yeah.

451
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:48,751
How old are you?

452
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:49,999
Still eating

453
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,876
those kid foods.

454
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:52,959
Unbelievable.

455
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:53,959
Give me more.

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,292
The dream bracelet you gave me

457
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,417
stopped working.

458
00:21:59,542 --> 00:21:59,959
I didn’t sleep well

459
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,125
these days.

460
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,125
It’s OK.

461
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,167
I’ll call the after service

462
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,125
tomorrow,

463
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,042
to check what’s going wrong.

464
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,334
Ling Lingqi.

465
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:45,959
What’s wrong with you?

466
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,834
Haven’t you

467
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,083
already made up your mind?

468
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:48,709
Haven’t you sworn

469
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,751
an oath?

470
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:50,209
You promised never

471
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:51,999
think about him.

472
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,083
Stop thinking about him.

473
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:55,834
Don’t you think it’s late and silent,

474
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:56,626
so you can think about him.

475
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:57,834
Be decent!

476
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,999
It’s so embarrassing!

477
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,334
My dear.

478
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,042
Why are you so late?

479
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,417
I have already wanted to close.

480
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,209
You’re waiting for me, Dad?

481
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:51,959
Yeah.

482
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,209
Don’t do that again.

483
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:57,834
I gotta work late

484
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,292
every day in future.

485
00:23:59,375 --> 00:23:59,834
Do you?

486
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,000
I’ve grown up.

487
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,334
I can take care of myself.

488
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,876
My baby girl is a grownup now.

489
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:05,751
I don’t have to worry for her.

490
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:07,209
It’s so nice.

491
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:08,834
Oh, right.

492
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,000
My clients gave it to me

493
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,000
when I delivered the goods today.

494
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,959
I kept some for you.

495
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,209
Have a taste. I’ll lock the door.

496
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:22,792
Okay.

497
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:27,292
Let’s go home.

498
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,542
This is the man who loves me the most

499
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:37,792
in the world.

500
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:41,501
I lost my idol,

501
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:43,959
but I have the best father in the world.

502
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:46,083
Dad,

503
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,125
you’re always my idol.

504
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:58,751
My baby.

505
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:39,792
Today, the National Bureau of Statistics

506
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:40,876
announced the changes

507
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:43,042
in residential sales prices in 70 large

508
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,584
and medium-sized cities nationwide

509
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:45,375
in December last year.

510
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,626
Block it with your hand.

511
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,667
The number of rising cities

512
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,375
continues to increase,

513
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,292
but the differentiation is obvious.

514
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,501
Picky.

515
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,751
Housing rental prices in this city

516
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:57,501
increased by 3%

517
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:58,751
from the previous quarter.

518
00:25:59,042 --> 00:25:59,918
We interviewed

519
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:00,918
several young tenants randomly.

520
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,167
Honestly,

521
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,375
you know our Qi is

522
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:05,501
such a lucky girl,

523
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:08,792
living in a big city

524
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,083
with parents.

525
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,792
Look at those kids out of town,

526
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:12,751
we don’t know

527
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,167
how much they earn,

528
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:15,250
but the rent,

529
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,417
and the utility bills,

530
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:17,918
are pressures for them.

531
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:19,542
I heard

532
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,417
Li Lijun is renting

533
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,417
their basement.

534
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,459
Because someone wants to rent.

535
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,250
No worries, Baoni.

536
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,167
I’m on it.

537
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,042
I’ll get it done.

538
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,417
Bye.

539
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:36,792
Mommy.

540
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,209
Have breakfast, Qi.

541
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:40,876
“Mommy, mommy”.

542
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,167
This voice again!

543
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,667
Are you out of cash?

544
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,626
Don’t take your daughter

545
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:47,792
as a material girl!

546
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:48,792
Yes, I am.

547
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:49,667
How much you’re giving me?

548
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:50,959
Look at her.

549
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,667
No, I’m kidding.

550
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,918
I don’t want a penny.

551
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:54,959
Seriously,

552
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:56,959
I wanna say,

553
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,751
can we rent

554
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,667
our balcony?

555
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:01,709
Balcony?

556
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:03,751
You heard Aunt Li

557
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,167
is renting her basement,

558
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,167
so you want to rent ours too?

559
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:07,918
No.

560
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:10,959
I think this suggestion

561
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,042
sounds great.

562
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:13,125
Right?

563
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,417
We can earn some extra money,

564
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,250
and also

565
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,417
have a nice neighbor.

566
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It’s good works.

567
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,459
We can rent it to

568
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:22,626
some young outcomer with low income.

569
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,999
It’s good to help people.

570
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,584
But it’s balcony, and shabby.

571
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:27,918
No one wants it.

572
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,167
Your idea is great,

573
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,792
and we must rent it to agood guy.

574
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:31,459
Right?

575
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:32,417
Not everyone can

576
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,542
rent it.

577
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:34,334
If we rent it to

578
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,250
some riff-raff,

579
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,459
the neighbors will gossip.

580
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:39,000
I swear to the bun,

581
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,042
he’s a good guy.

582
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:40,751
Maybe he can

583
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:41,667
help us

584
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,417
on delivery or something,

585
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:44,709
or

586
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:45,584
carrying the gas tank.

587
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,167
Right?

588
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,292
OK, deal.

589
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:49,751
It’s a deal.

590
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,834
I’ll inform him.

591
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:51,417
Bye.

592
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,125
Help me on delivery

593
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,000
or something?

594
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:58,709
A man.

595
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:02,417
Something is going on.

596
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:09,959
You’re all here.

597
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:10,667
Hurry up.

598
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:11,792
OK.

599
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:13,501
Good weather.

600
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:15,834
Too hot.

601
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,999
I wear too much.

602
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:18,959
Good news!

603
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,042
My mom finally

604
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,334
agrees to rent the balcony.

605
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,250
I knew you can do it.

606
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:26,250
See?

607
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:27,959
Cheap and nice place.

608
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:28,792
I’ve found one for you.

609
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,542
You meant it yesterday?

610
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,292
Of course!

611
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:35,459
We’re friends.

612
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:36,667
Go check out

613
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,209
from your 3,000 mansion.

614
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:39,667
And more,

615
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,250
Mo Nan, in return you can

616
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:41,876
get our bills paid

617
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:42,709
while Baoni and I

618
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:44,167
have meals.

619
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:44,834
OK?

620
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,334
You’re so sweet.

621
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,000
In case my mom changes her mind,

622
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:51,042
we better move in tonight.

623
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,250
No need to be in such a hurry.

624
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:52,834
Right.

625
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,876
Yes, we do!

626
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,125
Stop chatting.

627
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,417
My lords and ladies.

628
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,542
We gotta get everything arranged

629
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:01,501
before tomorrow evening,

630
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:02,751
and the opening is next morning.

631
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:03,876
We’re running out of time,

632
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,292
but still got a lot of work to do.

633
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:06,751
Let’s go back to work.

634
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:07,417
OK, OK.

635
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,042
Hurry up.

636
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,000
Gosh.

637
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:07,250
You are?

638
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,584
I work for the booth contractor,

639
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,501
for, for construction.

640
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:14,959
Mr. Chen sent you?

641
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:15,792
Yeah, right.

642
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:16,876
The construction

643
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,083
was finished yesterday.

644
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:18,918
And there is

645
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,751
no Mr. Chen

646
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:20,542
in their company.

647
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,542
Who are you?

648
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:22,542
I…

649
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,250
Stop!

650
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,083
Get him!

651
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:26,959
- Guards! - These flowers …

652
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,584
Stop!

653
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,042
Get him! Stop!

654
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,292
Get him! Guards!

655
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,459
You’re fast. Hold him.

656
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:40,999
What happened?

657
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:41,751
Say it.

658
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,083
What are you doing here?

659
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:44,626
Delivery.

660
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,626
I see those flowers look nice,

661
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:49,125
so, I lifted some.

662
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,334
You stole our flowers.

663
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:52,459
Anyone got cellphone?

664
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:53,667
Call the police.

665
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:54,083
OK.

666
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:54,876
That’s it.

667
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,334
It’s no big deal.

668
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:57,250
Let him go.

669
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,375
Thanks, boss.

670
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:01,292
Thank you.

671
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,209
Don’t come again.

672
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,751
Anything lost?

673
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:08,167
Only these.

674
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:09,959
What’s that smell?

675
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,584
What’s going on?

676
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:20,918
Extinguisher, now!

677
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,709
Get the extinguisher, hurry!

678
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:23,584
Fight the fire!

679
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:24,584
Fight the fire!

680
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:25,584
Save the flowers!

681
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,459
Yi, get the extinguisher, now!

682
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,167
Water! Water!

683
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:30,999
Water!

684
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,042
Put out the fire!

685
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:33,709
Water!

686
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:34,999
Give it to me!

687
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:37,584
Get water!

688
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:38,584
Go over there!

689
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:39,375
Put out the fire!

690
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:40,083
Hurry up!

691
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:42,709
Hurry!

692
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:43,375
Watch it!

693
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:44,626
Hurry up!

694
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:46,626
Hurry!

695
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:47,918
Come on!

696
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:49,626
Any more water?

697
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,334
Where is the water?

698
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:51,709
Here! Hurry up! Water!

699
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:53,501
Hurry up! The fire is too big!

700
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:56,375
Hurry!

701
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:57,709
Hurry up!

702
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:58,959
Bo Hai!

703
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,292
Water! Hurry!

704
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:02,042
Here, here!

705
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:03,584
Be careful!

706
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:04,584
Watch it!

707
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,083
Watch it!

708
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:05,667
And this.

709
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:24,125
The fire caused some damages,

710
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,999
but it’s under control now.

711
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:28,417
We spent a lot on it.

712
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:29,542
Now everything

713
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:30,999
we worked for is burnt away.

714
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:31,792
Yi.

715
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:33,876
For so many years, our company

716
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:34,834
has gone through trials and hardships.

717
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,834
It’s not a big deal.

718
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:38,083
Everyone go back to work.

719
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,751
Where is Mr. Bo?

720
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:42,959
Mr. Bo

721
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,000
is certainly handling

722
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,751
this thing right now.

723
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:46,834
Shouldn’t he

724
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,209
handle it in the venue?

725
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,167
No, it’s not that.

726
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,501
The client needs a result.

727
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,626
Mr. Bo got more important matters.

728
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:56,709
Don’t worry.

729
00:32:56,918 --> 00:32:58,042
Mr. Bo will

730
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,626
get everything solved.

731
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,042
Let’s go back to work.

732
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:04,292
Where is Bo Hai?

733
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,626
Mr. Bo is meeting the client.

734
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:10,999
I got something important

735
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,167
to tell you. Come with me.

736
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,834
Back to work. Back to work.

737
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,417
Back to work.

738
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,042
The rescue is in time.

739
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:23,876
Their loss

740
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:24,834
shouldn’t be too big.

741
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,751
But Mr. Bo

742
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,125
never showed up after the fire.

743
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,042
I heard he went to explain to the client.

744
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:31,626
Explain what?

745
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,542
Explain the exhibition is on soon

746
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:35,375
but the venue is on fire?

747
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,626
The inside fire is out,

748
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:39,918
but the fire outside,

749
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,918
will keep Mr. Bo busy for a while.

750
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,042
Let’s wait and see.

751
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:17,209
- Mo Nan! - Mo Nan!

752
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:18,375
Here!

753
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:20,999
I’m here, my fairies!

754
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,417
Mo Nan, come up!

755
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:24,459
Come!

756
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:43,417
Get in.

757
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:53,209
How’s it?

758
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:57,083
Qi.

759
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,292
Is this room really for human being?

760
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,417
Of course.

761
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,792
Don’t be fussy, young man.

762
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,083
Yeah, the appliances

763
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,083
are well equipped.

764
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,334
And you don’t have to spend a penny.

765
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:15,375
I’m telling you,

766
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,542
you will find it quite cozy

767
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:18,834
after cleaning it up.

768
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:22,334

Bo Hai!

807
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,292
Bo Hai, are you at home?

808
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:57,751
I’ll call the police.

809
00:37:59,083 --> 00:37:59,751
No, no.

810
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,250
I got something.

811
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:03,292
What?

812
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:05,834
Look.

813
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,501
Why not

814
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:14,459
take it out earlier?

815
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:17,667
Bo Hai?

816
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:21,584
Bo Hai?

817
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:25,292
Bo Hai?

818
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,167
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

819
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:34,667
Xinyan!

820
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,417
Okay. To your new home,

821
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:44,334
and a better future!

822
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:47,042
To Mo Nan, who’s finally reached

823
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,083
the peak of life,

824
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,000
and become the winner!

825
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,250
Thank you, my fairies.

826
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,167
The candles are on.

827
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,501
Can I make a wish?

828
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:58,375
Yeah.

829
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,501
I wish to be promoted and makegreat  money,

830
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,042
to be a CEO,

831
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,792
and to buy a villa!

832
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,792
What’s good of villa?

833
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:20,626
It’s nothing

834
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,125
compared to my friend’s balcony,

835
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,209
warm and sweet,

836
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,209
romantic and human.

837
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,334
I’d change it for nothing.

838
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:30,292
Cheers!

839
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:31,167
Come!

840
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,292
Let’s take a photo.

841
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:35,042
Come on!

842
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,125
One, two, three!

843
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:44,918
Come here!

844
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:46,792
Stop there!

845
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,167
What are you laughing at?

846
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,626
You wanna play?

847
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:53,417
I’m coming!

848
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:55,792
Stop!

849
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,417
You know

850
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:57,542
anything else

851
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,792
eternal like those stars

852
00:40:58,834 --> 00:40:59,999
up in the sky?

853
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:04,375
Us.

854
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:06,959
Right.

855
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:10,709
Our friendship

856
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,250
is everlasting.

857
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:13,876
What if we have a fight?

858
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:14,667
No chance.

859
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,375
What if?

860
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,667
If we have a fight,

861
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,292
it must be my problem.

862
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,459
If you like,

863
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:29,709
I’ll do crazy things with you.

864
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,042
If anyone bullies you,

865
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:37,417
I’ll give him a hard time.

866
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:39,042
How’s it?

867
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:40,709
Come, cheers!

868
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,334
