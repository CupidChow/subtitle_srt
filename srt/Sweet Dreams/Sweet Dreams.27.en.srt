51

Hello.

52
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:56,125
Mr. Mo, I heard from the headquarters that

53
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,125
you are giving up the FlowerPlus acquisition,

54
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:58,709
are you?

55
00:01:59,125 --> 00:01:59,584
Yes,

56
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,083
I will go back to headquarters later.

57
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:03,667
As to the finishing work,

58
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,083
they will send professionals to

59
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,125
help you.

60
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:10,334
We have worked so hard for

61
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,125
the FlowerPlus project.

62
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,834
Why are you giving up now?

63
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:17,751
Because of Ling Lingqi?

64
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,584
Have you ever thought that

65
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,501
if someone knows

66
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:25,792
you blow this case

67
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,292
because of a woman,

68
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,000
you’ll never

69
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,292
be promoted

70
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,000
in DREAM?

71
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,542
And you will be the laughingstock

72
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:34,792
of this industry.

73
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:35,959
You ever thought about it?

74
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,125
No need to persuade me anymore.

75
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,292
I’ve already thought very clearly.

76
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,501
Since this decision was made,

77
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,626
no matter what the consequences are,

78
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,292
I’ll bear them.

79
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:08,834

Mr. Bo.

83
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:38,959
Shall I close the door?

84
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:40,792
Just wait for a while longer.

85
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:41,999
Someone must be still inside.

86
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:43,125
Sure.

87
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:19,626
It’s already late.

88
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,626
Why are you still here?

89
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:23,834
I can’t make it

90
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,292
feel like the Starry Night.

91
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,918
Excessive fatigue can damage your wrists.

92
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:38,209
By then,

93
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,501
you can’t be a florist

94
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:40,709
let alone

95
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:41,584

96
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:46,999
Does it hurt?

97
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:57,292
Are you waiting for me?

98
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,292
No.

99
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:04,834
I’m not.

100
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,000
It’s done here.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,999
Go back home.

102
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:09,667
Don’t delay the security from off duty.

103
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:20,501
Wait.

104
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,959
It’s late.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,334
For the safety of employee,

106
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,584
let me take you home.

107
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:36,792
OK.

108
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:41,542

and I’m tired.

111
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:48,501
Don’t make me

112
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,083
wash clothes.

113
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,417
Don’t we have a washing machine?

114
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:51,918
It’s for washing quilts.

115
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,417
But washing clothes

116
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:54,834
is hurting my hands.

117
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:55,918
- Then… - No.

118
00:05:59,083 --> 00:05:59,751
Qi?

119
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:01,417
Go, go, go.

120
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,751
Be careful.

121
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:06,959
I’m home.

122
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,834
Go upstairs. I’m leaving.

123
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,292
Wait.

124
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,626
Well…

125
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,459
It’s a long way to station.

126
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,250
How about I walk you there?

127
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:25,375
OK.

128
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:36,959
Well,

129
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,083
Bo Hai just walked Qi home,

130
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,999
and Qi is going to walk him back.

131
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,083
Then Bo Hai

132
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,792
sends Qi back again.

133
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:45,999
They will keep going like this.

134
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,083
Is it ever going to end?

135
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,167
You fool. That would be the best.

136
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,834
That means our Qi is a grown-up now.

137
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:52,999
Yes, grown up.

138
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,250
I seem to understand what you said,

139
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:56,584
yet not quite understand.

140
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,542
It doesn’t matter you understand or not.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,918
All it matters is Qi understands.

142
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:02,751
OK, OK, OK.

143
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,751
Stand up now.

144
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:05,792
Go home and wash clothes.

145
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,375
Don’t we have a washing machine?

146
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,083
- It costs electricity. - But…

147
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,167
Use your hands and they don’t cost electricity.

148
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:10,542
But my hands won’t

149
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,792
be able to count money.

150
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:41,209
Be careful.

151
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,584
Wait for me.

152
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,626
Ling Guoliang, you are so cheap.

153

West Lake Longjing three to six tablets.

154
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,959
Why don’t you praise me for frugality?

155
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,626
I got two.

156
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:12,918
Qi, you are back.

157
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,083
You are back.

158
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:14,667
Yes.

159
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:15,542
Any good news

160
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:16,417
you wanna tell me?

161
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,792
What good news?

162
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:19,709
Come, come.

00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:20,459

Come.

165

Come, tell us.

169
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,250
Your father and I are listening.

170
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:28,125
What?

171
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,542
There is no good news.

172
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,334
I asked someone.

Next spring,

00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,542
If everything goes well,

177
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,167
the year after next year, our family

178
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,792
should have one more child.

179
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,501
Mom, what are you talking about?

180
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,459
Fooling us again?

181
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,000
We saw you just now.

182
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,459
You and Bo Hai

183
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:52,999
were sticking

184
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,709
to each other.

185
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,459
Don’t you tell me

186
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,626
you are just friends.

187
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,918
No, we are not

188
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,167
in a relationship yet.

189
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
Not yet?

190
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:05,042
That means

191
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:06,792
it’s almost there.

192
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,334
Mom! I’m going to sleep.

193
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,542
I’m done talking to you.

194
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,292
You must answer

195
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,292
my question.

196
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,083
No.

197
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:12,501
Enough.

198
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,209
Don’t be such a big gossip.

199
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:17,542
You little girl.

200
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:18,959
Qi?

201
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,292
Ling Lingqi, I’m telling you.

202
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,250
You must answer my question today.

203
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:24,792
If you don’t,

204
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,000
I’ll knock your door every three minutes.

205
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,083
You won’t be able to fall asleep.

206
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:28,876
You hear me?

207
00:09:58,918 --> 00:09:59,584
What are you drawing?

208
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,042
Do you know the Starry Night by Van Gogh?

209
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:04,125
Of course.

210
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,209
That famous painting.

211
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,584
The theme of my design this time

212
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,459
is the Starry Night bouquet.

213
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,959
And I made a bet with Bo Hai.

214
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,834
If I can design

215
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:15,834
this bouquet,

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,501
he will respond to my love.

217
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,250
Qi,

218
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:28,792
are you happy?

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,751
Of course.

220
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,083
See, I have

221
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,292
a good job now,

222
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:32,918
and two

223
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,167
close friends.

224
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,834
And one

225
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,042
not-yet,

226
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,501
but soon-will-be

227
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,209
boyfriend.

228
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,959
I’m a winner here.

229
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,709
I made it wrong.

230
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,959
Your happiness is all that counts.

231
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:52,876
Relax.

232
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,459
I will never look down on friends.

233
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,375
After Bo Hai becomes my boyfriend,

234
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:57,709
I’ll treat you and Baoni

235
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:58,501
a big time.

236
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,334
Deal?

237
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:01,626
Deal.

238
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:30,209
Mo Nan?

239
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,042
What is he thinking about?

240
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,100
= HR Director CHO =

241
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,620
= Mo Nan =

242
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,300
= Resignation Letter =

243
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,584
Did I not make it clear?

244
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,709
Or just because he is dumb.

245
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:08,918
Besides,

246
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,626
even though he has no confidence in himself,

247
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,918
he can’t just go away.

248
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,292
Too irresponsible.

249
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:17,999
I made it!

250
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:19,999
You scared me.

251
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:20,999
Why are you screaming?

252
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,167
I’m sorry.

253
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,459
I’m just so excited.

254
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:23,959
Look.

255
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:26,584
From now on,

256
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,542
I’ll listen to you

257
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:28,334
carefully.

258
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,292
You said something irresponsible.

259
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:31,999
What’s going on?

260
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,834
Was I just

261
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,542
casting pearls before swine?

262
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:37,876
Tell me again.

263
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,999
I didn’t hear you clearly.

264
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,459
Are you going to resign?

265
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:46,959
Not me.

266
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,626
Mo Nan.

267
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,167
It seems he really

268
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,459
wants to leave here

269
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,542
because of emotional hurt.

270
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,000
What to do?

271
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,792
We just watch him leave?

272
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:10,334
No.

273
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,000
I can’t wait anymore.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,626
I deicide

275
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,751
to make a move.

276
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,542
Tonight I’ll express my love to Mo Nan.

277
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:21,959
Baoni, I support you.

278
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:24,542
I make up my mind too.

279
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:25,542
Today,

280
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:27,542
I’ll ask Bo Hai for an answer.

281
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:28,751
Looks like our

282
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:29,834
single time

283
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,751
is going to end tonight.

284
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,000
When is this?

285
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:46,959
Yesterday.

286
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,209
Get your answer ready.

287
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,375
I’ll see you at Glass House tonight.

288
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,209
Smile so happily.

289
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:13,209
We are like brothers.

290
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,667
Tell me what happened.

291
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:17,417
You wanna know?

292
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:21,876
I won’t tell you.

293
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,167
- Mr. Bo. - Naughty.

294
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,000
A batch of flowers was seized

295
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:24,959
at the freight center.

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,125
You need to go there in person.

297
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,083
Qi,

298
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:35,417
we are leaving.

299
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:35,751
OK.

300
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,292
We’re gonna go, Qi.

301
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:36,959
- Bye. - Bye.

302
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,209
See you tomorrow.

303
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:40,292
Leaving now?

304
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:41,334
- Bye. - Bye.

305
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:51,667
Qi.

306
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,000
You wanna come home together?

307
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,834
No, I have

308
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:57,083
a big date.

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,167
This is the Starry Night?

310
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:02,959
Yes.

311
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,000
See? Isn’t it beautiful?

312
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,876
So

313
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,542
you are seeing the Chomper tonight?

314
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,083
We have made an appointment

315
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,125
to meet here.

316
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:28,334
I think

317
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,626
you have a big date

318
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,959
tonight, too.

319
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:33,709
No, I don’t.

320
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:35,959
You will know later.

321
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,709
Don’t waste your time here.

322
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:38,667
Go, go, go.

323
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,834
Hurry.

324
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,542
You’re gonna be late.

325
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:44,375
Cheer up!

326
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:06,834
Mo Nan!

327
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:09,751
Baoni?

328
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,834
Why do you look

329
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,250
different today?

330
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,876
More beautiful.

331
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,042
This lipstick color fits you well.

332
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:24,125
What?

333
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,834
All dressed up

334
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,751
for a date?

335
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,834
I’m just being casual.

336
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,626
I managed

337
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,792
to book a very hot

338
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,000
French restaurant online.

339
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:38,375
Let’s have dinner together.

340
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,125
I am a bit tired from work today

341
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,000
and want to go home early to have a rest.

342
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:45,584
Why don’t you eat with someone else?

343
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:46,667
Can I take a rain check?

344
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,620
= Resignation Letter =
What is this?

345
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,180
Why do you have it?

346
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,501
Have dinner with me, and I’ll give it back to you.

347
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,459
Actually I know

348
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,751
why you want to resign.

349
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,834
You know?

350
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:37,501
Are you falling in love

351
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:38,709
with a girl?

352
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,167
And

353
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,876
you don’t have the courage to tell her.

354
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:49,626
So,

355
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,417
you use resignation

356
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,209
to escape from this love.

357
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,667
But have you ever thought that

358
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,125
you two like each other

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and you don’t need to resign?

360
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,626
Look, Baoni.

361
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,250
I think you’re misunderstanding.

362
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,709
Mo Nan, I’m not.

363
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,999
No, Baoni, listen to me.

364
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:38,959
You listen to me.

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,584
No, Baoni.

366
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,792
It’s not what you think.

367
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:41,751
I know you like me,

368
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:42,250
and l like you too.

369
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,042
Let’s be together.

370
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,876
No, Baoni.

371
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:44,792
It’s not what you think.

372
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,709
Mo Nan, listen to me.

373
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:46,542
Seriously. Listen to me.

374
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,334
I’m not misunderstanding.

375
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:48,459
Baoni…

376
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:49,751
I know. I…

377
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,167
Baoni…

378
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,584
It’s not what you think.

379
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:04,584
You are right.

380
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,250
There is someone.

381
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:07,125
But…

382
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,667
But it’s not you.

383
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,459
So, I’m sorry.

384
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,083
I can’t accept you.

385
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,209
Sorry.

386
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:40,792
Miss, you want this cake cut?

387
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,125
Miss?

388
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,000
Cut what?

389
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,459
Can’t you see I’m being dumped?

390
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,834
All set and waiting for you.

391
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,876
Chen Mo and I got this.

392
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,042
Go if you have something emergent.

393
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,876
OK. I’m leaving.

394
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:00,959
Thank you.

395
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:01,584
Sure.

396
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,375
No worries. Bye.

397
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,209
Cry if you want.

398
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:12,292
Don’t hold it.

399
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:13,918
I can borrow you my shoulder.

400
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:14,792
Piss off.

401
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,042
What’s with your attitude?

402
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,042
Today, you ignored me.

403
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,876
Tomorrow, you can’t reach me.

404
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:23,876
Can’t reach whom?

405
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,292
Of course,

406
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,876
I can’t reach you.

407
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:29,292
I can’t reach you.

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,375
Come on. Eat some sugar.

409
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,459
You are too old to

410
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,667
carry sugars every day.

411
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,667
I don’t like them.

412
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,999
Someone does.

413
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:48,125
Does this flavor taste good?

414
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:55,584
Help! Anyone?

415
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:00,959
Help!

416
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:02,959
Anyone?

417
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,417
Help!

418
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:09,250
Mr. Bo.

419
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:10,667
It’s late.

420
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:11,334
Why are you here?

421
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,083
It’s off time.

422
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:13,167
Nothing.

423
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,584
I’m just looking around.

424
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,167
Fire alarm!

425
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,584
- Call 119. - OK.

426
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:20,250
Go see where the fire is.

427
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:28,292
Help!

428
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:47,626
Help!

429
00:23:58,459 --> 00:23:58,959
Qi!

430
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,459
Qi! Qi!

431
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:04,709
Qi!

432
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:06,334
Qi…

433
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,999
Bo Hai!

434
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,083
Hai!

435
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:28,209
- Mom. - Hai!

436
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:30,918
Hai!

437
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:32,042
Mom, help me!

438
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:32,999
Hai!

439
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:41,959
Mom, help me!

440
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hai!

441
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,792
Hai!

442
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,375
Mom!

443
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:54,000
Qi…

444
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,334
Mom…

445
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,125
Qi…

446
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,501
Qi… Qi…

447
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,918
Mom.

448
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:12,292
Qi…

449
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:29,250
Excuse me.

450
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:30,834
No, you can’t go inside.

451
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:31,334
Move!

452
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:31,751
You can’t!

453
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:32,375
It’s dangerous!

454
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:36,292
Qi! Qi! Qi!

455
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:39,834
Qi!

456
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,125
Qi!

457
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:08,959
Qi!

458
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:09,584
Come.

459
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,959
Qi! Hang in there.

460
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:19,459
We will be at the hospital soon.

461
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:28,209
Bo Hai.

462
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:28,626
Qi…

463
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:29,083
Bo Hai.

464
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:29,834
Qi…

465
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,334
Do you know

466
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,167
you almost got her killed?

467
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,542
You don’t deserve to be with her!

468
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:34,125
Back off!

469
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:38,209
Qi.

470
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:39,125
Bo Hai!

471
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,459
Qi… Qi… Qi…

472
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:44,375
Qi…

473
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:45,083
Bo Hai!

474
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:14,751
Here.

475
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,542
You gave me a long night.

476
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:29,459
I don’t have time to

477
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:30,959
be sad for losing my love,

478
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,918
yet be scared by you.

479
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,042
Come, give me a hug.

480
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:44,792
You scared me.

481
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:52,417
Why are you

482
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:53,918
so heartless?

483
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:54,959
Now

484
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,209
you still have good appetite.

485
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,959
I just escape from death.

486
00:27:59,083 --> 00:27:59,959
I need to eat more.

487
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:03,751
You. Are you stupid or

488
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:04,751
just playing dumb?

489
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,959
In order to see Bo Hai,

490
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:13,167
you spent years and years.

491
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,584
But, do you really know him?

492
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:17,584
Do you know

493
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,459
your position in his heart?

494
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:21,751
Have you ever doubted whether

495
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:22,751
his love

496
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:24,334
to you is genuine or not?

497
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,334
Who can watch the love one

498
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,209
in danger and don’t help?

499
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,584
He has his reasons.

500
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:33,999
So what?

501
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:36,959
Is it really worth trusting a man

502
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,751
who can’t protect you?

503
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:40,792
This Lu Baoni.

504
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:41,918
She is just stirring up trouble.

505
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:44,167
Let’s go.

506
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,876
Wait…

507
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:01,167
Do you know

508
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,125
you almost got her killed?

509
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:03,542
You don’t deserve to be with her!

510
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,250
- Back off! - Qi.

511
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:07,959
Who can watch the love one

512
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:08,626
in danger

513
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:09,876
and don’t help?

514
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,334
He has his reasons.

515
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,417
Is it really worth trusting a man

516
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,334
who can’t protect you?

517
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,542
I heard that yesterday

518
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,167
if it was not you,

519
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,250
Ling Lingqi might

520
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,667
not be alive now.

521
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,501
I sacrifice my career

522
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,375
and want her and Bo Hai be together.

523
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,792
I thought Qi would be happy.

524
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,000
Am I doing the right thing?

525
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,667
They say true love shows in danger.

526
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,667
Yesterday at the scene of the fire,

527
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,209
do you remember what Bo Hai looks like?

528
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,876
It’s enough to say that he’s a man

529
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,876
who is afraid of death

530
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,167
and he is selfish.

531
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:10,834
Do you really want

532
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,125
to give Ling Lingqi to him?

533
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:29,375
Baoni.

534
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,000
Are you here to finish
the discharge formalities for Qi?

535
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,167
I’ll leave you alone.

536
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:44,751
I

537
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,167
will go to the ward to find Qi.

538
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:47,334
Wait.

539
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,334
She’s not in the ward.

540
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,250
Come with me.

541
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,292
You are here.

542
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,417
Yes.

543
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,501
The fire was big.

544
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:30,834
Are you alright?

545
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:33,667
Yes.

546
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,792
And you?

547
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:39,000
I’m fine.

548
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,375
I have no merit.

549
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,459
But I have good luck.

550
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:46,042
Every time, I always manage to get out of danger.

551
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,083
So you don’t need to feel guilty.

552
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:51,584
I don’t blame you.

553
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,417
I’m serious.

554
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:03,834
I left the bouquet

555
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:04,834
in fire.

556
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:06,876
I’m not able to find

557
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:08,167
new flowers for now.

558
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:11,918
This is the substitute.

559
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:20,459
In fact, you don’t have to rush

560
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:21,417
to give me the answer.

561
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:23,125
I’ve been waiting

562
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,167
so long anyway.

563
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:25,918
It doesn’t matter if I need
to wait a few more days.

564
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,083
No need.

565
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,709
I have my answer.

566
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,959
You don’t need to tell me.

567
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:44,709
I don’t want to know.

568
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,083
Don’t you already know?

569
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:47,709
Yesterday at the scene of the fire,

570
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:48,792
you saw it with your own eyes,

571
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:49,626
right?

572
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:51,459
Before that,

573
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,042
I’ve been trying to lie to myself.

574
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:55,751
I thought I could fall in love with you.

575
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:57,584
But I can’t pretend anymore.

576
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,709
I can’t love anyone.

577
00:32:58,709 --> 00:32:59,667
You are lying! Lying!

578
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,999
I don’t believe you.

579
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,834
Believe it or not,

580
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,626
this is my answer.

581
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:27,501
Ling Lingqi,

582
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:30,792
I can’t accept

583
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,667
your love.

584
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,459

Mr. Bo, I am here to thank you,

608
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,000
Thank you for letting Qi go,

609
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,040
so she can drop her love for you.

610
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,250
But I hope

611
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:32,990
you can do

612
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,870
as you said and

613
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,160
stay away from her.

614
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,160

Men are not that excellent.

624
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,167
Can’t we live without them?

625
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:29,459
True.

626
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:31,999
We want them to know

627
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:32,959
that we can live better

628
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,250
without them.

629
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,083
Why do I like you?

630
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,751
You are so selfish,

631
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:59,042
vengeful and

632
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,083
annoying.

633
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,417
Why would I like you

634
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:08,083
at the beginning?

635
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:11,918
Are you more miserable than me?

636
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,459
There are so many people like me but

637
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,125
I don’t like them.

638
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,000
Finally I fall for someone,

639
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,125
but he doesn’t like me.

640
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,125
Why you treat me well if

641
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,209
you don’t like me?

642
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:36,584
If you treat me well,

643
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:37,542
why you say that you

644
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,209
don’t like me?

645
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:42,042
You should tell me if you like me.

646
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,042
You don’t like me but

647
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,083
you treat me so well.

648
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:24,501
Qi.

649
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:25,999
Why?

650
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,417
You are so drunk.

651
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,709
Why don’t you tell me

652
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,751
you like me?

653
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,375
Bo Hai,

654
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,125
why you don’t want me?

655
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:47,792
My heart hurts.

656
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:48,501
Qi.

657
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,209
Bo Hai.

658
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:53,751
Let’s go.

659
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:58,999
- Bo Hai… - Qi…

660
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:39,999
I have told you that

661
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:41,999
you don’t deserve love.

662
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,626
Things base and vile,

663
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,209
holding no quantity. Love can

664
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:49,501
transpose to

665
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:50,626
form and dignity.

666
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,292
Let me ask you.

667
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,250
Can you lie to yourself?

668
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,083
Yes, I can.

669
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:58,459
No, you can’t.

670
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,959
Because I am you.

671
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,459
Let me tell you.

672
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:24,667
You can’t break through

673
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,417
the barriers in your heart.

674
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,167
You can’t forget,

675
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:29,334
forgive

676
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:31,250
or love someone.

677
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:34,083
Because the lying and hatred

678
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,042
in your heart

679
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,751
is the curse of

680
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,959
your whole life.

681
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,209
You have to believe it,

682
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:52,334
because the curse comes into effect.

683
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,959
Anyone who wants to come to you will

684
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:55,834
finally

685
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,501
become ashes in the fire

686
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,959
