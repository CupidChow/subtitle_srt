= Episode 5 =

51
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,459
What happened?

52
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,626
I checked the flowers

53
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,918
before I left.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,918
Last night, I…

55
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:50,792
It was my fault.

56
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:52,959
Sorry.

57
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:54,751
I failed to keep the flowers well.

58
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:56,083
The cattleya

59
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,250
were rotten.

60
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,209
But the shop was closing

61
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,751
when I found that.

62
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,959
In case today’s event might be affected,

63
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,459
I made a decision without authorization

64
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,501
and replaced the cattleya.

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,042
That’s a good excuse.

66
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:11,584
Sorry, Mr. Bo.

67
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:12,209
I…

68
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,918
I didn’t mean it.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,751
I will never

70
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:15,626
make a mistake again.

71
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:16,999
Can you forgive me?

72
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:21,876
You’re fired.

73
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,292
Ling Lingqi. Ling Lingqi.

74
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:33,375
Wait a second.

75
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,334
That was a rude punishment.

76
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,250
And unreasonable!

77
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,292
She made a mistake.

78
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,250
But she had

79
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,083
tried her best

80
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,292
to make up for it.

81
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,167
Anyway, the new bouquets

82
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
aren’t that ugly.

83
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,417
She can’t lose her job.

84
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:49,918
She comes from the rural area.

85
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:50,375
She has to support

86
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,417
a family of three,

87
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,375
including a brother in junior high.

88
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,042
You appear to be a philanthropist.

89
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:55,501
You can’t be so unfair

90
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,792
behind people’s back.

91
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,000
In FlowerPlus,

92
00:02:58,292 --> 00:02:59,999
every employee’s first task

93
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,250
is to bring wonderful life experience

94
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,626
to customers,

95
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,709
instead of making his own family happy.

96
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:05,542
Besides,

97
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,918
I decide if it’s fair.

98
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:35,834
You’re totally different

99
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:36,334
from the Bo Hai in my dream!

100
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,250
You’re fake!

101
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:38,792
What did you say?

102
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:44,501
This girl

103
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:45,959
applied to work for us

104
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,083
for three years.

105
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,584
She’s your fangirl.

106
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,083
Tell me what I look like

107
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,167
in your dream.

108
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:57,375
You…

109
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,125
You know what?

110
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,751
I don’t care for

111
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:01,667
your daydream.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,584
If you keep working

113
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,167
in such an unrealistic way,

114
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:05,751
I will make your dream

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,083
into a nightmare.

116
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,834
You were so mean

117
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,167
to the girls!

118
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,417
You broke their hearts

119
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,959
into pieces.

120
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,751
According to company rules,

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,584
I have the right

122
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:35,459
to ask the fired employee

123
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,918
to compensate for our loss.

124
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,125
Even Ling Lingqi.

125
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,918
She shall have administrative penalty, too.

126
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,999
You mean

127
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,125
you weren’t cruel enough?

128
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:46,918
You’re right.

129
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,667
Chomper! Horrible!

130
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,083
I like that.

131
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,834
All right. Time to stop.

132
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,900
You have to work.

133
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:06,792
Give it to me.

134
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,876
Thank you.

135
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,999
I’ve been having a good time with you.

136
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,709
Especially you, Ling Lingqi.

137
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,042
Qian, shall I also…

138
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,834
What are you talking about?

139
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,417
I’m fired.

140
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,000
You must work harder. Got it?

141
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:23,999
I’ve been working here

142
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,334
for nearly two years.

143
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,459
I can tell that

144
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,667
you’re very talented.

145
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,999
Work hard

146
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,375
and be a good florist.

147
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:31,083
Do you know?

148
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,709
When I get married,

149
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,167
I’ll let you do the flower decoration.

150
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,260
Qian, if you get in trouble,

151
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,584
remember to call us.

152
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:40,918
Okay.

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,834
Bless me.

154
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,292
Hope I won’t have another boss

155
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,417
like Bo Hai.

156
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,334
You won’t. Don’t worry.

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,501
Take care.

158
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,125
Is Bo Hai really the Chomper?

159
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,501
My favorite scallop!

160
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,584
Dream of all girls?

161
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,959
I think it’s just dream

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,834
of drunk girls!

163
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,709
Only a mindless girl like you

164
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,250
will like him!

165
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,125
He wasn’t like that

166
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,584
four years ago.

167
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,751
He was kind and warm.

168
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,167
He even wrote me a card

169
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,334
to encourage me.

170
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,417
That was your imagination.

171
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,209
Have you met him personally?

172
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,250
Sure, I have.

173
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:38,501
He’s on TV.

174
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:39,292
Flower Art Rhapsody.

175
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,584
I’ve been watching it for three years.

176
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,501
I can’t hold it anymore.

177
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on. Let me tell you.

178
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,542
That’s publicity stunt, all right?

179
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,209
Our Marketing Department

180
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,000
is taking care of this.

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,417
I mean, packaging his image.

182
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:55,709
But…

183
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:57,959
He makes such beautiful flowers.

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,501
Can he really be the Chomper?

185
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,042
- Yes. - Yes.

186
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:04,999
Oh, Ling Lingqi.

187
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,542
When you have daydreams

188
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,792
in the comfort zone,

189
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,459
you’re innocent and romantic.

190
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,626
But when you still daydream in the society,

191
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,792
you’ll be stupid.

192
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:14,751
Let’s think about it.

193
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,292
When you were crossed in love,

194
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,083
Bo Hai gave you a bouquet

195
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:21,751
and you fell in love

196
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,459
with him.

197
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,292
Psychologically speaking,

198
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:25,167
it is a way

199
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:27,626
you used to

200
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,042
make up for your love

201
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,000
when you were lost.

202
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,501
That was unreliable.

203
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:33,834
Listen to me.

204
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,918
If you can pull back now,

205
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,083
it may be

206
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,542
a little bit late.

207
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,918
But it’s better than

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,334
losing everything.

209
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:42,626
In other words,

210
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,292
you’ve grown up.

211
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,250
Do I love the wrong man?

212
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,918
You just like Bo Hai.

213
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,209
What’s the big deal?

214
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,042
There are plenty more fish in the sea.

215
00:07:58,751 --> 00:07:59,417
Or…

216
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,584
Shall I introduce a boy to you?

217
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:03,375
Cheers.

218
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:08,459
Let’s enjoy the food.

219
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,417
All right. Stop thinking!

220
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:10,584
Is my love for four years

221
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,042
really coming to an end?

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,918
Stop being obstinate.

223
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:16,667
Ling Lingqi.

224
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,626
His honey trap

225
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,959
no longer works on you.

226
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,501
I still want to thank you.

227
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,501
For consoling me

228
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,918
when I was upset.

229
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,501
But in fact,

230
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,459
I’m not having a crush

231
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,292
on the real you,

232
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,083
but an illusion of mine.

233
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:04,626
Chomper!

234
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,501
I hereby announce that

235
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,626
I’ll no longer

236
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,125
be your fangirl

237
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,000
from now on.

238
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,083
Every young boy and girl

239
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,417
experiences a process

240
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,999
to get rid of his or her idol.

241
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,626
When we keep working hard

242
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,000
and making progress,

243
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,584
we will gradually realize that

244
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:29,918
the idol isn’t as perfect

245
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,209
as we think he is.

246
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,876
I guess

247
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,209
this is the process of growth.

248
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,876
You know what?

249
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,459
The most beautiful girl in our company

250
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,542
Lu Baoni is single again.

251
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:55,584
Really?

252
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,083
Sure.

253
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,375
The long-face guy

254
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,000
from Sales Department told me.

255
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,417
It’s a great chance

256
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,626
for single men like us.

257
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:04,626
What makes you so happy?

258
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,375
I’m telling you. I want her.

259
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,584
You don’t stand a chance.

260
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,417
You have nothing, but long legs.

261
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,999
And you, don’t dream about it.

262
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,626
David, what do you mean?

263
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:16,709
Morning, Baoni.

264
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:17,834
Morning, Baoni.

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,042
Morning, Baoni.

266
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,083
Morning.

267
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:21,792
These are for you.

268
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:23,417
What?

269
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,292
Why do people know I’m single

270
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,459
so fast?

271
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,834
Can’t I have any peace?

272
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:51,459
It’s yours.

273
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,083
It’s yours.

274
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:55,125
And take this.

275
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:56,501
Thank you, Baoni.

276
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:57,417
It’s yours.

277
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:58,417
Thank you, Baoni.

278
00:12:58,792 --> 00:12:59,167
Here.

279
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you, Baoni.

280
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,000
Lu Baoni, should I take this?

281
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:02,999
This is your gift.

282
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,999
Why shouldn’t you?

283
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,042
Such gifts

284
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,834
have piled up in my home.

285
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,709
Take it and ease my burden.

286
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,334
Okay?

287
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,700
= To my Muse Love you, Wang Jianming =

288
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:24,334
It’s not for you.

289
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,375
Why is my computer down?

290
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:37,709
What’s wrong, Baoni?

291
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:38,250
What happened?

292
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,959
My computer is down.

293
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,292
That’s simple.

294
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,250
There must be something wrong

295
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,209
with the graphics card and drive.

296
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,375
It’s okay. I’m experienced.

297
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,000
Let me help you.

298
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,792
Who repaired your computer last time?

299
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:48,542
I did, right?

300
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:48,999
Forget it.

301
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:49,334
- Don’t brag. - Baoni.

302
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:50,626
Let me enter the BIOS

303
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:51,375
and check for you.

304
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:54,959
Please have a look.

305
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,292
This is our sample.

306
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,792
Do you have any requirement

307
00:13:58,834 --> 00:13:59,792
for this design?

308
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,209
The boy I’m attracted to

309
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,334
is gentle and considerate.

310
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,501
Especially when he smiles,

311
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,584
he’s as warm as the sun.

312
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:09,584
In FlowerPlus,

313
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,667
every employee’s first task

314
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:12,959
is to bring wonderful life experience

315
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,292
to customers,

316
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,375
instead of making his own family happy.

317
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:17,292
Besides,

318
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,709
I decide if it’s fair.

319
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,334
Well, I’ll use sunflowers

320
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,876
as the main part.

321
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,125
Then we can…

322
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,959
Excuse me.

323
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,876
Do you know the boy you’re attracted to?

324
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,000
I advise you

325
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,125
to know him better

326
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,125
before buying him a bouquet.

327
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,876
I was attracted to a man, too.

328
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:33,792
But later I realize that

329
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:34,417
he’s different

330
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,125
from what I imagine.

331
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,751
Totally different.

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,167
You must think carefully about it.

333
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,626
What do you mean?

334
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:41,999
I mean…

335
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:42,667
Ling Lingqi!

336
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,542
What nonsense are you talking about?

337
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,709
Apologize to our customer!

338
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,584
Apologize!

339
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,250
Sorry! Sorry!

340
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:51,918
I don’t want it.

341
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,626
There are many flower shops on the street.

342
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:54,876
Do you think you’re the only one?

343
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,417
Don’t go, Miss Liu.

344
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,959
She’s the new intern.

345
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:58,751
Miss Liu.

346
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,792
I made some sense.

347
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,209
What the hell

348
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,792
are you thinking about?

349
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:05,959
I will

350
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,542
report it to the head office

351
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,209
and record it in your intern assessment.

352
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,292
Don’t bother.

353
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,751
I can quit now.

354
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,292
She’s still sleepy. Go.

355
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:14,999
I…

356
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,792
What are you doing?

357
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,292
What do you want?

358
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,959
I should ask you.

359
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,167
What do you want?

360
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,250
I want to quit!

361
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:24,542
Calm down!

362
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,292
I’m crossed in love!

363
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:26,876
You…

364
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,334
You’re never in love!

365
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,626
How can you be crossed in love?

366
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:34,876
I abandoned my major

367
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:35,959
and learnt floriculture.

368
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,667
I applied to work in FlowerPlus

369
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,542
for three years.

370
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,709
All for Bo Hai.

371
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,042
Now I no longer like him.

372
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:40,751
Why must I stay here

373
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:41,999
and be a doormat?

374
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:43,584
Ling Lingqi.

375
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,709
Could you expect something

376
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:46,751
more than Bo Hai?

377
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:47,876
For example,

378
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,375
career or dream?

379
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,459
You look down on me?

380
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,959
I’m encouraging you, all right?

381
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:56,918
Besides,

382
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:58,792
you spent four years

383
00:15:58,918 --> 00:15:59,834
in learning floriculture.

384
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,584
Finally, you work in FlowerPlus.

385
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,250
Don’t be capricious.

386
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:06,250
Anyway,

387
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,417
I’m getting in to write the resignation.

388
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,542
Give it to the manager for me.

389
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:10,959
I’m not coming to work tomorrow.

390
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:12,792
Ling Lingqi.

391
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,792
Look at my son.

392
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:27,834
He’s too honest.

393
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,876
He was asked to be the manager.

394
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:29,584
But he refused.

395
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:30,918
He thought he was young

396
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,584
and insisted on experiencing at grass-roots.

397
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,250
So is my daughter.

398
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,876
She has just worked.

399
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,375
But her boss,

400
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,792
the chairman,

401
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,334
praises her every day

402
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,584
in front of everyone else

403
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,292
for she’s smart and competent.

404
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,375
Yesterday, she told me

405
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:50,751
her boss

406
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,918
asked her to

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,584
take care of a branch.

408
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,417
But I don’t agree.

409
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:56,709
She’s just a girl.

410
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,584
Why must she take care of a branch?

411
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,709
She’ll be exhausted.

412
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,083
Who believes!

413
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,417
Qi. Qi.

414
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,209
Qi, which branch did your boss

415
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,501
ask you to take care of?

416
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:11,999
France?

417
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,417
France.

418
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:14,959
Did you hear that? France.

419
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,209
Qi. Qi. Come over!

420
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:18,375
Is she nuts?

421
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:19,709
Come on!

422
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,459
Stop! Stop! Stop!

423
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,250
Stop!

424
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,167
Her boss

425
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,834
asked her to France

426
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,501
to take care of a branch.

427
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,751
But France isn’t a good place.

428
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,667
There’s no hot water.

429
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,209
The bread is as hard as rock.

430
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:35,709
If she has such meals,

431
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,626
she’ll have a stomachache.

432
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:38,417
She mustn’t go.

433
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,209
Am I right?

434
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,626
Her boss

435
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,375
is the handsome and gentle

436
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,667
caring man

437
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,125
who is always on TV!

438
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,209
What caring man?

439
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,542
He’s the Chomper!

440
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,334
Don’t brag.

441
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:57,417
Sounds as if

442
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:58,667
you have been to France.

443
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,876
Are you still dancing or not?

444
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:04,459
No. No.

445
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,167
No more dancing today.

446
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,292
Enjoy yourselves.

447
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:10,876
Ling Lingqi.

448
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,584
Do you really think you’re an agent?

449
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,292
Instead of helping me,

450
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,417
you made trouble for me.

451
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:16,834
Just now

452
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:17,999
you nearly

453
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,167
expose my lie.

454
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,501
You were lying unacceptably.

455
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:23,584
Would anyone believe you?

456
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,209
I was just chatting and joking

457
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,334
with the neighbors.

458
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,918
You know what?

459
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:32,918
In terms of love,

460
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,292
you’re not as good as others.

461
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,918
Since you were born,

462
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,042
you have never

463
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,209
even held a boy’s hand.

464
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,667
Luckily, you have a good job.

465
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,292
You must work on that.

466
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,000
- Mom. - Let me finish.

467
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:48,667
In fact, I…

468
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:50,417
Your dad and I think

469
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,125
you get the job after all the trouble.

470
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,417
You must be the pride of our family

471
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,626
so that he and I

472
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:56,918
can feel relieved.

473
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,959
Okay, Ling Lingqi?

474
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,891
Hello? Sophie.

475
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,662
Can you stop being selfish?

476
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,222
Hello, who is this?

477
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,626
Should I tell her

478
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,626
I quit my job?

479
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,751
What? You quit?

480
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,375
You quit? Quit?

481
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,459
You quit your job?

482
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,709
Why did you?

483
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:22,667
Why didn’t you consult with us

484
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,083
before you made such a big decision?

485
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,542
Do you know how we feel?

486
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:26,834
You got the job after all the trouble.

487
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,083
Why did you quit?

488
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,334
Why? Why?

489
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,709
What’s wrong with you?

490
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,000
I love my job, Mother.

491
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,334
Shouldn’t you be at work?

492
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,501
Why are you back home?

493
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,334
Is that how you love your job?

494
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,334
No.

495
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,125
I just changed a shift.

496
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:55,000
Hello?

497
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:56,876
Mo Nan.

498
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,709
Match the colors in a lovely way,

499
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,334
according with the design concept
of FlowerPlus.

500
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,834
Make it simple and practical with highlight.

501
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,083
Are you still waiting for me?

502
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,792
Who is waiting for you, Sisi?

503
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,125
My ex-boyfriend.

504
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,334
He went abroad two years ago.

505
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,417
Love You Through the Galaxy.

506
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,417
What a romantic name!

507
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,459
It’s the work of Relief Flower Shop.

508
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:43,751
Look!

509
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,999
Only twelve roses.

510
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,542
They dyed them

511
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:48,292
and created

512
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,918
splendid colors like the galaxy.

513
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,375
Simple,

514
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,292
but still ingenious.

515
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:55,792
Interesting!

516
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:57,999
Come and listen.

517
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,834
Mr. Peng from New York

518
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:03,167
ordered the rose box

519
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,250
Love You Through the Galaxy

520
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,959
for his ex-girlfriend.

521
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:08,792
If she responds

522
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,125
to his confession,

523
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:11,417
he will return to China for business.

524
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:12,626
Otherwise,

525
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,250
he will settle down overseas.

526
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,542
What are you waiting for?

527
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,999
Shall I make the call for you?

528
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,167
Who needs you?

529
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:19,501
I’ll make it myself.

530
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,209
- That’s expecting. - By the way,

531
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:23,417
Relief Flower Shop

532
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,417
is very popular lately.

533
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,751
Even I often view their Weibo

534
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:26,792
and enjoy their designs.

535
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,501
Yeah. I think

536
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,083
this design is better than Mr. Bo’s.

537
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,042
What are you talking about?

538
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,375
We’re in FlowerPlus.

539
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,542
Are you asking for trouble?

540
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,250
No.

541
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,459
Mr. Bo is doing

542
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,792
bigger business.

543
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,584
He makes more money.

544
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:43,999
But he only cares for money.

545
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:45,792
And he’s impersonal.

546
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,209
Look at Relief Flower Shop

547
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,167
and listen to their slogan.

548
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,083
Flowers can’t remove

549
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:53,334
all the sorrow.

550
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,209
But they offer a wonderful start.

551
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,959
Listen. How warm!

552
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,125
How sweet!

553
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:06,542
Mr., Mr. Bo.

554
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:08,292
Mr. Bo, it’s… It’s just something

555
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,209
from low-class designers.

556
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:12,042
We’re just browsing around.

557
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,834
Let me have a look.

558
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:18,876
Relief Flower Shop?

559
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,125
The flowers look good, with a good design.

560
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,417
A better job than yours.

561
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:24,417
Yes. Yes.

562
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:25,667
Learn from them.

563
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,042
Hello, Mr. Bo.

564
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,334
I thought you would be jealous.

565
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,626
Am I that superficial in your eyes?

566
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,660
= Letter of Resignation =

567
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:41,999
I divined

568
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,167
and I knew you would regret.

569
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,250
I said you asked for a leave

570
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,375
because you had a stomachache.

571
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:47,876
That was clever. Thank you.

572
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,083
You’re welcome.

573
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,501
Why are you dressed like this?

574
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:53,042
You’re smartly dressed like a gentleman.

575
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,125
Which girl are you going to flirt with?

576
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,459
Just you!

577
00:22:58,459 --> 00:22:59,209
Will you accept that?

578
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,751
No kidding. I’m working, all right?

579
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,334
Please show some respect

580
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,626
for a white-collar man.

581
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:06,834
Okay. Let’s go.

582
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:07,417
Go.

583
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:09,292
Baoni.

584
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:11,042
What’s your plan after work?

585
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:13,999
Baoni, well…

586
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,417
There’s a Contemporary Art Exhibition tonight.

587
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:16,834
I bought tickets. Let’s go and enjoy it.

588
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,042
Forget about the exhibition.

589
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,334
Baoni, there’s a wonderful

590
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,834
French restaurant nearby.

591
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,918
I booked a table.

592
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:22,834
Shall we go together…

593
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,209
Baoni.

594
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,125
I hear the night scene at Phoenix Mountain

595
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:24,834
is amazing.

596
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:25,417
Shall we go enjoy it?

597
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,083
Forget about the night scene.

598
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,792
Baoni, get in the car. I’ll drive you home.

599
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,999
Since when were you a designated driver?

600
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,042
You’re a designated driver!

601
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:33,542
- Baoni. Seriously… - Seriously…

602
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:34,334
We shall enjoy arts to…

603
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:35,709
Baoni, aren’t you losing weight?

604
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,999
Let’s go climbing the mountain.

605
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,417
Baoni.

606
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,751
This is for you.

607
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:50,334
For me?

608
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:52,292
Take it.

609
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:54,542
What is he doing here?

610
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:55,417
Look at him!

611
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,709
When did he come?

612
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,751
Actually, this is from an untidy

613
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,584
middle-aged man.

614
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:02,751
Our shop just launched

615
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,125
flower delivery service by caring man.

616
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,292
Anyway, I’m the most caring man

617
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,959
in the neighborhood.

618
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,292
I’m just like a sun

619
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,083
in winter.

620
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,667
You were encircled?

621
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,083
With great power comes great responsibility.

622
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:23,667
Let’s go.

623
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:26,709
Baoni.

624
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,751
Look at him! His hand…

625
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,167
Where is he putting his hand?

626
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:30,834
What are you doing?

627
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:32,209
Saving you!

628
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,834
If I don’t take you away,

629
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,375
those intentional guys

630
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,250
will tear you up!

631
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,792
Thank you, my bestie.

632
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:45,375
Sure.

633
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,626
Go. I’ll buy you spicy crayfish.

634
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:47,751
Mo Nan!

635
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:48,999
How dare he take away my girl!

636
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:50,292
Did you hear her?

637
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,292
What bestie?

638
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:52,626
He just wants to be her boyfriend.

639
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:53,459
- Yeah. – Yeah.

640
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,375
Luckily, Mo Nan arrived in time.

641
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,042
Or I would have

642
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,501
enjoyed the exhibition,

643
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,959
had the French meal

644
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:03,709
and in the end,

645
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,125
enjoyed the night scene.

646
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,417
Being a knockout

647
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,667
is really a sweet burden.

648
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:11,334
Mo Nan, anyway,

649
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,626
you’re coming back to the head office.

650
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:13,292
Please help me

651
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,584
with this problem. All right?

652
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,167
Oh, Qi.

653
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:17,375
They gave me

654
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,375
a lot of presents.

655
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,250
I’ll leave some for you.

656
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:23,292
Aren’t you

657
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,209
provoking her?

658
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,459
It’s okay. It’s okay.

659
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,209
The spicy crayfish looks good.

660
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:34,375
Qi, have some more.

661
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:34,959
Okay.

662
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,042
Tastes so good!

663
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:49,876
You…

664
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,250
Slow down.

665
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,125
Today, I finally realize

666
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,417
how you turn anger into appetite.

667
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:15,626
I really admire you!

668
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,626
In fact,

669
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,792
you can’t stop missing Bo Hai.

670
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,292
You admit you fall for the wrong guy.

671
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,459
But you’re still not convinced.

672
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,125
You know what, Qi?

673
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,167
In love,

674
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,083
you must manage to let go.

675
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,375
Then you can live a cool life.

676
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:33,209
Just like me.

677
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,292
In my life,

678
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:39,959
I can’t even let go of my chopsticks.

679
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:42,959
Why don’t you try

680
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,375
shifting your attention?

681
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:48,000
Move away your attention

682
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:48,709
from Bo Hai.

683
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:51,417
That makes sense.

684
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:53,709
But how?

685
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:57,042
The way I’m used to

686
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,000
is

687
00:26:58,834 --> 00:26:59,876
having a new boyfriend.

688
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:03,501
Sorry. Sorry.

689
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,626
Now I know

690
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:08,959
why you have so many

691
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:09,751
unwanted admirers.

692
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:10,375
Lu Baoni.

693
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,042
I admire nobody, but you!

694
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,167
Don’t I make any sense?

695
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:17,709
Yes, you do.

696
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:26,042
Ling Guoliang.

697
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:31,709
What are you doing?

698
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,209
Picking a boy again?

699
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:36,834
Our daughter

700
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,501
still has no boyfriend.

701
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:39,667
just because of

702
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,667
your improper attitude.

703
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:45,417
Me? All right!

704
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,751
Well, let’s think about it.

705
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,209
In the past,

706
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,125
you had blind dates for her, right?

707
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:51,876
You tried so many times.

708
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,042
But she refused.

709
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:54,626
This is different now.

710
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,167
I found something!

711
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,459
She ripped all the posters of Bo Hai

712
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:01,250
off the wall.

713
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,999
What’s wrong?

714
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,667
What do you mean?

715
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:05,751
What wrong can it be?

716
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:06,751
It only means

717
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,751
our daughter’s love life

718
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:09,584
has come to

719
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,042
a turning point.

720
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,375
So, I must arrange

721
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:14,792
a blind date for her.

722
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,375
What if she doesn’t want it?

723
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,167
She doesn’t want it?

724
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:19,834
I’ll go for her!

725
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,918
Babe, you’re back?

726
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,709
May I tell you something?

727
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:27,834
Mom, whenever you call me babe,

728
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,375
you want something. Don’t bother.

729
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,792
Do I always do that?

730
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,584
Yeah. Always!

731
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:34,209
Come on. Qi.

732
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:36,000
I prepared

733
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:37,292
a small date

734
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:39,501
for you.

735
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,209
Go have a look.

736
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,167
If you don’t like him,

737
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:43,375
you can leave immediately.

738
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,167
You’ll lose nothing!

739
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:45,876
I’m not going.

740
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:50,042
Qi, just go.

741
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:51,542
This is our neighbor

742
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:52,501
Fang’s son,

743
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,417
Dahua.

744
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,250
I made inquiries. He’s excellent.

745
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:56,751
A cool man, isn’t he?

746
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,375
Go have a look.

747
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,125
Come over.

748
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,292
I’ll go have a try.

749
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:15,667
Really? You’ll go?

750
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:17,876
Awesome!

751
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:19,459
I’m calling him right away!

752
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,792
Is this dress okay?

753
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,250
Perfect!

754
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,709
Do I look good in this, Mom?

755
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:34,918
You know what, Qi?

756
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:36,584
You’re young,

757
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:38,876
and know more about fashion or taste than me.

758
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,542
But I know more

759
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,501
about Dahua than you do.

760
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,209
Let me explain.

761
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,083
When I carried you,

762
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,250
one day,

763
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,375
I walked on the streets

764
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,292
in this dress.

765
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,000
Everyone there

766
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,209
admired me,

767
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:58,459
including Dahua who was four.

768
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,250
Oh, hurry up! You’re getting late.

769
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,792
You mustn’t be late for a date.

770
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:05,417
Okay.

771
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:06,375
Mom, my bag.

772
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:07,584
I told him

773
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:08,876
you were still working on Saturday

774
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,042
so that you would look

775
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,584
more hardworking.

776
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,167
What? I really helped, huh?

777
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:13,918
Do you feel

778
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,209
I spare no pains?

779
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:15,918
See you.

780
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:16,709
Don’t get the wrong place.

781
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:17,792
- The Cafe. - Okay.

782
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:18,501
Near your shop.

783
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:19,417
I see.

784
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,292
Nancy, get me a cup of Americano.

785
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:28,292
Mr. Bo. Today is the weekend.

786
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,375
I’m not in the office.

787
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:33,709
Oh, I forgot.

788
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,042
Shall I order a take-out for you?

789
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:36,792
No.

790
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,792
I’ll get it downstairs.

791
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:56,334
It’s okay, Ling Lingqi.

792
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,250
You don’t come for a blind date,

793
00:30:58,792 --> 00:30:59,709
but for a cure.

794
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,417
This is the only way

795
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:03,000
to forget Bo Hai.

796
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:05,417
Yes.

797
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,000
Qi.

798
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,751
I’m waiting for you at Table 12.

799
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,751
Is she my real mother? She fooled me!

800
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,834
I can’t afford the cure!

801
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:49,250
Qi.

802
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,250
You arrived, didn’t you?

803
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,501
Why haven’t I seen you yet?

804
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:02,459
Hello.

805
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:03,167
Did you

806
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:03,959
just see

807
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:04,709
a young girl

808
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:05,667
looking for someone?

809
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:06,834
Have something to tell me?

810
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:08,042
Sorry. No.

811
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,667
Could you…

812
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:12,709
Could you change a table?

813
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:13,959
I come for a blind date with a girl.

814
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:14,709
But I don’t know

815
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:15,542
what she looks like.

816
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,375
Thank you. Thank you.

817
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,209
Where has she gone?

818
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,999
Where is she?

819
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:46,834
Where is she?

820
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:52,083
Waitress.

821
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,834
Get me another table.

822
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:55,042
I don’t like to share a table

823
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,000
with a stranger.

824
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,876
Okay. The one next to you is available.

825
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,334
Hello. You must be Qi.

826
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,375
Nice to meet you. I’m Dahua.

827
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,167
You get the wrong person.

828
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,209
No way.

829
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,542
I recognize the dress.

830
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,417
Chomper!

831
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,709
Qi, don’t run!

832
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,626
What bad luck I have!

833
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,042
I was pestered by the bald man

834
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:45,999
the whole afternoon,

835
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,584
just because of the Chomper!

836
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,209
I really had bad luck!

837
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,459
I think it’s good.

838
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,751
It helps you to further realize

839
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:57,000
what kind of man

840
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:57,918
Bo Hai really is.

841
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,334
Stop having any illusion

842
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:00,709
on this man.

843
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,417
Whenever I meet him,

844
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,083
I have bad luck.

845
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,083
You’re ill-matched.

846
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:10,167
Stay away from him.

847
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,292
I figure it out.

848
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,292
If I meet him again,

849
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:14,999
I’ll stay away as far as I can.

850
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,792
I can at least avoid him.

851
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,751
The other day,

852
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,709
you cudgeled your brains

853
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,542
to meet Bo Hai.

854
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,459
But now

855
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:29,542
you’re thinking of

856
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:30,999
how you can avoid him.

857
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,042
What a dramatic life

858
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,250
I’m living!

859
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,709
My mom was weird.

860
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:42,959
She introduced me

861
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,042
a bald man!

862
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,876
That wasn’t the worst part!

863
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,125
I even ran into the Chomper!

864
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,459
Miserable, weren’t I?

865
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:49,501
Today,

866
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:51,209
I was really disgraced!

867
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:51,876
I…

868
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:01,999
Freaked out?

869
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,042
Don’t you know I’m afraid of darkness?

870
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,250
You’re afraid of darkness as an adult?

871
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:12,959
Cockroach! Cockroach!

872
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:14,542
It’s…

873
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:19,292
And you’re afraid of cockroaches!

874
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,584
You made fun of me?

875
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:22,501
I’ll pinch you!

876
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:22,918
I’m serious.

877
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:23,751
Come over! Don’t run!

878
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:24,459
A big one!

879
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:26,459
Look! Look! Look!

880
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,250
Fang.

881
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,417
Aren’t we neighbors?

882
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:39,417
We get on well, don’t we?

883
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,999
Why did you lie to me?

884
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,334
Don’t get angry. Calm down.

885
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:45,209
Look!

886
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,876
Your son in the photo

887
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,042
and your real son.

888
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:51,501
Do they look

889
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,042
even a little bit alike?

890
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:55,999
Don’t get angry! Don’t!

891
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:56,834
PS?

892
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,876
Don’t tell me about that.

893
00:35:59,083 --> 00:35:59,792
You know what?

894
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:00,751
How I wish

895
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:02,209
I could now

896
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:03,083
PS your conscience!

897
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:05,459
Damn it!

898
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,542
All right.

899
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,459
Look at the time.

900
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:11,125
It’s getting late.

901
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,459
Could you stop messing about?

902
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:14,459
I’m messing about?

903
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:15,876
Do you look clearly?

904
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:17,209
Do you?

905
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,667
Do they look alike? Do they?

906
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:19,834
What’s this?

907
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:21,876
This is defrauding for marriage!

908
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,580
Chinese painter Mr. Li Qingzhu enjoys high fame

909
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,209
= Mr. Li Qingzhu’s First Exhibition =
in the international painting circle.

910
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:32,334
He’s very popular with art collectors

911
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:32,999
from different countries.

912
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,125
In the Antwerp Biennial Exhibition

913
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:35,959
last year,

914
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,918
he won the Lifetime Achievement Award.

915
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,667
He was the first Chinese painter

916
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:41,959
to win such an international award.

917
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:43,709
Next week, Mr. Li

918
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,125
will hold his first exhibition

919
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,918
at the Exhibition Center
since he returns to China.

920
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:48,000
The theme will be

921
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,209
flowers that he’s best at.

922
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,959
Therefore, he invites us,

923
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,709
FlowerPlus,

924
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,209
to do the flower decoration

925
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:54,876
for the exhibition as his partner.

926
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,501
You can see that

927
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,083
Mr. Li’s paintings

928
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,667
use wonderful colors.

929
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:05,292
This time,

930
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,459
we will build

931
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,959
a large floral device

932
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,417
known as Mirror Lake.

933
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,000
Different flowers will be

934
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,167
precisely arranged with gradual change,

935
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,375
to contrast the exhibition theme.

936
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:17,375
Mr. Li has

937
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:18,083
approved

938
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,000
this proposal.

939
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,834
He also asked Mr. Bo

940
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:23,667
to complete the Mirror Lake personally.

941
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,459
Our Design Department

942
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:26,834
have been fully prepared

943
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,584
to cooperate with you

944
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:29,834
so that you can complete

945
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:30,834
the design successfully.

946
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,209
Mr. Li is famous.

947
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:35,751
Even the media

948
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:36,999
pay a lot of attention to this exhibition.

949
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:38,417
So,

950
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:41,209
if we succeed, we’ll have a higher fame.

951
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,167
If we lose, we’ll be disgraced.

952
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:45,167
I hope all of you can

953
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,334
gather your strength.

954
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,250
Okay. Dismiss.

955
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,180
= Li Qingzhu =

956
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,000
Have you heard of it?

957
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:14,876
Li Qingzhu’s painting

958
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,417
sells at a rather high price.

959
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,876
I hear even a hundred reporters

960
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:23,999
will go to

961
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,292
his exhibition.

962
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,083
I guess many employees of different shops

963
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,334
will be sent for help.

964
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:32,751
I don’t want to work

965
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:33,918
with the Chomper.

966
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:37,959
I’m so useless.

967
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:39,417
I don’t think they’ll send me.

968
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,751
All right. Stop gossiping.

969
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,501
Xiaohui. Lisa.

970
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,542
Go get ready.

971
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:50,459
This afternoon,

972
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:52,000
go to the Exhibition Center with me for help.

973
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,834
Thankfully, I don’t need to go.

974
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,000
Ling Lingqi.

975
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,459
The intern in Xicheng Road Shop

976
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:00,292
is sick.

977
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,209
Go with us for help

978
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:04,709
and take care of the odd jobs.

979
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,083
I’m going to assign

980
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,209
your missions.

981
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,292
Mr. Bo has

982
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:16,584
a lot of work to do

983
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:17,501
for the thematic floral device.

984
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:19,000
The process is complicated, too.

985
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:19,959
Well.

986
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,125
Xu Yunlu, Song Fang.

987
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,375
You shall help workers

988
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,667
to build the main frame.

989
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:27,292
Liu Minna, Chen Sisi and Ma Xiaoyi.

990
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,834
You shall take care of the plants.

991
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:29,918
The rest of you,

992
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:30,918
just follow me.

993
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:32,167
Let’s take care of

994
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,000
the surrounding problem.

995
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:35,250
Boss, look at those in the front.

996
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,292
Obviously,

997
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,834
they’re inexperienced interns.

998
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:38,709
They haven’t experienced

999
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,918
the high-intensity work you assigned.

1000
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:41,709
And those behind them

1001
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:42,709
are exactly experienced employees

1002
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:44,083
who have suffered before.

1003
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:46,125
But I guess,

1004
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,709
after experiencing the hard work

1005
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:49,125
this time,

1006
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:49,709
few of them

1007
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:50,959
will still adore you.

1008
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:52,959
Over all these years,

1009
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:54,125
you’ve hurt

1010
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:55,792
so many girls!

1011
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,667
Could you focus on your work?

1012
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:00,125
Director Li.

1013
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:01,417
I don’t want to help with

1014
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,876
the flower decoration inside the venue.

1015
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:03,918
I want to work in the lobby

1016
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,459
and help Mr. Bo with the Mirror Lake.

1017
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:06,792
Yeah. What a perfect chance!

1018
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:07,542
Let me go, too.

1019
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:08,334
Hope you can

1020
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:09,918
respect our decision.

1021
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,167
If there’s another chance

1022
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,626
to work with Mr. Bo,

1023
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:14,292
I’ll give priority to you.

1024
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,042
Ling Lingqi, calm down.

1025
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,667
Take a deep breath

1026
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:23,083
and defeat him

1027
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:23,876
with your amazing willpower.

1028
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,167
Good, Ling Lingqi.

1029
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:31,501
You managed to avoid

1030
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,999
Bo Hai’s spell strikes.

1031
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:37,042
Oh, you interns.

1032
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,334
Does anyone of you

1033
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,083
want to carry some flowers?

1034
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,000
Director.

1035
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,501
Do you mean carrying flowers with Mr. Bo?

1036
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:43,584
What are you thinking?

1037
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:45,042
How will Mr. Bo carry flowers?

1038
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:45,751
Right?

1039
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,000
Who wants to go?

1040
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:49,000
I do!

1041
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,459
You do? Okay. Fine.

1042
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:53,417
I’ll leave it to you.

1043
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,834
Okay. Now,

1044
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,209
let’s work separately,

1045
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,417
as planned.

1046
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,000
Let me emphasize one point.

1047
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,334
- You must be careful. - Hello?

1048
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,000
- Okay. I’ll be right there.
- Once you have any problem, don’t hesitate to

1049
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,167
report it to the person in charge

1050
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:06,959
of your department.

1051
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:07,751
Okay?

1052
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:10,000
Then he will collect the problems

1053
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:10,999
and report them to me.

1054
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:12,292
All right. Get to work.

1055
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:12,940
You can’t get in without a certificate.

1056
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,584
= Mirror Lake =
You can’t get in without a certificate.

1057
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:15,709
I come to inspect the site

1058
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,334
on behalf of Mr. Wen.

1059
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,209
His men

1060
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,300
never need a certificate.

1061
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:20,918
Go ask about

1062
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,209
who Mr. Wen Guangqi is

1063
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:23,209
in FlowerPlus.

1064
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:24,417
You’re a security.

1065
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,167
How dare you offend him!

1066
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:26,709
Mr. Shi. Mr. Shi.

1067
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,042
Mr. Shi. Hello. Hello.

1068
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:30,417
The security team

1069
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,417
is outsourced.

1070
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,834
He doesn’t know our people.

1071
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:33,375
Sorry.

1072
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:34,751
Mr. Wen asks me

1073
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,167
to check if you’re careless in work

1074
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,000
or use inferior material.

1075
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,709
Okay. For the sake of Mr. Wen,

1076
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,542
I must accompany you all the way.

1077
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:44,626
This way, please.

1078
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:49,918
Oh no, Chomper!
