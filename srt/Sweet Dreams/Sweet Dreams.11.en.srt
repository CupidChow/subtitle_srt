51
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:44,792
Chomper.

52
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:46,083
Now is working time.

53
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,584
Talking about anything

54
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:48,417
other than work

55
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,042
will get an administrative warning.

56
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:51,667
Attacking your boss

57
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,334
will be subject to an administrative sanction.

58
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:54,584
Three times sanctions

59
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,375
will get you fired.

60
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:02,834
I almost forgot

61
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,959
that you can’t quit.

62
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,042
You can only

63
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,292
stay here.

64
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:10,709
By the way,

65
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:11,751
tonight,

66
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:12,792
an important client’s wedding ceremony

67
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:13,959
requires to use tuberoses

68
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,959
to make a large bead curtain.

69
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,584
This errand is yours.

70
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,167
There are not many tuberoses.

71
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,501
Just tens of thousands.

72
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:24,083
I have never seen

73
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,626
a bad boss like you.

74
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,542
Yi, the ceremony tonight

75
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,375
needs a lot of tuberoses,

76
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,250
so get 20 thousand more.

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,709
Got it, Mr. Bo.

78
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:38,792
I’ll order them now.

79
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:40,999
You…

80
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:45,999
What?

81
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,584
You want more? Alright.

82
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,584
Give me my bag.

83
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:56,042
You bag?

84
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:17,542
Why did you touch my things?

85
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:19,292
That’s my photo.

86
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:21,042
It shouldn’t be there.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,459
So, you admit

88
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:25,375
you are the Chomper.

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,083
Did I interrupt something?

90
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:34,250
Out.

91
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:36,334
Not you.

92
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,876
You. Out.

93
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,584
This is the contract.

94
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,792
Right, Peter said

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,626
the Chinese style product of the

96
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,584
new season will be sent to you later.

97
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,417
Peter specifically stressed that

98
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,000
the new product is still in the secret.

99
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:01,834
He told us to do a good job

100
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:02,667
of confidentiality.

101
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:03,501
Got it.

102
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:05,876
You may leave.

103
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:42,834
Qi,

104
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,751
I have a meeting at 4:30 later.

105
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:44,667
I can help you for

106
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:45,709
another 25 minutes.

107
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,083
Why do we have

108
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,792
such a weirdo in our world?

109
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:51,209
I thought of him

110
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,125
as a myth before.

111
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,083
Now when I think about it,

112
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,125
it feels like a joke.

113
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:00,667
What’s wrong?

114
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,459
Let me see.

115
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,125
Why are you so careless?

116
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,250
Here, let me help you.

117
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,834
Be careful.

118
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:21,834
I’m done.

119
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,125
How about

120
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,125
you just resign?

121
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,125
Change your job.

122
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:32,792
No.

123
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,834
I can’t resign now.

124
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,083
If I continue doing this job,

125
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,167
I really will die young.

126
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,709
For me, you’re already there.

127
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:51,417
Gosh!

128
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,000
I forgot to get that Chomper

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,417
an important document.

130
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,167
I need to go.

131
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:05,999
Mo Nan?

132
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:07,334
Qi.

133
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,709
This is the new plan of Marketing Department.

134
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,167
Mr. Bo needs to sign this.

135
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,125
Then leave it here.

136
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:16,417
No.

137
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:17,667
There are things

138
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,292
I need to discuss with him in person.

139
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:22,083
I will come back later.

140
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,751
Right, Qi,

141
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:28,584
Baoni told me about your job.

142
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:30,083
After I finish my work, I will help you.

143
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,375
That’s my buddy.

144
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:44,792
Good day.

145
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,792
Good day.

146
00:06:59,334 --> 00:06:59,918
I’m exhausted.

147
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:05,792
Isn’t it more appropriate to make

148
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,501
a phone call than just show up?

149
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,083
Congratulations on

150
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,542
Peter’s program.

151
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:11,209
Chen Mo and I

152
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,125
prepared a bottle of

153
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,959
Chateau Mouton Rothschild of 1982.

154
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:15,584
I don’t drink.

155
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,751
How about this Minute Maid of 2018?

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,876
I can drink that wine for you.

157
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,042
I’m warning you.

158
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,250
Don’t mess up the place.

159
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:25,834
Here.

160
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,417
Don’t touch this.

161
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,542
You bought durian?

162
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:54,751
What’s…

163
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,626
What?

164
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:57,459
Put it in.

165
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:58,918
Put it in!

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,501
What’s…

167
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,292
This thing is forbidden in my place.

168
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:07,792
What’s wrong with durian?

169
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,125
It’s cute.

170
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,167
- Cheers. - Cheers.

171
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,125
You’re both doing great

172
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,626
in getting Peter’s program.

173
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,375
Boss, this program can bring

174
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:27,501
a lot of money.

175
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,209
This glass of wine

176
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,417
- is not enough.
- Give us something real.

177
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,918
Fine. Tomorrow morning,

178
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,250
I will notify the Finance Department

179
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:36,542
to give you the first half year’s…

180
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,125
Hold on.

181
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,250
In your eyes, your partners

182
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,250
who start the business with you

183
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:43,501
are so vulgar

184
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:44,459
and value money that much?

185
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:48,876
Then, you two.

186
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,667
What do you want exactly?

187
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:02,792
Xinyan, Xinyan…

188
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,042
Xinyan, you are drunk.

189
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,083
I’m not.

190
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:15,751
Sit up straight.

191
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,667
This is creative.

192
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:22,999
Sit up straight.

193
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,792
Bo Hai, how about

194
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:27,834
I give it a go?

195
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:29,999
A go for what?

196
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,542
You are making things worse.

197
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,709
You are disgusting.

198
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,250
Xinyan, Xinyan.

199
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,375
Sit properly.

200
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,125
How about another round?

201
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,083
We three are close.

202
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:51,876
One kiss

203
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,501
is all right.

204
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,626
Don’t let her drink.

205
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,417
Slow down.

206
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,083
Chen Mo,

207
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:06,792
send her…

208
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,417
Bo Hai,

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,999
I need to tell you something.

210
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:10,709
OK. OK.

211
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,375
For all these years,

212
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:14,209
I’ve been waiting for you.

213
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,709
You know I like you.

214
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,125
You know it, right?

215
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,959
I’m not drunk.

216
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,918
I’m not.

217
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,334
There’re things I could tell you

218
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,375
only after I drink some wine.

219
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,626
Do you understand?

220
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:28,959
I didn’t

221
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,125
dare to tell you.

222
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,959
Well, sit up straight. Then talk.

223
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,042
Sit up straight.

224
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:37,792
Chen Mo.

225
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,250
I think I should leave.

226
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,792
Leaving now?

227
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,459
You bought the wine.

228
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,501
You take care of her.

229
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:45,125
I’m not leaving.

230
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,042
I’m not done yet.

231
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,542
I mean him.

232
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,792
You sit up straight, Xinyan.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,501
Let go of me. I was talking to him.

234
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,751
How to get her leave like this?

235
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:22,584
Are you alright?

236
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:28,751
Want some candy?

237
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,000
I have adored him secretly

238
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,626
since college.

239
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,542
I’ve been there for him

240
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,918
for so many years.

241
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,000
Why did he

242
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,709
still refuse me?

243
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,792
Xinyan, don’t cry.

244
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:11,959
It’s not only you.

245
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,000
He refuses all women.

246
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,709
Bo Hai is such an idiot

247
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,209
when it comes to love.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Five years.

249
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,501
The company grows from three people

250
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:30,999
to today’s

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,876
group with more than 800 people.

252
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:34,918
Sometimes,

253
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,459
when I was looking at the mirror,

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,999
I felt like

255
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:44,626
I got more wrinkles here

256
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,375
and another dark spot there.

257
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,999
I asked myself.

258
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,751
I put my youth into this.

259
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,542
Does it worth?

260
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,042
Of course it does.

261
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,292
You know it does.

262
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,125
That’s why you do it.

263
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:04,626
Yes.

264
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,209
Because I believe

265
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,626
the one who can open Bo Hai’s heart

266
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:10,334
in the end

267
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,584
will be me.

268
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,999
Alright. Xinyan, don’t cry.

269
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,375
You still have me.

270
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,125
If someday

271
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,417
you become an old woman

272
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:28,542
covered with wrinkles,

273
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:30,042
then I could

274
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,417
show some mercy

275
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,792
and accept you.

276
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,751
Back off.

277
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:46,667
I didn’t order enough.

278
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:57,834
Braised Spare Ribs in Brown Sauce.

279
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,167
Sweet-and-sour Fish.

280
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:03,918
But too sour.

281
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,042
When it comes to eat,

282
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,542
Qi becomes selfish.

283
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,459
She invited you to eat downstairs.

284
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:13,501
You refused

285
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,417
and insisted on eating instant noodles with me.

286
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,125
I saw you

287
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,292
all alone by yourself.

288
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,000
So I condescended to stay with you.

289
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,042
How dare you say that?

290
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:28,999
To be honest,

291
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,000
your life quality is really bad.

292
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,918
You just eat this

293
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:33,834
by yourself every day?

294
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,292
Why not change flavors?

295
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,042
I did.

296
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,626
Three days of a week I eat braised beef flavor

297
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:42,626
and other three days for Lao Tan Pickled Cabbage.

298
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,209
Sunday is Seafood flavor instant noodles.

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,417
You’re unbelievable.

300
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,167
You don’t care much

301
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:03,876
about what you eat.

302
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:04,709
But you like to play

303
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,042
this childish toy.

304
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:12,459
This is not a toy.

305
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:14,667
This is a timer.

306
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,792
It can materialize

307
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:17,834
abstract time.

308
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:20,999
Turn the hourglass upside down.

309
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,501
Running out of sand

310
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,709
takes an hour.

311
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,999
Falling from above

312
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,459
takes a moment,

313
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:28,709
but it changes fast.

314
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:30,751
Because of work,

315
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:31,999
I am strict about time.

316
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,751
So I take it with me all the time.

317
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:36,751
Aren’t you

318
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,334
just doing planning?

319
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:47,626
Such deep words

320
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:48,584
coming out of your mouth

321
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,167
is hilarious.

322
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,125
I was too dramatic.

323
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:17,584
Bad news!

324
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,501
AiFan Household’s new product design

325
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:20,417
was leaked.

326
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,209
In two minutes,

327
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:23,792
the news was already

328
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,417
spread by mainstream media.

329
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,375
What about Peter…

330
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,620
= Peter =

331
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:32,999
What’s going on?

332
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,209
Isn’t this our company’s

333
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,083
new design?

334
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:36,876
- Yes. – Yes.

335
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,125
How come it was leaked?

336
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:38,876
No idea.

337
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,584
Who did this?

338
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,792
Look!

339
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:44,042
AiFan Household’s

340
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,250
new product design was leaked.

341
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,584
That’s our work.

342
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,501
Who did this?

343
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:51,459
There must be someone

344
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:52,918
who leaked the news.

345
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,751
Not everyone

346
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,334
has the access to the design.

347
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,959
Leaked? No way!

348
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,083
Isn’t it our company’s

349
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,334
latest design?

350
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,209
What are you looking at?

351
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:03,292
We…

352
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,083
Excuse me.

353
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:12,584
I deeply understand

354
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,876
your feelings now.

355
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,626
If this thing

356
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,999
turns out to be our responsibility,

357
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,334
we will do as fast as we can

358
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,751
to give you a satisfactory answer.

359
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:21,334
Goodbye.

360
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,209
What now?

361
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:27,999
Find out

362
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,417
how the design gets out.

363
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,709
It’s quite obvious.

364
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:31,375
There must be

365
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,709
a hidden traitor inside our company.

366
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,209
It’s just awful.

367
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:34,999
We work so hard

368
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,000
to get clients.

369
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,667
Now it’s in vain.

370
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,375
If I find out who did this,

371
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:40,042
I will beat

372
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,292
this person up.

373
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,042
Who is it?

374
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,125
The new design

375
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,250
was classified.

376
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,834
Not everyone knows about it.

377
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:48,709
All files

378
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,167
were in Mr. Bo’s computer.

379
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,751
We need to pin down people who

380
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,501
have access to his computer.

381
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,334
Let’s make a list.

382
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,459
Mr. Bo.

383
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:56,999
Secretary Chen.

384
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:58,292
Director Zhou.

385
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,375
And me.

386
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:04,709
Hello?

387
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:07,209
Yes.

388
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,417
The Chomper calls me.

389
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:11,125
I’m coming.

390
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,501
Is it Ling Lingqi?

391
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,501
How is that possible? What are you thinking?

392
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:28,876
So, you are saying

393
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,417
I am the one who leaked it.

394
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:36,292
I do want to make a prank on Mr. Bo.

395
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:36,626
But,

396
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,250
I won’t choose

397
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,292
to fight dirty.

398
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:41,042
Besides,

399
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:41,626
this low trick

400
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:42,709
could be broken in three minutes,

401
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:43,709
why would I choose this way?

402
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,709
Stop pretending.

403
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:47,542
This is huge.

404
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:48,751
If we don’t have evidence,

405
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,375
we wouldn’t suspect you.

406
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,083
The design was transferred

407
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:52,751
last night.

408
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:53,667
And this morning,

409
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,167
we have this leaked news.

410
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:56,042
Besides Mr. Bo,

411
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,083
you were the only one

412
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,834
who have been in this office.

413
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,250
Just because I went into this office

414
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:00,918
to get files,

415
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:01,542
you accuse me

416
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,626
of being a hidden traitor?

417
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,167
You are trampling people

418
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:04,959
to mud and ashes.

419
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:05,751
Don’t we have surveillance

420
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:06,375
around the office?

421
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,667
Go check them.

422
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,375
You did this after

423
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,542
you were ready.

424
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,209
That’s why the camera

425
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,167
was damaged.

426
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:13,334
So, you don’t have evidence.

427
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,501
Then why are you slinging mud at me?

428
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,999
The cleaner is the witness.

429
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:16,751
She saw you

430
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,334
walking out of this office.

431
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,792
But there was…

432
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:23,667
Mo Nan?

433
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:25,292
Qi.

434
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:26,751
No,

435
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:28,918
I can’t drag him into this.

436
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,626
There was what?

437
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:32,459
There was no good

438
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,792
for me in this.

439
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,542
Your real boss is not Mr. Bo,

440
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:39,626
but Mr. Wen.

441
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,334
It’s not me.

442
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,292
Ling Lingqi,

443
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,250
the way you pretend

444
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,667
is really disgusting.

445
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,959
Believe it or not,

446
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,999
I didn’t do it anyway.

447
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,250
I heard that when people are depressed,

448
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,876
eating sweets makes them feel better.

449
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:39,209
Mo Nan,

450
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,792
do you believe me?

451
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:47,250
Ling Lingqi,

452
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,751
even if the world doesn’t believe you,

453
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,167
as long as you say you didn’t do it,

454
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,042
I believe you.

455
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,334
I read you right.

456
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:02,334
I didn’t tell them about you.

457
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,250
Qi,

458
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,501
why didn’t you

459
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,000
tell them about me?

460
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
I don’t know about others,

461
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:17,918
but I know you.

462
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:19,959
There is no way you are the hidden traitor.

463
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:22,083
I am just unlucky.

464
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,751
So, I became their target.

465
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:25,876
How could I drag

466
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,125
you down to this?

467
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:36,792
Secretary Chen said

468
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:39,250
the company is still looking into this.

469
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:47,834
I hope this could

470
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,000
end soon.

471
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:03,959
FlowerPlus is

472
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,209
a hot mess now.

473
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,501
I heard that Peter

474
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,000
has already reached out to his lawyer.

475
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,000
All thanks to

476
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,250
our stealth killer.

477
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,292
Go deep inside enemy and win by surprise.

478
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:17,334
Yes.

479
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,167
The headquarter sent us

480
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:19,459
a really good specialist.

481
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:21,876
Two years ago,

482
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,000
he sued

483
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,459
a cosmetics company

484
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,542
for unwarranted patent infringement

485
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,584
in a U.S. local court.

486
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:31,334
DREAM took advantage of it.

487
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:32,709
In six months,

488
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,042
the acquisition was completed.

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
A year ago, he guided public opinion

490
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,542
and made a false news case

491
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,999
bubbling with noise.

492
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:42,999
The fashion websites involved

493
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,167
were sold to DREAM

494
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:46,626
at half of the original valuation price.

495
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,000
It only took four months.

496
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:51,042
I wondering this time,

497
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,751
would our specialist

498
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,751
set a new record again?

499
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,999
The first time William sent you here,

500
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,751
I doubt if he

501
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:06,999
should appoint

502
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,125
such an important job

503
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:09,417
to a boy.

504
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,876
I didn’t expect you

505
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,083
to be such a tough character.

506
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:26,501
I wish our first battle a success

507
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,167
and all success after.

508
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:28,918
I go inside FlowerPlus

509
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,125
because I want to fulfil

510
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,417
my ambition.

511
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:32,709
But you,

512
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,999
for a little profit,

513
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,542
you betrayed

514
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,209
your benefactor and boss.

515
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:38,918
Willingly embrace

516
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,250
the enemy.

517
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:42,417
I’m not like you.

518
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:44,918
What do you mean?

519
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,709
I mean

520
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:51,292
your boss and I

521
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,167
just sit on a boat temporarily

522
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,083
to achieve

523
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,959
a common goal.

524
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,667
After getting off the boat…

525
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,042
If we are not the same,

526
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,999
how come we sit here together?

527
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:04,459
I’m leaving.

528
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:06,250
Shi Ji, show Mr. Mo the way out.

529
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:06,709
No need.

530
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,209
Don’t come close

531
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:10,626
to me anymore.

532
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,209
Isn’t he just a business spy?

533
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:23,417
Copy some files.

534
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,542
How hard could that be?

535
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,417
Look how arrogant he is.

536
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,334
He is William’s favorite.

537
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,626
We need to be careful with him.

538
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,876
Be smart.

539
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:35,709
Yes.

540
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:57,999
Ji Bin.

541
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,250
Mr. Mo, long time no see.

542
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:07,250
The project in Nice

543
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,459
was finished.

544
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:10,042
I specially asked William

545
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,083
to send me here to help, are you happy?

546
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:14,999
It’s good you are here.

547
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,542
I don’t need to do this all alone

548
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,083
and have no one to talk.

549
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:19,999
By the way,

550
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:21,667
I moved to a female colleague’s place.

551
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,709
The balcony.

552
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:30,667
You need to be careful when you are around.

553
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:31,876
Don’t be suspicious.

554
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,751
Sure.

555
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,083
There’s another thing

556
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:36,999
I don’t quite understand.

557
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:38,000
In Europe, you

558
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,709
were a high-level white collar.

559
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,667
Why did you come back and suffer this?

560
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,876
FlowerPlus is a tough bone to chew.

561
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:44,999
Otherwise,

562
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,042
William wouldn’t invite me

563
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,375
to handle the business.

564
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,584
Right. According to the company’s practice,

565
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,417
as long as you finish the task,

566
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:53,501
William should promote you

567
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:54,834
to President of Asia Pacific.

568
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:56,417
Think about this.

569
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,167
It’s worth the trouble.

570
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,083
You won the first battle.

571
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:05,834
Why are you still

572
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:06,709
unhappy?

573
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,375
I’m just too tired recently.

574
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,209
I always feel like

575
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,000
the one behind this

576
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,501
must be Wen Guangqi.

577
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,209
But this Ling Lingqi,

578
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,959
did Wen Guangqi buy her over?

579
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:36,667
Did she get something out of this

580
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,042
so she betrayed the company?

581
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:41,501
But she is

582
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,125
always giggling

583
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,459
and doesn’t care about things.

584
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:44,959
She doesn’t look like that kind of person.

585
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,209
Don’t you think

586
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,501
the words she said in the office

587
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:48,709
sound true?

588
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,626
So I think

589
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,584
there may be something else.

590
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,709
Something else or not,

591
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,709
before we have conclusive evidence,

592
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,667
Ling Lingqi is still suspicious.

593
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,375
Bo Hai, you always have grudges

594
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:04,959
against her.

595
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,250
Are you trying to kick her

596
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:07,751
when she is down?

597
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,375
Do I look like that kind of person?

598
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:11,292
You do.

599
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:14,626
Do me a favor.

600
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:21,542
The cleaner said

601
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,792
she only saw me walking out

602
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,334
of the office.

603
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:26,626
Did she already

604
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:27,792
colluded with Wen Guangqi?

605
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:30,042
So they want me to be a scapegoat.

606
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,626
Ling Lingqi, you can’t be

607
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:33,459
so dark because

608
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:34,834
you are wronged.

609
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,083
You need make things clear

610
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,334
before you make a decision.

611
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,751
Hi, mister.

612
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:41,501
Did you

613
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:42,125
see that

614
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:43,125
cleaning lady?

615
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,918
Ma Guihua?

616
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:46,834
She went to clean the Glass House.

617
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,626
The Glass House. Thanks.

618
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,375
I heard your cooperation with

619
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:14,834
AiFan went wrong.

620
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:17,876
Mr. Wen should know

621
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:19,751
about that better than anyone else.

622
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,334
Why are you so careless?

623
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,042
Well, you are young.

624
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,584
With your passion,

625
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,334
you manage this big company

626
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,125
all by yourself.

627
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,000
It’s really hard.

628
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,292
You don’t need to work so hard.

629
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,209
Give me a sign,

630
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,751
and DREAM could be

631
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:43,334
your most solid support.

632
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:46,459
You are right.

633
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:48,626
You can’t manage a company

634
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:50,334
just by being enthusiastic.

635
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
At a critical moment,

636
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,626
one needs to be tough.

637
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,417
Doing business is like fighting a battle.

638
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,292
Before the war,

639
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,626
the commander uses the traitor’s blood

640
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:08,709
to ask for blessing.

641
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,999
Mr. Wen, take care.

642
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:27,792
The whole company

643
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,375
knows that I testified against you.

644
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:30,959
Do you have a grudge

645
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,375
and try to revenge?

646
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,876
No, Auntie.

647
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,000
It wasn’t me!

648
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:43,792
Mr. Bo,

649
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,250
I don’t want to hurt you.

650
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:45,999
Even if I do,

651
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:46,542
I wouldn’t choose

652
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,542
that way.

653
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:48,959
I’m not that kind of person.

654
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,626
Then what kind of person are you?

655
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,209
You just refreshed

656
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,584
my understanding of being despicable.

657
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:57,876
Don’t you forget that

658
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,417
I still get the goods on you.

659
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:01,042
You used this

660
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:02,918
despicable way against me.

661
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:03,792
Should I do the

662
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:04,292
same and

663
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,000
destroy you?

664
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:07,292
Don’t you dare.

665
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,709
I will fight you to the end.

666
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:11,209
Good.

667
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:12,751
I’d like to see

668
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,584
what else you can do.

669
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,959
Ling Lingqi, I always thought

670
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,709
you were just a shallow fool.

671
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,999
I didn’t expect you to be so dark

672
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:20,709
and scheming.

673
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,918
Wen Guangqi could

674
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:22,792
pay for your conscience.

675
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,667
So could I.

676
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,501
Why didn’t you ask me?

677
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:28,292
Maybe my price is higher.

678
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,167
Anyway,

679
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:30,999
I will make you and

680
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:32,417
Wen Guangqi pay.

681
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:37,334
Bo Hai, you fool!

682
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,042
Well, this is

683
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,626
quite interesting.

684
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,375
Suddenly, there is a scapegoat

685
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:03,209
saving us a lot of trouble.

686
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:04,918
Go make AiFan’s news

687
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,459
more interesting.

688
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,999
This show is getting better and better.

689
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:23,876
People’s artist!

690
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,501
You almost got me.

691
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:26,751
Did you see

692
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:27,542
Wen Guangqi’s face?

693
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:28,999
He totally believed it.

694
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:31,334
Next,

695
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:32,250
we will

696
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,334
do things our way.

697
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:35,918
That poor Ling Lingqi.

698
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,792
She cried so hard.

699
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,292
Why are you doing business?

700
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:41,959
You should be

701
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,042
in a TV series.

702
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,292
And you can take me with you.

703
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:45,167
You play a prince,

704
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:46,334
and I can be your emperor.

705
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:49,125
Shut it.

706
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:10,876
Qi.

707
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:19,876
Qi, are you alright?

708
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:25,200
Goodness! What happened to you, Mom?

709
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,000
How do I look?

710
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:30,834
I went to the mall today.

711
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,167
When passing by the cosmetics counter,

712
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:33,876
the clerk recommended it.

713
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,250
It is said that this color is good.

714
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:36,876
I think it’s great, too.

715
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,459
I tired the color for you.

716
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,667
You know?

717
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:40,918
It’s popular.

718
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,250
A boy-killer’s color.

719
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:50,209
I want to kill him now.

720
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,042
He misjudged me?

721
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,334
I was wrong about him!

722
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,417
I was blind.

723
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,375
A person with so many problems.

724
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:08,999
Can everyone

725
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,209
be a president now?

726
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,709
He is a bad person

727
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:12,751
with abnormal personality.

728
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:13,626
And his brain

729
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:14,292
is not working at all.

730
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:15,876
Anyone could be a president now, right?

731
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:16,709
I hate

732
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:17,959
this kind of hypocritical moneybags.

733
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:24,626
Did he think a person

734
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:25,792
like him could also

735
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
be a domineering president?

736
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,334
Qi, drink some water.

737
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:37,209
Don’t choke yourself.

738
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:44,083
“My price is higher.”

739
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:49,876
Qi,

740
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,209
what’s your plan?

741
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,959
What else can I do?

742
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,042
This is the 21st century now.

743
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:55,876
They can’t have things their way

744
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:57,334
and wrong a good person.

745
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:59,584
The truth will come out.

Mo Nan,

749

what are you thinking?

750
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,626
She is being treated unjustly.

751

He is worried

00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,667
about me.

753
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,542
Right, Mo Nan?

754
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:23,999

new design.

763
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,250
I’d like to ask some questions about it.

Fine.

Hello, FlowerPlus.

We just

781
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:25,292
knew about this.

Sorry, no comment.

For any

785
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,542
irresponsible words,

786
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:32,501
we reserve the right

= Meeting Room MR =

789
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:37,667
The Sales Department received

790
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:38,626
many phone calls

791
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:39,999
from some major clients.

792
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:40,876
Because of the incident of AiFan Household,

793
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:44,834
two clients have decided

794
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,876
not to cooperate with us.

795
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,042
The current PR crisis

796
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,083
is escalating.

797
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,959
The Brand Department has

798
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,417
tried every way to refute the rumor.

799
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:57,542
But the result is not ideal.

800
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,834
Our shops are also under great pressure.

801
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:02,292
There are several shop managers

802
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,209
now reporting that

803
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,292
reporters went to shops

804
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,083
and made requests for filming and interviews.

805
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:08,000
Although we rejected them

806
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,334
and forwarded to the Brand Department,

807
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:10,375
it still

808
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:11,667
affected the customer’s

809
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,292
consumption experience after all.

810
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:21,584
Peter

811
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,209
refused to meet with our men.

812
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,417
And also,

813
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:25,542
he sent two men down

814
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,000
and said awful things.

815
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,167
So,

816
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,042
I think peaceful negotiation

817
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,042
is impossible.

818
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,918
Alright.

820
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:43,876
about AiFan,

821
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:44,876
our year-end bonuses

822
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:46,167
are gone.

823
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:48,751
Seriously?

824
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:50,000
I’m waiting for that money

825
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,417
to travel.

826
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:53,876
That’s all on Ling Lingqi.

827

Shameless!

828
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:56,834
Keep your voice down.

829
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,626
I don’t understand.

830
00:37:58,918 --> 00:37:59,918
A person like her

831
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,999
should leave the company now.

832
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:18,459
Who did this?

833
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,100
= FlowerPlus Personnel Regulations =

834
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:34,667

Take this and write it 20 times.

836
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:40,083
Isn’t this the company’s personnel regulations?

837
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:41,375
We got this when we join the company.

838
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:42,375
Why do I have to copy?

839
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:43,918
Because recently,

840
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,584
there was a confidential leak.

841
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,209
As a director,

842
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:48,209
I believe it is necessary

843
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,834
to issue Personnel Regulations again

844
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,501
to rectify the company’s discipline.

845
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:53,125
What important documents

846
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:54,083
do you want to copy

847
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:55,209
so you can leak

848
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,167
company’s secrets again?

849
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,334
A traitor like you

850
00:38:58,667 --> 00:38:59,459
should write the regulations

851
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:00,292
many times.

852
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:01,542
So you can remember it.

853
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:16,999
20 times?

854
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,542
- 20 times! - 20 times!

855
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:19,900
Right.

856
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,220
Let me tell you.

857
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,876
This time she is done.

858
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:22,792
I guess after she finished it,

859
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,000
her hand must have been wasted.

860
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:25,792
What did you say?

861
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:28,959
Baoni, I…

862
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,792
Who let Qi copy the regulations?

863
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,167
Baoni, most of the time,

864
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:36,417
when you ask me something,

865
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,584
I tell you the truth.

866
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,709
But, in face of major issues of principle,

867
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,167
I have my rules,

868
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:43,459
and I can’t tell you.

869
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,000
You two,

870
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:53,542
go and apologize to Ling Lingqi.

871
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:54,834
Are you kidding me?

872
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,083
Who is the one should make an apology?

873
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,167
Lu Baoni.

874
00:39:58,501 --> 00:39:59,292
I know you and Ling Lingqi

875
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,250
are BFFs.

876
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:02,459
But I suggest you not get into this.

877
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,334
Ling Lingqi betrayed us.

878
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,959
To copy the regulations

879
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,209
is just a small punishment.

880
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,125
I say it one more time.

881
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,918
Go and apologize to Ling Lingqi.

882
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,167
Who do you think you are?

883
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:12,999
How dare you

884
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:13,834
bossing us around?

885
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:15,167
Look how angry

886
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,334
she is!

887
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:17,334
Maybe,

888
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,000
she is an accessory.

889
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:19,999
What did you say?

890
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,209
Watch your mouth.

891
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:22,209
You dare to make a move!

892
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:23,083
I did it, so what?

893
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:24,709
You are the hidden traitor and you beat people.

894
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:25,542
Are you really taking the company

895
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,459
as a food market?

896
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:29,542
Outrageous!

897
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:32,167
They are fighting!

898
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,209
Let go of me!

899
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:35,792
Stop! Stop it!

900
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:36,334
Let go!

901
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:37,083
Sisi!

902
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:37,501
Let go!

903
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:38,876
Stop!

904
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:45,000
Crap!

905
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,626
My beautiful face!

906
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:50,125
- Be gentle! - I’m sorry.

907
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,250
I’ll be more careful.

908
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:56,709
I’m sorry, Baoni.

909
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:58,375
It’s my fault.

910
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,709
What does this have to do with you?

911
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:01,876
It’s not your fault.

912
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,375
They bully you with no reason.

913
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:05,667
Besides,

914
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:06,792
you are my sis.

915
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,250
I should take care of you.

916
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,459
If you were a man,

917
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:12,250
I would marry you.

918
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,667
It’s cruel that you two

919
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,167
are doing this in front of me.

920
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:18,334
And also,

921
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,876
we are good friends.

922
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,209
We agreed you should’ve called me

923
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,751
before you got into a fight.

924
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:23,918
That’s not a fight.

925
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,792
Just jostling each other.

926
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:28,459
Qi,

927
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,334
I can’t take this no more.

928
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:31,792
They are bullying you like this.

929
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:33,501
Are you going to take it?

930
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:34,709
No.

931
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:35,584
We are going to fight back.

932
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:36,292
Fight back!

933
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:37,999
With fist or words?

934
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:38,834
It doesn’t matter.

935
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:39,584
There are only three of us.

936
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,209
Can we really beat

937
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:40,999
tens of them?

938
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,626
