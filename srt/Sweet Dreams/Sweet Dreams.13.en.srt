51

The assistant to president

52
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,125
is actually just

53
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,042
an errand girl.

54
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,959
And I was even mistaken as a hidden traitor.

55
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,250
I…

56
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,292
I am really good for nothing.

57
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,167
OK, dear.

58
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:00,959
Forget it.

59
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,751
Qi,

60
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,876
we don’t know

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,375
what happened to you in the company.

62
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,042
But we know

63
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,000
our child well.

64
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,125
Although you have many weaknesses,

65
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,542
you are

66
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,167
the kindest girl.

67
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:19,542
Your dad is right.

68
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,334
Qi is a good girl,

69
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,834
but she’s not weak

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,417
that everyone can push her over,

71
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:24,918
right?

72
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:25,959
She’s like me on this point.

73
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:26,542
You also got

74
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:27,709
a best ability

75
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:28,626
that no matter

76
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,918
what setbacks you suffer,

77
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,584
you can always

78
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,834
come alive stronger!

79
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,751
She’s like me

80
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:35,792
on this point.

81
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,292
Qi, who said those words

82
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,125
to you?

83
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,125
Tell me,

84
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:41,834
I’ll go find him,

85
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,083
whoever he is.

86
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,751
Your heart is soft,

87
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,000
so you’re reluctant to do this.

88
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:48,959
I’m afraid of no one.

89
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,167
I’ll go with you to work today.

90
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,709
I’m gonna confront them.

91
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:55,209
I wanna see

92
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,959
who the hell are they

93
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,501
say that about my daughter.

94
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,834
No, no.

95
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,083
Your mom is too impulsive.

96
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:03,792
Well, Qi,

97
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:04,417
I’m telling you,

98
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,375
About this,

99
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:06,959
you can think in the other way.

100
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,334
One’s temper has something

101
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:10,918
to do with how much they suffer

102
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,250
and how deep they’re misunderstood.

103
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,959
The more you suffer,

104
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,250
the deeper you’re misunderstood,

105
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,083
the broader your mind

106
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:18,959
and the better your temper will be.

107
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,250
Ling Guoliang, your outlook is totally wrong.

108
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,125
What?

109
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,584
Is it good to lose out?

110
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,667
How’ my outlook is wrong?

111
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,000
’What I said is chicken soup for the soul,

112
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:28,501
you understand?

113
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,751
That’s spiritual victory.

114
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,334
Don’t listen to your father.

115
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,626
Qi, whoever did this to you,

116
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:32,959
let’s return like for like.

117
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,375
My dear,

118
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:38,042
well,

119
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,375
you’re clear about

120
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,542
what we mean.

121
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:43,626
No matter what happens,

122
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,584
we’re proud of you.

123
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:53,542
Don’t, don’t.

124
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,834
Don’t cry, try your new shoes.

125
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:55,959
Don’t cry.

126
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,250
Come, try your new shoes.

127
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:58,959
Come on, try them on.

128
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,459
There, there.

129
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,542
Your new shoes, size them up.

130
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:04,792
Come, dear.

131
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,292
Come on, you look ugly now.

132
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:06,999
Stop crying.

133
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:07,918
Try them on, stop crying.

134
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,125
Try them on.

135
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,083
Don’t cry, my poor little baby.

136
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,125
Put them on.

137
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,083
Come on, Dad is putting them on.

138
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,584
Don’t cry.

139
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,876
Come on!

140
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:32,000
Hi!

141
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:33,417
Qi.

142
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:33,751
Morning.

143
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:34,584
Morning.

144
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:35,667
What are you doing?

145
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,959
I thought about it.

146
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,792
How about you resign?

147
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,042
I have some

148
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,125
HR friends who might

149
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,584
help you find a new job,

150
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,042
with salary

151
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,667
not less than in FlowerPlus!

152
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,667
What do you think?

153
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,792
Thank you

154
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,042
for your kindness.

155
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:56,042
But I’m not resigning.

156
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,542
Why?

157
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,292
If I leave,

158
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,999
I must leave with my innocence returned.

159
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,417
The truth of the leak hasn’t come to light.

160
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,250
If I

161
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:07,542
quit now,

162
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:08,584
it means I’ve admitted

163
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,918
that I’m the hidden traitor.

164
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,999
So I can’t just wait

165
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,250
for the truth to come out.

166
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,000
Moreover, Bo Hai is probably

167
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,209
waiting to see me as a fool.

168
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:18,042
He’ll definitely not help me

169
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:18,834
but might push me over

170
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,959
to pour oil on the flames.

171
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,876
My parents are right.

172
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:25,999
I must pull myself together,

173
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,125
and stop being a sitting duck.

174
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,292
I’m the only one who can save me!

175
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,959
Why you’re a bit different today?

176
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,501
You tell me.

177
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,876
New shoes?

178
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,375
My parents bought for me.

179
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,000
Look good?

180
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,292
So I’m going to

181
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,667
unleash the magic in my body!

182
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:46,959
Come on! Let’s go.

183
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,042
Hurry up, we’re late!

184
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:12,584
Ling Guoliang!

185
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:15,999
Where did you buy these shoes for Qi?

186
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,250
In our community.

187
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:21,667
From that swindler

188
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:22,876
who is selling knockoffs?

189
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,584
High imitation.

190
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,209
Qi won’t tell.

191
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,375
Saved us a lot of money.

192
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:28,999
Ling Guoliang!

193
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,542
I don’t care if you’re stingy

194
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:32,626
with money,

195
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:33,792
but it’s your own daughter!

196
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,876
I really wanna slap on your face!

197
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,060
= Chairman of the Borad CB =

198
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,083
Bo Hai!

199
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,209
Do you really think

200
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,000
I’m the hidden traitor

201
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:50,876
who is bribed by Wen Guangqi?

202
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,209
I don’t care who the hidden traitor is.

203
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:55,000
I only care

204
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,584
how to solve the crisis here.

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,501
You think

206
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,459
money is always above

207
00:06:59,459 --> 00:06:59,918
the others’ dignity,

208
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:00,959
do you?

209
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,334
It wasn’t me.

210
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,250
So I want you to apologize

211
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,459
for what you did to me,

212
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,125
in these two day

213
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,125
Right now!

214
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:13,626
You think

215
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:14,792
your

216
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,209
ridiculous momentum

217
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,542
could make you get rid of

218
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,584
what you did?

219
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,876
You arrogant asshole!

220
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:25,209
You think you can wrong people

221
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,250
because you’re rich?

222
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:29,709
Yeah, I’m poor,

223
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,459
my parents bought me fake shoes

224
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,125
to encourage me,

225
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,542
but I’ll never

226
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:35,584
be ashamed of this.

227
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,459
So you can’t

228
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,334
deny my personality, either.

229
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,542
I don’t like you,

230
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,250
but I won’t do things

231
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,042
like you do,

232
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,459
because I have my bottom line!

233
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:47,918
Your shoes are broken.

234
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,501
It’s fine you don’t wanna apologize now.

235
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:05,834
Soon

236
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,417
I will slap the truth

237
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,167
on your face.

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,584
What do you want?

239
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:50,584
I’m telling you,

240
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,417
violence won’t solve the problem!

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,834
I’m gonna find the true traitor

242
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:54,626
by myself!

243
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,209
I’m not done with those

244
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,375
who have bullied me.

245
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:14,501
Hey, Qi.

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,334
You got any idea

247
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,584
to find the hidden traitor?

248
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:18,709
Not yet.

249
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
Not yet?

250
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:21,751
How dare you

251
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,584
bluff Chomper like that?

252
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,375
At least I need defeat him

253
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,709
in momentum.

254
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,584
I do admire you for that.

255
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,209
You better think

256
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,042
how to escape

257
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,501
from Chomper’s claws.

258
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,375
Come, put it on.

259
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,125
Thank you.

260
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,542
Can you think

261
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,250
something nice for me, like

262
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,584
how I will

263
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,584
trample on Chomper after the truth

264
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:48,709
comes to light.

265
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,125
Since you helped me fix my shoe,

266
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
I’m gonna share the joy with you.

267
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,250
You’re really a daydreamer.

268
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,876
You better think

269
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:57,709
how to find the hidden traitor.

270
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,250
That’s a more practical problem, OK?

271
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:00,501
The hidden traitor is

272
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,042
just a common staff.

273
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:03,667
Anyway,

274
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,417
Wen Guangqi must be behind this.

275
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,000
Wen Guangqi is a sly old fish.

276
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:10,125
He must be

277
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,125
overflowing with joy

278
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,375
seeing you accidentally

279
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,083
be taken

280
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,792
as the scapegoat.

281
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:17,876
I think,

282
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,542
we should start

283
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,918
from Wen Guangqi.

284
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,626
Such a remote place,

285
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:11,459
my goodness!

286
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:14,501
He must be planning

287
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,834
something furtive.

288
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,292
Surely he is.

289
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:41,042
Why are you following me?

290
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,876
I wasn’t following you, okay?

291
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,834
I’m just passing by.

292
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,876
Get off me!

293
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,999
You look familiar.

294
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:02,000
You

295
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,709
stalk me alone.

296
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,918
You got some nuts.

297
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:08,918
Little girl, you’re too young

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,042
to play tricks with me.

299
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:13,918
Help! Help!

300
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,000
Someone help me!

301
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,709
Don’t come closer, I’m calling the police.

302
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:23,667
Let’s go.

303
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,459
You all right?

304
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,292
- Are you hurt? - I’m okay.

305
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:33,709
Okay, let’s go.

306
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:34,083
OK.

307
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:35,334
Come on.

308
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:36,584
Go.

309
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:46,209
Let me check.

310
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:48,792
It hurts.

311
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, you know it.

312
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:52,751
It I didn’t make it there in time,

313
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,501
you’ll be ripped apart by him.

314
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,292
I didn’t expect that.

315
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,792
You haven’t expected a lot of things.

316
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,834
Qi, who do you think you are?

317
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,751
Sherlock or Wonder Woman?

318
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,999
I’m begging you,

319
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,167
do not do

320
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:09,999
anything hasty anymore.

321
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,375
What you did

322
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:12,375
is very dangerous.

323
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,792
I know it’s stupid,

324
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:16,375
but I got no other ways.

325
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,000
You

326
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,999
only have valor

327
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,792
but lack strategy.

328
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:28,542
But what should I do?

329
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:29,792
My parents told me to cheer up.

330
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,042
I must do something.

331
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:35,626
Ling Lingqi,

332
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,167
you’re a joke.

333
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,125
Oh, doomed.

334
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:41,542
I just bluffed

335
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,584
Bo Hai and Zhou Xinyan

336
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,459
this morning.

337
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:45,542
What to do?

338
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,042
I’d never say those words to them
if I knew this coming.

339
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,083
Can I take it back?

340
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,999
Of course no. I’m doomed.

341
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,584
A letter from AiFan’s lawyer.

342
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:16,292
100 million?

343
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:17,959
This is absurd!

344
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,459
That’s no negotiation.

345
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,918
That’s blackmail!

346
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:22,209
For me,

347
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,834
Peter is nothing different

348
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,250
than Wen Guangqi!

349
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,417
The compensation is gigantic indeed.

350
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,918
But based on their company scale,

351
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,709
and their sales of new products each season,

352
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,501
it’s reasonable

353
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,292
to ask for this amount.

354
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,542
Thanks to Wen Guangqi

355
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:41,626
and Ling Lingqi!

356
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,667
Can blaming someone

357
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:45,459
solve the problem

358
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:46,584
now?

359
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:49,709
No, it can’t.

360
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:51,459
Then put your energy on

361
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:52,542
how to pay

362
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:53,501
this 100 million.

363
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,380
= Lawyer’s Letter =

364
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,751
AiFan is asking for 100 million?

365
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,751
Why… Why are you

366
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:16,751
showing me this?

367
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,918
Don’t worry.

368
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,125
I don’t have time

369
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,167
for you to play the martyr.

370
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:23,375
I’m just telling you

371
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,375
a fact.

372
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,250
If AiFan officially claim for this compensation,

373
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:26,959
Wen Guangqi

374
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,834
would definitely

375
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:28,834
get himself rid of this.

376
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:29,918
By that time,

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,209
you’ll be the only one held liable.

378
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:34,876
If AiFan makes the claim,

379
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,584
the company will

380
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:37,918
file a civil lawsuit against you

381
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:39,834
for infringement of business secret.

382
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,542
You want me to pay 100 million?

383
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,042
Of course you can’t afford it.

384
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,501
Civil litigation

385
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,542
only makes you broke.

386
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:56,125
So, do you want to

387
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,334
help us catch Wen Guangqi

388
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,417
before he runs?

389
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,999
You’ll also be helping yourself.

390
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:00,876
What I said to you in the warehouse

391
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,626
the other day still remains valid.

392
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:28,417
Mr. Mo seems to be

393
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:29,459
quite close with Ling Lingqi.

394
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,125
It’s personal,

395
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,709
nothing to do with DREAM.

396
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,999
None of your business.

397
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,292
That’s the best.

398
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,083
AiFan has sent a lawyer’s letter

399
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,209
to FlowerPlus.

400
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,417
It’s at our fingertips now.

401
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,000
You’re underestimating

402
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:50,417
Bo Hai, if he’s really

403
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,417
so easy to handle,

404
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,667
I would never had the chance

405
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,501
to be here.

406
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:10,667
Good morning.

407
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:13,959
Good morning.

408
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,501
Who left it here?

409
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,876
It was on your desk

410
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:23,959
before we got here.

411
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:33,584
Baoni?

412
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,042
Mo Nan?

413
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:37,083
Seems this guy

414
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,083
knows me quite well,

415
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,042
but he must have a misunderstanding

416
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,334
on my food preference.

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,542
Isn’t it the same guy

418
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,083
who fixed the copier for me?

419
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:06,959
Such a nice person.

420
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,459
Once I come back

421
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,375
I’ll surely repay you.

422
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:34,167
The thing you want

423
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,709
will be delivered tomorrow morning.

424

Inform everyone,

425
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,709
we’re holding a meeting tomorrow morning.

426

Okay.

427
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:52,751
Listen up, everyone!

428
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,876
Mr. Bo will personally preside over

429
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,542
a meeting tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

430
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:56,417
The meeting will be about

431
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:57,584
the solution to AiFan Household’s

432
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:58,834
trade secret infringement.

433
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,459
Everyone must attend in time,

434
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,375
understand?

435
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:03,459
OK.

436
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,459
Looks like tomorrow will

437
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,709
be the hidden traitor’s final judgment.

438
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,834
What do you think

439
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,083
Mr. Bo will do with Ling Lingqi?

440
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,167
Of course

441
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,542
she will be dead tomorrow.

442
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,292
It’s 100-million compensation.

443
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,292
Now you’re afraid?

444
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,417
A black sheep like you,

445
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,083
should be butchered a thousand times.

of AiFan Household’s Trade Secret =

This crisis is really

448
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,292
fatal to AiFan.

449
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,167
Some of AiFan’s biggest competitors

450
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,375

of similar style within a week

452
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:41,834
to contend for the market.

453
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,292
They have also maliciously registered

454
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,792
all of domains of these products.

455
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,417
Now the household industry

456

is in chaos.

my shop

Not sell anymore!

486

our Qi told us about it.

Yeah, it’s called B2C.

Just scan the QR code. Ding!

It will be paid.

502
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:08,876
Really?

503
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,375
We gotta keep up with the times!

504
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:15,751
That’s convenient!

505
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,459

But fate

508
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,209
has cruelly knocked me down

509
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,542
that I can’t climb up.

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,959
Qi, stop eating.

00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:47,834
If you don’t stop,

512
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:48,918
your stomach will hurt.

513
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,959
Just let me eat.

514
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,000

the next meal.

00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,459
What are you saying?

517
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,167

00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,709
Do you regret

526
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:10,334
not ratting me out?

527
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,375
You’re the

528
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:19,417
silliest girl in the world.

529
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:21,501
Here.

530
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,042
Wipe her up.

531
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:28,751
Stop eating.

532
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:29,667
Stop eating.

533
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,918
Don’t cry.

534
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,459
Now you might see me

535
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,626
quite reliable.

536
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:07,334
But I was a trouble maker

537
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,250
when I was at school.

538
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,250
Luckily I got Qi with me

539
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,667
at that time.

540
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,167
She used to tell me

541
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,959
that all kinds of difficulties

542
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,083
we’re suffering

543
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,999
are our schoolwork for life.

544
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,417
And we’re undergoing things

545
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,334
that one day

546
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:26,999
will help us become fairies

547
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,501
and fly up into the sky.

548
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,292
I just never expect that

549
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,417
she’s the one suffer it alone.

550
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:38,250
Don’t worry.

551
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,501
Qi will be okay.

552
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,751
How can you be so sure

553
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:45,000
about it?

554
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:48,501
Because

555
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:50,626
sometimes God

556
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,250
is distracted by something else,

557
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:53,959
but after all,

558
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:54,626
he has his rules

559
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:55,959
to run the world,

560
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,584
that is good things will happen to good people.

561
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:58,751
Especially for a kind-hearted girl

562
00:24:58,918 --> 00:24:59,709
like Qi.

563
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,125
She won’t be failed.

564
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:10,250
Mo Nan, if I were

565
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,167
suffering this,

566
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,167
would you care for me

567
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:14,042
like you did to Qi?

568
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:17,042
No, you won’t.

569
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,125
You’re already a fairy.

570
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,751
You won’t be as silly as Qi.

571
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,167
Okay, that’s it.

572
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,459
Bye, Peter.

573
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,167
Peter.

574
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,626
Mr. Bo, both of us

575
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,459
are respected people in the circle.

576
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,375
I have already sent your company

577
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:46,709
the lawyer’s letter.

578
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,751
The following procedures will be

579
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,000
executed strictly according to the law.

580
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,501
I don’t have the energy

581
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,417
or the mood

582
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:55,959
to negotiate with you again.

583
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:57,375
Why you come to bother me

584
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,209
again and again?

585
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:01,459
You misunderstood.

586
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,459
I never intended to bother you.

587
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:06,042
In business, I’m not

588
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:07,125
that experienced as you are.

589
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:08,584
But in this field,

590
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,292
I’ve made a figure.

591
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:11,751
After years of struggling,

592
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,751
I’ve figured out some techniques

593
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:13,959
in doing business that

594
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,542
risks are often accompanied by opportunities.

595
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,250
So in this crisis,

596
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:19,918
you can’t say there is no opportunity.

597
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,417
This is a proposal I made.

598
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,250
Hope you can give it a look.

599
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:53,626
100 million.

600
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,834
Qi, take this.

601
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,709
My dear,

602
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,250
it’s all the money

603
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,083
we’ve saved in these years.

604
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:41,918
Take it.

605
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,709
But it’s not enough.

606
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,667
Who asked you to pay them back?

607
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:54,709
This is for the lawyer fee.

608
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,209
Correct.

609
00:27:58,626 --> 00:27:59,918
If you didn’t do it,

610
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,417
don’t you ever admit it,

611
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:04,584
even if they force you!

612
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:13,999
Mom.

613
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,000
William is satisfied with

614
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:20,834
this result.

615
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,626
AiFan will certainly

616
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:23,626
defeat FlowerPlus this time.

617
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:25,834
We can be prepared to draw in the net.

618
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,834
I just got here

619
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:31,959
and had no time

620
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,083
to visit my parents,

621
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,459
now I gotta go back.

622
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:36,959
Who knows

623
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:37,918
when I can receive a project here

624
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,083
again next time,

625
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,292
so I can treat my Chinese stomach.

626
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:47,834
Mr. Mo,

627
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:50,042
you don’t seem to be happy.

628
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:55,918
I heard that

629
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,959
the CEO of the cosmetic company

630
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,542
we bought last month

631
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,083
attempted suicide?

632
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:04,501
It’s true.

633
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:07,375
But you said that

634
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:09,209
in business, if you want

635
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,417
remarkable accomplishments,

636
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,375
you must pay astonishing price.

637
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:14,876
Soft-heartedness

638
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:16,709
won’t get you anywhere.

639
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:18,125
Yes, I did.

640
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,667
The interest plunder in business

641
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,876
is a bloody war,

642
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,751
your kindness and humanity

643
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:30,584
can be fatal

644
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:31,792
in this battlefield.

645
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,459
Only the most cold-blooded soldier

646
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:41,667
can keep winning.

647
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:46,542
Notify William,

648
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:52,999
we’re drawing in the net.

649
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:20,250
You’re gonna be late.

650
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:31,292
After this mess,

651
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,459
never to mention our year-end bonus,

652
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,125
we could barely

653
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,042
keep the job.

654
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,375
Why didn’t we see through

655
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,459
her vicious heart earlier?

656
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,042
Yeah.

657
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:39,834
Let’s wait and see.

658
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,000
Even she’s 007,

659
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,375
she’ll be dead today.

660
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,501
Qi.

661
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:02,667
All the time,

662
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:03,918
FlowerPlus has set foot in the market

663
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:04,709
relying on

664
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:05,459
outstanding products

665
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,542
and good reputation.

666
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,250
But this AiFan incident

667
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:09,459
is the biggest crisis we’ve experienced

668
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,209
since our establishment.

669
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:12,792
I won’t waste time

670
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,667
on the risk management plan

671
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:14,999
in today’s meeting.

672
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,999
I’ll represent

673
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,125
the company’s top management

674
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,834
to make final comments

675
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,709
on the treatment of this crisis.

676
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:25,584
Now everyone’s attention is on

677
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,501
the leaker of this incident.

678
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,667
It’s true the leaker

679
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,709
is the key to solve the whole case.

680
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:35,959
What motive

681
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,375
they have?

682
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,999
Who is behind them?

683
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:40,626
Or who on earth

684
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:43,167
is pulling the strings?

685
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,709
To be honest, I have no idea.

686
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:48,125
No idea?

687
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,292
Isn’t it Ling Lingqi?

688
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:50,501
Yeah.

689
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,417
But just now,

690
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,626
I got some

691
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,959
important evidence.

692
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,542
The recovered data from the surveillance

693
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,876
camera in the corridor.

694
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,334
I believe the video

695
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,918
will reveal the truth.

696
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,209
At 16:47,

697
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:13,125
Ling Lingqi

698
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,501
came out from Mr. Bo’s office

699
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,584
and ran right into

700
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,125
the cleaner of our company.

701
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,542
Irrefutable evidence.

702
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:19,792
It was Ling Lingqi for sure!

703
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,918
Yeah, it’s her.

704
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:22,876
It’s her for sure.

705
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:33,501
This is?

706
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,375
At 17:08,

707
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:36,834
Fang Cheng entered

708
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the Mr. Bo’s office.

709
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,626
It wasn’t me.

710
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,834
You must have

711
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,542
doctored this video!

712
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,999
It was him. It was definitely Fang Cheng!

713
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:45,999
Yeah.

714
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:46,667
Could it be

715
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:48,375
that Ling Lingqi was wronged?

716
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,417
After 13 minutes,

717
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,292
which was 17:21,

718
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,667
Fang Cheng came out.

719
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,751
Nonsense! It took me only five minutes to...

720
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,542
It was really him.

721
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:10,459
Sorry,

722
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:12,250
my mistake.

723
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:17,876
You black sheep!

724
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:19,834
How dare you

725
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,626
betray the company

726
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,999
for such a pathetic benefit?

727
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,501
How did I train you?

728
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,000
Now you dragged the whole company

729
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:27,876
into the mire, you know that?

730
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,334
I’m so disappointed.

731
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,709
I’m sorry.

732
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,167
I didn’t train him well.

733
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:43,459
I let you all down.

734
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,626
Mr. Wen’s loyalty to the company

735
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:46,792
is rarely seen.

736
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,417
I declare from now on, Fang Cheng

737
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:50,292
has been removed from the office and

738
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:51,667
the company reserves the right to

739
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,125
investigate and affix his legal liability.

740
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:53,876
In addition,

741
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:57,209
Ling Lingqi’s position will be restored.

742
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,000
I know.

743
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:18,542
OK, I’ll…

744
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:22,792
I see.

745
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:24,083
You just leave like that?

746
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:24,792
We’ll talk when we meet.

747
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:25,918
What the hell!

748
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:29,709
Qi.

749
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,792
Their looks are worse than crying.

750
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,501
Qi, please sit down.

751
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,209
Baoni, come.

752
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,667
Qi, we bought this

753
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,417
for you.

754
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:48,999
Tom Yam Kung soup

755
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,083
from the Thai restaurantat the gate.

756
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,501
Green curry chicken rice.

757
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:53,042
Terribly spicy.

758
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,042
Good dish you ordered.

759
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:00,709
Just like my mood now,

760
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:01,918
burning like

761
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,083
the chili in it.

762
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:04,250
I might explode

763
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:05,584
accidentally.

764
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,042
Qi, have some tea.

765
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,626
White mum, best in keeping the fire down.

766
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:13,876
Baoni,

767
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:15,167
you want one too?

768
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:17,459
Fine.

769
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,751
Qi, be cool.

770
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,542
It was all our fault

771
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,042
before.

772
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:38,209
Yeah.

773
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,459
So we’d like to

774
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,209
apologize to you solemnly.

775
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,667
We’re sorry, Qi.

776
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,042
Sorry, sorry.

777
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,584
I have a quite good personality

778
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,501
except for one flaw.

779
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,334
I’m particularly petty.

780
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,918
I’m vengeful.

781
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,459
For such a huge grudge, I reckon

782
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:03,584
she’ll remember it the rest of her life.

783
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:08,999
Well, Qi,

784
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,250
Zhenqi and I

785
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,417
are quite available recently,

786
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:12,918
you ask us to do anything you like.

787
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:13,375
Yeah.

788
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:14,042
We’ll do it for you.

789
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:14,709
Give it to us.

790
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:15,459
- Qi. - Give it to us.

791
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:15,792
And me. And me.

792
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,375
I’m much stronger than them both.

793
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,792
About his job,

794
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,334
just tell DREAM’s HR to handle it

795
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:37,918
like they used to do,

796
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:40,501
but with more compensation.

797
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:41,751
Tell them I said so.

798
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:44,584
Okay.

799
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:47,167
But for such a good opportunity,

800
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:48,834
it was really a shame.

801
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,918
Mr. Mo, isn’t it because

802
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:54,999
the female colleague living downstairs,

803
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:55,751
you asked Fang Cheng to…

804
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:56,209
No.

805
00:36:57,626 --> 00:36:58,334
Nothing to do with her.

806
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:01,999
Bo Hai has fixed the video,

807
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,626
if we hadn’tintercepted in time,

808
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,459
we’d be completely annihilated.

809
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,083
Looks like Bo Hai

810
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:12,542
isn’t that easy to deal with

811
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,501
as we imaged.

812
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,459
It’s a hunter’s

813
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:17,334
good luck

814
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:18,626
to encounter a rivaling prey.

815
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,626
It was too easy for me

816
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,667
to get everything in Europe and America,

817
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:24,918
I got bored of it.

818
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:26,918
It thrilled me a bit

819
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,542
to meet a rival like Bo Hai.

820
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:30,459
I really hope

821
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:31,876
he won’t die too fast.

822
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:35,083
Okay.

823
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,125
As for William,

824
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:37,709
I’ll explain to him for you.

825
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,375
That Fang Cheng,

826
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,083
is quite loyal.

827
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:51,876
He doesn’t admit that

828
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,501
Wen Guangqi sent him no matter what.

829
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,375
Mr. Luo doesn’t know how do with him.

830
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,292
Of course.

831
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Wen Guangqi, that sly old fox,

832
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:00,042
is crafty and cunning.

833
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:01,083
Surely he’s already had

834
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:02,209
everything planned.

835
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,167
We can find his weakness?

836
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:05,501
No way.

837
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,999
Finally we’re able to find the traitor

838
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,042
in our company.

839
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:09,999
But it’s still a shame

840
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:10,959
that AiFan

841
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,667
will still keep pestering us.

842
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:14,918
Hey, watch this,

843
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,167
Mr. Bo and Peter

844
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,375
are having an urgent press conference.

845
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:17,959
What?

846
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,999
I believe every one of you has been

847
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,667
following up closely the leak

848
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:22,751
of AiFan’s new products.

849
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,751
Today, commissioned by Peter,

850
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,292
I’m here to announce that

851
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:29,667
the leak incident of AiFan

852
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:31,220
is a brand PR activity

853
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,460
jointly planned by FlowerPlus

854
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,020
and AiFan Household.

855
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,584
The aim is to promote

856
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,459
the new products of AiFan Household.

857
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:40,751
I told Mr. Bo

858
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,417
that I’ve been bored of

859
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:44,834
the traditional red-carpet

860
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,667
product launching in hotels.

861
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,125
If the products

862
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,000
will be really accepted by everyone,

863
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:53,584
leak might also be

864
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,667
another method to reveal the veil.

865
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,125
And based on

866
00:38:58,417 --> 00:38:59,334
the current market response,

867
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,501
it was way beyond

868
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,542
our expectations.

869
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:02,667
Our scheme

870
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:03,584
has brought us

871
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,125
a good promotional effect.

872
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:12,250
It’s a pleasure to work with you.

873
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,626
Uder this critical situation,

874
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,501
Mr. Bo has finally

875
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:18,542
turned the tables.

876
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:19,709
Yeah, impressive.

877
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,959
He’s really cool.

878
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,083
I’d never admired anyone

879
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:25,209
in my whole life, but I’m Mr. Bo’s fan now!

880
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:26,125
The Aifan Household’s leak incident

881
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,709
that has caught the public’s attention recently

882
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:28,959
has a new update today.

883
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,125
AiFan and FlowerPlus have jointly

884
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:32,999
called for a press conference today

885
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,542
to clarify that the incident

886
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,334
was planned by them…

887
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,042
Come and look.

888
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,292
News about FlowerPlus.

889
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,792
…to promote the new products of AiFan.

890
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:44,709
No one ever expected

891
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:45,999
that it ends like this.

892
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,167
Ling, how much for the garlic?

893
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:50,292
Ling?

894
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:51,584
Hold on!

895
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,000
What attitude you got?

896
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,000
See, I told you.

897
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,167
Our daughter can’t be

898
00:39:58,417 --> 00:39:59,999
dog-ass, right?

899
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:02,000
Thank goodness!

900
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,542
I’ll go buy a chicken

901
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,792
to make some soup for Qi.

902
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,459
Right!

903
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,876
Buy the most

904
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,000
expensive one!

905
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:10,375
Got it.

906
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:11,292
Hurry back.

907
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:15,959
So good.

908
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,999
Bean sauce.

909
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:25,626
Might be this one.

910
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:27,542
Ling,

911
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,167
what’s the production date?

912
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:30,334
It’s printed on it.

913
00:40:31,918 --> 00:40:33,584
Three months ago.

914
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:34,792
Give me a cheaper price.

915
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,417
Just take it.

916
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:38,375
You give to me for free?

917
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:42,209
I just got the news

918
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:43,999
that AiFan Household’s new products

919
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:45,334
has now reached the top three

920
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:46,209
trending topics online

921
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:47,876
after the press conference.

922
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:49,834
AiFan’s Marketing Department

923
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:50,959
just called that

924
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,125
their orders for the new products

925
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,876
today has skyrocketed.

926
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:59,250
We got good news in our shops too.

927
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:00,918
Our customer flow has returned

928
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:02,626
to the standard before this crisis.

929
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:03,918
Director Liu said

930
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,125
the big clients we lost

931
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:06,542
have also called over

932
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:07,999
for cooperation again.

933
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,167
The wind has finally subsided

934
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,792
and the waves have calmed down.

935
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:14,999
Don’t be happy too early.

936
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:16,751
The water is not tranquil yet.

937
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:18,584

938
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:19,459
