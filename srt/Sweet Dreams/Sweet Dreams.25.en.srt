Morning.

54
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,125
Morning, Lili.

55
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:51,125
Morning.

56
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,042
Morning.

57
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,083
What makes you so happy?

58
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,584
I’m always happy, aren’t I?

59
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:56,459
Are you?

60
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:56,959
Morning.

61
00:01:59,375 --> 00:01:59,918
Qi.

62
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:02,751
I asked you to help me with that.

63
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:03,751
What have you got?

64
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:05,542
What do you mean?

65
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,999
Mo Nan!

66
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:13,292
Don’t worry.

67
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,792
He doesn’t like anyone.

68
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:18,876
He told you that?

69
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:24,876
He didn’t tell me directly.

70
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:25,918
But I think

71
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,626
he doesn’t have a crush on anyone.

72
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:28,584
I think that’s

73
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:29,834
what he meant.

74
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,292
That can’t be right.

75
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,250
My hunch is always accurate.

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,459
I know you are not reliable.

77
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:41,501
Never mind.

78
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,751
I’ll figure it out myself.

79
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:47,999
This time, we

80
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,125
are invited by premium female fashion brand,

81
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,250
Esperanza, to provide

82
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,834
floriculture modeling design

83
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,459
for their new product posters.

84
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:54,751
We communicated with Esperanza many times,

85
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:55,709
and determined

86
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,918
that the theme is A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

87
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:11,459
Mr. Bo?

88
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,083
This theme

89
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,459
consists of three parts.

90
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,417
Let’s take a look.

91
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:50,876
Yummy.

92
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,334
Bo Hai’s meeting is over?

93
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:57,959
Great.

94
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:58,918
I must go ask him

95
00:03:58,999 --> 00:03:59,959
about his fake amnesia

96
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:00,542
and lie to me.

97
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,083
Could you stop your public display of affection

98
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,375
in front of a single man like me?

99
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,918
So cruel.

100
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:07,876
It’s that obviously?

101
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,459
Of course.

102
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,999
I never expected Bo Hai could open up himself.

103
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,999
It’s like the iceberg is melting,

104
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,250
or the iron tree is blooming.

105
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:16,250
But,

106
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,375
don’t be happy too soon.

107
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,209
Your way to success

108
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,834
is still long.

109
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,751
Don’t worry.

110
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,125
I’ll definitely cheer up

111
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,959
and level this iceberg.

112
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,125
Hello?

113
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,292
The bracelet?

114
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,125
Wait for me in the hall. OK.

115
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,417
Bo Hai is looking for you?

116
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,209
No,

117
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,250
it’s the Sweet Dream Technology.

118
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,209
My bracelet is not working.

119
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,125
The guy comes to do research.

120
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:41,292
Is it the one you bought

121
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,209
for Bo Hai?

122
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:43,626
You knew it?

123
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,584
That’s right.

124
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:46,000
I need to go.

125
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,918
Mo Nan, help!

126
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:05,584
Hello, are you

127
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,876
from the

128
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,918
Sweet Dream Technology?

129
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,083
Yes, and you are?

130
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,626
Nice to meet you, I’m Chen Mo.

131
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:12,626
Nice to meet you.

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,125
Sorry, I’m late.

133
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,751
This is…

134
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,751
She is my assistant.

135
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:23,918
Nice to meet you.

136
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,709
Nice to meet you.

137
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,501
Mr. Chen.

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,167
I’m sorry to bother you this time.

139
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,417
It’s mainly because many clients

140
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:29,542
reported to us that

141
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:30,751
the dream bracelets

142
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:31,626
made by our company

143
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,083
have shown phenomenon of the same frequency.

144
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,584
The same frequency?

145
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,751
Yes, in a nutshell.

146
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,876
When the frequency

147
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,584
of two bracelets is the same,

148
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,167
one user can enter

149
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,250
the other user’s dream

150
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,959
during sleep,

151
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:48,999
and the active side

152
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,792
is usually conscious

153
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,626
while the passive side

154
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,876
is not.

155
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:55,459
If you always

156
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,918
dream of the same person recently,

157
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,375
it is likely that there is

158
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,709
a phenomenon of the same frequency.

159
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,083
I’m wondering if you

160
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,626
have noticed anything like that.

161
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,417
Nothing abnormal.

162
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,918
Everything is fine.

163
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,792
Yes, everything is fine.

164
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,667
Really? That’s great.

165
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,959
Mr. Chen, if you

166
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:27,959
have any problem

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,792
about the bracelet,

168
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:29,626
feel free to contact me.

169
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:29,959
Sure.

170
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,501
Ling Lingqi, what are you doing?

171
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:32,292
You don’t work hard

172
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,125
but sneak off?

173
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,000
I… Well…

174
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,792
Who are you?

175
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,459
Hello,

176
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:43,167
I’m a post-sale worker from

177
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,292
Sweet Dream Technology.

178
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,375
I’m here

179
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,334
for Mr. Chen.

180
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,375
Mr. Chen? Which Mr. Chen?

181
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:48,876
Well…

182
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,542
Hold on!

183
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,667
What a big bug!

184
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,250
Huge. It’s gonna fly.

185
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:56,459
Yes, yes, yes, very big.

186
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:56,709
Run, run, run.

187
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,250
Where?

188
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,959
Big bug!

189
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,250
Where is it?

190
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,000
Ling Lingqi!

191
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,125
Thanks to my quick wit.

192
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,751
I got away.

193
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,751
Is there something

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,417
you should

195
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,751
explain to me?

196
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,501
Nothing to explain.

197
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:23,209
Don’t know what you are talking about.

198
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:24,209
Really?

199
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,334
If I am right,

200
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,918
you have a dream bracelet.

201
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,125
Then Chen Mo’s bracelet

202
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,501
must be

203
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:34,751
applied for Chomper.

204
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,375
What are you talking about?

205
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,626
Nonsense.

206
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,334
Fine.

207
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,834
If you don’t tell the truth,

208
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:41,834
I have to find Chomper

209
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,542
and tell him about

210
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,959
the same frequency thing.

211
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,000
What is the same frequency?

212
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,125
Let’s go.

213
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:56,709
So, the dream entering

214
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:57,999
is a real thing.

215
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,542
Qi, you are not a real friend.

216
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:02,209
You don’t share

217
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,667
this kind of good stuff.

218
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,083
That’s not good.

219
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,584
It’s like

220
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:10,042
a time bomb.

221
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,334
Bo Hai is finally

222
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,999
a little fond of me now.

223
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:14,542
If he knows

224
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,918
about dream entering…

225
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:17,876
Right.

226
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,959
Last time Xiaoqi of the Marketing Department

227
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,000
went on a tour

228
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,167
with the excuse of sick leave,

229
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,083
and he fired her without hesitation.

230
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,459
For such a small

231
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,417
problem,

232
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,542
he held a general meeting of all staff.

233
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:30,667
If he knows

234
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,250
you pursue him by cheating,

235
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:33,959
your ending

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,459
is no better than hers.

237
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,042
Why is it so hard

238
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,709
to maintain a relationship?

239
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:42,918
So, what are you

240
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,125
going to do next?

241
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,751
One step at a time.

242
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:04,999
Mr. Bo.

243
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:06,125
These two documents

244
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,083
need your signatures.

245
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,876
Great Barrier Reef,

246
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,501
Taj Mahal,

247
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:17,999
Machu Picchu,

248
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,334
and Pyramid.

249
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,626
I wonder if

250
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,042
I have that kind of luck

251
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,626
to visit these places in my life.

252
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,375
If you want to ask for a leave,

253
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,918
go to the HR Department for approval.

254
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,417
Boss,

255
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,959
that’s not enough.

256
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,709
The air tickets are too expensive.

257
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:36,876
After I buy them,

258
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,834
I’ll have to live on dirt there.

259
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:40,834
Don’t cross the line.

260
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,334
I have an issue.

261
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,167
Every time I spend my money, I feel pain inside.

262
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,042
Once I’m painful,

263
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,501
I can’t keep myself from talking.

264
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,626
Once I start talking,

265
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,751
I may say anything

266
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,459
to anyone.

267
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,709
Xinyan, do you know

268
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,167
that this morning,

269
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:54,999
someone…

270
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,042
I’ll pay for your air tickets.

271
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,959
Really?

272
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:03,375
Yes.

273
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:06,792
I’m flattered.

274
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,501
Leave, now.

275
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,501
Bye-bye.

276
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,042
Xinyan,

277
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,209
I need to discuss

278
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,501
with you about

279
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,250
the online flower shop thing.

280
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:36,918
- Hello, Director. - Hello, Director.

281
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:43,959
Chen Mo.

282
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:45,167
Xinyan.

283
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,209
I found you are prettier.

284
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:52,792
I am?

285
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:54,417
Shut up.

286
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,626
Maybe because I have something joyous.

287
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:57,751
What is it?

288
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:58,709
Tell me.

289
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,501
I want to be happy too.

290
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,083
It’s nothing big.

291
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,876
Tell me please.

292
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,626
I want to know.

293
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,792
Tell me.

294
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:13,292
You do want to know?

295
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,250
Say it.

296
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:27,334
I won’t tell you.

297
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:33,167
Hurts! Hurts!

298
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,584
Forcing me to be violent, right?

299
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:35,792
You don’t want the easy way.

300
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:36,792
What are you doing?

301
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:38,626
What despicable means did you use

302
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,709
against Bo Hai

303
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,999
to make him obedient to you?

304
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,209
Wait.

305
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:41,751
Say it.

306
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:42,792
Let me go first.

307
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,083
Then I’ll tell you.

308
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:46,000
OK, OK, OK.

309
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,959
Bo Hai falls in love with Ling Lingqi.

310
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:52,667
Now you are lying again?

311
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:53,751
I’m not.

312
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:54,417
If I am,

313
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,918
I will be alone for the rest of my life.

314
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:12,460
Mo Nan.

315
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,459
Baoni.

316
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,083
Let’s have dinner tonight.

317
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,667
I’m meeting someone.

318
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:21,501
Maybe next time.

319
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:22,584
Bye-bye.

320
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,999
Meeting someone?

321
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,876
Is it some young girl?

322
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:39,709
Why is he going faster than a rabbit?

323
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,250
I’m exhausted.

324
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,460
= File Bag =
Mr. Mo. The file you asked for.

325
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,083
Mr. Mo. The file you asked for.

326
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,918
This is a rare

327
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,000
opportunity.

328
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,834
If dream entering is disclosed,

329
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,501
= Application for Dream Bracelet =

330
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,020
= Application for Dream Bracelet =
Bo Hai will break up with Ling Lingqi.

331
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,501
Then we don’t need to be afraid

332
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,620
of anyone in the future.

333
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,980
= A Survey on the Same Frequency
of Dream Bracelet =

334
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,620
It’s set. It’s on you now.

335
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:25,417
This one is good.

336
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,834
What are you looking at?

337
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:31,626
Never saw a beauty?

338
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:32,792
Hot temper.

339
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:39,751
Damn Mo Nan.

340
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,751
He must be

341
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,709
with some young witch.

342
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,501
The more important thing is,

343
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:09,584
maybe after Ling Lingqi cuts feelings

344
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,250
for Bo Hai,

345
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:12,959
she will realize someone

346
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:16,042
is more suitable than Bo Hai.

347
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,000
Where is the man who was sitting here?

348
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:33,876
No.

349
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:36,209
I can’t leave

350
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,709
this evidence.

351
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,626
I must destroy it.

352
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:44,792
Thanks to it,

353
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:47,417
I get to approach Bo Hai in dreams.

354
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:50,959
If I just ditch it,

355
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,918
am I too ungrateful?

356
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,959
Is the Internet not working, Bo Hai?

357
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,250
What? You’re looking for me?

358
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,417
You called me.

359
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,999
I might accidently

360
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:23,876
click the phone.

361
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:25,584
Then I’m hanging up.

362
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,584
Hold on.

363
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,667
Well, are you home?

364
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,417
Of course.

365
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,167
Where should I be?

366
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,334
It’s late. Look.

367
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,459
Home is safer.

368
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,959
Don’t go to dangerous places

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,626
like balcony

370
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:44,876
or the community park.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,250
Especially at night.

372
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,250
You are so jealous.

373
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,209
What?

374
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,209
Nothing.

375
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,292
I said… I said relax.

376
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,375
Going to the balcony

377
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,459
or the community park

378
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,083
is just your imagination,

379
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,167
and will not happen.

380
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,125
Mo Nan

381
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,667
doesn’t like me.

382
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:04,918
What are you talking about?

383
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don’t understand it at all.

384
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,334
It’s late. I’m going to sleep.

385
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,083
Am I that obvious?

386
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,334
I wonder what dream

387
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,042
Bo Hai will have tonight.

388
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:58,375
Well,

389
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,334
the last one time won’t hurt.

390
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:03,876
The last time.

391
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,083
The last time.

392
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:06,167
The last time.

393
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:08,042
Sleep.

394
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,792
Flower of this white dye,

395
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,042
hit with Cupid’s archery,

396
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,999
sink in

397
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,334
apple of his eye.

398
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,292
This is

399
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,792
the magic medicine

400
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,334
that can provoke love.

401
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:20,709
Lysander.

402
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:22,209
This is a horrible trap.

403
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,459
It is not the magic medicine for love.

404
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,999
It will kill us.

405
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,876
The road to true love is not flat.

406
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,459
Magic medicine for love does not exist.

407
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,542
Your human’s behavior

408
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:45,334
is so ridiculous.

409
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:56,292
Go!

410
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:03,584
Go!

411
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:08,042
Lysander.

412
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,042
I am exhausted.

413
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,459
I cannot run any more.

414
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,375
What is this,

415
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,375
clever Lysander?

416
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:20,209
If then true lovers

417
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,542
have been ever crossed,

418
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,083
it stands as

419
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,334
an edict in destiny.

420
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,334
Then, come on, Hermia.

421
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,542
Let us teach our trial patience.

422
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,375
As due to love

423
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,292
as dreams and sighs,

424
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,334
wishes and tears,

425
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,584

Ling Lingqi.

472
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,459
Mom, why did you wake me up?

473
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,125
Someone told me she needs to

474
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,999
arrange the

475
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,042
studio and can’t

476
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,417
be late.

477
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:53,834
No.

478
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:58,209
Crap.

479
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,000
This is rare.

480
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,250
You are late.

481
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:16,792
What’s wrong with your tie?

482
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:19,000
Help me.

483
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:19,709
Excuse me.

484
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:25,417
Wait.

485
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,250
I think I found a secret.

486
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:30,792
Last night, did you

487
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,876
do the things both appropriate and

488
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:33,167
inappropriate?

489
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,000
Sorry, boss.

490
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,375
It’s I that did something wrong

491
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,417
last night.

492
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,709
Go! What are you waiting for?

493
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:47,209
I can’t.

494
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,459
I’ve been afraid of height since I was a child.

495
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:49,959
Why is that?

496
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:51,334
You have a huge body.

497
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,792
You cannot be afraid of height.

498
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,334
Go. Go.

499
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:55,834
Stop. I can’t.

500
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:56,959
I will hold you.

501
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,000
Don’t be scared.

502
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,083
Go. Go.

503
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,334
Everyone is busy.

504
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:01,334
We are lack of hands.

505
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:02,292
For the development

506
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,125
of our company,

507
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,375
challenge yourself.

508
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,292
Go!

509
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,250
I am begging you.

510
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,667
Don’t push me, Manager Li.

511
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,501
I will beat you if you don’t go.

512
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,584
I can’t. I will die.

513
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,167
You don’t want the bonus

514
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,083
of this month, right?

515
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,417
I can’t persuade you, right?

516
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,501
I can’t unless I die.

517
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:16,375
Manager Li.

518
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,375
Let me go, Manager Li.

519
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:19,709
You?

520
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:20,751
Come on, give it to me.

521
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:21,584
Are you sure?

522
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:22,250
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

523
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:22,959
Great!

524
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:23,292
Okay.

525
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,250
Thanks.

526
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:25,000
Never mind.

527
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,083
Don’t push yourself.

528
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:26,542
Okay.

529
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:27,876
Hold the ladder.

530
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:28,417
I will help you.

531
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:30,626
Watch out, Qi.

532
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:32,501
Come down if you can’t.

533
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,042
Let him do it.

534
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:33,667
Okay.

535
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:36,876
The metal framework

536
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:38,000
is fully built.

537
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,167
Cirrus and branches

538
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,292
are shaped.

539
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:42,250
After Li Boqing set floriculture with others,

540
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:44,125
all the settings will be complete.

541
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:47,501
Great.

542
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,042
Left, left, left.

543
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:52,918
Left? To my left?

544
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes, yes. Good.

545
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:55,876
This one too.

546
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,042
Come on.

547
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,125
Where? Here too?

548
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,459
Slightly to the right.

549
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:01,250
To the right, yes?

550
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:02,250
- Yes. - Here?

551
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,334
Okay.

552
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:09,918
Let’s go over there, Mr. Bo.

553
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,751
Okay.

554
00:28:11,918 --> 00:28:12,292
Okay.

555
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,751
Take a rest.

556
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:25,751
Okay, thanks.

557
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:38,417
Who did you meet yesterday?

558
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:43,000
Just a nobody. Why?

559
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:45,918
We are sisters.

560
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,209
Just want to care about you, can’t I?

561
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:50,709
Sure.

562
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:55,209
I have heard about it, Mo Nan.

563
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,209
You are awesome!

564
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:02,999
What happened?

565
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,292
Don’t you know?

566
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:05,209
The major client

567
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,918
we couldn’t settle

568
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,000
was easily convinced

569
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,667
by Mo Nan yesterday.

570
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,876
I was just lucky.

571
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:17,000
Don’t be modest.

572
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:19,334
You have taken a big order

573
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:20,417
for our company.

574
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,667
When you get the bonus,

575
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,083
don’t forget to treat us.

576
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,501
Okay, I won’t.

577
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:27,834
So

578
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,083
you met a client yesterday?

579
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,792
Sure, otherwise?

580
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,834
Nothing. Go ahead. Bye.

581
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,209
Too much work in limited time.

582
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:49,292
Let’s help each other.

583
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,250
Come on. Thank you, everyone.

584
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,999
Meal’s here. Let’s eat first.

585
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,834
Thank you!

586
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,083
Watch out.

587
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:55,876
Eat first.

588
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,876
Come to eat.

589
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,334
Come.

590
00:29:59,083 --> 00:29:59,542
Qi.

591
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:00,542
Eat first.

592
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:01,334
Stop working.

593
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:02,250
It’s fine. I am not hungry.

594
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,083
You go first.

595
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,626
Then

596
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,292
take care.

597
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:07,209
See you.

598
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:07,667
Okay.

599
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:17,751
Thank you for your hard work.

600
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,459
- The boss rewards us today. - Here.

601
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:20,751
Everyone gets a bottle of juice.

602
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:21,167
Nice work.

603
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:21,918
Thank you, boss.

604
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,042
Our boss is so sweet.

605
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:24,501
Thanks.

606
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,042
Thank you, boss.

607
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,167
Thank you.

608
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:28,918
Where is Bo Hai?

609
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,501
Thanks.

610
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:31,667
I don’t know.

611
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:32,626
Thank you, boss.

612
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,000
Do you know where Mr. Bo is?

613
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,000
No idea.

614
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:36,751
Thank you.

615
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:39,083
Good job.

616
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,250
Did you see Qi?

617
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:40,999
Yes.

618
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,083
She was in the studio just now.

619
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:42,709
Here.

620
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:45,584
What happened?

621
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,167
Qi’s not here?

622
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:50,334
Here, I’ll go find her.

623
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,167
Wait, I’ll go with you.

624
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:54,792
Are you okay?

625
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,709
I will call someone for help.

626
00:32:57,999 --> 00:32:58,584
Qi.

627
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:31,250
If dream entering is disclosed,

628
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:33,375
Bo Hai will break up with Ling Lingqi.

629
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,959
Then we don’t need to be afraid

630
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,292
of anyone in the future.

631
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:44,999
Maybe after Ling Lingqi cuts feelings

632
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,751
for Bo Hai,

633
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:48,375
she will realize someone

634
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,584
is more suitable than Bo Hai.

635
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,125
Lili,

636
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,501
is this Mr. Bo’s office desk?

637
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:08,167
Yes.

638
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,083
Thanks.

639
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,460
= File Bag =

640
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:25,083
Put these two flowerpots there.

641
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:26,417
Okay.

642
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:27,417
Let me see if today’s flowers

643
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:28,209
are fresh or not.

644
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:33,042
What’s the matter?

645
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:34,417
Are you insane after being harassed

646
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:36,751
by Ling Lingqi?

647
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:40,167
Let me ask you something.

648
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,751
Why one can always meet

649
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:44,083
the same person

650
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,667
in his dreams?

651
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:47,999
Tell me whether the person

652
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:49,876
is Ling Lingqi or not?

653
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:51,250
Keep it.

654
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,334
Okay.

655
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:53,459
Put this one

656
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,459
over there later.

657
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:54,834
Okay.

658
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:55,542
Go.

659
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:57,876
It’s easy.

660
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:00,125
You dream of what you think in the day,

661
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,417
which means you’re

662
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,417
in love with

663
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,167
Ling Lingqi

664
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:03,792
and cannot control yourself.

665
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,626
So you dream of her.

666
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:09,501
What if before

667
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:11,000
I met Ling Lingqi,

668
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,584
I already began to dream of her?

669
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,125
You mean

670
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,209
you began to dream of

671
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,250
Ling Lingqi before

672
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,083
you knew her?

673
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:20,250
My first dream of her

674
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:21,751
occurred in France.

675
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,292
You were ahead of time.

676
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,584
So, right after you

677
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,709
put on your dream bracelet,

678
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,000
you began to dream of her.

679
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:31,834
Oh, today

680
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,209
Sweet Dream Technology

681
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:34,167
kept contacting me.

682
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,042
They said something was wrong

683
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:36,709
with the bracelet,

684
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,000
but they left before

685
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:38,959
I met them.

686
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,626
Are they insane?

687
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:45,542
Forget about it.

688
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:46,918
Let’s talk about it after

689
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:47,999
finishing the work.

690
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:58,542
Sweet Dream Technology?

691
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,876
Why does it sound familiar?

692
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:04,375
Hello,

693
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:05,125
I’m a post-sale worker from

694
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,209
Sweet Dream Technology.

695
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,292
I’m here

696
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,209
for Mr. Chen.

697
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,459
Mr. Chen? Which Mr. Chen?

698
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:11,834
Could he

699
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,542
come for Chen Mo?

700
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:16,709
Why didn’t Ling Lingqi

701
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:17,459
let him go to

702
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,918
Chen Mo?

703
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,751
It would be great if A Midsummer Night’s Dream

704
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:27,083
is true.

705
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:29,876
Are you thinking about the

706
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,042
magic medicine for love in the story?

707
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:32,626
Of course!

708
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:34,167
Who wouldn’t

709
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,125
want that?

710
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:35,999
You?

711
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:37,417
True.

712
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,375
If I have the magic medicine for love,

713
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:42,501
when I encounter a handsome guy,

714
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,125
I will put it on his eyelids

715
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,584
while he is asleep.

716
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:46,876
Then he will fall in love with me

717
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,999
after waking up.

718
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,209
Stop dreaming, OK?

719
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,999
But this kind of stuff

720
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:57,834
is really nice.

721
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,501
But what if the other party learns it?

722
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:02,959
That’ll be a disaster.

723
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,167
If the other party is

724
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:07,626
as upright as Mr. Bo,

725
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,542
then the girl will definitely be put

726
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,250
in to the blacklist and

727
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,834
will never meet him in the rest of her life.

728
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:16,417
Let’s begin!

729
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:17,626
Come on!

730
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:18,626
Come on!

731
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:19,584
Let’s begin!

732
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,000
What’s wrong, Qi?

733
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You are unhappy.

734
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,209
You just hugged your

735
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:44,834
Bo Hai as you dreamed of.

736
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:46,751
You should be happy, right?

737
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,584
No, I’m not.

738
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,417
The more hope I see,

739
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,999
the more I’m afraid that he will learn

740
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:58,959
about my entering his dreams.

741
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:03,709
What if Bo Hai knows it

742
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:04,167
and he treats me as a liar and

743
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,209
doesn’t see me anymore?

744
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,751
Then what should I do?

745
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,501
No way.

746
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:11,918
Don’t think too much.

747
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:12,792
It’s not

748
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,459
that worse.

749
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,834
You can’t escape all the time.

750
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:17,834
You can’t escape all the time.

751
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,209
You can’t escape all the time.

752
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,999
It’s all my fault.

753
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:25,083
At the thought that

754
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:25,834
if Bo Hai knows it,

755
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,834
he won’t see me anymore…

756
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,000
Baoni…

757
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:30,792
He won’t.

758
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,334
I hate it.

759
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,250
Don’t think too much.

760
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:36,292
- No way. - What should I do?

761

Hello.

765
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,375
