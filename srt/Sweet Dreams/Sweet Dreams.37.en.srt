Here comes the good stuff.

52
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:48,999
Look at me.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,584
What’s going on?

54
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,501
Have I changed at all today?

55
00:01:59,167 --> 00:01:59,667
No.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is that appropriate?

57
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:07,959
Alright.

58
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,334
What?

59
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:16,959
Can’t you see?

60
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,209
Any difference?

61
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:21,667
What?

62
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,417
Today,

63
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,999
I put on my new glazed lip gloss.

64
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,999
It’s so moist, can’t you tell?

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,083
You don’t care about me at all.

66
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,125
How come you say that?

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,959
I erased all your late record

68
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,918
without Bo Hai knowing.

69
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,667
I downloaded movies for you during office hours.

70
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:43,667
Yesterday online,

71
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,083
there was a two-for-one sale of toilet paper.

72
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,167
I bought you…

73
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:49,876
What are you doing?

74
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,292
Domestic abuse?

75
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:54,876
I killed

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,918
a mosquito for you.

77
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,250
There really is one.

78
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:02,626
I know our Xinyan

79
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:03,375
loves me the most.

80
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,125
Give me a hug.

81
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:06,792
Does it hurt?

82
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:07,459
No.

84
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,834
As soon as I’m back on my feet,

85
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,292
I’ll pay you back.

86
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,000
Just give me a few more days.

87
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:16,292
It’s true.

88
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:17,542
No, I’m telling you the truth.

89
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,167
Dr. Zhang,

90
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:19,459
there is a patient who wants to register.

91
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:20,626
No more registration.

92
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:21,918
Tell the patient to come back tomorrow.

93
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:22,999
Got it.

94
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,667
I’m telling you the truth.

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,083
Just give me a few more days.

96
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,083
Really, I…

97
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,042
Dr. Zhang.

98
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,792
I’m in an emergency.

99
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,876
I’m sure you won’t say no.

100
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:37,792
What’s wrong?

101
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,334
I’m fine.

102
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,209
It’s you

103
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,660
who’s having a hard time.

104
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,000
I heard that your wife

105
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,999
is in the stock market.

106
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,042
She not only loses money,

107
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,792
but also owes a debt.

108
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,459
How are you going to pay it back?

109
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,167
You…

110
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,918
Who are you really?

111
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,417
I’m a businessman.

112
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,334
I want to make a deal.

113
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,459
If we work well together,

114
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:04,959
I’ll help you pay off

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,000
all your debts.

116
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,083
It’s very simple.

117
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,125
I just want to know

118
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,876
what mental disease

119
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,792
Bo Hai has.

120
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,125
We doctors

121
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,334
protect our patients’ privacy.

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,042
Then I want to know

123
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,042
who’s protecting your privacy?

124
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,626
Your wife’s debt

125
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:35,167
is a scandal.

126
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,751
The creditors are pushing so hard,

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,083
if that’s made public,

128
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,542
you will be embarrassed.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,751
I heard you’re up for a promotion.

130
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,999
Bo Hai suffers from a severe phobia.

131
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,959
Because of

132
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,334
a fire in his childhood,

133
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,959
he has a strong fear of fire,

134
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:03,083
and even can cause

135
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,792
neurological visual loss,

136
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,751
resulting in temporary color blindness.

137
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,542
It turns out Bo Hai is colorblind

138
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,999
whenever he meets fire.

139
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,417
What we found

140
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:55,459
on the prescription

141
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,876
wasn’t wrong.

142
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,751
Think about it.

143
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,459
During the floriculture competition,

144
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:03,834
Bo Hai was really in panic

145
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,584
when he saw the fire.

146
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,083
He just had a quick mind

147
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:08,709
and chose

148
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,125
to muddle through

149
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,375
with a black and white bouquet.

150
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,999
Unexpectedly,

151
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,334
the nation’s

152
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,751
leading florist

153
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:20,501
has such

154
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,459
a dark secret.

155
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,667
For some reason,

156
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,626
the universe is helping us.

157
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,000
The universe did us

158
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,125
an even bigger favor.

159
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,626
Dr. Zhang judged

160
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:35,167
that although at the dock yesterday,

161
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,626
there was no open fire,

162
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,083
the effect produced

163
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
by the projector

164
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,834
was convincing enough

165
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,125
to trigger

166
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,834
Bo Hai’s psychological shadow.

167
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,459
Next,

168
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,918
we’ll see how we seize the moment

169
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,417
to bring him down

170
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,209
and ruin him.

171
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,083
The Flower Association will hold

172
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,584
The Best Florists

173
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,042
Annual Awards Ceremony tomorrow.

174
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,542
There’s no surprise

175
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,918
that Bo Hai will win.

176
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,667
Well, let’s give him

177
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,876
a surprise.

178
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,375
When he wins the prize,

179
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,292
we’ll reveal his ugly truth.

180
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:28,167
I’m sure there’s nothing

181
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,501
more exciting than that.

182
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:37,292
Ling Guoliang.

183
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,709
I’m telling you.

184
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,918
Li Lijun really screwed up

185
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,876
her face today.

186
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,876
You were not there.

187
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,209
It’s our Bo Hai

188
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,834
made me proud.

189
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,042
Your Bo Hai?

190
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:53,959
Of course.

191
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,000
He is my future son-in-law.

192
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,542
If he is not ours, then whose?

193
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,292
Alright, alright. Yours, yours.

194
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:00,792
Qi,

195
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,918
you should just

196
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,292
call Bo Hai every now and then

197
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,334
to go around our neighborhood

198
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,834
like you did today.

199
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,501
You know what?

200
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:09,250
Among our group

201
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,459
of dancers,

202
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,667
he is very popular.

203
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:16,792
He took a picture

204
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:17,959
with us today.

205
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,292
What a great opportunity!

206
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:20,584
However,

207
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,292
we only saw a group

208
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,292
of people there,

209
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,667
there was no face of Bo Hai at all.

210
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:26,709
That’s because you’re all

211
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,584
drama queens.

212
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:28,792
Everyone is so dramatic.

213
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:29,918
That’s because you’re a bad photographer.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,834
All right, all right, all right.

215
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,751
Next time Bo Hai comes,

216
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:33,584
I’ll dress up.

217
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,083
I’ll use a selfie stick.

218
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:36,292
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,876
A selfie stick?

220
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:40,999
Qi.

221
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:42,918
This is

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,250
the card Mo Nan left

223
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,918
with 50,000 yuan in it.

224
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,125
When you see him,

225
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,000
give it to him.

226
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,167
The man has gone. We shouldn’t keep his money.

227
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:01,334
Mo Nan

228
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:02,542
had been living upstairs

229
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,918
for so long,

230
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,584
yet we didn’t even notice that

231
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,542
he is Mr. somebody.

232
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,501
We may know a man’s exterior but not his heart.

233
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,167
If he is a decent man,

234
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,751
it would have been nice

235
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,959
to set him up

236
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,501
with Qi back then.

237
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,459
What are you talking about?

238
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,250
Just saying. I’m just saying.

239
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,292
We have Bo Hai now.

240
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:32,792
I’m satisfied.

241
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,209
What’s it got to do with Mo Nan?

242
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:35,959
Eat. Eat.

243
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,000
Save your talk.

244
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:29,584
Mr. Mo.

245
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,375
She insisted on seeing you.

246
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,792
Have a seat.

247
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:02,959
Looks like

248
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,417
this is where you belong.

249
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,417
What do you want?

250
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,209
I’ve come to ask you a question.

251
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,083
It’s late.

252
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,209
You don’t come here

253
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,209
just to ask me a simple question, do you?

254
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:23,709
Right.

255
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,626
That’s a big question for me.

256
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,584
Actually,

257
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,584
I asked you once before,

258
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,250
but I don’t think

259
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:38,751
your answer

260
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,125
was true then.

261
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,999
Now that your cover

262
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,959
is blown,

263
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,709
there’s nothing to hide.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,542
So,

265
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,792
I’m gonna ask you one more time.

266
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,918
Mo Nan.

267
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,334
What you did

268
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,792
to Qi and me,

269
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,792
was that an act?

270
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,292
What we had

271
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,167
wasn’t real?

272
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:39,000
Right.

273
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,042
This was all a ploy

274
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,959
to hide my true identity.

275
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:54,584
Have you really

276
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:57,250
been lying to us this whole time?

277
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,292
Lu Baoni, the play is over.

278
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:05,876
If this play

279
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,999
gave you any illusions,

280
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,292
then I’m sorry.

281
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,959
But there’s nothing I can do.

282
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,626
The only thing you can do now

283
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,292
is to forget me as soon as possible.

284
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:22,792
Okay.

285
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,834
Tell me. Where do you live?

286
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,751
Since I walked her home,

287
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,792
I’ll walk you home, too.

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,626
Baoni, promise me.

289
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,042
Stop playing in love, okay?

290
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,459
If you continue,

291
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,459
you’ll ruin your life.

292
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,542
Find a boyfriend carefully

293
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,292
who really cares for you.

294
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,999
Girl, why are you crying?

295
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,042
Hey, girl, what’s going on?

296
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,667
Let’s go.

297
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,209
Come, come.

298
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:03,792
Come on.

299
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,167
Let go of me.

300
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,542
What’s bothering you?

301
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:07,292
What are you doing?

302
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:09,792
Ow! Ow! Ow!

303
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:14,751
Get lost!

304
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:16,417
Go, go.

305
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:24,999
You all right?

306
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,042
Did Mo Nan send you to me?

307
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:28,918
Is there something he wants to tell me?

308
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,125
I’m just returning your bag.

309
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:36,959
Thank you.

310
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:57,501
This year’s

311
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,751
Flower Association Awards Ceremony

312
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,292
is a star-studded affair.

313
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,709
In a departure from previous years,

314
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:02,667
the foreign capital community

315
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:03,751
has also begun to pay widespread attention

316
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:04,667
to this industry.

317
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,918
William Liu, the head of DREAM,

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,584
the world-famous fashion group,

319
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,709
is here, along with Mo Nan,

320
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:12,042
the President of Greater China.

321
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:13,501
Their presence

322
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,999
sparked a lot of speculation.

323
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:15,999
What kind of favor

324
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,083
will the floriculture industry get

325
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,042
from the capital?

326
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,125
What will happen

327
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,834
to the industry structure?

328
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,083
Let’s wait and see.

329
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,375
Good!

330
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,209
He is sure to win

331
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,709
the award for Best Business Management.

332
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:26,999
I’ve already written the press release.

333
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:27,999
Why not

334
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,918
the Best Florist?

335
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,834
I think he wants

336
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,083
the Best Florist in the world.

337
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:32,292
He already won

338
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,542
the Best Florist Award.

339
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,042
I think he deserves

340
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,501
an award for management.

341
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,626
Otherwise, it’s too personal

342
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,834
when it comes to publicity.

343
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,792
I think it’s the idea award.

344
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,083
In recent years, our company

345
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:46,042
has purchased

346
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,125
some large-scale places,

347
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,292
and this kind of practice is

348
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,209
subversive in the industry.

349
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:51,667
Business Management.

350
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:52,999
Best Florist.

351
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:53,999
Best Idea.

352
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,125
The wrong guys buy dinner.

353
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,083
Yeah, sure. No problem.

354
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,980
= China Flower Association
Annual Awards Ceremony =

355
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,375
- Hello. I’ve heard so much about you. - Hello.

356
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:15,751
Please, sit down.

357
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:16,209
Have a seat.

358
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:18,542
What a coincidence!

359
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,083
It’s not a coincidence.

360
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,000
I was expecting you.

361
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,000
It’s the biggest event

362
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,209
in the floriculture industry in the country.

363
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,125
We DREAM

364
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,000
are here

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,334
for the party.

366
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,999
Of course, if you don’t show up,

367
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,626
what to party?

368
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,834
How on earth does Mr. Bo

369
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,999
manage to keep a straight face?

370
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:44,000
Try more excitement.

371
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,834
It brings you more stimulation.

372
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,375
I’ve been through

373
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,417
a lot of your excitement,

374
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,501
and it’s not very creative.

375
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,501
Don’t worry.

376
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,876
Today, we are going to let you enjoy yourself.

377
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,042
Fine. I’ll wait and see.

378
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,292
Distinguished guests,

379
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,501
elites and leaders

380
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,542
of the floriculture industry,

381
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:06,751
and warm friends

382
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:07,667
from press,

383
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:08,626
welcome!

384
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,167
The 2017

385
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,876
Flower Association Annual Awards Ceremony

386
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,250
starts now!

387
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:19,125
And now we’re going to present

388
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:20,375
Outstanding Achievement Award.

389
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,042
This award

390
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,626
is intended to reward those who have made

391
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,083
significant contributions to the industry.

392
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:26,709
So,

393
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,542
which well-respected person

394
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,584
will receive

395
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,083
the honor?

396
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,340
= Outstanding Achievement Award Bo Hai =

397
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:38,417
There is this one man

398
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,876
who is the youngest

399
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,959
in the Flower Association history.

400
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:42,792
But his achievements

401
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,167
are well-known.

402
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,292
Over the past six years, he has led his team

403
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,334
to quickly become

404
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,792
the leading daily flower provider

405
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,292
in China,

406
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:52,667
and he creatively put forward

407
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,626
the concept of the flower lifestyle.

408
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:55,918
Users can place orders via

409
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:56,751
WeChat’s Service Accounts

410
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:57,959
and applications,

411
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,000
then they can receive a box

412
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,542
of seasonal flowers.

413
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,918
Flowers used to be a gift.

414
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,292
Now he has turned them

415
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,501
into a lifestyle.

416
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:08,459
This man is

417
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,167
the CEO of FlowerPlus,

418
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,334
Mr. Bo Hai!

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,834
It’s worth

420
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:17,918
our crazy cheer for you.

421
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,876
Do we have any wine?

422
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,626
I think we need wine

423
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,709
at this moment.

424
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:22,292
We do.

425
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,125
There’s still two bottles of wine left

426
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,375
from our last service.

427
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,000
Give them here.

428
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,000
You’re all wrong.

429
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,292
Who’s buying dinner?

430
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,167
The boss.

431
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,876
Right, right, right.

432
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:35,292
Next,

433
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,167
let’s welcome

434
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,584
Secretary-General Zhang of the Flower Association

435
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,918
to present the award to Bo Hai.

436
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:50,751
Hi, Mr. Bo.

437
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,292
I heard

438
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,167
you’re quite colorblind.

439
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,042
Most of your works

440
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,167
were done

441
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:57,918
by someone else.

442
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,792
Is that true?

443
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,209
Color blindness? How is that possible?

444
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:11,876
Dear media friend,

445
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,667
we will arrange

446
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,751
an interview

447
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,125
after the award ceremony.

448
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,209
Please have a seat.

449
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,167
We don’t want an interview.

450
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,125
We want the truth.

451
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:19,999
Secretary-General Zhang,

452
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,083
what is the impartiality of this award?

453
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,459
Without clarification,

454
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:23,209
we cannot recognize

455
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,125
the value of this award.

456
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:25,501
If so,

457
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,999
could it be the biggest scandal

458
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,042
in the country’s floriculture industry?

459
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:28,918
This is slander!

460
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:30,584
I’m also a florist.

461
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:31,375
I’ve seen

462
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,417
Mr. Bo make flowers.

463
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,542
His color sense

464
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,501
is absolutely superb.

465
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,125
But since there is such a rumor,

466
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,334
I believe that the matter of color blindness

467
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:38,834
will not be groundless.

468
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,667
Mr. Bo, please give me a positive response.

469
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,000
We need you to set the record straight

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,959
personally

471
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,334
for the public.

472
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,667
Everyone, I’ve been doing this

473
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,792
for over 30 years.

474
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,334
I know all kinds of

475
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,250
people and things in this industry.

476
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,709
Since someone today has questions about Bo Hai,

477
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,417
about the Flower Association,

478
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:06,459
then I think,

479
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,501
we should have Bo Hai

480
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,417
do a practice for us on the spot.

481
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:12,292
Seeing is believing.

482
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,459
The pure is pure, and the turbid is turbid.

483
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,292
Strength is the best answer.

484
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,042
Bo Hai.

485
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:23,959
Do it.

486
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:28,292
Xinyan.

487
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:40,250
Color blindness?

488
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,760
Yeah, what if he’s really colorblind?

489
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,308
He can’t even tell the colors.

490
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,400
What if these people are telling the truth?

491
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:48,250
No way.

492
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,542
A florist is colorblind?

493
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,667
How is that possible?

494
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:00,792
What’s he doing?

495
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,417
A stall tactic.

496
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:03,834
I think he’s trying to come up with something.

497
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:06,334
So the news is true.

498
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,042
Yeah, I never thought

499
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,292
he’d turn out like this.

500
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:10,125
He doesn’t move at all

501
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,000
on stage.

502
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,501
I think he’s feeling guilty.

503
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,417
The fact is clear to everyone.

504
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,959
Bo Hai cheats

505
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:18,918
the public.

506
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,292
What do you have to say for yourself?

507
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:21,584
He really can’t do it.

508
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:22,501
Yeah.

509
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:23,417
He is not

510
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:25,250
doing anything at all.

511
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:26,959
Just admit it.

512
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,083
So he really is colorblind.

513
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:31,959
There’s got to be something wrong with this.

514
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:04,501
Wait!

515
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,459
This work of Bo Hai

516
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,876
is well-layered and full of verve.

517
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,167
It’s very appealing.

518
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:14,918
In the face of

519
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,459
such a perfect piece of work,

520
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,000
how clumsy

521
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,000
those rumors are!

522
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:25,584
Sir,

523
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:27,751
please let me say something.

524
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:28,999
Yes, please.

525
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:29,834
Thank you.

526
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,876
About what happened back there,

527
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:38,792
it’s not exactly a rumor.

528
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,667
I do have color blindness.

529
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,667
Color blindness?

530
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:45,959
Not wrong about him.

531
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:49,209
When I was a child,

532
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:50,501
a particular experience

533
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:53,042
gave me a phobia.

534
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:55,959
When it happens,

535
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,417
I get color blindness.

536
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,209
Although the frequency

537
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,042
is not very high,

538
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,667
it has

539
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,501
seriously affected

540
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:05,292
my work.

541
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,501
So when it happens,

542
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,501
I try to avoid work.

543
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,417
When necessary,

544
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,083
I will ask my assistant

545
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:15,626
to do some assistance

546
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,167
according to my design concept.

547
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,042
Then,

548
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,125
I’ll explain it to the client.

549
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,292
So there is no such thing

550
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:24,167
as deliberate deception.

551
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:26,042
The reason why

552
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,417
I didn’t mention it to you

553
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:28,999
is that I was worried

554
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,709
that some people

555
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:33,375
would make a big deal out of it.

556
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,209
As it turns out,

557
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,667
my concerns are not misplaced.

558
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,292
But this time

559
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:41,959
they failed.

560
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,542
Because my symptoms

561
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,167
have been completely cured

562
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,375
with aggressive treatment.

563
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,709
As a florist,

564
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,334
his expertise and skills

565
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,709
are obvious.

566
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:09,542
We are touched by your candor.

567
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:11,125
So,

568
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,584
I think you deserve this award.

569
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,542
You earn it.

570
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:54,125
Are you really cured?

571
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:55,042
Do you have any idea

572
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,292
how worried we were about you?

573
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,751
You didn’t even tell us you were cured.

574
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:58,918
End of friendship!

575
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:02,792
You were not lying to them, were you?

576
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:05,626
In fact,

577
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,626
I made sure I was cured

578
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,834
before the ceremony.

579
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:12,876
How did you make sure

580
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:14,125
you’re cured?

581
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,709
Could it

582
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:19,626
be that you just happened

583
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,125
not to have one this time?

584
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,459
In order to test

585
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,000
whether you are really cured,

586
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,417
I specially put on

587
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,876
colorful clothes today.

588
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:32,999
Can you tell me

589
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,876
what colors I’m wearing?

590
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,626
Don’t try to fool me.

591
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,501
Navy blue and white.

592
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,167
Looks like he’s really cured.

593
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,709
Well, that’s odd.

594
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:47,918
All these years,

595
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:48,999
after all the doctors you’ve seen,

596
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:49,792
you were not cured.

597
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,999
Why are you healed now?

598
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,459
William, I’m sorry.

599
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:41,918
What happened today was my fault.

600
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:43,042
Never mind.

601
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,792
The failure of a small battle

602
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:47,999
will not affect

603
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,334
the implementation of the whole strategy.

604
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:52,000
I underestimated my enemy.

605
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,542
Word’s already out about

606
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,709
DREAM buying FlowerPlus.

607
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:01,000
Chinese and foreign media

608
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,667
have given it a lot of coverage.

609
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:04,999
DREAM has even

610
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,209
redone its

611
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,834
strategic deployment in China.

612
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,167
It was supposed

613
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,167
to be a quiet

614
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,292
blitz.

615
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:15,876
But it turned out to be

616
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:17,876
a pitched battle between two companies.

617
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:19,709
If we don’t

618
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:21,459
deliver results soon,

619
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,626
the foreigners on the board

620
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,542
will lose patience.

621
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:29,083
Because of my mistake,

622
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:29,918
you’re under a lot of pressure

623
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,334
from the board.

624
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:32,918
Don’t worry.

625
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:34,459
I’ll get it done as soon as I can.

626
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,834
Compared to our previous prey,

627
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:43,501
FlowerPlus is not the largest,

628
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,501
nor the most experienced,

629
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,292
but the most formidable.

630
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,792
We’ve waited too long

631
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:57,792
and suffered too long.

632
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,709
You really scared me.

633
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,667
God bless

634
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,876
your illness has been cured.

635
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,626
What bless?

636
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,834
It’s not God that heals me.

637
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,167
It’s you.

638
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:31,167
Me?

639
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,918
How did I do that?

640
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,459
You’re my medicine.

641
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,709
Bo Hai!

642
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,792
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

643
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,417
I got you. It’s OK.

644
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:47,000
This is not real. Don’t be scared.

645
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,501
I’m with you. It’s OK.

646
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,042
Bo Hai!

647
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:02,417
Bo Hai! Don’t worry. It’s OK.

648
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:04,375
This is not real. Don’t be scared.

649
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,876
You healed me with your love.

650
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,042
If one day,

651
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,459
I break up with you,

652
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,876
you will be hopeless.

653
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:19,751
You dare?

654
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:21,709
You’ll never

655
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,209
leave me again.

656
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,417
Did he really say that?

657
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:34,876
Yeah, I’m telling you.

658
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,959
Right in front of his mother-in-law.

659
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:36,584
Did he really say that?

660
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:37,375
Oh, come on.’

661
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,250
This was so stupid.

662
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:53,209
Color is life.

663
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:55,209
Because

664
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:57,667
a world without color

665
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,375
is dead.

666
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:03,334
Fire makes light, and light makes color.

667
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,459
Intonation gives color to words.

668
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:08,918
Color gives shape

669
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,751
to sound from the spirit.

670
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:12,918
Every color

671
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,959
is the friend of the color next door,

672
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:16,459
and the lover

673
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,834
of the color of the opposite position.

674
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,999
There can’t be too much artificiality in color.

675
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:26,375
They’re supposed to come from nature.

676
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:31,834
I don’t like the stiff names

677
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,167
on the color cards.

678
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,083
I prefer to call them

679
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,125
romantic purple

680
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,626
or playful pink.

681
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,709
Thanks to the sun,

682
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:49,834
we live in

683
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,501
a colorful world every day.

684
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,167
Feeling the color changes in the four seasons.

685
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,417
Humans can recognize five million

686
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,083
to ten million colors,

687
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,876
but only 1,200 of them

688
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,834
have names.

689
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,876
Some of these colors are lonely,

690
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,167
some are shining,

691
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:13,125
some are sad, and some are warm.

692
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,417
Although the colors

693
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,999
are not all beautiful,

694
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,459
this colorful world

695
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:30,667
is so gorgeous and wonderful.

696
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:29,999
Mo Nan.

697
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,417
Stop it.

698
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:43,501
I understand your bitterness.

699
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,542
But what you’re doing right now

700
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,042
is just too much.

701
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,250
Stop it.

702
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:52,751
Stop?

703
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,250
Did Lu Yunqing ever think about quitting

704
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,626
when she killed my dad?

705
00:34:58,501 --> 00:34:59,459
But there has to be

706
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,334
an end to this revenge.

707
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:05,876
Sure,

708
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,542
but not now.

709
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,751
Mo Nan! Mo Nan!

710
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,918
Mo Nan! Listen to me. Mo Nan!

711
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:16,626
Even if you

712
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:18,542
don’t have any feelings for me,

713
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,542
I still don’t want to see you

714
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:22,667
go farther away,

715
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,209
becoming more and more strange.

716
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,459
I’m afraid if you go away,

717
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,584
I’ll never find you again.

718
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,000
We are strangers anyway.

719
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,125
And

720
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:54,209
we’ll never meet again.

721
00:36:58,626 --> 00:36:59,542
I’m suspended from the hospital.

722
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,167
What more do you want?

723
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,292
You played me.

724
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,292
Dude, I wouldn’t dare.

725
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:05,209
It’s a misunderstanding.

726
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:06,375
What’s the misunderstanding?

727
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:07,459
I’m telling you,

728
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:08,542
if you piss me off,

729
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:09,959
I’ll do anything necessary.

730
00:37:11,584 --> 00:37:12,667
No. No, man.

731
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,083
I watched the live broadcast

732
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,000
of the awards show.

733
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,959
I’m surprised

734
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,250
at him, too.

735
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:19,209
You’re surprised?

736
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,999
You’re his shrink.

737
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:22,250
Don’t you have any judgment?

738
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,000
Loser!

739
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:24,042
No, man.

740
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:24,999
In psychotherapy,

741
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:26,125
there’s a lot

742
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,584
of uncertainty.

743
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,250
But… But I’m sure

744
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:30,501
Bo Hai’s recovery

745
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,000
this time

746
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,083
must be

747
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,751
temporary.

748
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:36,000
It’s got to be temporary!

749
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:36,999
Temporary?

750
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,209
Right, right, right.

751
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:39,501
Easy on the hands

752
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,834
back there.

753
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,209
Let me stand up and talk.

754
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,417
Let me stand up and talk.

755
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:46,959
Take it easy. Take it easy.

756
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,250
Man, I’m telling you.

757
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,501
His psychological problems

758
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:53,292
have nothing

759
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,083
to do with fire.

760
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,501
In his childhood,

761
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,918
the experience of being abandoned

762
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,709
cast a shadow

763
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,250
over him.

764
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,167
The fire

765
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:02,792
is only

766
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,375
an external symbol.

767
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:05,792
If Bo Hai

768
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:06,626
finds another

769
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,792
new… Well, new

770
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:10,709
emotional sustenance,

771
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,125
such as family

772
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,375
and love,

773
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,626
his illness

774
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,876
might have

775
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:18,375
the chance to be cured.

776
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:19,626
Naturally, he will be

777
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:20,876
less sensitive to fire.

778
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:22,083
But if his

779
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,959
new emotional sustenance

780
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,999
does a reenactment of

781
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,083
what happened

782
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,584
and abandons Bo Hai all over again,

783
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:33,542
there’s a good chance that his condition

784
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,000
will develop in a direction

785
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,375
which can’t be controlled.

786
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:38,000
There’s a chance

787
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:38,918
he’ll never

788
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:40,125
be cured.

789
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,334
New emotional sustenance?

790
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,250
A reenactment of what happened?

791
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:45,459
Right.

792
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:50,417
Mr. Mo.

793
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,542
What’s your plan?

794
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,751
Are you really going to force Ling Lingqi

795
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,000
to abandon Bo Hai?

796
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:18,292
I planned to

797
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,751
watch a movie with you.

798
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:21,125
But with all this overtime,

799
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,584
the movie should have

800
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:23,792
started by now.

801
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,876
Why are you looking at me?

802
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:29,167
Do I have something on my face?

803
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,667
Here, let me take a closer look.

804
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,167
But if his

805
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,667
new emotional sustenance

806
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,292
does a reenactment of

807
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:09,250
what happened

808
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,167
and abandons Bo Hai all over again,

809
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:13,584
there’s a good chance that his condition

810
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,000
will develop in a direction

811
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,334
which can’t be controlled.

812
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:17,459
Mr. Mo.

813
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,626
Are you really going to force Ling Lingqi

814
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,959
to abandon Bo Hai?

815
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:27,626
How was the movie?

816
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,292
No movie is interesting enough

817
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:31,792
when I’m watching it with you.

818
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,626
What do you mean?

819
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,834
I was too busy watching you.

820
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,667
I was not interested in the movie anymore.

821
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,417
I’ll give you 100 points for that.

822
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:43,042
You know how to pick up girls.

823
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,042
But I think you…

824
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,417
Come, kid, take a look.

825
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,125
Xiaoming, is this OK?

826
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,584
What do you think? Is it big?

827
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:53,375
I want that one.

828
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,125
You like it?

829
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:55,292
You like this one?

830
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,334
Since I was eight,

831
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:58,876
I haven’t bought a windmill.

832
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,250
So every time I see a child

833
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,375
holding a windmill,

834
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,792
I feel envious.

835
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:04,751
In fact, I envy

836
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:06,667
the windmill vendor the most.

837
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:07,792
They can have

838
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,209
so many windmills.

839
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:10,918
You know what?

840
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:12,751
In my heart, a windmill

841
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,542
is not only a toy,

842
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:16,709
but also a child’s hope

843
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,250
and parents’ love.

844
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:21,834
Wait for me.

845
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:25,334
Hey, sir.

846
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,584
Which one do you like, miss?

847
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:40,209
Come!

848
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:41,876
I bought these for you.

849
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,292
Make up for what you’ve lost.

850
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:44,918
Am I good?

851
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:45,959
Thank you.

852
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:46,959
Give me a hug.
