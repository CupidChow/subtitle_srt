You know

anything else

53
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,542
eternal like those stars

00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:48,667
up in the sky?

55
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,125
Us.

56
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:55,709
Right.

57
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,250
Our friendship

58
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,751
is everlasting.

59
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,334
What if we have a fight?

60
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,083
No chance.

61
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,876
What if?

62
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,083
If we have a fight,

63
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,918
it must be my problem.

64
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:15,959
If you like,

65
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,167
I’ll do crazy things with you.

66
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,375
If anyone bullies you,

67
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,042
I’ll give him a hard time.

68
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,292
- Deal. Cheers!
- Come.

69
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:34,999
Ling Lingqi!

70
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:38,959
I gotta go.

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,000
If my mom is pissed off,

72
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,292
she’d chatter for hours.

73
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:42,876
I gotta go.

74
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:44,209
Wait.

75
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:45,000
Here,

76
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:45,959
any smell?

77
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:50,876
No, it’s ok.

78
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:51,459
It’s ok.

79
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,709
Not at all.

80
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,459
See you guys.

81
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,209
How could there is no smell?

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,709
- Qi. - Come.

83
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:58,125
She’s gone.

84
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:58,834
Let’s drink.

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,209
Be careful downstairs.

86
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:12,167
Ling Lingqi!

87
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,209
You drank?

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,834
No.

89
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:22,959
A little bit.

90
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,375
Look at you!

91
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:26,375
You’re a girl.

92
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,626
Look what you’re like now!

93
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,083
If I didn’t call you back,

94
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,292
when you’re gonna stop

95
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,959
drinking with Mo Nan?

96
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,918
Are you waiting for me and your dad

97
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,209
carrying you down?

98
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:35,834
Mom, how can I

99
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:36,999
drink that much!

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,584
I…

101
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,292
We just drank a little bit

102
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,834
to celebrate Mo Nan moving in.

103
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:41,542
Take a smell if you don’t believe me.

104
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,042
I’m warning you.

105
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,876
Keep a distance from Mo Nan.

106
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,501
Tell me the truth,

107
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:51,918
is he up to something

108
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:52,751
on you?

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,125
No.

110
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,584
We’re sisters.

111
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:57,626
Good friends.

112
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,209
He’s my bestie.

113
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,501
How’s that possible?

114
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,250
You young girls

115
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,125
are out of mind.

116
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,334
How could a man

117
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:06,876
be a sister

118
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,125
to you?

119
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:09,751
I’ll go to sleep.

120
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:13,501
Remember,

121
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,042
if a man can only

122
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,000
afford a balcony,

123
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,167
he’s good for nothing.

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,501
If you’re with him,

125
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,584
you’ll have hard times.

126
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,542
I’m going to bed, good night.

127
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,918
Wait, I haven’t finished yet!

128
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:29,709
Boss,

129
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,417
you scared us to death yesterday,

130
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,209
you know that?

131
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:33,876
Coffee.

132
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:34,709
It’s hot.

133
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,167
Thanks.

134
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,417
We’ve already hired

135
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,292
the best security team

136
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:39,292
to make sure

137
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,083
the safety of this venue.

138
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,334
But something still happened.

139
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,751
It must be Wen Guangqi again.

140
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,542
He always play hard for his purposes.

141
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,959
It’s obvious.

142
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,751
But luckily,

143
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,792
our great Mr. Bo

144
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,250
saw farther,

145
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,375
preparing the

146
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,417
redundant flowers

147
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:56,626
in advance, right?

148
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,375
But that’s minor.

149
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,167
The person

150
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,626
is what that matters.

151
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,501
Now the most important thing is

152
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,209
Bo Hai’s eyes.

153
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,375
As soon as I saw the fire yesterday,

154
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,751
I thought of your illness.

155
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,083
Previous times when it attacked,

156
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,042
at least we can find an excuse

157
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,125
to evade.

158
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,209
But tomorrow the exhibition will be on.

159
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,375
And the customer specially

160
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,626
asked you to do it personally.

161
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:23,626
What to do now?

162
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:30,667
I got an idea.

163
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,626
What is it?

164
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,125
How about

165
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,918
we find someone

166
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,167
to replace Bo Hai?

167
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,334
What do you think?

168
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,125
Bad idea.

169
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,083
No, listen to me.

170
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,000
We’ve signed

171
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,459
a contract

172
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:47,876
with them.

173
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,042
As a matter of fact,

174
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,334
even if we lose the business,

175
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,876
economic loss is no big deal.

176
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,125
But if it affects

177
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,292
our company’s reputation

178
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,959
and Mr. Bo’s reputation,

179
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,167
that’s not something we can undertake.

180
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,375
I’d rather break the contract
than finding a substitute.

181
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,626
Bo Hai, I know

182
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,334
it’s a bad idea.

183
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,584
And it’s also dishonorable.

184
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,209
But we got

185
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,083
forgivable reasons.

186
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,250
I think

187
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,542
Chen Mo got the point.

188
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,250
It’s a special situation now.

189
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,250
It’s impossible for our client to

190
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:24,209
fully understand us

191
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,334
with asymmetrical information.

192
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:26,876
Finding someone do the job for you

193
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,334
is just a makeshift.

194
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:30,959
Whatever you two

195
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,834
say today,

196
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:32,918
I’ll never agree on it.

197
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,292
I’ll go explain it to the client.

198
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:35,709
Call Zhang.

199
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,667
Ask him to pick me up.

200
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,375
Boss, how are you gonna

201
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,751
explain it to them?

202
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:52,626
It’s strange.

203
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,209
Mr. Bo is not back yet?

204
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,459
Mr. Bo is a workaholic.

205
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,250
But what happened yesterday

206
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,209
seems not concern him at all.

207
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:01,918
It’s not him.

208
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,667
Right. I think so.

209
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,167
At this time,

210
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,292
we better think it over

211
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,751
how to explain it.

212
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,501
How to explain?

213
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:28,709
Should we tell them

214
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:29,834
we’re standing them up?

215
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:30,709
We give up on this job

216
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,959
and you do whatever you like to do.

217
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,751
Once it’s simmered,

218
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:35,250
it’s not only

219
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,542
about our company’s interest.

220
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:37,250
Bo Hai’s

221
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,250
intermittent color blindness

222
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,501
will also be put in the air.

223
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:40,584
This is gonna be

224
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,792
a devastating blow

225
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,417
for a famous florist.

226
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:48,167
Bo Hai’s illness

227
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,584
is like a time bomb.

228
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:50,792
Once it’s detonated,

229
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,042
the flower empire he built

230
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,792
by himself will be gone.

231
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:55,751
I’ve been doing marketing job

232
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,667
for years,

233
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:57,999
I’m not exaggerating.

234
00:07:58,542 --> 00:07:59,584
For so many years,

235
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,542
we’ve helped him starting this business.

236
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,417
We can’t watch him

237
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,584
destroying his career

238
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:03,542
without doing anything.

239
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:05,751
What shall we do?

240
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:06,792
He’s a stubborn donkey.

241
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,375
We can’t persuade him.

242
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,584
Xinyan, if we can’t,

243
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,125
then we don’t.

244
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,626
- Act first. - Act first.

245
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,167
We’ve signed

246
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,792
a contract

247
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,042
with them.

248
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,250
As a matter of fact,

249
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,542
even if we lose the business,

250
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,000
economic loss is no big deal.

251
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:37,834
But if it affects

252
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,417
our company’s reputation

253
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,167
and Mr. Bo’s reputation,

254
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,292
that’s not something we can undertake.

255
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:53,999
Hello? I’m driving.

256
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:57,542
I see.

257
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:00,959
What is it?

258
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,584
The water pipe burst ahead.

259
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,334
A rush-repair is being done.

260
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,042
We gotta take a detour

261
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,042
to Mr. Li’s home.

262
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,375
Hey,

263
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:15,250
what’s going on with Mr. Bo?

264
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,709
I’m worrying for him.

265
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,751
Why he’s still not here?

266
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:19,626
Seems he’s gonna

267
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,959
make us work overnight today.

268
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,876
My facial mask costs over one hundred yuan.

269
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:24,751
Listen up, everyone.

270
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,375
First of all, thanks for your hard work.

271
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,999
You’re all doing a great job.

272
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:30,375
So today,

273
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,334
all of us are taking a day off.

274
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:31,999
Go back and have some rest.

275
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,000
Seriously?

276
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:35,209
The exhibition will be on

277
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,250
in hours.

278
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,417
And the Mirror Lake is like shit now.

279
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:40,083
You ask us to go home?

280
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,083
Mr. Bo

281
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,292
is on the way here.

282
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,417
What are you panicking about?

283
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,417
If we’re all off work,

284
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,042
Mr. Bo would be furious

285
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,417
if he comes back.

286
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,209
No.

287
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,292
This is what he told me.

288
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,667
I’ve talked with him.

289
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,459
What’s wrong with you guys?

290
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,125
Why so many crap to leave work early?

291
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,501
Should I be left

292
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,083
to help him?

293
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,083
No need.

294
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:02,959
The accident before

295
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,584
delayed the progress of our work,

296
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,209
so Mr. Bo dispatched

297
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,667
three experienced florists

298
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:08,709
from the branch

299
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:09,501
to be his assistants.

300
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:10,501
So you can leave too.

301
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,125
Go home, everyone.

302
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,501
Okay, let’s go.

303
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,667
Then… Let’s go.

304
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,000
- Go. - Go.

305
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,334
It doesn’t feel right.

306
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,083
Isn’t it great to take a day off?

307
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,125
Whatever it is right or wrong.

308
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,167
= Single Flower Monthly Package =

309
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:42,542
= Single Flower Monthly Package =
Here you go.

310
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:44,709
I’ve ordered

311
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:45,876
every Monday’s flower for you.

312
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:46,667
You can take some

313
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,250
to decorate your balcony.

314
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:49,834
If you need food

315
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,584
or anything else,

316
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:51,292
you can take it directly

317
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,417
from my dad’s shop.

318
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,999
I’m so happy to be friends

319
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,000
with you rich people.

320
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:58,375
Who is rich?

321
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,667
We’re poor, OK?

322
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:02,959
This is our shop.

323
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:04,209
My dad is still here.

324
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,626
Come on in.

325
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,250
Dad, these are my friends.

326
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:08,459
You’re here.

327
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,417
Hi, uncle.

328
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,417
- Hi. - Uncle Ling.

329
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:11,959
Be my guest.

330
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,792
I’ll sell at purchasing price.

331
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,918
So generous. Thanks, uncle.

332
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

333
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,042
Let me check.

334
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,626
There are… What’s wrong?

335
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,417
What are you talking about, purchasing price?

336
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:26,292
Think about it.

337
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,751
I’ll suffer losses.

338
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,709
The delivery, utility and rent.

339
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:32,501
These are all costly.

340
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:33,292
Keep it down.

341
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,417
Dad, what are you thinking about?

342
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,584
You ask him to do labor job.

343
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:36,209
You will earn it back

344
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,626
in a couple of days.

345
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,792
You should look on the long run.

346
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,375
Don’t haggle over every ounce.

347
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,501
Look at his skinny body.

348
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,459
He can do the labor job?

349
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:43,626
When can I get

350
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,000
my profit back?

351
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,501
I know.

352
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,167
I’ll make it up.

353
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,209
Keep it down.

354
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,083
How could you have immortal flowers?

355
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:56,375
Uncle Ling.

356
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:57,792
When did you start

357
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,250
selling immortal flowers?

358
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,167
Well…

359
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,999
Isn’t it FlowerPlus’s mark?

360
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,000
How could it be?

361
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:10,000
Our company has

362
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,709
strict distribution channel policy

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,918
to maintain

364
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
brand image.

365
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,751
We can’t sell flowers

366
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,292
to small shops.

367
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,626
Uncle, isn’t it

368
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,834
fake product?

369
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,083
Counterfeit?

370
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:25,709
No, no. This…

371
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:26,709
It can’t be, Dad.

372
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,709
What’s going on?

373
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,250
It’s getting harder for small business.

374
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,334
I heard

375
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,334
they’re opening up

376
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,375
a supermarket nearby.

377
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:34,542
And it’s 24 hours

378
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,292
open.

379
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,083
If I don’t find a new path and

380
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:38,709
figure out another way,

381
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:39,751
my small shop

382
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,292
may be closed tomorrow.

383
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,834
But you can’t sell counterfeit!

384
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:44,709
If someone finds out,

385
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:46,125
you know what are the consequences?

386
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,542
Shut up!

387
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,501
I won’t sell it anymore.

388
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,459
I won’t, OK?

389
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,542
I won’t sell it anymore.

390
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,083
How much are these, uncle?

391
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,292
It’s for free.

392
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,083
For free. Go.

393
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,667
- For free. - For free?

394
00:12:58,792 --> 00:12:59,292
For free. Really.

395
00:12:59,292 --> 00:12:59,667
It’s OK.

396
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,083
Go. Just leave.

397
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,000
I’ll pay him later.

398
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:01,459
Just go.

399
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:02,000
It’s all right.

400
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,876
Thank you, Uncle Ling.

401
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:03,375
Thank you, uncle.

402
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:03,792
Just go.

403
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:04,584
Bye, uncle.

404
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,999
Shortsighted!

405
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,042
In all business,

406
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,375
if you don’t play edge ball,

407
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,250
how can you make money?

408
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,125
All cleared up. The door is locked too.

409
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:34,959
About Bo Hai, I got him.

410
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,751
He won’t be able

411
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:36,542
to see Mr. Li.

412
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,334
This is the design drawing.

413
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,459
Now it’s your turn.

414
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:40,751
If you have any questions, let us know.

415
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:41,918
OK.

416
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,125
You know the importance of this task,

417
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,459
I won’t mention it again.

418
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:46,876
This is our last resort.

419
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,834
Our last fight.

420
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,584
We got nothing to lose.

421
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:50,501
You understand me?

422
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, I understand.

423
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,459
Let’s get started.

424
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,542
Are you doing it deliberately?

425
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:15,042
Who asked you?

426
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,125
Zhou Xinyan or Chen Mo?

427
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,876
You owe me one.

428
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,876
Turn back. Go to the venue.

429
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,501
Chen Mo, Xinyan!

430
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,334
I know you’re in there.

431
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:39,125
Open the door!

432
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,999
What are you doing!

433
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:33,375
Sorry.

434
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,626
We got no other option.

435
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,042
We can only act first and then tell you.

436
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,876
We’ve been working together for 6 years,

437
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,876
how could you lie to me?

438
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,125
Are you gonna make me

439
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,542
the biggest joke in this industry?

440
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,334
We did it for your good.

441
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,042
Once your illness goes public,

442
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,250
your career is gonna be destroyed.

443
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,501
That’s my business.

444
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:53,459
Who asked you

445
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,417
to save me

446
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:55,501
with your sense of justice?

447
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,876
Bo Hai, don’t be mad.

448
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,167
It’s no use to be mad now.

449
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,125
It’s already happened.

450
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:01,959
How about you

451
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:02,876
listen to us once?

452
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,042
Only once, OK?

453
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:05,626
This is all

454
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:06,667
me and Chen Mo’s work.

455
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:07,834
We’re not finding any excuse

456
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:08,792
to pass the buck.

457
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,375
Once the exhibition is over,

458
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,459
we’ll take all punishment.

459
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,334
Is this what you want?

460
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,125
Make it done,

461
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,083
so I can’t undo it.

462
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:24,501
I’ll be under your control.

463
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,417
Remember,

464
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,834
I’m your boss!

465
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:27,959
You have no right

466
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,459
to change my decision!

467
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,125
You think you can

468
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,626
control me now?

469
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,375
Okay, I’ll call Mr. Li

470
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,876
right now!

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,792
I’ll tell him what happened.

472
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,626
No, boss.

473
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,167
All you care is your artistic faith.

474
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:41,959
Have you ever thought about that

475
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,667
over two hundred staff

476
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,250
will lose their jobs?

477
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:45,751
If your career is over,

478
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:46,542
the company is over.

479
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,709
What about those staff?

480
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,334
All you care is your face.

481
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,959
You’re being selfish!

482
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,417
Hello, Mr. Bo?

483
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,792
Hello, Mr. Bo?

484
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,542
Are you still there, Mr. Bo?

485
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:04,375
Hello, Mr. Li.

486
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,918
I’m Mr. Bo’s secretary,

487
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:08,834
Chen Mo.

488
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:11,209
Nothing.

489
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:12,167
I just call to check

490
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:13,042
if you have other

491
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:14,167
special requirements tomorrow?

492
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,292
No.

493
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,542
Okay, bye.

494
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,250
This one?

495
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Is it the strongest?

496
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:29,542
Try reverse direction.

497
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:30,083
Reverse.

498
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:30,792
Doesn’t work.

499
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,542
What’s wrong with it?

500
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,334
I don’t think we can

501
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,292
have hot pot today.

502
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,584
Shall we order takeout?

503
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,584
Wait.

504
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,751
Wait a minute.

505
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:48,751
It’s not right.

506
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,959
It should work.

507
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:55,584
I’m coming.

508
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:56,918
Take that away.

509
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,751
Take it away!

510
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,167
Take it away now!

511
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:01,501
Be careful.

512
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,709
Charge it.

513
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,667
Will that work?

514
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,792
Yeah, charge it.

515
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,042
You’re impressive, Qi.

516
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,000
It’s true.

517
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:21,876
A glutton

518
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,042
always has his way.

519
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:30,999
It’s boiling.

520
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,751
Come on, stir it.

521
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:34,751
Shall we put the meat in?

522
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:35,667
- Yeah, put it in. - Come on.

523
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:36,959
- Put it in. - Put the meat in.

524
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:37,667
Just put it in.

525
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:41,999
Oh, no!

526
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,918
I gotta go back to the venue.

527
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:45,125
For what?

528
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:45,918
No.

529
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:46,542
I forgot to insert

530
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,209
water-storage tube

531
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,209
for hydrangea.

532
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:48,959
If I don’t go back,

533
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,083
they’ll be dried up tomorrow!

534
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:50,834
I’ll bring you there.

535
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:51,959
No need.

536
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:52,959
Sounds like you got a car.

537
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,709
Save me some meat.

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,834
You better hurry.

539
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:55,459
OK.

540
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:12,999
It’s so strange.

541
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,042
Why did they lock the door?

542
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:19,542
Chomper said

543
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,542
he’s gonna work late.

544
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,417
You won’t stop me.

545
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,542
I’ve done this before

546
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,751
when I’m in college.

547
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,459
Go back and have some rest, boss.

548
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:34,209
Don’t worry,

549
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:34,876
we’re here.

550
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,709
We got this.

551
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,959
Right. You had no

552
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,167
good sleep for days.

553
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,375
Go back and sleep.

554
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,501
Oh my goodness, it wasn’t Bo Hai!

555
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,501
What’s going on?

556
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:53,918
Keep an eye on it.

557
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,250
Secretary Chen,

558
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,000
Bo Hai is a master florist.

559
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:05,542
You said he’s sick,

560
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,000
so you asked me here.

561
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,292
But he’s obviously well.

562
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,083
Why you ask me to do it?

563
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,209
Sir, just do

564
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,334
your job.

565
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,999
Don’t ask any questions.

566
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:17,542
I know it even you don’t tell me.

567
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,834
Florist is like a painter

568
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:21,876
or a composer.

569
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,334
Even a master will

570
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,792
have his inspiration dried up someday.

571
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,375
But to keep face and

572
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:28,709
maintain their position,

573
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:29,667
people like us

574
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:30,667
can be put to use.

575
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,417
Don’t talk nonsense!

576
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:33,417
We’ve signed

577
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,876
confidentiality agreement.

578
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,250
What kind of person you find?

579
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,876
He’s my old folk at home, a good man.

580
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,417
Just has a vicious tongue.

581
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,542
Don’t worry, he’ll keep the secret.

582
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:02,584
Speaking of love,

583
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:03,709
we’ll come to roses

584
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:05,292
that represent love.

585
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,999
Now we’ll make a bouquet

586
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,083
with roses.

587
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,876
Let me show you.

588
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,083
Sorry, Mr. Bo.

589
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,292
I didn’t mean it.

590
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,209
You’re fired.

591
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:17,709
In FlowerPlus, every employee’s

592
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,542
first task

593
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,083
is to bring wonderful life experience

594
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,292
to customers,

595
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:21,999
instead of

596
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,459
making his own family happy.

597
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:24,501
If you keep working

598
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:25,918
in such an unrealistic way,

599
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:27,751
I will make your dream

600
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:28,959
into a nightmare.

601
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:33,667
Oh my goodness!

602
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,292
This is real Bo Hai.

603
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:38,626
Aren’t there not enough

604
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,209
ups and downs in my life?

605
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:41,792
Why God try so hard

606
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,417
to create so many secrets,

607
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:44,999
one after another,

608
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,417
striking my heart?

609
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,334
The gifted Prince Charming

610
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,042
in my heart,

611
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:52,083
is not only

612
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,209
a cruel evil,

613
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:54,292
but a jackass

614
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:55,083
with no morality.

615
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,751
He doesn’t worth

616
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,626
my admiration and love.

617
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,918
He only deserves

618
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:03,501
my hatred and abhorrence.

619
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,167
Who is there?

620
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:17,751
Ling Lingqi.

621
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,334
You, saw it all?

622
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,250
No matter what you saw,

623
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,542
keep it to yourself!

624
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,250
Otherwise…

625
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,417
You two go out first.

626
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:50,042
I’ll talk with her privately.

627
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:51,584
Bo Hai.

628
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:53,083
Let’s go, Xinyan.

629
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,459
What I saw

630
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:01,501
is a substitute?

631
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,501
Right.

632
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,000
Why?

633
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:05,959
You’re so talented.

634
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:06,918
And you’re competent.

635
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,209
Why hire a substitute?

636
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,334
Do you have difficulties?

637
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:16,834
If I tell you,

638
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:18,999
it was not my idea,

639
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,417
and I knew nothing about it

640
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,959
before I came here.

641
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,083
Do you believe it?

642
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,584
I do.

643
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,459
Isn’t it that

644
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,334
makes you feel better?

645
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:32,959
What do you mean?

646
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:35,459
Are you naive

647
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:36,584
or stupid?

648
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,000
How could I

649
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,417
have so many difficulties?

650
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,083
I may tell you the truth.

651
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:44,959
The florist master Bo Hai

652
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,375
in your heart

653
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,918
is at his wits’ end.

654
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:50,999
He’s just a hypocrite,

655
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,709
willing to do anything for his title.

656
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,292
Using a substitute is my idea,

657
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:58,209
nothing to do with the others.

658
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,501
Anyway,

659
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,792
I’m neither the first

660
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,167
nor the last to do it.

661
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,250
It’s no big deal.

662
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:10,751
How could you

663
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:11,667
say anything like this?

664
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,918
Are you ashamed of yourself?

665
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,751
You can’t take it anymore?

666
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:21,542
You always said

667
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:22,751
I’m your idol.

668
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,667
You’ve taken three years exams to FlowerPlus,

669
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:25,626
but you don’t even know

670
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,042
what kind of person I am.

671
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,999
Aren’t you stupid?

672
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:31,876
Right, I am stupid.

673
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,709
I take a conscienceless man

674
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,083
as my idol

675
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:35,959
and loved him for three years!

676
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,125
I’m so blind!

677
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:38,250
Here.

678
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:39,584
I quit this job.

679
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:40,792
I’ll go out

680
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:41,501
and tell everyone

681
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:42,292
about this.

682
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,083
So they can see your true color.

683
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,380
= Liquefied Natural Gas Bus =

684
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,125
Bye.

685
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,380
= More love for life Charity Bazaar =

686
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,000
I haven’t contacted Bo Hai.

687
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,125
But some colleagues tell me that

688
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:40,959
Bo Hai is

689
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,292
never a Mr. Right.

690
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:43,959
He’s a demon!

691
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:51,584
You always said

692
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,792
I’m your idol.

693
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,709
You’ve taken three years exams to FlowerPlus,

694
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,542
but you don’t even know

695
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,125
what kind of person I am.

696
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,250
Aren’t you stupid?

697
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,209
I may tell you the truth.

698
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,042
The florist master Bo Hai

699
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,501
in your heart

700
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,792
is at his wits’ end.

701
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,417
He’s just a hypocrite,

702
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,459
willing to do anything for his title.

703
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,125
Poor baby.

704
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:58,375
Someone is upset,

705
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,918
venting her anger on you.

706
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,876
If I wasn’t here in time,

707
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,209
you’ll be bald.

708
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:05,167
What?

709
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:06,876
Want to thank me?

710
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:09,042
Kiss me? Okay.

711
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,334
Drama King.

712
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,042
Seriously,

713
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:20,542
you’re really a florist.

714
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:21,501
You deflowered it

715
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:22,626
so artistically.

716
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:23,375
Check it out.

717
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,834
Isn’t it well-spaced?

718
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:27,959
Cut it out.

719
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,542
Tell me, who bullied you?

720
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,834
I’ll kill him.

721
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,501
The Chomper!

722
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,125
I just found out

723
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:44,000
my last four years

724
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,375
is a big joke!

725
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,501
My idol, my dream.

726
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,918
I lost them all today!

727
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:55,292
Is it so serious?

728
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,709
I’ve decided that I’ll quit.

729
00:28:58,876 --> 00:28:59,709
I’ll go to the HR

730
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:00,459
for formalities tomorrow.

731
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,292
Qi, is something bad

732
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,000
happened when you were back

733
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,334
in the venue?

734
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,209
Stop asking questions.

735
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,042
Anyway, I’ve made a decision

736
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,250
and I won’t regret.

737
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:16,125
Good night.

738
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,584
Well, you can find

739
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,459
another job elsewhere.

740
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:23,209
There is nothing good

741
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,125
to work for him.

742
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:25,751
See you.

743
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,542
All you care is your artistic faith.

744
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,250
Have you ever thought about that

745
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,000
over two hundred staff

746
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,626
will lose their jobs?

747
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:49,250
If your career is over,

748
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:49,999
the company is over.

749
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,000
What about those staff?

750
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:52,709
All you care is your face.

751
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,375
You’re being selfish!

752
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,083
Right, I am stupid.

753
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:59,125
I take a conscienceless man

754
00:29:59,125 --> 00:29:59,792
as my idol

755
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,083
and loved him for three years!

756
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,751
I’m so blind!

757
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:19,083
Today, the internationally renowned painter

758
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,501
Mr. Li Qingzhu’s art exhibition

759
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,959
opened in this city.

760
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:22,751
In this art exhibition,

761
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:24,375
Mr. Li Qingzhu specially invited us

762
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,083
to carry out transboundary cooperation,

763
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,959
to perfectly integrate paintings

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,667
and floral art in the space,

765
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:30,999
so as to bring a new experience

766
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,042
to the audience.

767
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,751
God bless us.

768
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:37,542
We finally

769
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,959
pulled it through.

770
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,667
Don’t be so happy.

771
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,417
You thought about

772
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,250
how to do with Ling Lingqi?

773
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,083
She’s a big trouble.

774
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,042
Yes, she is.

775
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:48,250
My head aches

776
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:49,626
to hear her name.

777
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,900
= Employee’s Card Ling Lingqi =

778
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:01,417
Ling Lingqi.

779
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:02,667
What, Secretary Chen?

780
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:03,792
It’s no small thing to quit.

781
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Give it a second thought.

782
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:06,167
No need.

783
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,292
I’ve made this decision

784
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,042
after deep consideration.

785
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:09,959
Are you worrying

786
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:10,834
Mr. Bo revenges you

787
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,042
with his power?

788
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,584
I swear, he’ll never do that.

789
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,000
About what happened last night,

790
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,792
he won’t be hard on you.

791
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,167
He decides to promote you.

792
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:19,417
He sent you, right?

793
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,792
No, no!

794
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,083
I’m here by myself.

795
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,042
Is he worrying that

796
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:25,876
I’ll tell everyone

797
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:26,709
about his dirty secret?

798
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:28,209
How about this?

799
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:30,000
If he’s willing to kneel down

800
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,751
to beg me for forgiveness,

801
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,999
I’ll keep the secret for mercy’s sake.

802
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,000
Or never mention it again.

803
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:44,375
Are you saying that

804
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,876
if I kneel down

805
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,876
with all my heart,

806
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:50,918
she will keep the secret

807
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,751
for mercy’s sake?

808
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,584
Yeah, that’s what she said.

809
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:02,083
Very well.

810
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:04,709
Mr. Bo.

811
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:06,709
This is the shop list

812
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:07,542
who are selling

813
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,876
counterfeit immortal flowers.

814
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:30,918
Wake up. It’s daylight!

815
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:31,792
Mom.

816
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,167
I don’t have to go to work today.

817
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:35,751
Oh, that’s your excuse?

818
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:40,751
Get up!

819
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,959
Still wanna sleep?

820
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,834
Okay, if you have nothing to do today,

821
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,584
and you don’t want to be starved,

822
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:51,292
well,

823
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
go help your dad

824
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:54,125
in the shop.

825
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,334
Can you be quick?

826
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,501
How much is this?

827
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:05,209
Qi.

828
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:07,751
If you can’t figure it out,

829
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:08,834
I advise you

830
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,792
not work here.

831
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,834
I don’t want to, auntie.

832
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:13,125
If it wasn’t

833
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,375
that Chomper,

834
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:15,584
I’m still a florist.

835
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:16,751
I don’t have to work here.

836
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:17,459
What the hell.

837
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,167
22.8 yuan.

838
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,083
What? How much?

839
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,542
22.8 yuan.

840
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,918
What? I can’t hear you.

841
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,959
22.8 yuan!

842
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,209
I don’t need salt.

843
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,209
22.8 yuan, grandpa!

844
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,334
Okay, 20 yuan then.

845
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:56,334
Just four years’ youth wasted.

846
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,167
It’s no big deal.

847
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,667
I can start over.

848
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,667
Ling Lingqi, come on!

849
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,459
You can do it!

850
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:06,876
Can you?

851
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:12,125
♪ If you’re alive and you still have dream ♪

852
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:13,584
She’s crazy.

853
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:15,918
What’s going on?

854
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,292
What happened?

855
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,918
Your daughter is crazy.

856
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,999
Don’t be mad. Just talk to her.

857
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:53,292
Who is that?

858
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,834
Is he Bo Hai?

859
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:59,584
The poster on Qi’s wall.

860
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:00,918
Qi’s boss?

861
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:01,501
Right.

862
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,459
- Hi. - Hi.

863
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:04,626
You are….

864
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:05,834
Is Ling Lingqi here?

865
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:08,959
Yeah, yeah.

866
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:09,876
Qi,

867
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,042
someone’s here for you.

868
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:18,292
What are you doing here?

869
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,209
Have a seat.

870
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:50,417
Since you’re here

871
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,375
by yourself,

872
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:52,999
it means you have fully realized

873
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:53,999
your mistake.

874
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,334

I’m not here for forgiveness.

Then for what? Curse?

How could I do that?

885

as my special assistant.

888

What makes you think I’ll go back

889

if you ask me to?

You accuse me without proof,

00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,042
but I have certain evidence to prove

899

your shop is selling counterfeit.

don’t work well.
