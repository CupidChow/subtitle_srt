00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,060
= Episode 10 =

51
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,709
As it goes,

52
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,209
best friends share happiness

53
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:46,584
and hardship.

54
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,584
I did a rough math,

55
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,626
there are 36 toilets

56
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,042
in this building

57
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,000
and I just finished 6 of them.

58
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,501
Now there are

59
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,083
30 left.

60
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,999
So if we three

61
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,042
can work together,

62
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,626
I’m sure we can finish it up

63
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:00,834
before dark.

64
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,626
Let’s do it together.

65
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,709
Hello, Miss Zhou?

66
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,834
Urgent meeting?

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,042
You won’t start without me?

68
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,459
Your phone is upside down.

69
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,584
Okay, I’ll be right back.

70
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,292
Qi, I just remember that

71
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:15,834
I need interview

72
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,125
a new employee later.

73
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,167
Oh, my shit memory.

74
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,375
I’ll go get prepared.

75
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:22,083
Doesn’t anyone of you

76
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,459
still have conscience?

77
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,292
We’re best friends!

78
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:29,792
Fine.

79
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,209
This is the flow for today’s program.

80
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:33,959
I have double checked.

81
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:34,792
No problem.

82
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:36,751
The host’s question outline

83
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,250
will be sent to us later.

84
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,501
Are you preparing

85
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,876
for tomorrow’s interview, Mr. Bo?

86
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,125
Mr. Wen fought for this opportunity

87
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,667
to get me on TV,

88
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,167
of course I should get well prepared.

89
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,334
You’re welcome.

90
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,876
We’re all for the company’s good.

91
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,501
Well,

92
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,876
I’ll leave you to it.

93
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,334
You go on.

94
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:57,417
Please.

95
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,042
Mr. Bo,

96
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:10,751
about the program,

97
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,167
do you need think it over?

98
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,334
I always think Wen Guangqi

99
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,417
has bad intentions.

100
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,250
Isn’t he up to something?

101
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,999
It’s a good chance

102
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,459
for the publicity of our company.

103
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,792
I won’t give it up.

104
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,751
As for Wen Guangqi’s purpose,

105
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,167
we will find out tomorrow.

106
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,083
Let’s go.

107
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,000
Hi.

108
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:47,709
Chomper,

109
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:48,876
wait for me and see.

Seven Heroes and Five Gallants.

112
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,501

complicated and changeable.

No, that’s not me.

132
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:06,709
What’s important is,

133
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:11,125
you and I are

134
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,292
deadly enemies.

135
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,501
I’m that indomitable man.

136
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,250
Bai Yutang is my name!

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,542
Shocked by my name?

138
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:36,667
I’ve defeated you in two rounds.

139
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,334
Tell me, Zhan Zhao,

140
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:40,542
are you scared of me?

141
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,083
Never heard of you.

142
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,375
Never?

143
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, I’ll show you

144
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,999
what I’m capable of today.

145
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,626
I never expected,

146
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,417
the powerful Zhan Zhao

147
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:07,209
could have such a wretched day.

148
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,542
A little sacrifice

149
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,167
is nothing to me

150
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,167
to see you’re still

151
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:20,834
alive and kicking.

152
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,042
Don’t you think you saved my life

153
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,667
so I’ll show mercy on you.

154
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,250
If you haven’t fooled me

155
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:30,999
again and again,

156
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,999
do I need to set a trap

157
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:32,999
to get you?

158
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:35,876
I’ll let you know

159
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,083
you’re messing with the wrong girl.

160
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,334
Are you afraid now?

161
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:55,459
Thinking of I could be

162
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,167
buried in flames,

163
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,417
yes, I am a little afraid.

164
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,375
Why didn’t you say earlier?

165
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:22,709
You! You!

166
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,751
Don’t, don’t!

167
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,459
Can you untie me first?

168
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,042
Sorry,

169
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,542
I never thought this coming.

170
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,042
It’s all fake, anyway.

171
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,626
Your eyes close and open again,

172
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:47,751
it’ll be all gone.

173
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,501
Goodbye.

174
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:51,083
Hey, untie me!

175
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:51,918
Bye.

176
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:52,918
Come back!

177
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,125
Damn rat!

178
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,501
How’s the fire so real?

179
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,834
Is Chomper all right?

180
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,209
It’s a dream, anyway.

181
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,709
Be a hero.

182
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:24,709
You all right?

183
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,417
Why did you come back?

184
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:29,209
Maybe I am

185
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,375
out of my mind.

186
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,334
Come on.

187
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,667
How do you feel? Are you injured?

188
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,540
= On Air =

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,292
Okay.

190
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,918
Thank you for sharing

191
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,380
the entrepreneurial story with us.

192
00:13:59,042 --> 00:13:59,876
We’ll bring you

193
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:00,918
more exciting content

194
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,417
after advertisement.

195
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:03,584
Cut!

196
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,667
This is the last link.

197
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,125
As of now, everything is going well.

198
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,709
Do we think too much?

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,292
I don’t know why,

200
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:18,459
I feel uneasy today.

201
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:19,959
That’s because you always

202
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,250
worry too much,

203
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,667
like a paranoid.

204
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:25,125
Hope so.

205
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,542
But as long as Bo Hai’s eyes

206
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:27,918
are not recovered,

207
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,999
I can’t be relieved.

208
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:32,751
All staff in place,

209
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,334
we’re ready to start.

210
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,918
Wang, the producer

211
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:36,626
just asked us

212
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,709
to add an extra link.

213
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:38,999
Please ask the two florists

214
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,167
compete on floriculture.

215
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,584
Both of them

216
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,417
are masters in the field.

217
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,876
Qi, Qi?

218
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:48,918
Come and watch this.

219
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,209
Hurry up, it’s on.

220
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:52,501
What?

221
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,083
Come on.

222
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,125
I heard that these two masters’ floral skills

223
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,042
not only have decorative effect,

224
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,417
but in some extent…

225
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:00,542
So tiresome.

226
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,000
Now I have to see

227
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,542
him after work too!

228
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,209
Don’t talk. Watch this.

229
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:05,542
So,

230
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:06,876
to feast

231
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,000
the audiences’ eyes,

232
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:08,876
our program team has

233
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,167
specially added

234
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,959
one extra link temporarily.

235
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,209
Next let’s welcome the two florists

236
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,626
to compete on their floral skills,

237
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,667
to bring us excellent floral works

238
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,042
on scene.

239
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,792
Working staff please come to stage.

240
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:26,709
What are they doing?

241
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,083
No, I need to talk with the director.

242
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,999
It’s live, too late!

243
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:33,667
He’s over.

244
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,876
Chomper is over.

245
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,876
What’s over?

246
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,584
Say something good, okay?

247
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:42,125
I believe Bo Hai will definitely win.

248
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,292
Relax.

249
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:31,250
Honey,

250
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,250
it doesn’t feel right.

251
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:35,584
The other florist

252
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,375
is finishing,

253
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,125
why Bo Hai’s not yet started?

254
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,792
You don’t understand.

255
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,459
He’s thinking.

256
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:45,918
Once it’s done in his mind,

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,999
then he will start.

258
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:54,834
Director,

259
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:55,876
could it become

260
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,209
a broadcast accident?

261
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,083
Do we need to inter-cut an ad?

262
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:01,751
Wait a minute.

263
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:08,709
Bo Hai, are you very arrogant?

264
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,501
I’ll get your name mud

265
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:13,250
in front of everyone.

266
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,626
You’ll never start over.

267
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:26,542
Look.

268
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,167
Look, what did I say?

269
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:29,167
I know nothing

270
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,876
about floriculture,

271
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,751
but even I can tell

272
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,459
what Bo Hai made is an artwork.

273
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,375
He’s just making a show.

274
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:36,292
Make a show?

275
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,125
You make one for me.

276
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,083
Handsome.

277
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,709
Hypocrite.

278
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:51,334
Successful.

279
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:52,667
Thanks to substitute.

280
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,250
And super talented.

281
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,209
Cheat.

282
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:56,667
Cheat the clients,

283
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,292
now the audience.

284
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,876
Not matched.

285
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:08,709
Ling Guoliang.

286
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:09,667
What’s wrong with you?

287
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,792
Is Ling Lingqi your biological daughter?

288
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,999
Be confident, okay?

289
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,209
Of course,

290
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,542
now the situation is,

291
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:22,876
our Qi

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,167
doesn’t match Bo Hai,

293
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,542
but it’s hard to say.

294
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,709
Maybe someday,

295
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,167
Bo Hai gets blind.

296
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,834
He starts to like Qi.

297
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:34,876
What do you say?

298
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:41,751
Little girl,

299
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,042
be smart, okay?

300
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,459
Don’t always eat, eat and eat.

301
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,125
He’s a good boy,

302
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,584
if you don’t take a move,

303
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:51,250
he’ll soon be someone else’s prey.

304
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,542
Mom, can you stop

305
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,542
judging people by their looks?

306
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,417
It’s not right.

307
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:57,918
He has two faces.

308
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:58,542
He’s not that good

309
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,876
as he looks.

310
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,876
Not good as he looks?

311
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,375
What do you mean?

312
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:08,667
He had a plastic surgery?

313
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,459
Or his company doesn’t exist?

314
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,375
Or he is a gay?

315
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:15,959
Don’t leave.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,959
You, you…

317
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,459
Tell us about it.

318
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,083
Okay, be quiet.

319
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:21,876
Mr. Wen,

320
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:23,667
Bo Hai’s performance

321
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,083
is really out of our expectation.

322
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:26,501
But I really heard

323
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,375
Ling Lingqi saying he’s using substitute.

324
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,834
You must hear it wrong.

325
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,250
Or Ling Lingqi

326
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:34,959
was joking?

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,501
Quiet.

328
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,292
Figure it out before you act next time.

329
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:41,209
Yes, sir.

330
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:48,959
Bo Hai,

331
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,000
when your eyes

332
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,167
got recovered?

333
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,709
You scared us to death.

334
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,792
This morning.

335
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,959
When you were sick before,

336
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,334
we took you to doctor many times.

337
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,709
You took injections and medicines,

338
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,417
and psychotherapy and so on.

339
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:05,918
Last time when we were abroad,

340
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,501
we found you an top expert

341
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,042
to treat you.

342
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,417
But this time,

343
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,792
how is it recovered?

344
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:11,667
Yeah, how?

345
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,250
You recover so fast.

346
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:15,709
I don’t know.

347
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:16,959
Anyway,

348
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,667
it’s a good news.

349
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:20,918
As far as I see,

350
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:21,959
he must be stimulated

351
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,042
by something else.

352
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,999
I’d like to order a bouquet

353
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,959
for my dad.

354
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,667
Tomorrow is his birthday,

355
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:43,501
but he’s in sorrow.

356
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,542
Because my mom died of disease

357
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,459
a month ago.

358
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:50,780
For many times

359
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,220
= Relief Flower Shop =
I saw my dad

360
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,620
= Relief Flower Shop =
crying by himself.

361
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,876
My mom and I had an agreement

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,876
that we must give him a bundle of flowers

363
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,542
on his birthday.

364
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,083
But my mom didn’t see

365
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,709
this day coming.

366
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,042
So I’d like to give him the flowers

367
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,209
in the name of my mom.

368
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,042
I want to tell him,

369
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,876
Mom is gone,

370
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,292
but you still have me.

371
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:14,918
Help me reply to her.

372
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:15,584
OK.

373
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,918
This bundle of flowers is for your dad.

374
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:22,501
Please keep it in mind,

375
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,667
the flowers

376
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:26,459
will blossom again,

377
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:28,709
and beautiful things

378
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,999
will arrive soon.

379
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,375
You do floral work in the office,

380
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,125
and now in your own home.

381
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:43,709
Your eyes are just recovered,

382
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:44,876
do you have to work hard?

383
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,667
The company is growing,

384
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,834
so is its influence.

385
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:53,209
The brands we’re cooperating with
are reaching a higher standard,

386
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,626
so our work gets more challenging.

387
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:57,959
But I,

388
00:22:58,876 --> 00:22:59,834
still prefer to read the stories

389
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,999
of common people,

390
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:02,626
and to use flowers

391
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,501
to deliver their simple feelings,

392
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,959
to relieve them from sorrows.

393
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,083
This bundle of flowers

394
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,417
is the spirit of floral work.

395
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,918
It’s also what inspired me to be a florist.

396
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:17,417
I got one question

397
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,709
that I wanted to ask you long before.

398
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,292
Why do you hide your name?

399
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,167
You’re like a spy,

400
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:22,959
running this floral shop

401
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,167
at night

402
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,209
in front of this desk.

403
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,250
Mr. Relief florist.

404
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,501
Sometimes it troubles me a lot
to be famous in this age.

405
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,042
How influential my name is

406
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,375
in domestic floral industry,

407
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:36,459
you know it.

408
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,167
Narcissist.

409
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:41,999
It’s a truth.

410
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,459
But in this online shop,

411
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:45,334
I’m just a common person

412
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,167
who is keen on floriculture.

413
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:48,999
My friends on line,

414
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:50,792
no matter who they are,

415
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,000
where they’re from,

416
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,667
whether they’re rich or poor,

417
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,375
they share their stories with me.

418
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:57,999
So,

419
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,042
compared with

420
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,834
the floral master Bo Hai,

421
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:02,584
I’d rather to be

422
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,459
the owner of this small flower shop.

423
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:05,542
But I don’t think

424
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,000
you can focus on your work.

425
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,999
You got 1 million followers,

426
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,292
over half of them are girls.

427
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:11,083
Check this.

428
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,125
Mr. Relief florist, I love you!

429
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,167
Pick me, love ya~

430
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,083
You’re gross.

431
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,626
That’s what they wrote to you!

432
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,375
= Chairman of the Board Bo Hai =

433
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,000
Awesome.

434
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,180
= Florist Bo Hai
Talking about China Floriculture =

435
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:18,876
This is Peter Fan,

436
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,959
a home design master.

437
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,292
He’s the founder of the famous

438
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,626
international household brand AiFan.

439
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:25,542
This is

440
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,260
the big client

441
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,042
= AiFan Household =
we’re on to now.

442
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,060
= AiFan Household =
This old man?

443
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,167
Guess how much you pay

444
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:32,000
if he designs your home.

445
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:32,834
1 million?

446
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:34,209
2 million?

447
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:36,334
5 million?

448
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:37,584
Vulgar.

449
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:38,999
He doesn’t care about money.

450
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:40,999
He’ll just do it if he likes.

451
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,542
This kind of people is tough.

452
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,792
I also heard that

453
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:46,042
he’s gonna

454
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,626
visit our company today.

455
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,083
I just saw

456
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,999
those people in Sales Department

457
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:53,834
gathering around

458
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:54,292
- an old man.
- Ling Lingqi.

459
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,828
- Could it be him?
- Get the classic schemes you prepared

460
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
to the meeting room.

461
00:26:57,714 --> 00:26:58,410
Mr. Bo wants them now.

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,375
Okay.

463
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,042
I’ve already got

464
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,792
a rough concept and direction.

465
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,584
Mr. Bo, here are the files.

466
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:11,626
This is the classic design schemes

467
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:13,417
of our company in these years.

468
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:14,834
I believe you’ll get a better understanding

469
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,250
of our company’s design concept

470
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,918
and style after you check on this.

471
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,042
Okay.

472
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:20,709
I’ll study it

473
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:21,834
with my people.

474
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,167
I’m glad

475
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,209
to be here today.

476
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:27,542
Cross-border cooperation is gonna

477
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,709
be the trend in future fashion industry.

478
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,459
Whether two of our companies

479
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:31,375
cooperate or not in the future,

480
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:32,209
I hope

481
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:33,999
we can exchange ideas

482
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,542
anyhow.

483
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,209
It’s an honor

484
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,250
to learn from you.

485
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,125
It’s about dinner time.

486
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,209
If you’re available,

487
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,501
please stay with us for dinner,

488
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,334
and allow me to play the host.

489
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,667
Actually It’s my selfish motive

490
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,083
to discuss more details

491
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:51,918
on the design scheme with my client.

492
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,501
OK, if you insist.

493
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,250
Make it arranged.

494
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:56,918
You can get off work

495
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:57,792
after it’s done.

496
00:27:58,876 --> 00:27:59,250
So I don’t have to

497
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,417
work with you tonight?

498
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:02,667
Why?

499
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:11,250
Go.

500
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,209
Mr. Bo,

501
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,083
with all due respect, I’d like to

502
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:18,584
invite this lady to dinner tonight.

503
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:19,083
You know

504
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,751
I’m doing home design.

505
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,125
I care very much

506
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,918
about female friends’ feelings.

507
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,876
I’d like to hear her opinion.

508
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,125
She’s new in the company,

509
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,125
and has barely no experience in design.

510
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,334
That’s even better.

511
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:31,918
I’m sick of

512
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,167
the academic.

513
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,459
I’d like to hear

514
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,125
the voice from a real consumer.

515
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:39,250
Okay.

516
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:46,125
Mr. Bo, your place is really good.

517
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:48,542
This way.

518
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:49,375
Please, Mr. Bo.

519
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:53,250
What kind of couple they are?

520
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:54,584
Such an important client.

521
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,292
Bo Hai just brought Ling Lingqi

522
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:56,250
alone?

523
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,792
It’s hasty.

524
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,292
This Ling Lingqi can do nothing

525
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:01,792
but sabotaging.

526
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:02,667
I gotta tell Bo Hai

527
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,042
to remind him of this.

528
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:06,250
I often come here for dinner.

529
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:07,167
It’s quiet and covert,

530
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:07,792
normal people

531
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,292
won’t find it here.

532
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,417
I’ll lead the way.

533
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:16,542
Behave yourself,

534
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:17,209
understand?

535
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:19,125
I didn’t want to come at all.

536
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:19,709
Anyway,

537
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:21,000
just be quiet and sit there.

538
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,000
Less talk more eat.

539
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:24,292
Beg me.

540
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,260
= Chinese Style Household
Floriculture Design Scheme =

541
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,250
For this Chinese style household

542
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,667
floriculture design scheme,

543
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,667
we’ve found

544
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:40,751
seven or eight companies,

545
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:42,501
big or small, for the bidding.

546
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,083
The design schemes of other companies

547
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,334
are quite alike.

548
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:47,167
They all adopt

549
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,792
various expensive flowers

550
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,459
to foil the household atmosphere.

551
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,417
But your scheme

552
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,334
is different.

553
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,584
You choose

554
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,542
dried peony flower of light color

555
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:57,626
as the materials.

556
00:29:58,501 --> 00:29:59,125
Can you tell me

557
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,250
for what reasons?

558
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,250
Here’s the thing, Peter.

559
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:05,292
Peony is a well-deserved national flower,

560
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:06,626
although she’s dried,

561
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,542
and her grace and pride slacked to some degree,

562
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,250
she’s still holy and pure,

563
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:12,250
elegant and tasteful.

564
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:13,459
Looks like

565
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:15,334
she bloomed again.

566
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:17,125
This is a flower which cannot be seen

567
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,501
if your mind is not cleansed,

568
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,709
or your heart is not calm.

569
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,792
It delivers

570
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,542
an essence of Chinese culture,–

571
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:24,375
Zen.

572
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,918
In addition, from practicability,

573
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,042
the target clients

574
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,417
of this series of furniture

575
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,083
are mainly middle-aged people

576
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,250
who have certain

577
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:33,292
life experience.

578
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:33,959
In their family,

579
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,876
there must be the elderly and children

580
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,167
who might be allergic

581
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,167
to fresh flower pollen, which might

582
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,959
harm their respiratory system.

583
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,751
Mr. Bo, you’re really a floral master

584
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,959
second to none in China.

585
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,709
I admire your craftsmanship.

586
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,083
Come, Peter.

587
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,876
To our craftsmanship.

588
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:52,792
Cheers!

589
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:02,959
I don’t think

590
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,792
I can find a better partner

591
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,709
than you.

592
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,501
Since you’re

593
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,834
interested

594
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:11,876
in our scheme,

595
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:13,876
how about

596
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:14,959
we nail everything down

597
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:15,792
today during dinner.

598
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:16,626
Sure.

599
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,250
Miss Ling,

600
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:20,959
you’re silent.

601
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,083
Why not talk about your opinion?

602
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,626
I think, if we chose

603
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:28,876
naturally dried flowers,

604
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,542
there is one question

605
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:30,250
needs to be considered.

606
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:31,042
Because

607
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,667
the shape and form of dried flowers

608
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,209
are changing over time.

609
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,959
Let’s say, one month after withering,

610
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,042
and one year,

611
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,000
it will look quite different.

612
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:39,876
Mr. Bo,

613
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,083
how you gonna solve this problem?

614
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:43,584
Please be relieved,

615
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,042
we have special

616
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,083
drying and

617
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,083
form-fixing technique.

618
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,584
Once our cooperation is finalized,

619
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,083
our Aftersales Department

620
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,083
will maintain and change it periodically.

621
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,292
Then,

622
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,209
I got nothing to worry.

623
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:56,834
Mr. Bo,

624
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,375
you said Miss Ling

625
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,709
is an amateur.

626
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:01,584
But the question she posed

627
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:02,918
is quite professional.

628
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,042
Your company is marvelous.

629
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:06,999
From president to assistant,

630
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,250
you’re all excellent.

631
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,292
It’s my honor

632
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,501
to work with you.

633
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,209
Actually, Peter,

634
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,918
Mr. Bo is not that excellent as you think,

635
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,751
can you think it over?

636
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:19,584
Why?

637
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,334
Because

638
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,501
he’s merciless to us.

639
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,709
So we privately

640
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:24,792
call him

641
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:25,876
Chomper.

642
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:29,834
During work hour,

643
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,000
being serious is good.

644
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,334
If you relax, you lose the stateliness.

645
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:34,375
No.

646
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,083
You don’t understand, Peter.

647
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,792
He’s not just inhuman,

648
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:38,542
he also has

649
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,250
a big secret.

650
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:40,876
He…

651
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,000
Are you drunk, Qi?

652
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:47,918
Don’t drink anymore.

653
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,083
Beg me.

654
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:51,959
What secret?

655
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,083
I’m curious.

656
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,918
He used to…

657
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,709
Please, please.

658
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,626
Peter,

659
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:04,876
he’s our president,

660
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,542
but he’s

661
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,334
a wimpy drinker.

662
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,542
He can only drink one glass.

663
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,834
He’d be drunk before drinking the second one.

664
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,792
So he’s drinking water with you.

665
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:13,918
I don’t know

666
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:14,459
if you’ve ever seen

667
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:15,667
a video of a drunk.

668
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:16,751
That’s him.

669
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,375
It’s hot online.

670
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,626
You people are quite interesting.

671
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,584
That’s why you can be florists.

672
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:27,125
Your life is full of joy.

673
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,417
Here, Peter, to you!

674
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:39,083
Okay.

675
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:47,999
You deserve it.

676
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:50,626
Have some dishes.

677
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:51,584
You too.

678
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:06,751
I always thought

679
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,834
domestic workplace culture

680
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,167
is quite serious,

681
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:10,542
but here

682
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:11,876
I spent

683
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
a happy hour tonight.

684
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:15,834
Peter,

685
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:16,501
my assistant

686
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,584
is a bit drunk tonight,

687
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:18,501
please forgive her impoliteness.

688
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,292
No, not at all.

689
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,709
Everyone has the right

690
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,209
of speech, that should be

691
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,751
the style of a creative company.

692
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,375
Your assistant is cute.

693
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,375
If she has no boss,

694
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,792
I’d like to be hers.

695
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,292
I’ll never leave my boss.

696
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,501
He’s really nice to me.

697
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:39,959
He treats me dinner after work.

698
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,667
And he’ll

699
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,626
drive me home later.

700
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:43,375
Oh yeah?

701
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,000
Mr. Bo is

702
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,501
quite a thoughtful boss.

703
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,459
Thanks. Please.

704
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,375
Do you believe it?

705
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:56,792
This leading actor,

706
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:57,667
this overbearing president,

707
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:58,751
will definitely

708
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,000
fall in love with this leading actress in the end,

709
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,626
this useless girl.

710
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,300
My proposal has already worked.

711
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,740
Say if

712
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,140
Cotillard knows the truth…

713
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,626
How do you know about that?

714
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,417
I watched a lot TV shows.

715
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:14,501
These are all fixed script.

716
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:17,083
The actor and actress

717
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:18,292
looked down upon each other

718
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,334
in the beginning,

719
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,000
so they fought and quarreled.

720
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:22,834
They’re taking

721
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,542
the quarrelsome lovers routine.

722
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:25,999
And later

723
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,167
they had crash on each other,

724
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,042
then fell in love

725
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:31,417
like Romeo and Juliet.

726
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:35,501
Do you think

727
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,709
it sounds familiar?

728
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,626
Isn’t that Qi and Bo Bai

729
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,667
are in that state now?

730
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:44,751
Of course.

731
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:46,709
This little girl.

732
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,292
Show me what you can do.

733
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,780
= Show me what you can do =
She got nothing to compare

734
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:49,626
with Qi now.

735
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:51,751
You

736
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,334
watched too much soap opera,

737
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:55,584
and you’ve lost your mind.

738
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,000
The TV play is made up,

739
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,999
but it originates from reality.

740
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,918
OK, OK, whatever you say.

741
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:01,751
Should we

742
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:03,000
care for our real life a bit?

743
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,501
Check the time.

744
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:05,876
It’s half past nine.

745
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,459
She’s still not home yet.

746
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,542
Isn’t that excessive?

747
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:15,501
You don’t watch TV plays,

748
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,959
so you don’t understand.

749
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:18,626
She’s

750
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:20,834
not working.

751
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:21,834
In the daytime,

752
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,751
they look troubles for each other,

753
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:25,292
and they haven’t got even.

754
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,375
Now it’s night,

755
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:27,292
they will change the place

756
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,959
to fight

757
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,083
and quarrel.

758
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,542
You don’t watch TV,

759
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:34,250
fuddy-duddy.

760
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:35,584
You won’t understand.

761
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,709
Full of craps.

762
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:43,411
You better pray that my money won’t…

763
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,626
Slow down.

764
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,334
Get off if you can’t stand it.

765
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:53,626
I’m Miss Justice

766
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:55,125
since I was little.

767
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,167
I can’t help

768
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,667
speaking for him

769
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:58,417
seeing you cheating

770
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,417
such a kind old man.

771
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:00,542
But I yielded

772
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:02,042
to vicious power in the end.

773
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,167
I didn’t tell out

774
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,417
your secret.

775
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:06,375
I never

776
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,918
owe someone a favor.

777
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,542
Come to work earlier tomorrow.

778
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:17,334
Get off.

779
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,000
You’re so ungrateful!

780
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,083
And narrow-minded!

781
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,083
My bag!

782
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,584
Chomper, you psychopath.

783
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,167
Look, they fight again.

784
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:51,667
Look.

785
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:52,959
OK, stop.

786
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:53,918
Stop talking about this drama.

787
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,000
You see

788
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:55,999
what time is it now?

789
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,334
Half past ten.

790
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,792
And she’s still not back.

791
00:37:58,999 --> 00:37:59,959
Something must have happened

792
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,209
in TV series.

793
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,334
Her boss is a decent person,

794
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,792
not Lothario.

795
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,234
A changeful veil

796
00:38:07,262 --> 00:38:08,685
and clean short hair

797
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:10,074
set off by contrast…

798
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,751
No one is answering.

799
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:13,360
Presenting an aesthetic sense of asymmetry.

800
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:14,370
Not answering.

801
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,083
Still not answering.

802
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,674
Leave my show place immediately!

803
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:19,525
I don’t wanna see you anymore!

804
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:21,542
Their pace

805
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:23,584
is too fast for a relationship.

806
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,314
You know her the first day?

807
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,805
She’s a devil!

808
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,940
= Florist Bo Hai =

809
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:11,334
I…

810
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:16,709
You think

811
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:18,375
you would piss me off by doing things like this?

812
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:19,918
Childish!

813
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,042
Ling Lingqi.

814
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:35,417
Thanks.

815
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,459
You’re welcome.

816
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:46,709
Hello, Dad?

817
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:50,459
You’re the only one I got now.

818
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,834
Chomper,

819
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,167
today I’ll teach you

820
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,834
what’s called “eye for eye”.

821
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:12,417
Seems there is gonna be a fierce war.

822
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,209
For our friendship,

823
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,292
I bet on Qi.

824
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:17,999
For capacity,

825
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,083
I go for Chomper.

826
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,959
Dinner is on loser.

827
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:21,459
Deal.

828
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:25,375
Chomper.

829
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:26,792
Now is working time.

830
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:27,876
Talking about anything

831
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,709
other than work

832
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,667
will get an administrative warning.

833
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:32,250
Attacking your boss

834
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,999
will be subject to an administrative sanction.

835
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,167
Three times sanctions

836
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,918
will get you fired.

837
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,417
I almost forgot

838
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:45,501
that you can’t quit.

839
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:46,626
You can only

840
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:47,667
stay here.

841
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,209
By the way, tonight,

842
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,626
an important client’s wedding ceremony

843
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:54,918
requires to use tuberoses

844
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,751
to make a large bead curtain.

845
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,125
This errand is yours.

846
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,918
There are not many tuberoses.

847
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,292
Just tens of thousands.

848
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,626
I have never seen

849
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,167
a bad boss like you.
