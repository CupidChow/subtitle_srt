Sir.

Under the premise of safety,

53
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,501
please drive faster.

00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:15,876
We’re in urgent need of the flowers.

00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:16,709
Okay. All right.

56
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,042
Take it easy. I’ll try my best.

57
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:18,918
Okay.

58
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:26,792
Watch out!

59
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,125
Sir, are you alright?

60
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,459
I can’t move my legs.

61
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,876
Help! Help!

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,918
Wait for me!

63
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:38,918
I’ll go get help!

64
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:40,250
Wait for me!

65
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,709
Be careful!

66
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,626
Wait for me!

67
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:45,334
Be careful!

68
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:50,959
Be careful!

69
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,959
Wait for me, sir!

70
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,918
Somebody!

71
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:02,999
Help!

72
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,375
Help!

73
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,167
If you insist on

74
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,375
holding the news conference,

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,334
I’m not sure

76
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:36,918
if there will be

77
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:38,584
similar accidents.

78
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,542
You violated our agreement

79
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,999
and you will pay for it.

80
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,292
Qi!

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,459
Qi!

Sir, are you alright?

83
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,083
My legs... I can’t move.

84
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,375
I can’t move.

85
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,751
Where is the girl?

86
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,626
She... She was here.

87
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,792
Are you alright?

88
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,626
Can you move now?

89
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,125
My legs are stuck.

90
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,292
Wait a sec. I’m calling the ambulance.

91
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,000
Hello, 120?

92
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,542
A man was injured in a car accident.

93
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,083
On Anzhou National Highway.

94
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,375
Yes. Please come quickly!

95
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:03,209
Yes. Yes.

96
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,250
Okay.

97
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,292
Qi! Qi!

98
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,999
Qi! Qi!

99
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,042
Chomper! Damn it!

100
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:20,709
I’m dying.

101
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:21,584
You’ll be happy, huh?

102
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,042
Don’t regret!

103
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:26,459
If I die,

104
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,542
he’ll even celebrate it!

105
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:28,626
No one will haunt him.

106
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,209
He’ll never regret!

107
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:40,709
Why are you here?

108
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,459
Ling Lingqi.

109
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,999
Who do you think you are?

110
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,417
People are born to avoid disadvantages!

111
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:45,667
Don’t you know?

112
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:46,375
Do you think

113
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,626
you’re brave?

114
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,417
You almost die

115
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,501
just to get some flowers!

116
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:50,125
How stupid you are!

117
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,375
Hopelessly stupid!

118
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes! I’m stupid!

119
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:54,959
For a man

120
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,000
I just met once,

121
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,000
I abandoned the major

122
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,459
I’ve learnt for four years in college

123
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,083
and become a damn florist!

124
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:03,792
I’m stupid!

125
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,250
But I’m better than you,

126
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,375
a coward!

127
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,083
Is that so hard to

128
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,459
admit your feeling?

129
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,125
I’m willing to take a risk for you.

130
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,542
I’m willing to pull through with you

131
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:14,918
and get over the difficulty with you.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,584
But you...

133
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,834
But you only want to push me away!

134
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:21,834

135
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,292

I was just informed that

00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,250
the small shop owners

157
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,999
have received the compensation from FlowerPlus

158
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,250
as agreed.

159
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:56,751
Sorry.

160
00:08:57,918 --> 00:08:58,999
I fail to stop Bo Hai.

161
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,834
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

162
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,083
It’s no big deal.

163
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:03,834
Have some drink.

164
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,709
But in this way,

165
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:16,959
all our efforts

166
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,334
have been wasted!

167
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,250
Then start all over again.

168
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:22,918
Just remember.

169
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:24,959
Whether you can take revenge

170
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,042
depends on

171
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,125
if you can abandon everything for that.

172
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,667
Abandon everything for that?

173
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,375
I don’t understand.

174
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,375
You will understand

175
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,501
someday.

176
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,584
Hello? Baoni.

177
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,125
Mo Nan! Qi had a car accident.

178
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,083
Why don’t you get off?

179
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:24,918
Too weak to walk.

180
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:28,250
Come.

181
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:31,125
What?

182
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,667
You’re weak, aren’t you?

183
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,375
Let me carry you.

184
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,584
One, two, three.

185
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,959
A pig carries his wife!

186
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:46,167
How do you feel?

187
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:47,417
You must be

188
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,584
feeling great!

189
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:49,999
If only the “wife”

190
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,042
can eat less!

191
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,167
Nonsense! I’m not heavy at all!

192
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,667
Thanks to Ling Lingqi,

193
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,167
we solved this problem.

194
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,334
What the hell with DREAM!

195
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,083
They racked their brains

196
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,125
to ruin us!

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,459
They even dug out the incident

198
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,375
twenty years ago.

199
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah.

200
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,709
It confuses me, too.

201
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:10,709
Why do they pay so much attention

202
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:11,918
to what happened

203
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,709
twenty years ago?

204
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:14,584
Good news.

205
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,709
The Trade and Industry Bureau just said

206
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,125
they found Huang Xingfa.

207
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,667
This bad flower incident

208
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,083
has nothing to do with us.

209
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,417
Flower shop owners

210
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,542
have greatly changed their attitudes.

211
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,000
Now they all praise us!

212
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,584
The media also

213
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,584
release news that

214
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,709
we were framed up

215
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:30,167
but we returned good for evil,

216
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,709
and helped the shop owners.

217
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,125
Our brand reputation

218
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,000
has been greatly improved.

219
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,209
Oh,

220
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:37,959
for this week’s mysterious hidden theme,

221
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,292
let’s use primrose.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,959
Primrose?

223
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,584
That’s obviously sweet!

224
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,417
For Ling Lingqi,

225
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,792
Bo Hai would rather sacrifice our company.

226
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,459
For Bo Hai,

227
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:54,999
Ling Lingqi risked her life.

228
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,083
They are...

229
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,834
Look at them.

230
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:58,834
They helped each other,

231
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,167
as if they planned it.

232
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,834
Did you tell Ling Lingqi

233
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,125
Bo Hai canceled the news conference

234
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,334
just for her?

235
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:06,542
In love,

236
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,626
you don’t usually get

237
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:08,918
what you have paid.

238
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:09,751
Don’t you understand?

239
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,292
You mean

240
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,542
that was a coincidence?

241
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,417
I guess love is an understanding

242
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,626
and instinct.

243
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,083
Oh, I see.

244
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,334
Just like us.

245
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:29,375
Baoni!

246
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:34,042
Baoni!

247
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:36,375
Baoni!

248
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:37,918
Was there anything wrong with your phone?

249
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,459
I didn’t reach you for two days.

250
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:40,626
What’s up?

251
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,667
Look! I bought two tickets

252
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:43,751
for your idol’s concert.

253
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:45,709
Not interested.

254
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,334
Look carefully!

255
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,042
The idol you loved for five years.

256
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,125
I have another idol, okay?

257
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,167
Do you have time this noon?

258
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,250
Shall we go have lunch?

259
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,751
No. I’m on a diet.

260
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,000
How about shopping?

261
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,334
There are discounts.

262
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:02,542
I don’t want to do anything.

263
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:04,667
To tell you the truth,

264
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,083
nothing was wrong with my phone.

265
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:07,626
But I didn’t want to answer the phone.

266
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,209
I don’t want to have lunch, go shopping

267
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,292
or go to the concert with you.

268
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,626
Could you leave me alone?

269
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:22,667
Well...

270
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,667
Take the tickets.

271
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,125
Or they’ll be wasted.

272
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:28,918
I’ll leave you alone.

273
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,501
Human

274
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,751
is just a fickle animal.

275
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:18,918
How many days

276
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,959
have you been with me?

277
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,876
And now you’re fed up with me!

278
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:32,667
I’m not!

279
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,667
Look at your handsome face!

280
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,250
How would I even look at others?

281
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:42,334
All right.

282
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,042
Tell me.

283
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,417
What worried you?

284
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,626
For Baoni.

285
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,000
You know what?

286
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,083
It’s a simple problem.

287
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,584
When you stay away from Mo Nan,

288
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,918
Baoni will be all right

289
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,542
and she won’t be cold to you.

290
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,792
How do you know everything?

291
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:07,792
Sure.

292
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,000
You’re the only silly girl!

293
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,501
You know nothing!

294
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,209
You’re silly!

295
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,542
We’re at work!

296
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,667
Show some respect!

297
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:17,459
Don’t you know?

298
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:33,417
Mr. Bo.

299
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,751
Please sign this document.

300
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:35,751
Okay. Okay.

301
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,250
Mr. Bo.

302
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,167
You...

303
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:47,542
It’s okay.

304
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,000
Leave me. Go.

305
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,626
I just went to Mr. Bo’s office.

306
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,542
Guess what I saw!

307
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,334
Mr. Bo was

308
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:12,209
with a woman!

309
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,459
No way?

310
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:15,417
You must have got it wrong.

311
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:16,959
I didn’t!

312
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,250
By the way,

313
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,542
Mr. Bo has been in good mood.

314
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,000
Look. He talked more at the meeting.

315
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,125
Yeah.

316
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,167
Yesterday, I saw him

317
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,709
giggling alone in his office.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,999
So...

319
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,459
everything indicates that

320
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:33,375
Mr. Bo must be in a relationship.

321
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,999
But who is

322
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,250
his girlfriend?

323
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,918
Why are you staring at me?

324
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,834
Qi, tell us the truth.

325
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,334
What do you mean?

326
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,083
Tell us!

327
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,751
Who is Mr. Bo’s girlfriend?

328
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,250
I’m not!

329
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,209
We know you’re not!

330
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,584
Don’t flatter yourself,

331
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,167
all right?

332
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,751
Who can she be?

333
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:18,999
Come over! Come!

334
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:21,584
What’s up?

335
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,709
Qi, I just want to invite you

336
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,959
to go with me after work.

337
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,334
No!

338
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,375
What if people see us?

339
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,417
We were nearly exposed.

340
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:28,459
So what?

341
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:29,751
I want them to know!

342
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:30,417
No!

343
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,542
Everyone thinks you’re the princess.

344
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:32,209
And I’m the frog

345
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,209
who wants to marry you!

346
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,292
But you used to be

347
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,626
very confident.

348
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,876
That’s because

349
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:38,876
you’re my boyfriend.

350
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,542
I fear people may gossip.

351
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,292
People are watching. What are you doing?

352
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,667
Telling anyone!

353
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,250
Little frog!

354
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:27,709
How does it feel

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,626
to marry a princess?

356
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,292
I feel it carefully.

357
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:33,000
And that’s awesome!

358
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,209
Have you heard of it?

359
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,459
Ling Lingqi is Mr. Bo’s girlfriend!

360
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:46,959
That’s awesome!

361
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,751
Don’t make a fuss!

362
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:50,209
Everyone knows

363
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,167
Ling Lingqi came to FlowerPlus

364
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,626
just to get Mr. Bo.

365
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:54,459
Do you think

366
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,751
they’re in a relationship

367
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,125
because they had sex already

368
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:58,999
and Mr. Bo had to be her boyfriend?

369
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,167
I always look down on

370
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,334
such a girl!

371
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:06,042
Make way.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,083
Soon after Ling Lingqi was hired,

373
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,667
she became a shop manager

374
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,292
and Mr. Bo liked her.

375
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:17,709
You’ve been working in FlowerPlus

376
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,751
for years,

377
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,584
but haven’t been promoted at all.

378
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,542
The boss?

379
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:25,209
He’ll never notice you.

380
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,959
Who should be looked down on?

381
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:39,792
Thank you for driving me back.

382
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,000
Don’t you

383
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:44,584
invite me for some tea?

384
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,042
I don’t think so.

385
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,125
You just said

386
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,209
I was the princess.

387
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,083
And now you don’t want to

388
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,292
show me to your parents!

389
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,792
No.

390
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,876
You know my parents.

391
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,209
If they know

392
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,292
we’re in a relationship,

393
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:00,999
they’ll never

394
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,667
leave me in peace.

395
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,209
Angry?

396
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,542
What makes you angry?

397
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,042
Don’t be angry!

398
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:15,626
Stay off me.

399
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,999
Why are you angry?

400
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,334
It’s no big deal.

401
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:20,584
The sauce is going to be expired.

402
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:21,626
How much do you think

403
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:22,959
we should sell it?

404
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,000
Thirteen.

405
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,626
Why does the car look so familiar?

406
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:32,751
It does.

407
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,125
It looks like Mr. Bo Hai’s car.

408
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,999
Don’t get angry.

409
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:41,542
Look at me!

410
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,417
Kiss me!

411
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:47,834
Or I won’t let you leave.

412
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,667
Okay. Okay.

413
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,000
Come on. I’ll give you a kiss.

414
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:09,459
What’s wrong?

415
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,709
What do you mean?

416
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:14,709
Don’t move!

417
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,834
What are you doing?

418
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,250
You want a kiss, don’t you?

419
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:19,042
The car is too advanced.

420
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,250
I can’t see anything.

421
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:21,751
What about you?

422
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,417
Turn around. What are you doing?

423
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,042
Don’t move.

424
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,626
Why are you suddenly shy?

425
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,709
Turn around.

426
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,542
Gosh!

427
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,542
Thank you, Uncle.

428
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,083
I’m telling you.

429
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,292
Qi is my

430
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,792
only daughter.

431
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,083
You know it, huh?

432
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,709
Don’t think

433
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,792
you can bully her

434
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,125
just because we’re not powerful parents.

435
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,125
If you dare to hurt her,

436
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:45,292
I’ll fight it out with you!

437
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:52,083
What are you laughing at, brat?

438
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,083
Do you think I’m kidding?

439
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,000
Uncle, don’t worry.

440
00:22:59,459 --> 00:22:59,876
I will

441
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:00,999
cherish your daughter.

442
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,167
I’ve never seen my father.

443
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,542
When I was little,

444
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,792
my mother abandoned me, too.

445
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,125
In my eyes,

446
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:17,209
it matters most

447
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:18,667
when a family can

448
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:20,751
stay together happily.

449
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,042
You know.

450
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,334
Sometimes,

451
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:25,542
I envy Qi.

452
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:29,417
She has the parents

453
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,000
who love her

454
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,459
and take fully care of her.

455
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:43,209
Don’t... Don’t be so sentimental.

456
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,999
Don’t... Don’t envy her.

457
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,417
Well, when you’re free,

458
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:48,999
come and visit us,

459
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,167
so that I can check up on you.

460
00:23:57,918 --> 00:23:58,292
Eat it.

461
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,584
This.

462
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:03,751
Mom, don’t we have the mutton?

463
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:04,626
Why don’t you take this?

464
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,626
I’d like better mutton!

465
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:06,999
Mutton!

466
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,334
As the saying goes, girls defend their men.

467
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:10,375
It’s been only a few days.

468
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:12,125
And you defend Bo Hai!

469
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,751
Mom, don’t you always want me

470
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:16,000
to be with him?

471
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,209
Now your dream comes true.

472
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,125
Can’t he just have a bag of mutton?

473
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,542
Okay! You can even have ten bags!

474
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:23,375
Qi.

475
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:28,209
I have something to tell you.

476
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,709
I always say

477
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:31,876
I want a rich son-in-law.

478
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,959
A rich one.

479
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:36,250
But you must like him

480
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,501
if you live with him.

481
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,167
Just like your father and me.

482
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:42,250
Your father

483
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,959
isn’t very talented.

484
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:46,125
Nor does he make a lot of money.

485
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,042
All his life,

486
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,042
he runs the small stop.

487
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,375
And he always

488
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,000
quarrels with me.

489
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,250
But don’t you feel it?

490
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,167
Your father and I

491
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,999
have been living a happy life.

492
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,167
What do you mean, Mom?

493
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,250
I just want to ask

494
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:04,542
if you really

495
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,709
like Bo Hai.

496
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,417
Don’t force yourself

497
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:09,918
to be his girlfriend,

498
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:10,999
just because he’s rich

499
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,334
or just because

500
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:13,292
you want to

501
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,584
make us happy.

502
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,667
Mom, don’t worry!

503
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,959
I like Bo Hai!

504
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,626
I like him,

505
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:23,999
no matter he’s rich or not.

506
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,042
You’ve grown up.

507
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:29,709
It itches!

508
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:32,542
Qi!

509
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,042
Since you’re in a relationship with Bo Hai,

510
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:37,417
you should

511
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:38,667
show him around our neighborhood

512
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,125
when you’re free.

513
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,334
Carrot Li Lijun

514
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,501
will never expect you

515
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:45,792
to find me

516
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,709
such a rich son-in-law!

517
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:49,999
Mom. Mom. Get me a bag.

518
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:50,626
Hurry!

519
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,459
The hot pot is boiling.

520
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,125
Come on. Try some!

521
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:58,792
Come on.

522
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:03,999
Bo Hai, give me your bowl.

523
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,667
We made it for you, Bo Hai!

524
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:09,542
Don’t stand on ceremony.

525
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:10,959
Thank you, Aunt.

526
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:11,959
Well...

527
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:13,417
Come on. Enjoy yourself.

528
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:14,918
Thank you, Uncle.

529
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,209
Here you are.

530
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:17,959
Shrimp!

531
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:19,834
Bo Hai, have more!

532
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:20,834
Help yourself to more.

533
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:21,999
Thank you, Uncle. Thank you, Aunt.

534
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:24,792
Come, Bo Hai.

535
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:25,834
Thanks, Uncle.

536
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:27,959
Bo Hai, help yourself.

537
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,584
Seriously?

538
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,542
I’m your own daughter,

539
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:32,459
all right?

540
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:33,459
I’ve been holding the bowl for long.

541
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,000
But you give me nothing.

542
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,918
What are you talking about?

543
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,125
We’re a family.

544
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:39,209
Bo Hai is a guest.

545
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,292
- Yes. - We should take care of him.

546
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,792
You can help yourself.

547
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,334
Here.

548
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,876
Some vegetables for you.

549
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:48,999
Good for you. Here.

550
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:53,417
Bo Hai.

551
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:56,250
Do you like the hot pot?

552
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,083
Yes. Yes.

553
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,751
Qi likes the hot pot, too.

554
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,876
I like vegetables in the pot.

555
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,042
Come often and enjoy the hot pot.

556
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,542
Okay. Okay.

557
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,083
Come on. Cheers.

558
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,167
- Cheers. - Okay.

559
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:08,959
Cheers. Cheers.

560
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,709
Come often.

561
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:11,459
Thanks, Aunt.

562
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,667
Ji Bin told me

563
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,792
Ling Lingqi was nearly hurt.

564
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:37,834
I find myself

565
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,584
so ridiculous!

566
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:42,667
I’ve done so much.

567
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,334
But in the end,

568
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,292
I push the girl I love

569
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,250
to my enemy.

570
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:54,501
You win some and you lose some.

571
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,000
Like I said,

572
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,000
whether you can take revenge

573
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:02,959
depends on

574
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,667
if you can abandon everything

575
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,042
for that.

576
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:12,918
But?

577
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,417
Is it worth it?

578
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,083
I feel I’ve lost

579
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,334
something more important

580
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,834
just to take revenge.

581
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,042
Ling Lingqi is charmed by Bo Hai

582
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,417
for the time being.

583
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:39,501
When you beat Bo Hai

584
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,417
and he loses everything,

585
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,834
Ling Lingqi will realize

586
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,125
who is the best man

587
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,459
for her.

588
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:04,042
Wait a minute.

589
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,584
Make yourself at home.

590
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:23,709
I’ll go get you some fruits.

591
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:24,876
Okay.

592

595
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,000
Why are you going through my stuff?

596
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:11,584
Qi.

597
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,250
Let me tell you a story.

598
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:20,902
Let’s go over there.

599
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,645
Over there.

600
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:22,382
Over there.

601
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:23,890
It’s okay.

602
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:24,834
No. I don’t want it.

603
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,651
Thank you.

604
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,709
Would you like a bouquet?

605
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,501
Would you like a bouquet?

606
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:32,375
I just made it.

607
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:32,834
Sir.

608
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:33,501
No. No.

609
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:34,459
Sorry.

610
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,250
Would you like a bouquet?

611
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:40,125
No, thanks.

612
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:48,417
Bo Hai.

613
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,626
When can you pay the rent

614
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:54,834
for the next season?

615
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:56,751
Sorry, Chief Zhang.

616
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,459
Could you give me a few more days?

617
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,876
It’s okay.

618
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:02,751
But...

619
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:05,375
Bo Hai.

620
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,626
It’s hard to sell flowers.

621
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,584
Why don’t you try some other business?

622
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,292
Thank you. Thank you.

623
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,375
At the age of 22,

624
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,042
I started my dream of floriculture

625
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,000
on the flower stand

626
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:27,417
in the center plaza.

627
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,083
Life was hard at the beginning.

628
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:31,918
However hard I tried,

629
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,250
no one enjoyed my bouquets.

630
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,209
Until one day,

631
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,876
I met my first customer who knew me.

632
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:45,250
It’s such a beautiful bouquet!

633
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,459
What a waste!

634
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,250
As time went by,

635
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,542
we communicated with flowers.

636
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:04,918
We never met.

637
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:06,667
But in my heart,

638
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,959
she knew me best.

639
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:51,876
Thank you.

640
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:53,250
- Looks great! - Bye-bye.

641
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:53,834
Thank you.

642
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,584
Would you like a bouquet?

643
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:57,792
Fifty for each.

644
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,417
This one looks nice.

645
00:34:58,876 --> 00:34:59,334
This one?

646
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:00,167
We’ll take this.

647
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:00,918
Is this okay?

648
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,417
- Okay. - Here.

649
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,042
Thank you.

650
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:04,700
Here.

651
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,459
Bye-bye. Wish you happiness!

652
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:10,959
Would you like a bouquet? Fifty for each.

653
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,667
Only two bouquets left. Pick one.

654
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:13,709
Here. Take it.

655
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,042
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

656
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:16,167
Thank you.

657
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:16,709
Bye-bye.

658
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:19,334
Bo Hai.

659
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:20,626
Chief Zhang.

660
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:22,918
Bo Hai.

661
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:24,918
You’re having good business.

662
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,626
Aren’t you going to renew the rent?

663
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,626
No.

664
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,209
I’ve found a shop

665
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,459
and I’m going to open a flower shop.

666
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:33,792
Good. You’re young

667
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,375
and you should start a business.

668
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,501
Okay. I’ll leave you alone.

669
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:38,167
See you.

670
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:38,626
Okay.

671
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:39,334
Wish you success.

672
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:40,042
See you.

673
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,083
Come on!

674
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:03,751
How much is this bouquet?

675
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:05,959
Sorry. This is not for sale.

676
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,083
Not for sale?

677
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,209
Sorry!

678
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:33,250
I gotta go.

679
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:33,792

When I was having the hardest time,

684
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,501
you gave me hope

685
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:28,792
so that I could persist in

686
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:29,959
my dream.

687
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,626
You make who I am today.

688
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,834
You helped me unintentionally,

689
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:38,375
and I helped you

690
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:39,417
before I knew.

691
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,000
Don’t you think

692
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,167
fate is so wonderful?

693
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,083
Unfortunately...

694
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:48,292
Unfortunately, neither of us

695
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,250
recognized each other.

696
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,417
We’ve wasted so many years.

697
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,667
Without your persistence,

698
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,375
we would have missed each other forever.

00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:01,209
From now on,

701
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,375
you must cherish me,

702
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,709
to make up for the regret in the past.

703
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:05,417
Aye, Ma’am!

704
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:26,167
Come here, everybody!

705
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,459
I have something to announce.

706
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:28,501
What’s it?

707
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:29,375
What’s it?

708
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,042
What’s it?

709
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,751
Manager Li of Design Department

710
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,250
will be transferred to the branch

711
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,417
in another city this month.

712
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:36,167
Based on the evaluation of HR Department,

713
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,042
we will

714
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,709
have Ling Lingqi,

715
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,584
the shop manager,

716
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:40,959
take Manager Li’s place.

717
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,751
Hope you will

718
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:44,876
cooperate with Manager Ling.

719
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:45,626
Okay!

720
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,918
Okay! Great!

721
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:48,584
Thank you, everyone.

722
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,250
I’ll work hard.

723
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,834
And I will live up to

724
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:51,834
your expectations.

725
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,459
That’s not enough.

726
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:54,626
You should at least

727
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,459
buy us some coffee, huh?

728
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:56,626
Yes!

729
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:58,375
Bravo!

730
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:00,584
Bravo!

731
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:14,918
Antia Group

732
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,459
will start their business in China.

733
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,542
If we can have

734
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:18,375
a long-term cooperation

735
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,375
with them on flowers,

736
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,626
we’ll get great help

737
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:21,626
in our business.

738
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:22,292
Even our stock price

739
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:23,334
will rise.

740
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:28,918
I think we come too early.

741
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:29,709
We arrive

742
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:31,334
45 minutes ahead of time.

743
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:32,250
It can show them

744
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:33,834
we take this meeting seriously.

745
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,792
Excuse me, which of you is Mr. Bo?

746
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:41,000
Hello. I’m Bo Hai with FlowerPlus.

747
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:42,000
Today,

748
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:43,334
we come to visit Mr. Zhang.

749
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:44,292
Hello.

750
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,083
I’m the secretary of the president.

751
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:46,792
I’m Zhang.

752
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:47,876
Please have some rest

753
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:48,876
in the hall.

754
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:49,542
Okay.

755
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,542
The president is

756
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:52,000
receiving the delegates with DREAM.

757
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,000
Please kindly wait.

758
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,792
Why do they come?

759
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,083
They also want a long-term cooperation

760
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,626
with our group.

761
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,167
Thank you.

762
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:13,834
Why are people with DREAM

763
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
like mad dogs?

764
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:16,417
They always hunt us!

765
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:22,209
Xinyan.

766
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:23,667
When you go up,

767
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,209
give Mr. Zhang a brief introduction.

768
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:26,501
Tell him

769
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:27,792
I have something urgent to attend to.

770
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,999
I’ll talk to him later.
