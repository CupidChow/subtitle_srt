51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,209
Hello? This is Ling Lingqi.

52
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,709
What dream at the same frequency?

53
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:01,834
Wait a sec.

54
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:03,918
What do you mean?

55
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,292
Something wrong with

56
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:10,999
your dream bracelet?

57
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,834
So…

58
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,667
we may enter someone else’s dream?

59
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,751
No. No. No.

60
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,542
It didn’t happen to me.

61
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:31,918
Since I used

62
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:32,918
your dream bracelet,

63
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,250
I haven’t even had dreams.

64
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,083
Weird!

65
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:37,042
Yes. I’m always fast asleep.

66
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:38,626
Okay.

67
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,459
Thank you. Bye-bye.

68
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,125
I thought

69
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,501
I was cleared.

70
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:47,959
Unexpectedly,

71
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,751
I had been given

72
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,292
a VIP service

73
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,000
while I don’t even know.

74
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,918
I should have a dream.

75
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,334
What if it comes true?

76
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:10,876
Even if it doesn’t come true,

77
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:11,918
there will be

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,334
a huge free lunch

79
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,292
to help it come true.

80
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:21,375
Could you stop

81
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,167
controlling me every day?!

82
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,000
I don’t like that.

83
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,584
But I’m doing this for your own good!

84
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:25,918
When you are in love,

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,334
you can solve everything.

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,459
Hold your hands and be together.

87
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:48,709
Didn’t you go to have lunch

88
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:49,501
with Miss Liu?

89
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,459
She said she wanted to have lunch with you.

90
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,834
She couldn’t have it in my face.

91
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,542
I told her you were too busy to have lunch.

92
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,626
She slammed the door and left.

93
00:03:58,834 --> 00:03:59,417
All right.

94
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,792
Everyone has a subjective standard

95
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,876
for beauty.

96
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,042
In your words,

97
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:07,584
so many people like you.

98
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,584
It’s okay

99
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,375
when some don’t, right?

100
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,250
You make sense.

101
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,918
We’ve known each other for years.

102
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:16,709
I’m really confused

103
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,876
about one thing.

104
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,501
Who has unrequited love for you?

105
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,125
No one has

106
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,667
confessed love to me yet.

107
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,000
But as far as I’ve seen,

108
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,083
some female colleagues

109
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,250
and even some cleaners.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,542
They all like me.

111
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,626
As the end of year is coming,

112
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,751
they have a stronger crush

113
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,083
on me.

114
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,334
Are you nuts?

115
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:42,959
The end of year is coming,

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,209
KPI is needed for

117
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:46,417
promotion and pay rise.

118
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,542
Girls who like you

119
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:49,792
have a common feature.

120
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:50,834
You know what it is?

121
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:51,417
What?

122
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,459
They live in your imagination.

123
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:55,292
Come on.

124
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,334
It still means

125
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,959
I’m handsome, all right?

126
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,083
Unlike you!

127
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,584
You never have a girlfriend.

128
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,334
Get out!

129
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:11,792
Narcissistic!

130
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,792
According to

131
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,709
brain engineering science,

132
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,292
a man’s cerebral cortex gets excited

133
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,709
and generates the brain wave
at a specific frequency

134
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,417
in his dream.

135
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,167
When the brain waves are collected,

136
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,834
they can be recoded

137
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,250
through computer decoding

138
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:34,459
and be built into a new dream model.

139
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,125
When consciousness is implanted in the model,

140
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:37,918
one will manage to

141
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,584
enter someone else’s dream!

142
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,709
I can’t see you in the day.

143
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:50,959
It doesn’t matter.

144
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,501
Anyway,

145
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:53,626
I can see you in my dreams.

146
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,918
In the dream, you’re mine.

147
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,667
Only mine.

148
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:00,959
Ling Lingqi.

149
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,042
What?

150
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,918
Do accounts for your dad.

151
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,334
Tomorrow! I’m getting to sleep.

152
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:16,959
See you in the dream.

153
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,140
= Chairman of the Board Bo Hai =

154
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,250
Boss, still working?

155
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:37,999
I have to

156
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,000
finish this part today.

157
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,334
I guess I’ll stay overnight.

158
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:42,959
Model worker!

159
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,584
Well,

160
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,792
Some girls

161
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,626
invited me to have fun.

162
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,667
Go and have fun.

163
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:54,709
See you.

164
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:56,042
Okay.

165
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:33,125
Let me sleep!

166
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,667
Why wasn’t I dreaming?

167
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,167
I just thought you were a miracle.

168
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,459
But you had a failure.

169
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,292
You don’t know who I am.

170
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,417
I don’t need to get embarrassed

171
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,876
for chasing you.

172
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:19,999
Nor do I need to

173
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,042
accept any consequence

174
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,083
from confessing my love.

175
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,042
Do you really think

176
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,959
I only want to make coffee

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,501
or deliver files for you?

178
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:29,626
Prince…

179
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,918
Mr. Dragon is such a great helper!

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,751
It always comes right in time.

181
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,250
Queen Mary, where are you?

182
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,000
I’m here!

183
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,542
Prince Jack, I’m coming!

184
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank you for saving me.

185
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,042
You’re welcome.

186
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,918
If necessary,

187
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,459
I’m always willing to help you.

188
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,083
Help me!

189
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:21,709
Prince Jack!

190
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,167
Help me!

191
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,459
Queen Mary. Queen Mary.

192
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,959
Queen Mary, don’t die.

193
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,751
I’m dying.

194
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,709
There’s only one way to save me.

195
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,125
I wonder if you want to do it.

196
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,999
I want! As long as I can save you,

197
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,292
I’m willing to do anything.

198
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,083
Kiss me!

199
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,292
Why are you recovered so quickly?

200
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,834
It’s the power of love!

201
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,459
I’m still weak. Go on!

Bo Hai.

248
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,083
I was just informed that

249
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,209
Wen Guangqi sold his company

250
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,042
to DREAM.

251
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,626
He holds the stock of FlowerPlus

252
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,709
in the name of his company.

253
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,000
It means

254
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:39,709
DREAM is already

255
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,834
a stockholder of FlowerPlus.

256
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:46,999
To get rid of

257
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,501
the auditing of the board of directors,

258
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,083
he even sold his own company,

259
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,501
regardless of the cost.

260
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,375
Seems like DREAM has given him

261
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,999
a super price.

262
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,709
The fence-sitters in our company

263
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,417
must be eager for action

264
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:00,292
with evil intentions.

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,709
Have you heard it?

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,417
Mr. Wen sold out

267
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:05,292
his stocks.

268
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,584
Seems like other stockholders

269
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,459
also contacted DREAM.

270
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,042
Maybe our company

271
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,792
will have a new boss soon.

272
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:13,834
Nonsense!

273
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,292
How much did DREAM pay you

274
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,501
to make you help them

275
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,459
and start rumors?

276
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,417
No. There must be some misunderstanding.

277
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,542
Yeah. We don’t…

278
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,334
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

279
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,167
I will certainly ask you

280
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,667
to hold responsibility according to law.

281
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:30,918
This way, please.

282
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,542
Mr. Fan.

283
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,042
Sorry to keep you waiting.

284
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:35,042
Sit down, please.

285
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,542
Mr. Fan, I’ll just get to the point.

286
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,709
There’s real pressure

287
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,042
on the cash flow of FlowerPlus.

288
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,417
DREAM has bought

289
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,959
over 10% of our stock.

290
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:54,375
I hope

291
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,667
your company Starlight Investment

292
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:56,959
can invest in FlowerPlus.

293
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,834
Mr. Bo, you’re straightforward.

294
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,375
I won’t beat around the bush.

295
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,292
Business is business.

296
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,667
My company

297
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,999
doesn’t like buying shares after others.

298
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,083
Having a low share is boring.

299
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,375
No investors like to invest in some industries

300
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,999
he isn’t familiar with.

301
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:16,125
For floriculture,

302
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,999
I’m a layman.

303
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,125
It’s so modest of you.

304
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,667
About floriculture,

305
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,292
you don’t understand much.

306
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,292
But in terms of investment,

307
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,709
you’re a master.

308
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:26,626
Otherwise,

309
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,375
you wouldn’t have

310
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:29,918
expanded your company so largely

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,375
within only two years.

312
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,125
To be honest,

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,501
I come with selfish motives.

314
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,792
But I won’t beg you.

315
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,250
In business,

316
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,250
human sympathy is useless.

317
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,209
Profit

318
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,375
is the only key to cooperation.

319
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,417
Anyone with a discerning eye can see that

320
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:50,626
the valuation for FlowerPlus

321
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,584
is obviously low.

322
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:52,876
Otherwise,

323
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,167
DREAM wouldn’t have been so active.

324
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:55,959
The investment in us

325
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,834
will be

326
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:58,667
a real bargain

327
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,167
for you and your company.

328
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,959
Ling Lingqi?

329
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:06,751
Come out.

330
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:10,918
The head office

331
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:11,751
is taking a promotion video

332
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,042
to reflect on the daily work of shops.

333
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,959
The Marketing Department sent a colleague

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,125
for the source collection.

335
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:16,042
Go and help him.

336
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:17,334
Mo Nan.

337
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:18,501
This is our salesperson,

338
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:19,334
Ling Lingqi.

339
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:20,876
She will assist you.

340
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:21,999
Okay. Thank you.

341
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,042
Hello. Miss…

342
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:27,292
Adorable.

343
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:31,501
Well, I just…

344
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,501
I just want to stay with you

345
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:34,334
and experience

346
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,876
the daily work of shops.

347
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:40,918
Listen.

348
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:42,918
That was a misunderstanding.

349
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,667
You rushed in

350
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,459
and kept talking.

351
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:47,876
I was too embarrassed to stop you.

352
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:48,751
Besides,

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,417
I was showing respect.

354
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:51,959
Right?

355
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:52,918
You want to experience

356
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,083
our work, right?

357
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,626
Here. Pluck the thorns.

358
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,250
What thorns?

359
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:58,709
With your hands.

360
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,751
No gloves?

361
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:02,626
No.

362
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,501
And no knife?

363
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,375
No.

364
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,876
Just pluck them with my hands?

365
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:15,584
It pricks!

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,167
I scolded him harshly,

367
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,417
thinking he was a pursuer.

368
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:32,250
Do you know

369
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,542
what he said to me?

370
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,876
He said my dress was unzipped!

371
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:37,375
Super awkward!

372
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,000
It was a shame on me!

373
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,667
When I was sent to assist

374
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,000
a colleague from the Marketing Department,

375
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,250
I fixed my eyes!

376
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,792
It was him again!

377
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,375
This is a big world!

378
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,083
But why do we always

379
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,250
run into him?

380
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,042
You know what?

381
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,292
Just as the saying goes,

382
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,000
in this world,

383
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,459
there is some bad luck that

384
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:55,918
one can’t avoid his’ enemy.

385
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,292
What a coincidence!

386
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,584
I didn’t expect to meet

387
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,042
you two fairies in this place.

388
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,042
Nice meal!

389
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:05,999
How about this?

390
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,417
Since we’re lucky enough to meet,

391
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:08,834
it’ll be my treat.

392
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:09,709
The meal is on me.

393
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,250
What are you dazing at? Take the order.

394
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,250
Order whatever you want!

395
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:16,834
Never mind.

396
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,250
Fairies.

397
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,792
There was some misunderstanding

398
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,292
between us.

399
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,584
But it was in the past.

400
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,125
Shouldn’t we enjoy the meal

401
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,584
and forget it?

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,584
That’s a good attitude.

403
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,083
You must keep

404
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,417
this fine tradition.

405
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,000
Boy.

406
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:02,459
In less than six months,

407
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:03,417
I will forgive you.

408
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:05,709
Six months?

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,626
Buying you such meals for six months?

410
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,000
1,250!

411
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,876
So much?

412
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,167
It’s okay.

413
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,667
As long as you enjoy yourselves.

414
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,542
Try this.

415
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:32,999
It tastes great.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,876
Would you like taste this one?

417
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,000
If I tell you I don’t take my wallet,

418
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,751
what will you do?

419
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,250
What? No wallet?

420
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,375
Liar!

421
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:08,375
Come over!

422
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,083
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

423
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:10,918
I’m sorry!

424
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,292
We were just informed that

425
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:29,000
the stockholders’ meeting
will be held at noon tomorrow.

426
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,042
DREAM will send a delegate.

427
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:32,334
Tomorrow,

428
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,751
DREAM will officially propose

429
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:34,876
the acquisition plan.

430
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,000
Fan Chen

431
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,209
is still hesitating.

432
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,042
I think

433
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,000
maybe we’ll fail to

434
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:39,834
have Starlight Investment

435
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,000
invest in us.

436
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,626
In foreign countries,

437
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,584
it’s said that DREAM never let go of any prey

438
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:47,834
they hunt after.

439
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,999
Keep waiting.

440
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,167
Bo Hai.

441
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,125
I have an idea.

442
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:57,167
I think

443
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:58,751
we don’t need to

444
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,459
be so stubborn.

445
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,209
We might get a worse result.

446
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,626
Shall we use another way?

447
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,125
Why don’t we negotiate
instead of confronting them?

448
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,209
We can cater to DREAM.

449
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,626
No way!

450
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,334
Morality is dear.

451
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,584
But life is dearer.

452
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:15,375
I established FlowerPlus at the age of 22.

453
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,292
I knew nothing, except the floriculture.

454
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,083
It took me only six years

455
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:20,125
to build it into a listed company

456
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,999
with hundreds of employees.

457
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,042
Do you know the secret?

458
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:29,417
I’m always lucky.

459
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,751
I like this posture.

460
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,626
Queen Mary. Queen Mary.

461
00:22:59,209 --> 00:22:59,542
Wait.

462
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,918
Where are we?

463
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:18,626
Queen Mary.

464
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,876
Queen Mary. Wake up.

465
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:21,375
Look!

466
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:27,959
Doomed.

467
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,459
We’re doomed this time!

468
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,292
You’re really scared?

469
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,584
It… It breathes out fire.

470
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,876
I can make it rain.

471
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,417
Wait a sec.

472
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,167
One, two, three. Rain!

473
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,042
What the hell!

474
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:08,751
Why is the rule

475
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,459
always changing?

476
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:18,375
Wait a sec.

477
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,167
Come on. Give me a big one.

478
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,584
Give you a like!

479
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:08,999
Hello.

480
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:10,999
I’m the girl who fought the dragon

481
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,250
with you in the dream.

482
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:13,667
I’m Ling Lingqi.

483
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,999
I work as a salesperson

484
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,042
in the shop at Jixiang Road.

485
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,584
I order you to get me to the head office

486
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:21,000
within two days.

487
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,375
Because I’m your fangirl.

488
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:26,334
No way.

489
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,250
Because I’m your fangirl.

490
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,167
When can it become true?

491
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:47,584
When can I

492
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,042
really see you?

493
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:29,020
= Meeting Room MR =

494
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:30,999
It’s been a while, Mr. Bo.

495
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,209
Since everyone is here,

496
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,501
let’s start the meeting.

497
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,375
Wen Guangqi.

498
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:42,626
You sold

499
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:43,834
all your stocks.

500
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:44,999
Why can you still come

501
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,125
for the stockholders’ meeting?

502
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:48,709
I’m exerting the full authority

503
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,292
in FlowerPlus

504
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,250
on behalf of DREAM.

505
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,542
I have the right

506
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,918
to attend the meeting,

507
00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:55,709
and I will carry out

508
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:56,918
strict supervision

509
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,667
on your capital flows.

510
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,417
Everybody, let’s make a long story short.

511
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:02,999
As you all know,

512
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,375
DREAM is a fashion empire

513
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,667
with a worldwide fame.

514
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,999
We think highly of

515
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,501
the brand value of FlowerPlus.

516
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:09,375
So, we kindly

517
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:10,876
offer a plan,

518
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,167
hoping that you can

519
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,417
be part of us.

520
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,876
So, there is only one topic

521
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:20,834
for today’s meeting.

522
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,876
To discuss about DREAM’s acquisition agreement.

523
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,140
= Letter of Intent for Stock Acquisition =

524
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,417
DREAM plans to purchase

525
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,209
all stocks of FlowerPlus.

526
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,292
The price for each stock

527
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,999
is 15.7 dollars.

528
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:56,542
The founder Bo Hai

529
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,626
will have 6% of the total amount

530
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,375
as cash compensation.

531
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,999
Sounds attractive.

532
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:04,751
Sure.

533
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,209
We’re very sincere.

534
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:10,918
I don’t accept it.

535
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,100
= Letter of Intent for Stock Acquisition =

536
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,000
Dismiss.

537
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:26,334
Bo Hai.

538
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,209
That was harsh.

539
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,375
Extraordinary!

540
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,167
I thought

541
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,083
you would have respected them

542
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,042
at the meeting.

543
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:36,250
I failed to hold my temper.

544
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,584
That simple?

545
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:39,459
But to be honest,

546
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,209
what you said

547
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,083
really stunned them!

548
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:45,417
Why didn’t you

549
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:46,501
tell me earlier?

550
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:47,999
In face of the fight,

551
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:48,667
what plan

552
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,626
do you have?

553
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:53,250
None.

554
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,167
None.

555
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,417
None?!

556
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,125
With no plan,

557
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,501
how dared you argue with them?

558
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:00,834
Those guys are evil enough

559
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,083
to do anything!

560
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:05,125
Dude!

561
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:22,000
This bouquet looks great!

562
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,083
Its theme is

563
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,709
Dream Lover.

564
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:29,000
When my dream lover

565
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:29,959
celebrates his birthday,

566
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:31,083
I’ll buy one for him.

567
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,792
Who is your dream lover?

568
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,167
Brad Pitt.

569
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,834
What about you? Don’t you have one?

570
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,918
Sure, I have one.

571
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,667
Who is he?

572
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,667
My dream lover

573
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:52,751
is handsome and talented.

574
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,501
He’s as gentle as breeze.

575
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,918
His smile melts my heart.

576
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,250
Most importantly,

577
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,334
he’s quite a gentleman.

578
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:27,375
My fairies.

579
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:28,667
What a coincidence!

580
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,459
Go!

581
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:33,375
Calm down!

582
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,083
- Go! - Calm down.

583
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:34,792
Don’t punch me.

584
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,501
Wallet.

585
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:55,542
Phone.

586
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,959
I think I watched such a scene

587
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,834
in an old Hong Kong film,

588
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,209
Portland Street Blues.

589
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,334
Have you watched it?

590
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:31,042
Ma’am!

591
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:32,375
Be right there.

592
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,501
We want roast mushrooms,

593
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,459
chicken wings, scallops,

594
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:38,584
spicy lobster tails and lamb chops.

595
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,334
And some crabs.

596
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:42,709
We don’t sell crabs.

597
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,083
Buy some.

598
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,459
Go and buy some.

599
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,459
Get in the market and turn right.

600
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:49,417
We’ll pay.

601
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,167
I know that.

602
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,083
And buy some lobsters!

603
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:51,667
Ma’am.

604
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,083
Boston lobsters!

605
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:56,751
Wait… Wait a minute.

606
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,334
My fairies.

607
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,792
Could you please

608
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,959
leave some money for my rent?

609
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,834
Buy some more crabs.

Want to ruin me

611
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,740
= Letter of Intent for Stock Acquisition =
with this file?

612
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,417
with this file?

613
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,209
DREAM.

614
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,375
Do you remember how you begged me

615
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,292
to help your company?

616
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,584
Now you survive.

617
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,167
On behalf of DREAM?

618
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,375
Who do you think you are?

619
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:43,999
In this room,

620
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,167
who doesn’t know you?

621
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:45,999
Why do you think

622
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,417
you can tell me what to do?

623
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:49,417
DREAM is

624
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,042
known as a famous hunter.

625
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,918
It never lets go of its prey.

626
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:55,918
But this time,

627
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:57,959
you pick the wrong prey.

628
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,709
FlowerPlus isn’t a sheep.

629
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,999
It’s still hard to tell

630
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,000
which one of us will win.

631
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,209
Prince Jack, hug me.

632
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:12,709
Let’s fight together.

633
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,209
Prince Jack!

634
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:25,792
Help me!

635
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,000
Queen Mary!

636
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,250
Prince Jack!

637
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:41,834
Don’t push me!

638
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:40,375
I’d love to

639
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,501
repeat this part for a hundred times.

640
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:01,876
What Bo Hai did

641
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,042
was totally ridiculous!

643
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:04,876
= Meeting Room MR =
I think

644
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,667
Bo Hao is too young.

645
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,375
A moment of pleasure

646
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,375
only makes it worse.

647
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,626
DREAM is a powerful company.

648
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,042
If we don’t accept

649
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:14,959
their acquisition plan,

650
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,876
we’ll lose more.

651
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:32,042
Everybody.

652
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:34,584
I called you here

653
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,417
to tell you something.

654
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:37,751
Starlight Investment,

655
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,751
affiliated to the famous investor Fan Chen,

656
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,542
decides to invest in FlowerPlus.

657
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,083
Invest in FlowerPlus?

658
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:47,167
I believe when the news

659
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:48,209
goes out,

660
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,626
the brand value of FlowerPlus

661
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,125
will be largely increased.

662
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,959
I don’t want to force you.

663
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:55,083
Everyone has his ambitions.

664
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:56,918
If anyone of you wants to get away

665
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,000
and leave the profits

666
00:36:58,167 --> 00:36:59,542
to Mr. Fan and me,

667
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,334
I won’t stop you.

668
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:02,626
Mr. Bo.

669
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,292
Even if you pay the double price,

670
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,334
I won’t sell my stocks.

671
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,584
Follow you and we’ll make profits.

672
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:08,918
Don’t you think so, everybody?

673
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:09,959
- Yeah. - Yes.

674
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,792
Only idiots sell stocks now.

675
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:22,167
Mr. Bo.

676
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,626
I think

677
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,083
you’ve been getting me wrong.

678
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:28,918
I did everything

679
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,501
for the good of our company.

680
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,709
For the good of our company?

681
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:39,751
You colluded with

682
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:41,042
some ignorant foreigners

683
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,167
and tried to snatch the brand

684
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:44,250
the founder has worked on for years.

685
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:47,334
That’s for the good of our company?

686
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,417
Do you know

687
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:53,542
how many employees will lose their jobs

688
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,667
once our company is acquired?

689
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:57,667
Wen Guangqi.

690
00:37:58,626 --> 00:37:59,709
You really are immersed in

691
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:01,584
your cheap value.

692
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,125
I’m not as considerate

693
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:10,334
as you are.

694
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,501
But we really

695
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,000
had problems before.

696
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,292
I did that

697
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,042
to protect your brand.

698
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,334
As the old saying goes,

699
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,501
a man cuts his wrist to save his body

700
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,501
when a snake bites his hand.

701
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,083
You’re right.

702
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,459
I should cut my wrist now.

703
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:32,417
And you’re the snake.

704
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,083
From now on,

705
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:36,626
I’ll spare no efforts

706
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:37,834
to do one thing.

707
