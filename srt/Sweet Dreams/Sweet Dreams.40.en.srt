50

= Episode 40 =

51
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,334
Did I do something wrong?

52
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:50,501
Seems not.

53
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,292
I can’t have Qi and Baoni

54
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,000
have hope for me.

55
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,542
So I have to be

56
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,959
ruthless with them.

57
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,083
I didn’t do anything wrong,

58
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,209
but why

59
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,542
do I feel so bad?

60
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,709
Because you’re lying,

61
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:27,542
and you’re going through

62
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,167
a man-to-devil transformation.

63
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,334
Maybe one day

64
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,542
you’ll turn into

65
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,042
a devil like William.

66
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,626
By then, maybe you won’t

67
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:39,667
be sad or hurt.

68
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,626
Yeah.

69
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,709
I’m becoming more and more like a devil.

70
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,042
In business,

71
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,292
you will do a great cause.

72
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,334
But I...

73
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,876
I still miss who you were.

74
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,667
At last,

75
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:24,959
I become a man

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,751
I used to hate most.

77
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,042
Theoretically,

78
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,834
we shouldn’t interfere with

79
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,459
your relationship with Bo Hai.

80
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:44,999
But

81
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,667
we’re experienced, anyway.

82
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,459
If you have any problem

83
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,584
with your relationship,

84
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:51,709
tell me.

85
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,626
Maybe I can

86
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,667
advise you what to do.

87
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,250
I can offer a suitable solution.

88
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:57,417
Yes. Yes.

89
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,334
Your mom has watched so many TV series.

90
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,667
She’s very experienced.

91
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:04,584
Just tell me.

92
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,375
What makes you

93
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,501
and my future son-in-law so unhappy?

94
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,000
Be right there.

95
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:20,584
Excuse me.

96
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:21,334
Is this Ling Lingqi’s home?

97
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:21,834
Yes.

98
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:22,584
A bouquet for her.

99
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,584
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:23,959
Bye-bye.

101
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:24,999
Thanks.

102
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,792
Oh, a bouquet for you!

103
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,292
What does it mean?

104
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,125
Apology!

105
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,060
= Reasons are feeble. I’ll wait for you in silence
until you forgive me. From Mo Nan =

106
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,459
Bad news!

107
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,292
The bouquet is from Mo Nan.

108
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,125
Mo Nan?

109
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:48,876
How come?

110
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:49,209
Look!

111
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,209
Did you get it wrong?

112
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:51,584
Mo Nan gives Qi a bouquet

113
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,250
at this time.

114
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,792
He’s totally fanning the flames.

115
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,125
He’s taking advantage!

116
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:00,000
Qi, I’m telling you!

117
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:00,876
You mustn’t

118
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,292
be unfaithful to Bo Hai!

119
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,626
Mo Nan is a bad guy.

120
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,167
You must watch out for him.

121
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,000
Otherwise,

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,375
you might even be grateful

123
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,792
when he betrayed us someday.

124
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,999
It’s hard to explain.

125
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,459
I’m going out for a walk.

126
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,083
Come back early.

127
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,501
I’ll make you a big dinner.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,334
Qi...

129
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:49,959
We’re holding a creative light show.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,459
Come and enjoy it

131
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,250

You can have a discount here!

136
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:05,375
Since I was eight,

137
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,999
I haven’t bought a windmill.

138
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,250
So every time I see

139
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000
a child holding a windmill,

140
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,292
I feel envious.

141
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,250
You know what?

142
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,042
In my heart, a windmill

143
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,918
is not only a toy,

144
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,959
but also a child’s hope

145
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:20,792
and parents’ love.

146
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:31,834
Hello, miss.

147
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,250
Milky Way of Roses Creative Light Show.

148
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:34,667
Would you like to have a look?

149
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,501
The exhibition is by the canal.

150
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,834
It’ll be very romantic.

151
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,042
Milky Way of Roses?

152
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,000
What is it?

153
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,626
I had wanted to go,

154
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,417
but I always failed to go.

155
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,250
Why didn’t you go?

156
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:50,209
Couples always go there.

157
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,000
I’ll be jealous if I go alone.

158
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:53,876
But now,

159
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,209
you’re no longer alone.

160
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,792
You’ll go with me?

161
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,250
Well, you look poor.

162
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,876
Let’s go and make others jealous.

163
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,626
Let’s go tomorrow!

164
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,292
If you buy the tickets now,

165
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,209
you’ll get 20% off for two tickets.

166
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,876
A real bargain.

167
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,209
Would you like a try?

168
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,584
I’ll buy one ticket.

169
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:15,250
Okay.

170
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,667
Scan and pay.

171
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:18,918
A hundred yuan.

172
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,209
No discount for a single ticket.

173
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:20,959
Okay.

174
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,000
Here is your ticket.

175
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:24,999
Thank you.

176
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:27,918
You look so beautiful.

177
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:30,999
Hello. Creative light show.

178
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,459
Any interest?

179
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:36,167
Hello.

180
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:37,292
Hello.

181
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:38,292
I want a ticket.

182
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,209
Okay. Okay.

183
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,626
Scan and pay.

184
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,167
Immortal flowers

185
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,000
can be used for flower boxes.

186
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,918
They can also be made into

187
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,125
a series of creative decorations.

188
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:49,709
For example,

189
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,125
the series of Alice in Wonderland

190
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,083
uses lovely color matching.

191
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,584
It’s perfect for

192
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,459
the design of wedding jewelry.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,792
I’m going to show you

194
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,083
how to make a simple bracelet

195
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,167
with the immortal flowers.

196
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,459
This is a simple

197
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,709
immortal flower bracelet.

198
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,501
I believe it will look better

199
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,501
when it matches the overall floriculture

200
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,959
at the wedding.

201
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,083
Most importantly, when the wedding ends,

202
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,417
the bracelet can be preserved

203
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,709
as a souvenir.

204
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,667
Have a discussion,

205
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:33,542
referring to this.

206
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:39,375
I’m sure

207
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,709
the immortal flower wedding series

208
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:41,792
will be hot-selling.

209
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,709
Watch what you’re doing!

210
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:56,999
Sorry. Sorry.

211
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:00,709
Aren’t you with the Finance Department?

212
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,417
Why are you doing the service thing?

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,709
Lili is occupied.

214
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,959
I’m helping her with the work.

215
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,626
Lili!

216
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:13,250
Thanks.

217
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,083
You’re welcome.

218
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,250
Hello? Mr. Liu.

just for me.

nothing will help,

however hard I explain.

252
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,200
I don’t want to give you

any more pressure.

But you can’t even protect yourself.

Bo Hai didn’t have an attack of illness.

315
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:22,876
You’ve tried a lot to stop him,

316
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,501
but he is still

317
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:26,918
working on new products.

318
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,209
But his attending doctor

319
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,083
confirmed his disease last time.

320
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,501
What went wrong?

321
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,417
I promised to the board of directors

322
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,000
that we would acquire FlowerPlus

323
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,083
within one month.

324
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,083
But so far,

325
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,751
you’ve made no progress.

326
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:47,417
How can I explain

327
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,542
to the board of directors?

328
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,999
If we only want to acquire FlowerPlus,

329
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:53,751
Mr. Mo’s plan

330
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,000
has already worked.

331
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:03,459
I’m warning you!

332
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,999
I want more than FlowerPlus!

333
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:07,584
I want Bo Hai

334
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,876
to be utterly disgraced!

335
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:19,834
I see.

336
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,334
I’m considering for you.

337
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,584
Bo Hai is your enemy.

338
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:38,999
Cheer up.

339
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,167
There’s not much time left for us.

the client Director Liu signed

did business fraud deliberately.

Didn’t they

00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,125
stop cheating us?

350
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,999
sue them?

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,250
They’re only puppets.

352
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,918
Someone is behind them.

353
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,834
You mean DREAM and Mo Nan?

354
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:24,375
I want to tell them

355
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,292
we survived

356
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,626
not because of their mercy

357
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:28,334
or charity.

358
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:29,459
FlowerPlus and I

359
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,083
are strong enough

360
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,292
to face them

361
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,125
and defeat them.

362
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,918
All right. Give it to legal personnel

363
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,125
and ask them to contact the lawyer

364
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,125
for the lawsuit.

365
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:41,876
Copy.

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,667
Mr. Mo...

367
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,626
I did what you suggested.

368
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,792
But Bo Hai is still okay.

369
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,292
No, Mr. Mo.

370
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,334
Let me explain.

371
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,083
Psychology

372
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,959
is always

373
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,375
a complicated subject.

374
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,292
In modern medicine,

375
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,667
there’re still many unknown areas

376
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,626
in human brain.

377
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:31,709
I’m a doctor,

378
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:33,584
but I still can’t

379
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,918
give him

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,792
a precise diagnose.

381
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:40,709
You can’t?

382
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,918
But I can predict your future.

383
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:49,626
Creditors will come to you.

384
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,459
The news that your wife’s in debt

385
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,083
will provoke much discussion

386
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,417
in your hospital.

387
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,959
Your promotion will be cancelled.

388
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,334
This is

389
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,250
all because of

390
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,667
your immature medical skill.

391
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,751
No, Mr. Mo.

392
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,292
Don’t... Don’t be angry.

393
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,626
I suddenly recall

394
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:13,709
an important detail!

395
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:15,000
I remember

396
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,501
Bo Hai told me

397
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:17,375
he didn’t

398
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,501
have the disease on the day of fire.

399
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,542
He became colorblind

400
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,626
when he was officially sent to welfare home

401
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,042
and confirmed that

402
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,999
his mother abandoned him.

403
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,292
So

404
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,542
does Bo Hai

405
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,876
still believe that

406
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:36,959
his girlfriend

407
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,125
will not leave him

408
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,209
and they will get back together?

409
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,751
Then his problem

410
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:45,751
hasn’t been triggered.

411
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:51,584
Well, let’s make him

412
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,000
give up.

413
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,626
Take his place

414
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,709
as Ling Lingqi’s boyfriend

415
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,751
and destroy all his illusions.

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,584
Mr. Bo, you asked to see me?

417
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,417
Stop walking around!

418
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,000
Go open the shop!

419
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,417
I’m not in the mood!

420
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:36,250
I just wish

421
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,334
I could close the shop,

422
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:38,375
stay at home

423
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,542
and keep an eye on our daughter!

424
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,334
Look at her!

425
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,000
She behaves so weirdly!

426
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,417
Bo Hai is such a rich boyfriend.

427
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,125
But she broke up with him.

428
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,459
And Mo Nan wants her!

429
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,792
Annoying!

430
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,209
No way. I must go have some divination.

431
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,501
I have to know

432
00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:58,709
what is happening.

433
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,125
You know what?

434
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:01,667
I won’t marry my daughter

435
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,959
to a vulgar husband!

436
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,584
A vulgar husband is okay.

437
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,542
Better than having no husband!

438
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,334
Could it be Bo Hai?

439
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:18,792
Be right there.

440
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,125
Coming!

441
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:22,751
Uncle.

442
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:24,250
Oh, Baoni.

443
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,083
Where’s Qi?

444
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,209
Qi?

445
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:30,918
Okay.

446
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,334
When you’re depressed,

447
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:55,042
you need a correct way

448
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,709
to relax yourself.

449
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,417
Baoni.

450
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:03,626
I find the whole world

451
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:04,918
so boring.

452
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:07,042
I don’t believe it.

453
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,459
Let’s go have a big meal.

454
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,834
Are you the fake Ling Lingqi?

455
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,417
Come on, girl.

456
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:24,834
Go! Go!

457
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,459
Are you the real Ling Lingqi?

458
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:27,751
Go!

459
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,042
Enjoy yourselves.

460
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:36,792
Thank you.

461
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:39,292
Baoni.

462
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,667
We are disappointed in love.

463
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:42,250
But

464
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,709
we still have to live.

465
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,000
How much do we have to pay for this?

466
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:46,999
We’re miserable, anyway.

467
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,375
Why don’t we enjoy ourselves?

468
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:52,918
To disappointment in love!

469
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:53,626
Cheers.

470
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:03,918
This is a cake

471
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,125
I specially ordered.

472
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,375
It took trouble.

473
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,459
We’re not having a birthday or festival.

474
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:10,709
Why did you buy a cake?

475
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,167
We can’t even finish the dishes.

476
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,375
Because today is

477
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,375
a very important day.

478
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:02,626
I asked Baoni

479
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:03,501
to help me ask you out.

480
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,083
Today is

481
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:07,667
the fourth anniversary

482
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,375
of our first meeting.

483
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:11,626
You said,

484
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,334
four years ago,

485
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,501
I turned up

486
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,542
and lit up your life.

487
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,584
You came to me,

488
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:23,667
helped me walk out of my fear,

489
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,250
and gave me love and hope.

490
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:28,083
You also

491
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,042
lit up my life.

492
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,083
Qi.

493
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,417
No one knows

494
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,167
what tomorrow will be like.

495
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,042
Will there be haze

496
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,167
or storm?

497
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,792
Whatever it is,

498
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:53,834
we will leave a light

499
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,083
for each other,

500
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:57,209
so that

501
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,876
we can find each other

502
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:02,959
in the darkness.

503
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,459
New immortal flower products

504
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,709
have been officially sold.

505
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:16,000
Today,

506
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,209
we’ve got the evidence of

507
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,459
the rival’s business fraud

508
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,542
and we’ve brought a lawsuit.

509
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,167
Qi.

510
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:28,125
I’m no longer

511
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,042
weak or cowardly.

512
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,626
Don’t sacrifice for me anymore.

513
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:40,334
Bo Hai.

514
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:55,626
I understand.

515
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:57,709
Qi.

516
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,501
I’ll always leave a light for you

517
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,751
until you come back to me.

518
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:32,584
Take his place

519
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,542
as Ling Lingqi’s boyfriend

520
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:38,292
and destroy all his illusions.

521
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,083
How dare you bump into me?

522
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,167
You bumped into me.

523
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:06,959
Apologize to me!

524
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:07,751
You bumped into me.

525
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:08,918
Why should I apologize?

526
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:09,667
Hit him!

527
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,125
Hit him! Do it!

528
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:15,792
How can you hit him!

529
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:16,959
Teach him a lesson!

530
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:17,834
Go away!

531
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,375
I’ll beat you to death!

532
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,167
Somebody! Help!

533
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:19,667
Hit him!

534
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:20,959
Go away.

535
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:22,417
Somebody! Help!

536
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,042
Mr. Mo.

537
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,209
Miss Ling broke in!

538
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:26,959
You did it, right?

539
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,000
What?

540
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:29,792
You asked someone to hit Bo Hai!

541
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:30,709
Don’t play the fool now!

542
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:31,751
Who else could it be?

543
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,959
I want more than FlowerPlus!

544
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,375
I want Bo Hai

545
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,751
to be utterly disgraced!

546
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,042
It was me. So what?

547
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,542
What kind of man are you?

548
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:56,292
How could you be

549
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,542
so ruthless?

550
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:01,999
Did Bo Hai’s warm hug

551
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:03,667
make you nearly forget

552
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:04,792
our agreement?

553
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:12,751
I’m telling you, Ling Lingqi.

554
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,042
To get you away from Bo Hai,

555
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,959
I’ve got worse plans.

556
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,667
Would you like to try?

557
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:24,459
Knowing you is the biggest mistake

558
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,626
I’ve ever made.

559
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:35,459
Yes.

560
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,999
I asked someone to hit Bo Hai.

561
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:40,083
How could we use

562
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:41,501
such a barbaric way?

563
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:43,250
Commercial competition

564
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,250
is barbaric itself.

565
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:46,584
There’s no such thing as rule.

566
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,000
Besides,

567
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,083
we didn’t always use

568
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,751
frank or fair ways.

569
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,626
Mo Nan, I always think highly of you.

570
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,292
But you’ve disappointed me!

571
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:01,209
So, I helped you

572
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:02,918
to teach Bo Hai a lesson.

573
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:04,834
I’ll pick up the pace.

574
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,501
But I hope to defeat my rival

575
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:07,751
in the way I want.

576
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,125
If your way works,

577
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,501
I won’t argue.

578
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:12,918
By the way,

579
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,417
I advised you to be Ling Lingqi’s boyfriend.

580
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:16,709
Have you made your decision?

581
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,375
I don’t want to hurt her.

582
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,542
You’re still not mature enough.

583
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:26,959
You’re too kind,

584
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,876
sentimental and conservative.

585
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,667
That’s too bad

586
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,751
for a businessman.

587
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:49,876
When can we cross it?

588
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,209
Is he mad?

589
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,918
Sir, it’s the red light!

590
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,000
Are you crazy?

591
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,626
Darn it! Don’t you see the red light!

592
00:28:58,626 --> 00:28:59,292
Watch out!

593
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:09,876
At a messy crossing,

594
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,334
you can’t cross the road

595
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,584
by waiting for the traffic lights.

596
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,667
A man can’t reach his goal

597
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,751
unless he breaks the original rule

598
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,459
and creates his own.

599
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,459
I don’t think

600
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,083
you will hurt Ling Lingqi.

601
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:28,959
Instead,

602
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,000
I think you’re a better boyfriend

603
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,083
than Bo Hai.

604
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,167
Only in this way,

605
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:35,667
can you make her

606
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,125
totally forget Bo Hai

607
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,626
and can you destroy him.

608
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:47,125
Besides, there are a lot of things

609
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:51,000
you’re not allowed to say no to.

610
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:54,334
The deadline we promised

611
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,417
the board of directors is coming.

612
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,083
I can wait.

613
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,334
But I don’t think others

614
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,083
are as patient as I am.

615
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:22,834
Since you don’t want it,

616
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:23,834
why did you accept

617
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,000
William’s offer?

618
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,667
That isn’t an offer, but a threat.

619
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:33,334
Threat?

620
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,292
How come?

621
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,584
He thinks so highly of you!

622
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:38,042
And we often

623
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:39,459
joke that

624
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:41,584
William is like

625
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:42,959
your adoptive father in DREAM.

626
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,209
I’ve changed. So has William.

627
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:51,292
But I really wonder

628
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,209
what went wrong.

629
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,709
I remember William told me

630
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,375
he went to Europe twenty years ago.

631
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:03,083
Yes.

632
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,375
If I remember correctly,

633
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,000
that was when you went there, too.

634
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,167
Maybe that’s also why

635
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:10,959
he thinks very highly of you.

636
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,125
But that was just

637
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,584
after the fire.

638
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,501
Do you mean

639
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,292
William had something to do with

640
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,667
Yunhe Flower Shop?

641
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:25,626
Go check up on William.

642
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,459
He’s oversuspicious. Be careful.

643
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,000
Qi.

644
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,292
Where are you going? Let me drive you.

645
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:55,834
No, thanks.

646
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,584
My car is over there.

647
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:57,834
We can chat on the way.

648
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,000
We broke up.

649
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,292
There’s nothing to chat about.

650
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:02,918
I thought

651
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:03,417
you understood what I said

652
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,501
last night.

653
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:05,709
I did.

654
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,626
But I didn’t agree.

655
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:10,501
Bo Hai, now I feel

656
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:11,876
very relaxed.

657
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:12,751
I’m going to

658
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,000
find my own happiness.

659
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,334
Hope you’ll find yours, too.

660
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:16,834
If you really mean it,

661
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,626
why don’t you dare to

662
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:18,834
look into my eyes?

663
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,209
Since I’ve made up my mind,

664
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:23,959
I’m not going to regret.

665
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:25,626
Then I’m telling you.

666
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:26,250
Whatever happens,

667
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,626
I won’t give up on you.

668
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:28,459
I believe one day,

669
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:29,626
you will come back to me.

670
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:32,834
Goodbye.

671
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:44,626
I don’t believe you will leave me!

672
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:49,459
Did you see the bruises

673
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:50,667
on Bo Hai’s face?

674
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,626
I did.

675
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:54,751
He said he fell off the stairs.

676
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,083
But I don’t believe him!

677
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:57,959
Secretary Chen.

678
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:02,709
He didn’t fall off the stairs.

679
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,167
Someone hit him!

680
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,959
Who hit him? Who dared!

681
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:06,792
Keep your voice down!

682
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:07,876
Don’t let others

683
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,876
hear you.

684
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:11,042
Some drunk punks

685
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,751
hit him.

686
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,667
But they only admitted

687
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,042
they were too drunk.

688
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:17,542
They’re already in the police station.

689
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,167
I think,

690
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,459
Mo Nan must be

691
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,792
behind it.

692
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,250
Luckily, boss is okay.

693
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:24,209
He only gets some bruises on his face

694
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,292
and looks worse.

695
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:26,792
If he got badly wounded,

696
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:27,918
I would fight it out with them!

697
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,709
We can’t just let it go!

698
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:30,584
I quite agree.

699
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:31,999
How about this?

700
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:34,876
I’ll hire some guys

701
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,375
to hit Mo Nan and his men.

702
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:37,751
Xinyan.

703
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:38,959
I have another idea!

704
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:39,834
I can keep

705
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:40,584
calling them,

706
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,959
asking if they want to rent a house

707
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:42,667
or want a loan.

708
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:43,292
I’ll keep harassing them

709
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,834
until they break down. Okay?

710
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:45,751
Shut up!

711
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,709
Xinyan, there’s still another way.

712
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,125
I haven’t defeated Mo Nan so far.

713
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:06,999
But Qi,

714
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,000
I’m not giving up.

715
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:13,125
The international exhibition comes in two days.

716
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,167
FlowerPlus will give a floriculture performance

717
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:16,501
on behalf of the Asian-Pacific region.

718
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:18,542
It decides if we can

719
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,459
develop the overseas market

720
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,709
and defeat DREAM.

721
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,042
Whatever tricks our enemy may use,

722
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,459
I believe we can defeat them

723
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:28,417
with real strength.

724
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,042
Tomorrow, the international exhibition

725
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:32,667
= International Fair =
will be held in our city.

726
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,250
= International Fair =
As an important business activity

727
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,460
= International Fair =
in the Asian-Pacific region,

728
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,000
this international exhibition

729
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,876
has attracted

730
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,083
leaders of business organizations

731
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,000
from over forty countries and regions.

732
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,501
This exhibition is not only for

733
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:43,542
business presentation and communication,

734
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,834
but also for battles

735
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,999
among tycoons.

736
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,959
A white war

737
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,292
will begin momentarily.

738
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:51,292
Ambitious Chinese enterprises

739
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:52,792
are ready to go.

740
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,334
Hope they can

741
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,209
distinguish themselves

742
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,667
and step into

743
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:57,584
the wider overseas market.

744
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,042
A white war?

745
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,459
We’re in, aren’t we?

746
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:09,999
This exhibition

747
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,459
is a great chance.

748
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:16,834
We’ll make Bo Hai

749
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,501
suffer from his disease

750
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,542
in front of all guests

751
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,667
and reporters.

752
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,334
FlowerPlus will be stuck in

753
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,626
an unprecedented crisis of confidence.

754
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:36,999
That will be

755
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,000
very exciting.

756
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:45,459
I’ll try.

757
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:51,626
To defeat our rivals

758
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,751
in business,

759
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,042
we need to use our brain,

760
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,459
and we also need passion.

761
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:12,959
Oh, why is Ji Bin absent?

762
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:18,626
His father is sick.

763
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,375
He asked for days’ leave.

764
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,125
We’re in need of helpers.

765
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,334
If we’re short of men,

766
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:31,834
there’ll be problems.

767
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:34,209
Career or family, he has to choose.

768
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,999
Don’t approve of such leave.

769
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:43,209
You don’t worry about a man,

770
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,042
only when you keep him around you.

771
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,300
= Shop =

772
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:11,250
Look at us.

773
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,834
We worried when Qi had no boyfriend.

774
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,375
Now, she has one.

775
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:17,417
Why are we unhappier?

776
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,042
How could we be happy?

777
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,751
One boyfriend is perfect.

778
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,584
But now there are two.

779
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:26,876
She can only have

780
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,501
one boyfriend.

781
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:29,459
If there’s another one,

782
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:31,250
there’ll be problems.

783
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,250
Not really!

784
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,042
Mo Nan and Bo Hai

785
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,417
are different.

786
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,250
Bo Hai is an honest man.

787
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,959
But Mo Nan is mean.

788
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:40,584
If Mo Nan hadn’t interfered,

789
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:41,250
Qi wouldn’t have broken up

790
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,876
with Bo Hai.

791
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:44,834
I agree!

792
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:47,042
Maybe Mo Nan did something,

793
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,375
so that our daughter broke up

794
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:50,000
with Bo Hai.

795
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:51,292
You know what?

796
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,292
Speaking of this,

797
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,375
I’m so pissed off!

798
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:56,167
What a pity on

799
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,709
my future son-in-law!

800
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,751
He’s aggrieved!

801
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:03,459
Why do you have pity on him,

802
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,209
instead of your own daughter?

803
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:06,626
Without a son-in-law,

804
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,417
how could our daughter be happy?

805
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,292
Why don’t you ask your daughter

806
00:38:10,626 --> 00:38:12,417
to have a new boyfriend?

807
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:13,667
Who?

808
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,542
Well, here is the thing.

809
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:17,417
My son wants to

810
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,209
invite her to watch a film.

811
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,250
- No! - No!

Here. Have something to drink.

00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:46,125
Thank you.

816
00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,334
Really want to quit your job?

Director Luo

818
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,125
still has your resignation to him.

819
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:04,125
I quit!

820
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,918
I’m smart, anyway.

821
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,167
I can work in any company.

822
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:09,959
You give up on FlowerPlus?

823
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,417
Yes. I’ll find a new job.

824
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:15,250
Won’t you see Bo Hai again?

825
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,334
If I can stop Mo Nan

826
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:20,209
from doing something crazy

827
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,626
by leaving Bo Hai,

828
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:22,792
I’ll be relieved.

829
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,209
Leaving is also a kind of love.

830
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:32,083
Yeah.

831
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:35,375
Leaving is also a kind of love.

832
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,334
I’ve made up my mind.

833
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:43,000
I’m leaving Mo Nan.

834
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,918
Come on. From now on,

835
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:49,334
we must love ourselves!

836
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,292
And love each other!

837
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,876
Luckily, we still have each other.

Baoni.

839
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,209
Is the phone too boring

840
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,542
or are the snacks yucky?

841
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,292
Why do we want love?

842
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:29,459
But the feeling of loving someone

843
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:31,959
and the depression of missing someone

844
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,292
are truly charming.

845
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,292
I thought love was a simple thing.

846
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:45,042
But I must break a way through obstacles

847
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,999
before I reach the prince.

848
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:48,834
That’s hard.

849
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:53,876
Why isn’t there

850
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:54,751
a textbook about

851
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,542
how to love?

852
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:57,459
Are you nuts?

853
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:59,542
How could there be a textbook?

854
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:02,042
We can see brighter light,

855
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,918
just because the road is dark.

856
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:11,209
But why can’t I

857
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:12,792
see any light?

858
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,740
= Zhejiang Archives =

859
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,209
I didn’t find William’s Chinese name

860
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:33,834
on the staff list of Yunhe Flower Shop.

861
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:35,834
But I found Zhou Anping

862
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,167
who Mo Nan had

863
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:38,417
talked to.

864
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:40,709
I think

865
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,918
he’s an important clue for a break.

866
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,792
Hello, sir.

867
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:54,959
May I ask about someone?

868
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,751
Do you know where Zhou Anping lives?

869
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:57,751
Zhou Anping?

870
00:41:58,584 --> 00:41:59,626
He moved away.

871
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,709
Look, he even sold his place.

872
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,584
Sir.

873
