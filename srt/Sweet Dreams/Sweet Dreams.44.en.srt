172
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,250
you and I both know

173
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,584
what kind of person William is.

174
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,209
I can’t handle him,

175
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,918
much less can you.

176
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:56,959
Come on, eat.

177
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:01,709
Baoni.

178
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,209
Thank you for

179
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,334
helping me all this year.

180
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,292
You have some, too.

181
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,542
- I want it! - I want it, too!

182
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:41,292
No, it’s mine.

183
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,626
I want it!

184
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,542
I want it!

185
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,417
I want it!

186
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,167
It’s so beautiful.

187
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,918
Sir, I seem to have left something

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,751
by the sea.

189
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,334
Pull over up ahead.

190
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,083
Hurry!

191
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,626
Wait for me!

192
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,751
Hi, kid.

193
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:27,876
Come.

194
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,250
That’s my scarf in your hand.

195
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,459
Can I have it back?

196
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:33,751
Thank you.

197
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,250
Your cricket looks nice.

198
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,709
Can I see it?

199
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,125
Could this grass cricket

200
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:14,626
be made by Bo Hai?

201
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:18,918
Nice work.

202
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,501
Did you make it yourself?

203
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:21,292
No.

204
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,083
It’s…

205
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,042
It’s from

206
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,751
a man who sells flowers in the market.

207
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:28,999
Thank you.

208
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,792
Auntie, may I ask you,

209
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:45,959
where is the man

210
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:46,751
selling flowers?

211
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,125
He sold out all the flowers and went home.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,959
Where’s his home?

213
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,417
You need to

214
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,542
cross the bridge, then go upwards,

215
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,000
and turn left.

216
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you.

217
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:12,501
Who are you looking for?

218
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:14,834
I…

219
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,209
I’m looking for the man

220
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,250
selling flowers in the market.

221
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,375
That’s me.

222
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,292
Sorry. I made a mistake.

223
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:40,542
Who is it?

224
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,375
A pretty lady.

225
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:43,709
Looking for me.

226
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,250
A pretty lady?

227
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:47,459
Go ahead and take a look.

228
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:50,792
Wait.

229
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,667
Why are you back

230
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,334
so early?

231
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:53,459
I usually sell them

232
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,417
till night.

233
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:55,334
Early?

234
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:56,584
If it wasn’t for Doudou and other kids

235
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,834
asking me to make grass crickets,

236
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:58,959
I’d be back earlier.

237
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:04,542
What’s wrong?

238
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:05,667
I suddenly feel there’s

239
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,042
something wrong with my duodenum.

240
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:08,250
Why don’t you

241
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,501
sell flowers for me tomorrow?

242
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:10,667
Just for one day.

243
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,709
No way.

244
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,000
Come on, Hai! Please, brother!

245
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:13,959
Just for one day.

246
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,918
According to the transaction record provided by

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,209
the real estate agent,

248
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,667
one of William’s men, Wu Fan,

249
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:21,876
used to rent a

250
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:22,834
suburban house.

251
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,751
But I followed them for a year,

252
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,834
and neither William nor Wu Fan

253
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,250
ever went there.

254
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,000
Renting a house in the suburb?

255
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,999
That doesn’t sound like him.

256
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:39,375
That’s right.

257
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,501
More importantly,

258
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:43,709
the rental time for this house

259
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,042
is right before

260
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,167
Uncle Zhou disappeared.

261
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,083
I think it’s for Uncle Zhou.

262
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:51,876
Most likely.

263
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,626
Come on, let’s go check it out.

264
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,020
= Lu Baoni =

265
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:04,209
Baoni.

266
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,000
You don’t have to go over there.

267
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:06,918
I’m not at the hotel.

268
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:07,626
I have an

269
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,209
important meeting

270
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,375
in Shanghai.

271
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,542
When I get back,

272
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:13,667
I’ll be in touch.

273
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,375
Why not answering his phone?

274
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:49,709
Follow that car.

275
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:19,501
It’s here.

276
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:26,334
Uncle Zhou.

277
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:29,334
We meet again.

278
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,417
What are you doing here?

279
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,709
Don’t be scared. We mean no harm.

280
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:34,918
We just want to talk.

281
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:26,792
Go!

282
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:30,709
Stop!

283
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:31,709
Get them!

284
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,501
I didn’t say anything.

285
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:43,999
You can’t live here any longer.

286
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,751
I have to find you a new place.

287
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,083
Stop!

288
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:53,334
Don’t let him get away!

289
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,250
Pull over. Pull over.

290
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,709
Over there, block him!

291
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,042
Stop!

292
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:22,667
Stop!

293
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:23,459
Spread out!

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,667
Fan out!

295
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,250
Stop!

296
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:33,167
Stop!

297
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:46,209
Mo Nan.

298
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,292
What are you doing here?

299
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,375
Go!

300
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
Stop! Go!

301
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,209
Stop!

302
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,584
Stop!

303
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:11,792
Stop right there!

304
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,876
Baoni, run!

305
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,751
I can’t.

306
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,792
Mo Nan! Mo Nan!

307
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,918
Just leave!

308
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,417
Mo Nan!

309
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:42,959
Baoni!

310
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,334
Baoni, are you alright?

311
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,125
Stop! We called the police.

312
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,584
Don’t do anything stupid.

313
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:57,959
Let’s go.

314
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,334
Are you all right?

315
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,459
I’m fine. Are you hurt?

316
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:10,501
I’m fine.

317
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:13,876
Come on.

318
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,959
I’ll be fine.

319
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,959
I don’t have a scar constitution.

320
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,250
Baoni.

321
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,792
Don’t ever do that again.

322
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,375
I was just trying to help you.

323
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:46,167
What you did then

324
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,667
wasn’t helping at all.

325
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,292
Luckily, they were just

326
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,709
trying to scare us,

327
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:51,834
or there’d be hell to pay,

328
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:52,626
you know?

329
00:21:58,792 --> 00:21:59,918
I don’t want you to get hurt for me.

330
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:06,334
It’s my fault.

331
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,125
I only make things worse for you.

332
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:09,459
I’m sorry.

333
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,999
Miss Lu meant well.

334
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,250
Besides,

335
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:20,501
we didn’t know

336
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,250
there’d be an ambush at Uncle Zhou’s,

337
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:23,042
right?

338
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,540
= William =

339
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,501
You’re late.

340
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,334
But at least I’m here.

341
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,250
Hurts, doesn’t it?

342
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,292
These guys

343
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:11,042
don’t know what they’re doing.

344
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:13,542
Piece of cake.

345
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,375
I’ll just call it a workout,

346
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:16,999
stretching my body.

347
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,042
You really are the

348
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,083
spitting image of your father.

349
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,834
When you believe in something,

350
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,000
you won’t turn back till the end.

351
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,876
If he hadn’t tried to find out the truth

352
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:35,125
about bad flower incident,

353
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,042
he wouldn’t have died.

354
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,167
You have no right to judge my father!

355
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:43,167
Okay.

356
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,250
Let’s not talk about him.

357
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,584
Let’s talk about you.

358
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,375
You’re young.

359
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,459
You’ve got a long way to go.

360
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,751
You must take care of yourself.

361
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,667
You don’t have to threaten me.

362
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:09,999
Don’t worry.

363
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:13,167
What my father failed to do,

364
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,375
I will do for him,

365
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,000
even at the cost of everything.

366
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:24,209
How can you be so forgetful

367
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,542
after all you’ve been through

368
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,751
with Bo Hai?

369
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:29,876
Yes.

370
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,584
You can sacrifice yourself.

371
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,918
But what about the others?

372
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,292
Can you sacrifice them?

373
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,667
Bo Hai has nothing now.

374
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,209
Who’s next?

375
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,042
Ling Lingqi?

376
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:48,667
Lu Baoni?

377
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:50,542
You really don’t care?

378
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,626
The dead is already dead.

379
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,459
Think of the living.

380
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:01,667
Don’t hold on to a dead man.

381
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:17,459
Of the 20 flowers in this bunch,

382
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,083
only these 12

383
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:19,999
are truly grade A.

384
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:21,792
Miss Ling.

385
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:23,999
I didn’t take you

386
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,792
for a young professional.

387
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,542
FlowerPlus is the largest floriculture company

388
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:29,250
in the country.

389
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:30,042
I guarantee that

390
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,584
as long as the quality of your goods
is up to standard,

391
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,626
our annual order will be

392
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:33,876
three times the current volume,

393
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,999
and any new orders

394
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,209
will be given priority to you.

395
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:38,626
That would be great.

396
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:39,667
Once the volume goes up,

397
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,918
the price has to come down.

398
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:41,834
So I’d like you to give me

399
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:43,667
a 20% discount at your current price

400
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,959
and then adjust it at random

401
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,167
according to the market.

402
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:47,959
No.

403
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:49,834
A 20% discount won’t do me any good.

404
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,459
A thousand mu of flower fields have just

405
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,083
been planned on the outskirts of Suzhou.

406
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:55,417
They’ll be

407
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,417
mass-producing bouquets

408
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:57,417
in less than a year.

409
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,999
Do you think they would agree

410
00:25:58,999 --> 00:25:59,709
if I were to order next year’s flowers

411
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,125
from them

412
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,667
at a 20% discount?

413
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:03,542
Um…

414
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:05,918
20% off, then. I’ll sign.

415
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:06,918
But

416
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,999
you have to sign a three-year contract.

417
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:09,999
Of course.

418
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,167
I’ll e-mail you

419
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,250
the contracts later.

420
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,000
It’s not easy dealing with

421
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,167
a little girl like you.

422
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:18,125
I’m telling you,

423
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:19,959
these are imported

424
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,459
Bulgarian roses.

425
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:22,125
I drove to the airport

426
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,542
this morning to pick them up.

427
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,334
The price is rock bottom.

428
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,167
Can’t go any lower.

429
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:26,709
Here’s the deal.

430
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,375
We’re old customers, right?

431
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,417
More discount, please.

432
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,999
You have to look at the product.

433
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:32,584
The price is rock bottom.

434
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:34,459
These aren’t Bulgarian roses.

435
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,542
These are Corolla roses from Kunming.

436
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:37,959
Although the quality of your goods

437
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:38,709
is good, and you can

438
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:39,999
make them look like the real thing.

439
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,375
But the difference is

440
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,167
that the branches are too short,

441
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,626
not even 50 centimeters.

442
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:46,999
Obviously, these are not imported flowers.

443
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,501
I’ve been buying flowers from you

444
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:51,250
for years,

445
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:52,250
and you’re still screwing me?

446
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,626
Look, I’m not gonna say anything.

447
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,667
You take them at the purchasing price,

448
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:57,209
OK?

449
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:58,999
OK, I was waiting for you to say that.

450
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,250
Load the car!

451
00:26:59,334 --> 00:26:59,792
Load the car!

452
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:11,876
Impressive, Bo Hai.

453
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,584
Check other flowers.

454
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:14,292
See if they are good.

455
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,042
Come on, that’s enough. Let’s go.

456
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:17,209
Fine. Let’s go.

457
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,375
Bo Hai. Bo Hai.

458
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:38,375
Bo Hai.

459
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,459
Is there something

460
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,459
on your mind?

461
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,876
You’ve been moping all morning.

462
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,417
Don’t lie to me.

463
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:49,792
I’m a good judge of character.

464
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:54,125
Do you have

465
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,375
a crush on some girl?

466
00:28:58,834 --> 00:28:59,334
Watch where you’re going.

467
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:03,209
Fine.

468
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,751
I know you have no other plans today,

469
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,375
so, help me watch the flower stand.

470
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:10,209
I don’t feel like going out today.

471
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,083
I finally got

472
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,459
Fang to go to the movie today.

473
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:14,417
Help me one more day.

474
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:15,167
Just for one day.

475
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,709
The more you like someone,

476
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,751
the colder you behave.

477
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:46,876
The more you care for someone,

478
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:50,292
the farther you stay away.

479
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,834
But it doesn’t matter.

480
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,042
I’ll always protect you.

481
00:29:58,584 --> 00:29:59,876

You said,

503
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,080
four years ago,

504
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,080
I turned up

505
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,410
and lit up your life.

506
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,000
You came to me,

507
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,000
helped me walk out of my fear,

508
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,950
and gave me love and hope.

509
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,040
You also

510
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,700
lit up my life.

511
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,410
Qi.

512
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,410
No one knows

513
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,200
what tomorrow will be like.

514
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,870
Whatever it is,

515
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,500
we will leave a light

516
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
for each other,

517
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,990
so that

518
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,620
we can find each other

519
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,200

I’ve been trying to lie to myself.

523
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,290
I thought I could fall in love with you.

524
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,790
But I can’t pretend anymore.

525
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,370
I can’t love anyone.

526
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,410
I like you.

527
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,290
Whatever others say or do,

528
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,790
I will not change my decision.

529
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,330
But in love, when you step forward,

530
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,200
I should step forward, too.

531
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,000
If you step forward while I step backward,

532
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,500
what will you get?

533
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,450
Then I’ll keep stepping forward

534
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,330
until you stop stepping backward.

535
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,910
Don’t you understand what I mean?

536
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,870
Is that so hard to

537
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,410
admit your feeling?

538
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,620
I’m willing to take a risk for you.

539

Coming!

553
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:25,542
Brother!

554
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,167
- You’re all here. - Brother!

555
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,042
Come on. Get in.

556
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:29,751
- I want a flower. - I want…

557
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:30,959
A flower.

558
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,542
I want a butterfly.

559
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:33,334
You want a dragonfly...

560
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:34,584
You want a dragonfly, don’t you?

561
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:35,292
I want a butterfly.

562
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,000
You want a butterfly.

563
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:36,918
What do you want?

564
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,334
What am I making now?

565
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:49,751
A frog.

566
00:33:49,918 --> 00:33:50,751
A frog.

567
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:51,876
A big frog.

568
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,083
Who wants this?

569
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:53,667
I do.

570
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:55,834
OK, this one…

571
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:56,834
I do, too.

572
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:26,209
How are you doing?

573
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,542
Here, the flowers bloom in silence,

574
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,083
and there is no strife.

575
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,042
I’m doing fine.

576
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,542
It’s been a year. Why haven’t I heard from you?

577
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:41,083
I’ve been looking all over for you.

578
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,334
My past is

579
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:47,876
full of bad memories,

580
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:50,584
so there’s nothing to

581
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:51,667
be concerned about.

582
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:57,209
You know what?

583
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:58,918
All this year

584
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:01,417
we’ve been protecting the company

585
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:03,959
and waiting for you to come back,

586
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,792
to start over…

587
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:06,999
I don’t want to know that.

588
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,125
I don’t care anymore.

589
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:13,834
It’s your FlowerPlus.

590
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,501
How can you not care?

591
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:22,042
I’m a loser.

592
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,167
I don’t have what it takes

593
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:26,459
to protect this company.

594
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,000
So,

595
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:30,375
you need to stop

596
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,709
this meaningless insistence.

597
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:37,999
People wait a year for you,

598
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,417
but all they get in return

599
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,584
is your so-called “meaningless insistence”?

600
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:48,292
I used to believe that

601
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,459
we live

602
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,918
to solve

603
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,501
all kinds of problems.

604
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:57,083
We can do anything

605
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,209
as long as we put our mind to it.

606
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:02,792
But now I think

607
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,000
there are some things,

608
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,167
no matter how hard we try,

609
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,876
they just don’t work out.

610
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,000
There are some people,

611
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:18,250
no matter how hard we try,

612
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,667
we still can’t have them.

613
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,751
I know you’re still mad at me.

614
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,876
I’m not asking you to forgive me.

615
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,209
But if you just go back,

616
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:40,209
I promise you,

617
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,792
I will disappear without a trace.

618
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,334
I will never appear to you again.

619
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,834
Come back, Bo Hai.

620
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,959
That won’t be necessary.

621
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,626
I’ve said my good-byes.

622
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,209
I’m not going back there.

623
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:07,417
I don’t believe it.

624
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,501
Please, just go back, okay?

625
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:16,792
Qi.

626
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,709
You know why

627
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,083
I want to say goodbye to the past?

628
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,792
Because you’re in my past.

629
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,876
How can you treat such a pretty girl

630
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:37,834
like this?

631
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,999
You sure fooled her.

632
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,083
You’re not gonna try to talk her out of it?

633
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:46,250
Looks like

634
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:47,999
she’s gonna be sitting there all night.

635
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,584
You’re not much of a brother!

636
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:54,584
We’ve known each other

637
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,834
for a year.

638
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,250
You’ve been holding out on me.

639
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:58,751
You know

640
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,876
all about flowers, don’t you?

641
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,083
Tell me what you used to do.

642
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:11,959
