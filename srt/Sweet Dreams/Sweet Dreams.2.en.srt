Thank you.

53
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,083
The grand wedding

54
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,000
for Hollywood superstar Nicolas

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,501
and the duchess Madeline

56
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,209
is going on

57
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,375
in Le Château d’Ussé, France.

58
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:58,626
The famous Chinese florist

59
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,792
Mr. Bo Hai

60
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,501
decorated the castle

61
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:03,709
into a stunning

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,209
Garden of Eden for princesses

63
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,959
with more than one hundred thousand

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,542
pink roses.

65
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,167
What’s wrong with you?

66
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,083
Choked?

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,918
Don’t scare me!

68
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:20,125
What’s wrong?

69
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,792
The ancient castle!

70
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:23,334
I dreamed of it

71
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:24,501
last night.

72
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,334
The flowers are the same.

73
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,626
So are the trees.

74
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,417
I dreamed of them in the dream.

75
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:32,209
Trust me!

76
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:33,626
I really dreamed of them!

77
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:34,959
Do you have the feeling?

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,667
Sometimes…

79
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:36,626
Sometimes,

80
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:37,542
something in your dream

81
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,250
turns up

82
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,209
in reality.

83
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,334
Qi, Qi, time is up.

84
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,167
You should go!

85
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:42,250
Hurry!

86
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,083
Or you’ll be late.

87
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:45,751
Good job.

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,751
Where did you get

89
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,999
so many pink roses?

90
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,999
There are no such pink roses.

91
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,626
What do you mean?

92
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,459
I dyed them.

93
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,209
Red dye was put

94
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,292
in the water-storage tube.

95
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,375
Inspiration.

96
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,167
I dreamed of it last night.

97
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,417
Amazing!

98
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,083
Nicolas.

99
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,459
Do you take Madeline…

100
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:11,584
Time to go!

101
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,459
Okay!

102
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,870
The half and the whole…

103
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:16,834
Weird.

104
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,918
It’s exactly the same in my dream.

105
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,292
I really dreamed of that.

106
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,840
Till death do you part.

107
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,542
See you.

108
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes.

109
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:31,042
What’s wrong with her?

110
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,334
As far as I could tell,

111
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,709
our daughter is nearly

112
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,542
possessed by Bo Hai.

113
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,792
Look at the girls!

114
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,501
What’s wrong with them?

115
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:41,918
They’re crazy!

116
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,167
They watch too many TV shows.

117
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,876
And they really think an

118
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,334
ordinary girl can marry a prince.

119
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:50,125
How unconfident you are!

120
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:51,999
Maybe someday,

121
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,751
our daughter will hit the jackpot

122
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,334
and have a rich husband.

123
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:57,459
You must have

124
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,667
watched too many shows, too.

125
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:00,459
You know what?

126
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:01,709
Qi is applying for

127
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:02,626
the recruitment of floriculture company.

128
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,584
If she fails,

129
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,292
maybe it’s a good thing.

130
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:06,667
Ask her to

131
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:07,918
find a suitable job.

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,626
Right?

133
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,626
You have a classmate

134
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,459
nicknamed Four Eyes.

135
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:15,918
He runs a veterinary hospital,

136
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:16,792
doesn’t he?

137
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:17,792
So what?

138
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,542
Take some gifts

139
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,334
and visit him!

140
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,375
Veterinary hospital!

141
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,334
Qi majored in veterinary medicine.

142
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:25,417
Maybe she can get a job

143
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,626
in his veterinary hospital.

144
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:36,834
Cheers.

145
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:38,876
- Thank you, everyone.
- Cheers.

146
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,083
- Thank you. - Thank you.

147
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,250
- Thank you so much. - Cheers.

148
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,375
Thank you.

149
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,042
Yes. Very successful.

150
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:12,999
Related media at home and abroad

151
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:13,709
covered the event.

152
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,167
Next…

153
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:18,834
Mr. Wen.

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,834
Yeah. Very successful.

155
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:22,876
Exceed the expectation

156
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,209
of most guys.

157
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,167
Especially the expectation

158
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,209
you have.

159
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:29,501
You’re getting old.

160
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:30,876
Health matters most.

161
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,250
Get to sleep early.

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,876
Wasting time

163
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,209
on people like you

164
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:39,792
is disgracing me!

165
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,709
Go back and tell Wen Guangqi

166
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,042
to stop before it’s too late.

167
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:44,876
Or he’ll be sorry.

168
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:51,918
That was

169
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:53,000
amazing!

170
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:04,918
Doomed!

171
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,542
How do you feel?

172
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:28,584
Are you all right?

173
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,792
Close your eyes!

174
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:41,751
Do you feel better?

175
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,167
Bo Hai.

176
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:45,459
Did you have a relapse?

177
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:46,626
Let’s go.

178
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:08,584
Morning.

179
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:09,292
Morning.

180
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:09,876
Good morning.

181
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,626
Qi! Here!

182
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:15,542
Baoni.

183
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:17,999
Let me have a look.

184
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,375
Rouge your lips.

185
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:25,167
You know what?

186
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,626
Calm down and don’t be nervous.

187
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,709
The recruitment of FlowerPlus

188
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,209
pays most attention to the first impression.

189
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:30,709
You’ll just sign up.

190
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,417
But as far as I know,

191
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,000
in fact,

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,876
they want to

193
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,334
get a first impression of participants.

194
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:36,834
So, don’t be nervous.

195
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,751
You must leave the examiners

196
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:38,709
the best impression.

197
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:39,751
I wasn’t

198
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,584
too nervous.

199
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,584
But you make me more nervous

200
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,250
saying that.

201
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,083
Look how cowardly you are!

202
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,834
Baoni. Baoni. Come over!

203
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:47,584
Be right there!

204
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,209
I have to go.

205
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:49,918

Hello.

217
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:43,083
Weird.

218
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,334
I just saw many people.

This is my resume.

Ling Lingqi.

225
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,542
Easy to remember, huh?

226
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:07,334

Examiner.

229
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,375
You’re young, but prudent.

230
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,709
I dream to be

231
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,000
an excellent florist

232
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,167
just as you.

233
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,125
I look young

234
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,375
and inexperienced.

235
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,792
But I have my own comprehension

236
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:23,626
and perception

237
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:24,250
for arts.

238
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:25,167
When I was four,

239
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,501
I learnt simple line-drawing.

240
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:27,459
When I was ten,

241
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:28,417
I read

242
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,375
all girls’ comics.

243
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,375
When I was twelve,

244
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,209
I started to match the clothes

245
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:31,876
for my mother.

246
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,584
When I was nineteen,

247
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:33,709
I fell in love with floriculture.

248
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:34,876
It turns out

249
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:35,709
I have enjoyed floriculture

250
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:36,999
for four years.

251
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,918
When others were in a relationship,

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,542
taking a walk

253
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,501
and getting up late,

254
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,250
- Stop. - I was…

255
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:55,876
What you said

256
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,834
is like potter praises his own pot.

257
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,459
No proof, do you?

258
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:02,501
How about this?

259
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:04,959
Use the flowers

260
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:05,834
on the table

261
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,626
and focus on

262
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,083
the topic of “adorable”.

263
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,125
Show me

264
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:14,918
what you can do.

265
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:25,209
Weird!

266
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:25,792
It’s only a few minutes.

267
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,584
Where has she gone?

268
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,083
Why doesn’t she answer the phone?

269
00:10:59,501 --> 00:10:59,959
This…

270
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,334
You!

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,834
Examinees.

272
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,334
I think you’re in the wrong room.

273
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:16,999
You’re the examinee, too?

274
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:23,959
You behaved greatly.

275
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,000
You will succeed!

276
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,334
You will succeed!

277
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,209
Are you nuts?

278
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:36,751
You’re doomed!

279
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,417
Don’t let me see

280
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:44,083
that liar again.

281
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,042
Whenever I see him,

282
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:45,876
I’ll punch him.

283
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:47,792
It’s really

284
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:48,918
too silly of you.

285
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,626
You can’t even recognize the examinee.

286
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:51,667
Lu Baoni.

287
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,167
Don’t you feel sorry for me?

288
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,501
Your friend was cheated today!

289
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,667
But you didn’t comfort me.

290
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,125
I just told the truth.

291
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:58,626
If I didn’t arrive in time,

292
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,042
you would have missed the sign-up.

293
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,375
Lu Baoni! Do you think

294
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,667
I’m not angry enough?

295
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,250
What the hell!

296
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:09,209
All right.

297
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,083
Come on. Have a beef ball

298
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,667
to make you clever.

299
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,459
For the sake of the beef ball,

300
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:16,667
I’ll let go of you.

301
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,459
Since we’re back in China,

302
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,417
we have to argue with Wen Guangqi

303
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,292
in his face.

304
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,209
But Bo Hai’s eyes…

305
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,709
Bad luck never comes alone.

306
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,209
Don’t worry, will you?

307
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,459
Say something pleasing.

308
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,167
The wedding

309
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,417
for Nicholas and Madeline

310
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,209
was a very successful ad for us.

311
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,167
According to the Marketing Department,

312
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,834
more than fifty media

313
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,542
covered us

314
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,375
in a positive way.

315
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,501
We’re among the hot topics

316
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,209
on Weibo for two days.

317
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,083
The search index for our band

318
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,709
has also risen by 15%.

319
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:07,959
The most cheerful thing is that

320
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:08,792
we finally

321
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:09,792
show the stockholders

322
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:10,667
in our company

323
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,542
what Bo Hai can

324
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,667
really do.

325
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,542
And DREAM…

326
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you realize that?

327
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,209
Since he used

328
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,417
the dream bracelet,

329
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,375
he has had a better sleep quality.

330
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,792
Bo Hai has been too tired these days.

331
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,417
Let him have a good rest.

332
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,250
Tonight, I’m going to see you

333
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,584
in my dream.

334
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,125
Cinderella and the prince

335
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:45,709
make a good story.

336
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:46,792
I love that.

337
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,417
Hope you can keep going.

338
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,584
But I don’t like

339
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,209
a fantasy action movie.

340
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:52,792
Hope it’s a romantic comedy

341
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:53,709
for tonight.

342
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,292
If

343
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,501
you can show me

344
00:13:58,584 --> 00:13:59,667
the examination tomorrow,

345
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,000
I’ll love you more.

346
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,209
Kiss, kiss!

347
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:06,209
Good night.

348
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,584
She’s really mad!

349
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,876
Did you visit Four Eyes?

350
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,250
Anything going on

351
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,209
with the job at the veterinary hospital?

352
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:18,000
I visited him.

353
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:19,584
I visited him

354
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,501
with a lot of tins.

355
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,542
He’s now the director.

356
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:24,918
And he’s being difficult.

357
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,792
I said quite a lot

358
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,999
with a torrent of words.

359
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,417
But he totally ignored me.

360
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,292
What tins did you bring?

361
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,834
Pork luncheon meat!

362
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,125
You asked him for help

363
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,125
with expired tins?

364
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,459
What’s wrong with you?

365
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,375
Who would notice the expiry?

366
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,792
Four Eyes will!

367
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,417
If I were him,

368
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,999
I would open all the tins

369
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,709
in front of you

370
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,042
and force you to eat them all!

371
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,292
You ruined it deliberately, didn’t you?

372
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:52,959
No.

373
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,501
Enough!

374
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,250
Take two bottles of good wine

375
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,667
and go apologize to him tomorrow!

376
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,375
Our daughter’s job

377
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,751
must be settled immediately.

378
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,125
My prince.

379
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,334
Do you remember me?

380
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,459
Why do you come again?

381
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,125
Do you remember

382
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,125
what you promised me?

383
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:58,501
If you approach me

384
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,751
to get a reward,

385
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,083
you make it.

386
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:02,626
What do you want?

387
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,667
Tell me. What do you want?

388
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,709
I want you.

389
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,459
In your dreams!

390
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,209
Why are you behaving weirdly?

391
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,626
Shouldn’t the prince propose
to the sleeping beauty

392
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,083
after waking her up with a kiss?

393
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,501
How shameless!

394
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:29,667
Get out of my castle.

395
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:32,209
Or I’ll have you thrown out!

396
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,167
Oh, my little heart.

397
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,250
When you look cool,

398
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,626
that’s adorable!

399
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,667
Wait for me.

400
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,542
My prince! Your Highness!

401
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:45,876
Wait for me!

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Your Highness!

403
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,083
Stop running!

404
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,709
Mr. Dragon, you are

405
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:00,918
just in time.

406
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:04,626
Are you scared?

407
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,250
Give me your hand. Come on.

408
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:06,918
Come on. Hug me.

409
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:07,292
Come on.

410
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:08,667
Look at you.

411
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,542
Why are you so restrained?

412
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,209
Hug me!

413
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:12,959
Mr. Dragon,

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,125
you have a new skill!

415
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,626
Hurry! Run!

416
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,042
See? I told you to hug me!

417
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:23,959
But you didn’t listen.

418
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,959
Come on. Hug me tightly

419
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,417
and you won’t be in danger.

420
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,083
Gosh, what a lovely hug!

421
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,083
It’s hot!

422
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,209
It’s burning!

423
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,501
You can spray fire, so what?

424
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,042
I’ll spray water at you!

425
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,542
Why am I less powerful?

426
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,083
Can you make it or not?

427
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:39,709
See?

428
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,417
I told you I could make it!

429
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,375
Let’s go! Go!

430
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:51,626
Wait.

431
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:55,999
Oh, dear.

432
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:58,501
It’s just a dream.

433
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,626
Look how scared you are!

434
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:11,876
What’s your name?

435
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:14,918
I’m

436
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:15,959
Queen Mary.

437
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,209
Queen Mary?

438
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,417
What nation are you from then?

439
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,709
It’s just a name.

440
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,292
Don’t bother about the logic.

441
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,417
Just remember my name.

442
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,334
What a weird name!

443
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,667
I’m Jack.

444
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,459
Prince Jack and Queen Mary.

445
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,959
Sounds like a couple!

446
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,667
Look!

447
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,000
Awesome, isn’t it?

448
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,167
Look! Look at the birds!

449
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,876
Look! Look!

450
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:16,834
I’m super awesome!

451
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,918
Well, I’m going to

452
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:21,876
take a recruitment exam in your company

453
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:22,709
tomorrow.

454
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,584
Could you tell me something before I go?

455
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:26,501
What do you mean?

456
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:30,999
I’m expecting too much.

457
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,501
It’s just a daydream

458
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:33,292
of a naïve girl.

459
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,000
There’s no cheat.

460
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,709
I’ll get something practical.

461
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:40,501
Come over.

462
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:42,999
Come!

463
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,083
He even gives flowers

464
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:57,334
in such a unique way.

465
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,709
He’s the dream boy of millions of girls!

466
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,375
Each plant

467
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,209
has its own life track.

468
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,042
As long as you figure out

469
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,876
its unique feature,

470
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,375
you’ll find its charm.

471
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,667
This bouquet suits you.

472
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:10,876
It’s practical.

473
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,959
He’s really a master!

474
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,042
He even makes fruits and vegetables

475
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,542
into art works.

476
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,125
What the hell!

477
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,083
Whether I can be admitted

478
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,417
and whether my dream can come true

479
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:35,334
depends on today! Ling Lingqi.

480
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:39,709
Little cosmos, burn!

481
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,667
Isn’t she the fangirl?

482
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:54,626
Our company thinks

483
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:55,292
she has evil intentions

484
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,459
and always declines her.

485
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,125
Unexpectedly, she still comes every year.

486
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:58,959
Impressive!

487
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,542
I hate such fangirls!

488
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,542
Does she regard working

489
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,292
as watching concerts or films?

490
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,542
With evil intentions,

491
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:07,834
she will never be able to make it.

492
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,375
Speaking of intentions,

493
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:10,792
you have some evil ones, too.

494
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:12,876
I’m different from them.

495
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,626
Yes, you are.

496
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,626
You’re the head of Bo Hai’s fans

497
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,751
and a die-hard Bo Hai fan.

498
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,667
Today’s exam for florists

499
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,667
is “Monet’s Inspiration”.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,751
Manager Li Boqing,

Senior Florist Xu Sisi and I

502
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,167

I think

539

it’s doing okay.

Yeah.

It tallies with

the topic of “Monet’s Inspiration.”

544
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,083
What does that help then?

545
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:49,209
For floriculture,

546
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,792
the overall skill matters most.

547
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:51,834
Besides,

548
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:52,999
she has evil intentions.

549
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,083
Only because of this,

550
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,292
she must be out!

551
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,167
Here comes the list.

552
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,000
Hurry!

00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,042
- Am I in? - Am I in?

554
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,292
Only ten.

555
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,250
I passed! I did!

556
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,542
I’m in! I’m in!

557

Finally, I passed!

558
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,626
Finally, I passed!

559
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:13,417
Awesome!

560
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:15,999
Isn’t that you? Look!

561
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,334
Amazing!

562
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,501
What good luck!

563
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,709
Qi, hold on!

564
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,083
How come?

565
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,834
I’ve been taking the exams for years.

566
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:29,667
I spent all my time

567
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,250
in learning floriculture.

568
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,000
Don’t waste your time.

569
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,959
I don’t want to see you next year.

570
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:51,751
Qi, why don’t you go home?

571
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,167
I’ll ask for a leave

572
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:54,626
and go find you, okay?

573
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,209
There’s a serious problem

574
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,417
for this year’s recruitment.

575
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:06,626
You didn’t publish

576
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,167
the recruitment for

577
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,209
two salespersons.

578
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:08,959
Do something

579
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,667
and solve the problem right away.

580
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,334
Please wait.

581
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,209
We suddenly decide

582
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,751
to hire two salespersons.

583
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,876
I wonder if anyone is interested.

584
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,876
But aren’t we here for the recruitment

585
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,959
of florists?

586
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,375
How much

587
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,667
is a salesperson paid?

588
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,083
And how is the welfare?

589
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:43,083
Salespersons in shops

590
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:43,751
also have the chance

591
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:44,999
to be florists.

592
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,584
Seems like you know pretty much

593
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:47,667
about our company.

594
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:50,000
When is

595
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,542
the sales interview starting?

596
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,834
Could you wipe off

597
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:54,709
your tears

598
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:55,501
before the interview?

599
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,220
To accord with

600
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,459

the Double Ninth Festival,

601
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,042

602
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,876
a special bouquet for parents.

603
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,834
And you will

604
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,834
sell all the bouquets

605
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,000
in the shop.

606
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:13,667
Remember.

607
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:15,250
Within two hours,

608
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:16,834
the first two

who sold the most bouquets

610
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,292
will be

611
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,584
our new salespersons.

612
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:23,334
Understand?

613
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:24,417
- Yes. - Yes.

00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,959

Our flowers are on sale.

Have some flowers. Look!

631
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:47,918
Hello, Miss.

632
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:48,667
You obviously

633
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,292
enjoy a high-quality life.

634
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,125
Would you like some flowers?

635
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:50,417
No.

636
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,417
Buy some for your parents!

637
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:51,959
Okay?

638
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:52,999
Buy some flowers for the Double Ninth Festival.

639
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,167
Ma’am! Ma’am!

640
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:55,751
Would you like some flowers for…

641
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,292
For yourself?

642
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,834
Girl, you’re funny!

643
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,584
Look how old I am!

644
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:04,209
Why do I need to buy flowers for myself?

645
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:07,667
Your flowers look great.

646
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,334
But you know what?

647
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,250
Buying flowers is a waste of money.

648
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,125
If our children care for us,

649
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,417
why don’t they buy us

650
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:16,459
fruits, vegetables,

651
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:17,792
or health care products?

652
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,334
They’re substantial, aren’t they?

653
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,042
Yes.

654
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,250
She makes sense.

655
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:27,751
But where can I get

656
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:28,751
fruits or vegetables now?

657
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,792
They are newly made.

658
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,292
Each plant

659
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,083
has its own life track.

660
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,083
As long as you figure out

661
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,751
its unique feature,

662
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:44,375
you’ll find its charm.

663
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:01,667
Would you like some flowers?

664
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,125
For Double Ninth Festival.

665
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:04,667
I’ll take two bouquets.

666
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,501
You want one, huh?

667
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:06,459
Okay.

668
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:08,250
Come on. Thank you.

669
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:09,083
Two bouquets.

670
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,918
Be careful. They’re heavy.

671
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:12,834
I’ll take one.

672
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,626
Be careful.

673
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,751
I want one! I want one!

674
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:15,626
Okay. For all of you.

675
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:16,375
I want one, too.

676
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,167
Okay. Thank you.

677
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:20,999
Now, I’m going to

678
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,999
announce the result.

679
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,626
The best sales

680
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:26,626
for today’s bouquets goes to

681
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:27,834
- Ling Lingqi. - Wait.

682
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,000
She isn’t qualified to be admitted.

683
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,417
Why?

684
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:34,876
Because I’m the designer

685
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,250
for the festival flowers

686
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,792
and the shop manager.

687
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,375
Since you come for the interview,

688
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:40,501
you should know

689
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,167
a salesperson has no right

690
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,626
to change a design.

691
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,584
You broke the rules.

692
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,626
Boss, are your eyes better?

693
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:57,417
They’re fine.

694
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:00,999
What… What is this color?

695
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,292
This?

696
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,501
Thank goodness.

697
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,292
Otherwise, with both DREAM

00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,375
and Wen Guangqi,

699
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:17,125

Mr. Bo, look at this bouquet.

702
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:27,584
How is it modified?

703
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,876
She broke the rules.

704
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,501
How dare an interviewee

705
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,709
exceed her authority

706
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,501
and modify a designer’s design!

707
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,959
What’s wrong with Luo Xiannian?

708
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:43,709
How dare he bother the chairman

709
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:44,792
for such a small thing?

710
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,209
I will call him.

711
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,380
= Luo Xiannian =

712
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:48,167
Wait.

713
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:49,834
I find the innovation

714
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,334
kind of interesting.

715
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:52,375
Yeah.

716
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:53,751
Flowers that don’t sell well

717
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,125
should be modified.

718
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:56,501
The interviewee didn’t exceed her authority.

719
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:57,792
She was quick in mind.

720
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,501
Compared to authority,

721
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,375
flexible creativity is more meaningful.

722
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:05,334
Hello? Hello? Director Zhou?

723
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,375
Hello? Mr. Luo.

724
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:11,792
Okay. I see.

725
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:15,584
Approved by executives,

726
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,417
salespersons for this time

727
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,501
are

728
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:21,459
Ling Lingqi and Wu Qing.

729
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:29,083
Please kindly help with

730
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,167
my daughter’s job.

731
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:31,000
Come on.

732
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:32,709
Don’t rush.

733
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:33,501
Be careful.

734
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:34,167
I’m leaving.

735
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:35,918
Okay. See you.

736
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,334
Hello? Dear. What’s up?

737
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:49,959
You’re admitted?

738
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:55,000
What about my Moutai?

739
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,000
My expensive liquor!

740
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,876
Cheers!

741
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:02,834
Congratulations on me!

742
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:05,334
Qi.

743
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,334
Your father and I thought

744
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,417
you were possessed.

745
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,709
I wasn’t possessed!

746
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,792
I had the spirits of forgetting myself,

747
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:14,918
striving for progress,

748
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,918
and not giving up.

749
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,125
That’s worth learning.

750
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:18,876
Yes.

751
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:19,584
Yes. Yes.

752
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:20,584
This is the most inspirational story

753
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,083
I’ve ever heard this year.

754
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,876
Come on. Baoni. Try the shrimp.

755
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you, aunt.

756
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,042
I have something to say.

757
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,083
It’s your mother’s fault.

758
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,209
She was too worried!

759
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,959
She forced me to find you a job

760
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,083
with Moutai.

761
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,083
See?

762
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,250
- The liquor is wasted. - Here he goes again.

763
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,250
It will take a moment.

764
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:38,209
No way.

765
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:40,167
I must visit Four Eyes again.

766
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,000
I’ll go to his veterinary hospital

767
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:43,459
and get the liquor back.

768
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:44,626
How stingy you are!

769
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:45,501
Dad, how about this?

770
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,375
When I get paid,

771
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:46,918
I’ll buy you

772
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:47,876
a cabinet of Moutai.

773
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:48,959
You can put them all on the shelves.

774
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:50,876
Don’t brag.

775
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:52,501
Do you know

776
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:53,542
how much a bottle costs?

777
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:54,709
Forget it. Forget it.

778
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:55,667
I’ll let you go.

779
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,125
But I appreciate your kindness.

780
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,334
That’s so sweet.

781
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,876
That’s fine, then.

782
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:02,959
Let it go, will you?

783
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:06,667
By the way,

784
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,042
I’m admitted to FlowerPlus.

785
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,709
But not as a florist.

786
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:15,834
You can be transferred, huh?

787
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,709
Besides,

788
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:18,334
you have real strength.

789
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,292
And I will

790
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,959
help you in HR Department.

791
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,918
You’ll finally get your expected job.

792
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:26,292
- Good! - Love you!

793
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,584
For your help,

794
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:28,709
cheers!

795
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:29,250
Cheers.

796
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay!

797
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,876
- Cheers! - Cheers!

798
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:44,125
We’re meeting tomorrow.

799
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,709
How do you feel? Nervous?

800
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,792
Excited?

801
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,876
Good night. Sweet dream!

802
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,501
I wonder

803
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,792
if I’ll dream of you tonight.

804
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,125
Wait a sec.

805
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,876
Today’s exam isn’t

806
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,501
about vegetable bouquets.

807
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:10,209
But I was

808
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:11,167
really admitted to FlowerPlus

809
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:11,999
with the vegetable bouquets.

810
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,375
What’s odd in the dream?

811
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:24,209
I think I always

812
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,042
have a daydream

813
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,250
with the bracelet.

814
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:31,918
I’ll try without it.

815
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:33,834
Good night.

816
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,209
Weird.

817
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,542
I had no dream.

818
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,083
Ling Lingqi.

819
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,876
Time to get up!

820
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,375
Look at the time!

821
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:08,417
On your first day at work,

822
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:10,292
you must leave a good impression on your boss.

823
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:20,334
You’re so early?

824
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:21,918
Coffee.

825
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:22,751
Thank you.

826
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:32,167
Boss, are you going to visit the client

827
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:33,250
in this state?

828
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,250
With the bracelet

829
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:39,876
you bought for me,

830
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,167
I had good sleep lately.

831
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:42,542
But last night,

832
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,042
I was somehow sleepless again.

833
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:46,125
Instead of wasting time in bed,

834
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,876
I’d rather work in the office.

835
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,417
That’s unacceptable!

836
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,626
You always tell us

837
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:54,209
to meet clients in different ways.

838
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:54,751
Right?

839
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,042
In the way the client likes.

840
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,209
Who are you going to meet?

841
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,334
Miss Liu.

842
00:35:58,542 --> 00:35:59,792
She emphasizes the appearance.

843
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:00,501
Come on!

844
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,834
Don’t I look good?

845
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,834
You want the truth?

846
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,459
I think

847
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,792
I’m okay to meet Miss Liu

848
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,292
with this look.

849
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,792
But you look worse!

850
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:16,667
What should I do now?

851
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:25,584
No men are really ugly.

852
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:26,999
They’re just too lazy.

853
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,417
Only when you keep trying

854
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:30,375
can you

855
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:31,876
shorten the distance between us.

856
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:32,626
Got it?

857
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:34,751
Okay?

858
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,250
Okay. Okay. Okay.

859
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:37,501
No.

860
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:39,834
Salary for three months.

861
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,918
Boss, we’re bros.

862
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,876
Don’t try to reward me.

863
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,209
And I don’t want to

864
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,000
get a reward for the first time

865
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:49,167
just because of a facial mask.

866
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,375
You get me wrong.

867
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,083
I mean deduction of salaries.

868
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:57,626
When will we finish?

869
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:58,584
What if employees come to work

870
00:36:58,834 --> 00:36:59,751
and see us?

871
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,542
Dude, it’s half past seven only.

872
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:04,542
Except me,

873
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:05,834
no one will come to work.

874
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,375
You give no bonus to overtime work.

875
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:40,417
FlowerPlus I’ve been dreaming of.

876
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:41,959
Here I am!

877
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:46,167
Hello.

878
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:46,999
Hi, everyone.

879
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:48,751
Hello, manager.

880
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,459
I’m Ling Lingqi, reporting for duty.

881
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,334
It’s not time to celebrate yet.

882
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:55,751
The shop manager

883
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,459
seems like she will abuse her power.

884
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,042
I think I’ll suffer.

885
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,125
Oh, the designer has come.

886
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,292
Since you’re a new recruit,

887
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,292
why don’t you start

888
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:09,250
from the bottom?

889
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:10,375
Okay.

890
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:12,501
Clean up

891
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:13,417
all corners in the shop.

892
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,125
By the way,

893
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,918
pluck thorns in the storehouse.

894
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,667
Remember, do that with your hands.

895
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:25,501
What are you dazing at? Go!

896
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,834
Hello!

897
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:10,792
Hello!

898
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,209
It’s noon.

899
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,667
When is Mr. Bo coming to work?

900
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:15,042
Mr. Bo?

901
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:16,792
This is

902
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,751
a small shop.

903
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:18,918
He’s the president.

904
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,626
He stays in the headquarters.

905
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:21,999
Doesn’t he come to the shop?

906
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,209
You know what?

907
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,000
I’ve been

908
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,626
working here for more than two years.

909
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,125
But I’ve never seen him.

910
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,375
You want to see Mr. Bo?

911
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,375
There’s a television out there.

912
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,250
You can see him on TV.

913
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,626
Seriously?

914
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:50,667
Let’s get to

915
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:51,375
Term 9.

916
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:52,542
You mustn’t make profits

917
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,250
with Company’s intellectual property

918
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,334
or related information.

919
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:56,667
And attention.

920
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:57,751
Don’t have unauthorized use

921
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,375
of intellectual property or related information

922
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:00,501
belonging to someone else.

923
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,792
Without permission,

924
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,751
you mustn’t make, copy,

925
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,167
store, keep

926
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,667
or destroy business secrets.

927
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,959
Okay. I’m done.

928
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,626
Okay. So much for

929
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:17,792
today’s meeting.

930
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,459
- You shall go to your own departments - Hello.

931
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,417
for the on-boarding.

932
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:22,876
I have something

933
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:24,626
to tell you personally

934
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:25,375
- later. - OK.

935
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:26,375
Thank you, everyone.

936
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,334
Dismiss.

937
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:35,334
Hello. You…

938
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,626
Since I was in the middle school,

939
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:41,959
I’ve been

940
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:43,209
a total hottie.

941
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,876
I’ve hurt a lot of

942
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,459
ignorant boys.

943
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:51,501
I know.

944
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,626
You’re young

945
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:55,792
with surplus hormone.

946
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,918
And you can’t help having a crush on me.

947
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,667
I can understand.

948
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,542
But I have to warn you.

949
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,167
You mustn’t go beyond

950
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,542
the imagination over me.

951
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:10,667
If you dare to

952
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:11,751
take action,

953
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,125
or act indecently

954
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,792
to me,

955
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:18,876
you’ll be sorry!

956
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:25,083
I just want to tell you that

957
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,584
your dress is unzipped.

958
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:31,417
And everyone saw that.

959
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,209
I found that embarrassing.

960
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:14,959
