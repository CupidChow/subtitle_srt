51
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,083
But I was too young

52
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,751
and I wasn’t careful enough.

53
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,083
Lu Yunqing had something on me.

54
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:53,334
Mr. Yin!

55
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,751
She met Yin Changhe in the shop

56
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,292
for a secret discussion,

57
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:56,959
Don’t run!

58
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,792
trying to tell on me.

59
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,918
Mom!

60
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:19,083
Mom!

61
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:21,918
Mom!

62
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,209
Mom!

63
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:32,999
Mom!

64
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:34,292
Hai!

65
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:35,167
- Mom! - Hai!

66
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,125
Help me, Mom! Mom!

67
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,125
Hai!

68
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,417
Mom, help!

69
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,250
Hai!

70
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,626
- Help me, Mom! - Hai!

71
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,000
Help me, Mom!

72
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:44,584
Move!

73
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,667
We got people inside! Hurry!

74
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,083
Help them! Hurry!

75
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,626
Mom!

76
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,459
Move!

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,626
Mom! Mom!

78
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,709
Mom!

79
00:02:58,999 --> 00:02:59,876
Mom!

80
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,626
I thought that was it.

81
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:57,876
Unexpectedly,

82
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,999
Yin Changhe

83
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,959
was burned to death

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,292
in the fire.

85
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,167
Lu Yunqing

86
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,209
has also disappeared since then.

87
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,709
This is what they get

88
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,584
for not helping.

89
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,999
Even God helped me!

90
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,167
So,

91
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,667
you made up the story about

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,542
Lu Yunqing killing my father,

93
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:40,999
so that

94
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,042
Bo Hai and I could become enemies

95
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,542
and kill each other.

96
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,999
They killed my son.

97
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,000
Then I

98
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,459
will let their sons

99
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,375
kill each other

100
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,999
and wish they were dead.

101
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:18,751
So,

102
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,167
I’ve always hated

103
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,334
and trusted the wrong people.

104
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,501
You know too late.

105
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,209
I really want to see

106
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,542
how Yin Changhe and Lu Yunqing

107
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,000
would feel

108
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,834
if they saw this.

109
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:44,999
William.

110
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,918
You’re insane!

111
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:49,876
You did

112
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:50,918
such evil things

113
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:52,709
for your son!

114
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,751
Are you out of your mind?

115
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,167
Liu Yingjie! Let go of me!

116
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,167
Let go of me!

117
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,626
Let go of me!

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,667
Liu Yingjie, you bastard!

119
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:12,667
You want to hit me?

120
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,417
Too bad you can’t.

121
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,250
You’re just like your dad.

122
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,459
A loser.

123
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,083
All these years,

124
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,792
I’ve been fighting

125
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,792
my anger,

126
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,334
my nausea,

127
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,209
treating you like my son,

128
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,667
hoping to see this.

129
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,459
Look at you now,

130
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,459
lying on the ground

131
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,083
like a dog.

132
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,501
How cheap you are!

133
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,417
I haven’t finished my drink.

134
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,083
Here’s to you.

135
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,501
To you and Bo Hai for

136
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,626
helping me

137
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,125
get my revenge.

138
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,292
And to your father,

139
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,209
who deserved to die.

140
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,999
Now that I’ve taken this step,

141
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:32,751
I don’t care about anything.

142
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,000
Well then,

143
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,542
every day from now on,

144
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,167
we’re enemies.

145
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,834
Whether you can take revenge

146
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,459
depends on

147
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,999
if you can abandon everything for that.

148
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:50,751
Lu Yunqing

149
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,250
must be responsible

150
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,667
for my father’s death.

151
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,000
But that was a generation ago.

152
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:57,834
What does this have to do

153
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:58,918
with you and Bo Hai?

154
00:09:59,042 --> 00:09:59,542
Why would you do something

155
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:00,709
that hurts everyone, including yourself?

156
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,709
The son shall pay for his mother’s debt.

157
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,292
It feels so good

158
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,584
to see my enemy in trouble.

159
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:08,501
Will you stop

160
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,501
if I agree to

161
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,250
be with you?

162
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,125
You think you can get

163
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:18,626
what you want this way?

164
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,792
I already have.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,125
I’m gonna make you pay

166
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,501
for what you did to Qi.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,918
When you beat Bo Hai

168
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,792
and he loses everything,

169
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,250
Ling Lingqi will realize

170
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:31,959
who is the best man

171
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,000
for her.

172
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,000
I even helped

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,209
such a man like you!

174
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,375
I never hated myself

175
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,667
like I do now!

176
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,250
Don’t let me see you again!

177
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,292
I’m sorry, Qi.

178
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,209
I don’t have the courage to see you

179
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,292
or to apologize.

180
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,876
I just know it today

181
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,834
that the belief and ideal

182
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,709
I have been holding

183
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:15,584
is just

184
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,501
a lie made by Liu Yingjie.

185
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,667
All I did

186
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,292
was digging my own grave.

187
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,250
I’m just a big joke.

188
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:31,501
Qi.

189
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,751
I don’t expect you to forgive me.

190
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:35,959
I don’t deserve

191
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,209
your forgiveness.

192
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,250
But I wish

193
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,918
it wasn’t so hard for you.

194
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,417
If possible,

195
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,167
I wish God would

196
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,375
let me bear

197
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,584
all the pain alone.

198
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,417
I’m sorry, Qi.

199
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:56,999
Take care.

200
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,667
What you think of as desperation

201
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,375
may be full of hope

202
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,501
around its corner.

203
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:30,834
What is hope?

204
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,000
Hope is flower.

205
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,417
Hope is warmth.

206
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,417
Hope is scattered light

207
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,584
in the darkness of despair.

208
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,417
Hope is being in hell

209
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,834
but having access to heaven.

210
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,250
Even when the world is full of hate,

211
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,709
keep the faith.

212
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,999
Even if the world is full of despair,

213
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,417
keep the dream.

214
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,292
Qi, where are you going?

215
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,000
Going to work.

216
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:54,792
Work?

217
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,918
Didn’t you quit your job a long time ago?

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,083
Didn’t your company...

219
00:13:58,334 --> 00:13:59,834
Work is good.

220
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,125
Young people should be positive

221
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,667
and full of positive energy.

222
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,125
I’ll buy you some breakfast.

223
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,501
No, I’ll eat on the way.

224
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,542
Look at her,

225
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,459
is this a good thing or a bad thing?

226
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:16,834
Couldn’t tell.

227
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:17,959
We used to

228
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:18,709
report problems

229
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:19,918
like this directly.

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,834
Good morning, everyone.

231
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,000
Qi?

232
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,709
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:26,959
Working.

234
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,626
I left my resignation letter

235
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:29,959
with Director Luo.

236
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:30,959
Get it back for me, would you?

237
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:33,751
Why are there so few of us?

238
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:34,667
Where are the others?

239
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,292
Yesterday, when DREAM took over the company,

240
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:39,417
it put everyone

241
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:40,584
on hold.

242
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,292
Some colleagues have lost faith in the future

243
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,417
of the company,

244
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,083
so they just stopped coming.

245
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,083
What about Director Zhou and Secretary Chen?

246
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,000
Don’t they care about this?

247
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:50,709
They

248
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,542
didn’t show up today, either.

249
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:58,792
I’m going out for a minute.

250
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,792
Cabbage, broccoli,

251
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,459
vermicelli and mutton.

252
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:15,876
We could have

253
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,959
hot pot tonight.

254
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:17,751
I’m OK with it.

255
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,167
Do you want clear soup pot

256
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,542
or spicy hot pot?

257
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,042
Spicy.

258
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:22,334
Okay, I’ll make it for you.

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,709
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,584
I’m here to take the deserters back.

261
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:49,751
Being Mrs. Mo

262
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:50,999
has certainly made a difference.

263
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,417
You’ve been so loyal

264
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,000
to DREAM and Mo Nan.

265
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:56,417
You even start to do

266
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:57,792
human resources’ job.

267
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,751
Yeah.

268
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,334
I never saw you take the company

269
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,292
so seriously before.

270
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,459
I’m not Mrs. Mo.

271
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:06,918
From now on,

272
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,375
I have nothing to do with Mo Nan.

273
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,876
I’m here for Bo Hai.

274
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:13,000
Bo Hai?

275
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:14,876
He doesn’t even want the company.

276
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:15,501
What’s the point of

277
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,667
us going to work?

278
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:17,584
I’m starting to think

279
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:18,667
everything is meaningless,

280
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,167
except that living in the moment

281
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:20,959
is meaningful.

282
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,000
Every day, we go shopping, buy food,

283
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,334
make hot pot, and watch TV.

284
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,167
How good life is!

285
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:27,999
Ling Lingqi.

286
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,667
We’re a little tired.

287
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,250
Let’s go.

288
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,083
Xinyan!

289
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,959
Wait a second.

290
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:38,959
Well,

291
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,709
whoever the major stockholder is now,

292
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,292
FlowerPlus is still

293
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,751
the fruit of you and Bo Hai.

294
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,083
If the company’s gone,

295
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,501
we can take it back.

296
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,542
But if the company dies,

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,292
everything dies.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,709
Besides,

299
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:52,250
I’m sure

300
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,501
Bo Hai will come back.

301
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:54,918
Until he gets back,

302
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,375
let’s hold FlowerPlus together,

303
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:57,501
so that he can see

304
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,459
his career is still here,

305
00:16:58,792 --> 00:16:59,626
his team is still here,

306
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:00,834
and everything is still here.

307
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,292
The company is run by William now.

308
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,042
We don’t want to

309
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,584
work for him.

310
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,292
That’s why

311
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,667
the company needs you more.

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,167
We can’t have DREAM

313
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,000
run around the company,

314
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:11,918
destroying things.

315
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,709
I’m leaving.

316
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,083
Director Zhou, Secretary Chen,

317
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,334
I’ll see you at work.

318
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,375
Whose side

319
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,999
is Ling Lingqi on?

320
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,876
I’m also confused.

321
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:42,709
Statistically,

322
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:44,083
it’s already moved on to the next step.

323
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,209
Lu Baoni,

324
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:46,792
I was just on my way to see you.

325
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,501
This is a list of DREAM executives assigned

326
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,250
to FlowerPlus.

327
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:50,751
Patch it through to

328
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:51,501
human resources.

329
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:52,125
Okay.

330
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,167
Wait, Secretary Wu.

331
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:58,292
What’s wrong?

332
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:01,792
Why isn’t there Mo Nan

333
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,834
on this dispatch list?

334
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:03,918
Mo Nan?

335
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,167
He’s been fired.

336
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,501
Why?

337
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,834
Do I really have to explain it to you?

338
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:12,501
A turncoat like him

339
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,626
should have been fired

340
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,709
a long time ago.

341
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:15,834
Out of sight, out of mind,

342
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,417
or I’ll beat him every time I see him.

343
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,820
= Mo Nan =

344
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,501
A few minutes of your time.

345
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,375
I need to talk to you about something.

346
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,918
Anyone absent from work with no reason today

347
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,209
will be fired.

348
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,709
Go, pack up their stuff

349
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:54,542
and put it in storage.

350
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,209
Yes.

351
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,542
I want every office desk clear.

352
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:57,292
Yes!

353
00:18:57,876 --> 00:18:58,709
On what grounds?

354
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,292
These are private property.

355
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:00,999
You have no right to move them.

356
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:01,459
Wait a minute.

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,918
It’s their personal property.

358
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,042
But the company pays

359
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,042
for the work space.

360
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,626
Do you think the company has the right
to take it back?

361
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,417
You’ve gone too far.

362
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,709
If you can’t take it,

363
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:16,584
you can quit.

364
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,209
I’ll tell

365
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,042
human resources

366
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:21,167
to process your resignation first,

367
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,250
and you won’t have to wait in line.

368
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,000
From now on, anyone who

369
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,375
doesn’t show up is considered to be resigning.

370
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,042
And we’re not looking to

371
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:32,834
fill those vacant positions.

372
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,083
The rest of you

373
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,751
will do all the work.

374
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:36,626
Of course,

375
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,417
you can resign all together.

376
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,918
The company would never ask you to stay.

377
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:41,626
When everyone’s gone,

378
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:42,959
how’s the company gonna run?

379
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:43,959
Are you deliberately trying

380
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,250
to shut down the company?

381
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,542
The blame for this can only be placed

382
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,459
on Bo Hai’s previous mismanagement,

383
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,083
which resulted in unexcused absences.

384
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:53,999
If the company were to fail,

385
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,834
it would have nothing to do with us.

386
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,542
Unexcused absences?

387
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,042
We were out of town on business,

388
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,209
according to the company’s plan.

389
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,792
We’re back, aren’t we?

390
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:05,417
Yeah, it’s on record of the HR Department.

391
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:06,959
All of these departments

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,167
have outgoing applications.

393
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,751
They travel to exhibitions,

394
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,000
visit clients,

395
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,792
or inspect suppliers.

396
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,918
Director Luo.

397
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:16,292
Why didn’t you say something before?

398
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,125
Why didn’t you ask before?

399
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:20,125
Besides,

400
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,209
I’ve got a lot of work to do here.

401
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,000
I’m so busy that I can’t even think straight.

402
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,792
Is it my fault?

403
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,918
That’s right.

404
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,250
We’re all in the same company.

405
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:30,000
We see each other all the time.

406
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,250
There’s still time.

407
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,209
If DREAM’s headquarter finds out

408
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,209
Mr. Liu is firing people at will,

409
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,542
it won’t be good, will it?

410
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,250
What are you talking about?

411
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:45,959
Boss.

412
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,667
Secretary Wu is just doing his job.

413
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,584
Maybe the way he said it

414
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:00,542
was a little inappropriate.

415
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,125
A misunderstanding.

416
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:03,959
Let’s get back to work.

417
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,042
Now that Mr. Liu has spoken,

418
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,167
let’s all work hard

419
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,167
from now on.

420
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,042
There are company rules.

421
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:14,667
We all have to do

422
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:15,918
our jobs.

423
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,375
No more tricks from now on.

424
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:27,667
All right.

425
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:28,959
Everybody back to work.

426
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,792
Fortunately, you all came back,

427
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:35,751
or we’d have fallen

428
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:36,918
for William’s trick.

429
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:39,417
We didn’t come back

430
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,584
to help you.

431
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,167
We did it to help Bo Hai,

432
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:43,542
to help the cause we

433
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,584
fought so hard for.

434
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,417
You traitor don’t need to thank us.

435
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:48,375
Stop it.

436
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:52,334
It’s all right.

437
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:53,999
It’s good to have everyone back.

438
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,334
Even though Ling Lingqi

439
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,501
failed Bo Hai before,

440
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:02,918
I think she did

441
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,375
the right thing today.

442
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:05,375
So what?

443
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:06,417
A traitor is a traitor.

444
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:07,709
At the end of the day,

445
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:08,584
Ling Lingqi is not

446
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:09,667
a bad person.

447
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,209
You are simple-minded.

448
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,918
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

449
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:14,918
After what she’s done

450
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:15,667
to us and Bo Hai,

451
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,667
can you guarantee

452
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:17,584
she won’t do the same next time?

453
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,959
She’s probably up to

454
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:19,999
something again.

455
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:20,918
Director Zhou.

456
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,042
Secretary Chen.

457
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,751
Actually, you’re wrong about Qi.

458
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:50,501
Jumble-beads

459
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,000
have an elegant temperament

460
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:54,834
and fresh smell,

461
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,459
reminiscent of a well-tended

462
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,918
and beautiful summer garden.

463
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,667
Are you looking at me

464
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,042
or the flowers?

465
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,209
I wish your heart be but like mine,

466
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,834
then not in vain for you I pine.

467
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,876
The flowers are in full bloom,

468
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,292
but where are you?

469
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,042
As you can see,

470
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,709
the new theme for this season

471
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:20,417
is called

472
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,542
“waiting to bloom”.

473
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,209
I used  autumn-color platycodon grandiflorum,

474
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,584
hot tea roses

475
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:25,709
hydrangeas,

476
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,292
and pointed eucalyptus and sabah leaves

477
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,209
as an embellishment

478
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,501
to create a

479
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:30,667
demure and mature

480
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:31,999
yet romantic feeling.

481
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:34,709
In the past, the theme of the bouquet

482
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:36,209
was determined by Mr. Bo,

483
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:37,792
and Design Department was responsible
for the delivery.

484
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,584
Yeah, who are you to decide

485
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:40,792
next season’s theme on your own?

486
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:41,626
Yeah.

487
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,876
At least it should be decided

488
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,584
by Deputy Director Wu.

489
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:44,792
Yeah.

490
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:46,709
Why did she give the order this time?

491
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,042
She really thinks she’s the landlady?

492
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:50,751
Quiet, all of you!

493
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:51,876
Is this still a company?

494
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,999
Or a free market!

495
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,417
Do you have any discipline?

496
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:55,751
Ling Lingqi is the flower art manager

497
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:57,501
promoted by Mr. Bo himself.

498
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,542
Her strength

499
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,584
is there for all to see.

500
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,584
Who else is

501
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,542
more qualified to be in charge of

502
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,417
flower art creation than her?

503
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,292
Who else?

504
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:07,626
Guys,

505
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,209
we’ve all seen what’s going on

506
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,375
in this company.

507
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,959
At times like this,

508
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:14,042
we must stick together,

509
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,167
instead of fighting among ourselves.

510
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:18,918
Let’s just keep our heads in the game,

511
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:19,667
okay?

512
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:21,918
Go on, Ling Lingqi.

513
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,209
Thank you all for your support.

514
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,542
This season’s new product handbook

515
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,375
is already in the works.

516
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,626
If you have any questions,

517
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:33,667
just ask.

518
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,125
I’m open to it.

519
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:36,626
This is my first time

520
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:37,751
in this position.

521
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,667
All colleagues and predecessors,

522
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,584
I hope you will give me good advice.

523
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:52,501
Thanks for that.

524
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:54,834
You’re welcome.

525
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,501
This is the key card to Bo Hai’s house.

526
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:01,542
You can keep it

527
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:02,584
until he gets back.

528
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:03,834
Ling Lingqi.

529
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,542
We know what happened.

530
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:06,751
We were wrong about you.

531
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,417
I can’t be

532
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:11,751
the only one apologizing.

533
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:12,459
Xinyan!

534
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:13,417
I’ll deal with her at home.

535
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,340
= Mo Nan =

536
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,083
Hello, Mo Nan?

537
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:30,876
It’s me, Ji Bin.

538
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:33,542
Ji Bin? How could it be you?

539
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,375
Can you come over and help me

540
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,334
talk to Mr. Mo?

541
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:55,876
Mo Nan.

542
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:04,125
Are you here to mock me?

543
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,918
I do look ridiculous.

544
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,125
All I wanted to do was avenging my father,

545
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:15,834
but only to be used by my enemies

546
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,542
for so many years and

547
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,292
became his revenge tool.

548
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,334
It’s just that you’re too kind.

549
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:26,999
Because of your kindness,

550
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:28,751
you were deceived.

551
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,417
Because I’m the stupidest man

552
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,709
in the world.

553
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,167
I’m the one

554
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,292
who ruined Bo Hai and  FlowerPlus.

555
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,918
And I hurt the one

556
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:47,999
I care about the most.

557
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:49,876
It’s not your fault.

558
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,167
It’s the people who lied to you.

559
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:54,334
Mo Nan, why are you

560
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,959
so hard on yourself?

561
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,334
Bo Hai is gone.

562
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:01,459
Qi…

563
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,501
She hates me.

564
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,167
If my dad were still alive,

565
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,626
he’d be very disappointed in me.

566
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,834
No one will ever forgive me.

567
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:21,417
And I’m not

568
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:22,918
gonna forgive myself.

569
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,584
Will you please pull yourself together?

570
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:39,918
Pull myself together?

571
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:41,751
Baoni.

572
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,667
People like me don’t have the right

573
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:44,751
to pull ourselves together.

574
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,292
People like me

575
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:49,876
should be miserable

576
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,167
and corrupt for the rest of our lives!

577
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:54,417
That way,

578
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,292
I might feel better.

579
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,375
You might feel better,

580
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,876
but what about the others?

581
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,417
What about Qi and Bo Hai?

582
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,334
Will they feel better

583
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,999
because you’re like this?

584
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,417
Yeah, you’re miserable.

585
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,375
But they’re more miserable than you are!

586
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:09,959
Mo Nan.

587
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,083
People who do the wrong things

588
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:11,709
don’t deserve

589
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,918
to be decadent like you do.

590
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,584
What you need to do now

591
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:15,709
is making amends.

592
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,167
A man must do what he must do.

593
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,626
You made a mistake, you change.

594
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:23,167
You failed, you start again.

595
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:24,834
Instead of hiding out here drinking.

596
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,209
What kind of man are you!

597
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,918
If you pull yourself together,

598
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,334
I will do everything I can to help you.

599
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,542
But if you continue giving up like this,

600
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,125
let’s just say I was wrong about you.

601

By the way,

It’s been a year.

679
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,959
Where are you?

680
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,709
How are you?

681
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:44,459
In the past two months,

682
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:45,667
sales in North China

683
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,834
have fallen slightly.

684
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,667
We found

685
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,501
there’s a supply chain issue.

686
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:50,792
But we’ve already asked the Production Department

687
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:51,417
to raise

688
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,792
the number of suppliers.

689
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,501
It’s not the suppliers.

690
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,209
It’s the cold-chain logistics.

691
00:35:59,083 --> 00:35:59,709
It’s true that the cold stores

692
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:00,709
are not well-distributed.

693
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,459
Supply costs are too high

694
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:02,459
in the northern markets

695
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:03,709
and deliveries are not timely.

696
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,167
Hold a meeting with the Production Department

697
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,417
this afternoon to discuss the problem.

698
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,667
All right, I’ll notice all departments.

699
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,292
Director Ling.

700
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,083
Something wrong with the newly arrived flowers!

701
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:25,250
These are small and wilted.

702
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:26,667
There’re even worm-eaten marks.

703
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,667
Our Design Department

704
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:28,959
ordered Class A flowers,

705
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,542
but these flowers are not even C class!

706
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,209
How did your Production Department do the work?

707
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:33,999
That’s Mr. Liu’s order.

708
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:35,959
He said it was to save money.

709
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,542
Okay, that’s enough.

710
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:44,417
Don’t send

711
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,459
any of these flowers to the shop.

712
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:46,959
Let’s keep this between us.

713
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:47,751
I’ll take care of it.

714
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:50,751
The company opened

715
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,125
more than 20 new shops in a year,

716
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,584
but the cost of the single shop is high

717
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,042
while the efficiency is low.

718
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,334
So, these 20 more shops

719
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:57,375
have not brought

720
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,918
a rise in market share at all.

721
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,292
In the meantime, we’ve borrowed

722
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:01,167
a lot of money from the bank,

723
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,501
and this kind of rapid expansion

724
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,209
of the company

725
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,667
will bring huge operational risks.

726
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,501
The expansion strategy

727
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,042
is the board’s decision.

728
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,292
As a marketing director,

729
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:12,876
you don’t have to worry.

730
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:18,292
Mr. Liu.

731
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,501
This is the third time this year to lower

732
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:21,792
the purchase grade of flower materials.

733
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,000
The quality of this batch of flowers

734
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,125
is surprisingly poor.

735
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,709
These flowers

736
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,000
cannot represent our FlowerPlus.

737
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,000
The company is in difficulty now.

738
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:30,959
The whole point of the downgrade

739
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,999
is to keep costs in check.

740
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,167
If your Design Department thinks of something,

741
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,083
sales can go up the same, right?

742
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,250
No Design Department can

743
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,542
use inferior materials

744
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,626
to trick consumers.

745
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:43,959
Every downgrade

746
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:44,918
has a significant impact

747
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:45,626
on sales.

748
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:46,417
If we keep doing like this,

749
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,709
FlowerPlus’s brand will be ruined.

750
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:48,417
Miss Ling,

751
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,834
you got the point.

752
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,918
Why are we in difficulty?

753
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,999
It’s because the cost is too high.

754
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:56,792
How are we gonna fix it?

755
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,792
Other than downgrading,

756
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:02,709
there’s only one way to go.

757
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:07,083
Cut the staff.

758
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:09,709
Some staff

759
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,667
do the work of four people.

760
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,125
Some staff do nothing

761
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,334
but make trouble.

762
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,125
Cutting staff isn’t about number,

763
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,459
but about cutting the worthless.

764
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,083
I’ll go on business in person.

765
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:19,876
Find the supplier

766
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:21,042
with good quality and low price

767
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:21,959
and try to solve

768
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,042
the problem of purchase cost.

769
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:31,959
As the saying goes,

770
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,876
a grown girl can’t be kept at home.

771
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,083
Keeping her at home

772
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:36,626
will grow hatred.

773
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:38,334
Your daughter

774
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:39,501
is still single?

775
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,417
You don’t need to worry

776
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:43,626
about my daughter.

777
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:47,751
I heard she got a promotion

778
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:48,709
in the company recently.

779
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,667
Did she get a raise, too?

780
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:52,876
She got a promotion

781
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,709
but didn’t get a salary raise.

782
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,834
Not at all?

783
00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:03,982
= We don’t go to the hospital… =

784
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,120
To tell you the truth,

785
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:06,375
your daughter

786
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,000
is really average.

787
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,918
Very average.

788
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:09,876
But,

789
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:11,250
my little boy

790
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:12,918
likes her.

791
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,876
Wait, wait, wait.

792
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,292
Likes who?

793
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:19,417
As long as Qi

794
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,167
can be obedient and sensible,

795
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,167
and more importantly, be nice to my son,

796
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,292
I’ll settle for

797
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:26,209
them going out first.

798
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:29,876
Li Lijun.

799
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,751
You mean

800
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,542
my daughter

801
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,209
is going to date your son,

802
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:35,584
right?

803
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:36,167
Yeah.

804
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,042
I ask you,

805
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,042
does she

806
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:41,709
know about this?

807
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:43,167
We don’t

808
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,667
need to talk to Qi.

809
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:46,000
Considering my son

810
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,542
likes your daughter,

811
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,459
she’s already lucky enough.

812
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,000
I’m telling you,

813
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,459
you won’t get a second chance.

814
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:54,918
Li Lijun.

815
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,042
Let me tell you something.

816
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,834
My daughter is doing just fine.

817
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,167
She doesn’t need a relationship.

818
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,083
No need.

819
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,083
As for

820
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,459
when she’s in a relationship

821
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,125
or with whom, how,

822
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,167
whether or not,

823
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,626
it’s all up to her.

824
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,542
If Qi says

825
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:11,209
she is never getting married,

826
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:12,459
as long as she’s happy,

827
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,334
we’re happy, okay?

828
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,459
Here’s to your trip

829
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,667
and success.

830
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:22,459
We’ll root for you. Cheers!

831
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:23,167
Thank you.

832
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:31,292
Guess

833
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,584
what I saw today.

834
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:33,542
What?

835
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,209
I saw Wu Fan hiding in the warehouse,

836
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,292
secretly trying on

837
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,792
the immortal flower necklace

838
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,626
we made for the client.

839
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:41,959
He tried on a necklace?

840
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,375
He has such a hobby?

841
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,334
Did you film it?

842
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,000
Group sharing tomorrow morning, 8 a.m. sharp.

843
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,417
From the directors to the cleaners,

844
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,083
I’ll make sure everyone gets a copy.

845
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,000
Good! Good!

846
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,626
Something this exciting

847
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,209
has to be sent to Bo Hai.

848
00:40:58,918 --> 00:41:00,000
What if he sees it

849
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,083
and wants to come back?

850
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,292
We’re all thinking of him.

851
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:19,626
Is he thinking of us?

852
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:21,584
A year has passed.

853
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,667
He just disappeared and no messages at all

854
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:24,792
till today.

855
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,042
We watch the company for him,

856
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:30,375
and think of him as a friend.

857
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,626
What does he think of us?

858
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,584
No matter how long he’s away from the company,

859
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,459
I’ll always watch it for him.

860
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,375
If he’s away for the rest of his life,

861
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:47,999
I will watch it for the rest of my life.

862
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:04,999
I have a business trip tomorrow.

863
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:05,834
I gotta go.

864
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,375
They’re paying for this, ma’am.

865
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:12,792
She’s a director now,

866
00:42:12,918 --> 00:42:14,000
how can she still be so stingy?

867
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:23,000
She’s changed a lot this year.

868
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:24,918
Yeah.

869
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,626
She used to tell me

870
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:28,834
everything that was bothering her.

871
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:30,876
But now,

872
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,918
she doesn’t tell me anything.

873
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,209
She’s holding it in.

874
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:40,626
I haven’t seen her happy for long.

875
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,167
Don’t you think she is

876
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,584
more and more like Bo Hai?
