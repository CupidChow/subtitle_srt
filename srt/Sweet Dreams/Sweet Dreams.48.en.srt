176
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:17,918
Yes, the meeting is going on.

177
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,083
That’s obvious.

178
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,209
They must come for peace.

179
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,959
For mercy, maybe.

180
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,667
Based on all investigations,

181
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,959
we think

182
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,420
DREAM has done a business fraud

183
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,083
= Flower Art Association =
DREAM has done a business fraud

184
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,999
= Flower Art Association =
and illicit competition.

185
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,667
What they have done

186
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:40,959
seriously interfered with

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,083
the normal operation of FlowerPlus

188
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:43,709
and harmed the healthy development of

189
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:44,584
the whole industry.

190
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,959
We will rigorously deal with

191
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,334
persons in charge.

192
00:08:58,584 --> 00:08:59,125
Here comes Mr. Bo.

193
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,792
It’s okay even if DREAM doesn’t help.

194
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,959
We still have a way out.

195
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:17,834
As I expected,

196
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:19,751
Liu Yingjie is abandoned.

197
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,959
Foreigners at DREAM’s headquarters

198
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,250
think that

199
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:24,209
Liu Yingjie made all the strategies

200
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:26,042
carried out in China

201
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,459
and he shall take

202
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,542
all the blame personally.

203
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,125
DREAM decides to sell

204
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,125
all the stocks of

205
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,083
FlowerPlus

206
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,334
and adjusts its global strategy.

207
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:36,876
Great!

208
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:38,709
Great!

209
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:40,375
Awesome!

210
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:50,959
Mo Nan.

211
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,083
What’s... What’s the result?

212
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,042
Good news

213
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:04,792
and bad news.

214
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,918
Which do you want first?

215
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,250
Good news.

216
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,042
The good news is

217
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,417
since I reported myself

218
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,959
and apologized actively,

219
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,667
I’m punished to leave this industry for five years

220
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,709
and pay the forfeit.

221
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,125
It’s the lightest penalty.

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,125
What about the bad news?

223
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,626
The bad news is

224
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:43,999
you’ll have to pay for

225
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,417
tonight’s big meal!

226
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,667
Annoying!

227
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,501
Since I must pay the fine,

228
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,209
I will sell all stocks of

229
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,501
FlowerPlus

230
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,334
and use up all my savings.

231
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,292
I’m going to be

232
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,375
a poor man!

233
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:03,542
But to me,

234
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,375
this is the real good news.

235
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,083
It feels so good!

236
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:11,334
Now you’re the man

237
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,667
you used to be,

238
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:15,209
I mean, our good friend.

239
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,334
Baoni, do you know

240
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,459
where I can rent a cheap room?

241
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:33,000
Let me think about it.

242
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,542
You know what?

243
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,334
I’ve got an idea.

244
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:38,334
It’s cold in winter and hot in summer.

245
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:40,918
It has a leaking roof.

246
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,584
But it gives a wide vision

247
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:44,751
with a wonderful scene.

248
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,751
Most importantly, it’s cheap.

249
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:48,959
Would you consider it?

250
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,542
I think it’s good, too.

251
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,375
But I wonder

252
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,000
if the old couple downstairs

253
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:53,999
are easy to get on with.

254
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,375
Will they bully me?

255
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:03,542
I’ll always treat you

256
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,834
as my good friend

257
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,209
and always stay with you.

258
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:09,792
Maybe one day,

259
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,542
you will stop

260
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,501
and look at me carefully.

261
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,125
Someday, I believe.

262
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,209
To be honest,

263
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,834
I can’t remember

264
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,083
when I talked

265
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,250
and laughed with you

266
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,417
last time.

267
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,209
Over the past year,

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,667
FlowerPlus and I have changed a lot.

269
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:41,667
In the past,

270
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,542
I used to be

271
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,459
Chomper,

272
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,292
who was cruel and merciless.

273
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:51,751
I was a working machine

274
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:52,792
who cared for nothing else.

275
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:54,918
It was you,

276
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:56,999
who melted

277
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,167
the ice in me

278
00:12:58,999 --> 00:12:59,584
and made me feel

279
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:00,959
the warmth from life

280
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:02,918
and the goodwill and kindness

281
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,584
from this world.

282
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:08,000
Except work,

283
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,292
we still have pancakes,

284
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
sunset glow at dusk,

285
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,501
and the fragrance of flowers in the air.

286
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,125
How long has it been

287
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:19,751
since we last

288
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:20,792
enjoyed this world?

289
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,375
Because of my twisted sense of value,

290
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:25,999
I know,

291
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,167
I made you work

292
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:28,542
in a depressing way.

293
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,292
I’d like to apologize to you.

294
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,000
But luckily,

295
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:34,792
it’s not too late.

296
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:36,792
Before the sun sets

297
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,292
and before the passion cools down,

298
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,792
go enjoy your lives.

299
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:43,876
Today,

300
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,250
a day off for everyone!

301
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,334
Terrific!

302
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:27,501
Boss.

303
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:28,792
What? What did they say?

304
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,083
They haven’t even replied.

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,459
I tried to call them

306
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:32,584
through the network phone.

307
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:34,292
But they didn’t answer.

308
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,083
Damn the foreigners!

309
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,626
They abandoned me!

310
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:41,417
Boss.

311
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,334
What should we do then?

312
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:46,709
I won’t lose.

313
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:52,083
I can’t be defeated.

314
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,876
Have you ever imagined

315
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:57,876
we would be in a relationship

316
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,250
someday?

317
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:01,959
How narcissistic you are!

318
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,334
I’ve thought of many ways

319
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,459
to meet you

320
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,292
and many ways

321
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,542
you fall in love with me.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,209
But I don’t think that’s imagination.

323
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,375
I think you sound

324
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:12,459
more narcissistic.

325
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,042
I knew from the very beginning that

326
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,292
I would be your girlfriend.

327
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:17,959
Because I know

328
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,834
dreams may betray me,

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,999
but efforts won’t.

330
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:31,375
Qi.

331
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,250
Thank you for meeting me.

332
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,459
If I hadn’t met you,

333
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,709
I don’t think I would meet

334
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,125
my Miss Right.

335
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,709
So many clovers!

336
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,209
A four-leaf clover!

337
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:06,792
I’ll make a wish!

338
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,375
What wish did you make?

339
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:18,834
I won’t tell you.

340
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,167
If you don’t,

341
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,083
how can I realize your wish?

342
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,083
Do you know

343
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:26,959
what a four-leaf clover represents?

344
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,042
You have no idea, do you?

345
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,083
A four-leaf clover represents

346
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,334
a dream coming true.

347
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:39,999
A dream coming true?

348
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:13,792
In this world,

349
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,959
there are six billion people.

350
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:18,083
In a man’s life,

351
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,417
he approximately meets

352
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,709
29.2 million people.

353
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,083
The probability of meeting someone

354
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,792
is four in one hundred thousand.

355
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,542
The probability of knowing someone

356
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,334
is five in ten million.

357
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,834
The probability of understanding someone

358
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,959
is three in one billion.

359
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,918
And the probability of falling in love

360
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,000
is too hard to be predicted.

361
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:43,667
Anyway,

362
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,209
it’s extremely low.

363
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,459
This shop

364
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:39,542
has a nice decoration.

365
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,751
So beautiful!

366
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,125
Does it look good?

367
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,667
The exhibition stand

368
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:54,501
looks good!

369
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:57,999
I don’t mean that.

370
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,501
I mean the jewelry in it.

371
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:07,626
Hello.

372
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,292
Seems like

373
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,667
you like our ring.

374
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:11,584
This is the limited-edition

375
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,918
diamond ring.

376
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,292
The only pair in the world.

377
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,125
The name is Only You.

378
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,417
You look so sweet.

379
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:20,042
I wonder

380
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,375
if you’re getting married.

381
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,250
Uh, today,

382
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:33,999
we have a sales promotion.

383
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,083
You’ll have 10% off.

384
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,167
The price goes to

385
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:37,999
88,888 yuan.

386
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,042
88,888?

387
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:41,417
That’s expensive!

388
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,125
Yes.

389
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,000
It’s okay,

390
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:45,959
if you like it...

391
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,000
I don’t like it!

392
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:47,834
I don’t!

393
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,000
The company is still in trouble.

394
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,209
Sorry, it’s too expensive.

395
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:51,667
It’s okay.

396
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,417
- Sorry. - See you.

397
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:56,542
Excuse me.

398
00:19:58,626 --> 00:19:59,042
Hello?

399
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,751
Is it?

400
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:02,999
Okay. I see.

401
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,250
Qi, some business problem.

402
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,125
I must go and take care of it.

403
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:06,959
Go home alone

404
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:07,959
and text me after you arrive.

405
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:08,542
Good girl.

406
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,792
I’m upset!

407
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,000
That’s expensive.

408
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,709
But he should have

409
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,209
done something else!

410
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,751
We came out for a date.

411
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,000
Why did he go back to work?

412
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,459
He said we melted

413
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:29,459
the ice in him

414
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:30,584
and made him feel warm.

415
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,125
What the hell!

416
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:33,834
What warm?

417
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:34,959
Always talks big!

418
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,542
I’m such a good girl!

419
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,125
Why can’t I

420
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,292
marry you?

421
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,542
Being in a relationship with such a numb man

422
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,334
is really tiring!

423
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,083
How lucky!

424
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,083
I want to marry Bo Hai.

425
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,584
What dream coming true!

426
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:49,792
Hello?

427
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,959
Qi, I love you!

428
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:54,709
What do you mean?

429
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,250
You heard

430
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,167
what I just complained?

431
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,167
In such a big world,

432
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:01,918
the probability of falling in love

433
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,083
is too low to be calculated.

434
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,167
Love is something

435
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,334
that will easily fail

436
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,584
and hardly succeed.

437
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,417
Since so,

438
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,626
I want us to

439
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,459
hold each other’s hand

440
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,876
and never let go of each other.

441
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:26,876
Qi.

442
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,209
Would you marry me?

443
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:47,999
Where are you?

444
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you proposing to me?

445
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,250
Such an informal way

446
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,292
helps less.

447
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,083
Close your eyes,

448
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:01,501
count down from ten

449
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,417
and I’ll appear right in front of you.

450
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:10,542
I don’t believe that.

451
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,000
Do it!

452
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:18,626
Okay.

453
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,083
Ten.

454
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:23,375
Nine.

455
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:25,334
Eight.

456
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:27,918
Seven.

457
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,209
Six.

458
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:32,834
Five.

459
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:35,375
Four.

460
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,250
Three.

461
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:42,959
Two.

462
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:51,959
One.

463
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:31,709
Bo Hai!

464
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:33,709
Bo Hai!

465
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,792
Bo Hai!

466
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:36,918
Bo Hai!

467
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,125
You haven’t proposed to me yet!

468
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,375
Wake up!

469
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:51,250
Sorry, miss.

470
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:52,501
You can’t get in there.

471
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:53,417
Save him!

472
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,417
I’m begging you!

473
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,834
Bo Hai, walk slowly!

474
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:52,918
I can’t catch up!

475
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:54,876
Bo Hai!

476
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:58,876
Bo Hai!

477
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:02,042
Bo Hai!

478
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,918
Bo Hai, don’t walk so fast!

479
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,459
Bo Hai, I can’t catch up!

480
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,918
Bo Hai!

481
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:20,083
Bo Hai!

482
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:25,334
Bo Hai, wait for me!

483
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,459
Bo Hai.

484
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,375
Bo Hai, don’t walk that fast.

485
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,918
I can’t catch up!

486
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:45,501
Bo Hai!

487
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,459

Shouldn’t the tenant

cover the expense

511
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,751
for repairing the balcony?

512
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:55,709
Anyway, we don’t need to repair it

513
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:56,709
if he doesn’t live in.

514
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,542
Sure, he will.

515
00:28:58,709 --> 00:28:59,959
Who rents the room repairs it.

516
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,250
That’s reasonable.

Ling!

00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,501
Give me a discount for the rice vinegar.

No!

Why?

521
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,751
It’s 6 yuan in a big supermarket.

522
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,375
But you sell it for 6.5 yuan.

523
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,584
That’s too much!

524
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:17,417
You’re not right.

525
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:18,876
You can buy it near your home,

526
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
instead of going far.

527
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,751
Li Lijun.

528
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:23,918
Could you have new ideas

529
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,501
along with

530
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:26,375
the society development?

531
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:27,584
Look carefully!

532
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:28,959
Is this still a small shop?

533
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,209
It’s a supermarket!

534
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,042
Open 24/7.

535
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,542
- B2C. - B2C.

536
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:37,250
Can you get a discount

537
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,542
in another supermarket?

538
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:38,999
Yeah.

539
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:39,792
Could you get a lower price?

540
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:40,209
Yes!

541
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,000
Stop it! B2C?

542
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,250
Even a big supermarket gives a discount.

543
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,125
Why can’t a B2C shop

544
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,083
give one?

545
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,292
We all knew it!

546
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,709
The tenant,

547
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:49,584
Mo Nan,

548
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:50,792
who rents your balcony

549
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,000
introduced you to buy two stocks

550
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,584
and you made much money.

551
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,918
Or how could you possibly

552
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,000
turn the small shop

553
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,999
into B2C?

554
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,417
So what?

555
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:03,125
Seriously,

556
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,167
we’ve been neighbors for years.

557
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,125
Why don’t you tell me the stocks

558
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,167
so that I can buy some

559
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,751
to make money?

560
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:14,959
I’ll tell you only one.

561
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,918
Fine, then!

562
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:17,626
Come on.

563
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,375
Fine, 6.5 yuan. I’ll pay it.

564
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,209
Hello, class.

565
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:24,626
Today,

566
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,709
I’m honored and glad that

567
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,667
Headmaster Wang holds his ground

568
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,209
and has me as the special lecturer.

569
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,042
I’m grateful.

570
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,292
But I also suspect that

571
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,959
he hires me

572
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,167
to act like

573
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:39,125
a negative example

574
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,501
so that you won’t fall into a wrong path

575
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,876
after you graduate.

576
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,501
I’m only joking.

577
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,042
But I still hope

578
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,083
you can remember that

579
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,042
when you deal with money,

580
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,083
you must be upright.

581
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,667
Because all of you will work in financial industry

582
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,292
after you graduate.

583
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:00,626
The financial industry

584
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,876
is filled with temptations.

585
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:02,918
People will always try to

586
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:03,834
instigate you

587
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,417
to do unethical behaviors.

588
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,292
In fact, I met someone

589
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,083
like that.

590
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,626
He told me

591
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:10,999
when I stood

592
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,292
at a chaotic crossing...

593
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:14,834
Hey, girl.

594
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:16,959
You look familiar.

595
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,334
Shall I invite you to lunch?

596
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:22,709
Okay.

597
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,083
If you don’t mind

598
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:25,751
having lunch

599
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:26,334
with Mr. Mo Nan.

600
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,626
I’m punished

601
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,959
to stay at the crossing

602
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:30,792
for the rest of my life.

603
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,292
So, I’m reminding you...

604
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:34,626
All right.

605
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,667
… with my own mistake.

606
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,834
After you graduate

607
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,042
and begin to work,

608
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,167
you must respect the industry

609
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:44,334
and your rivals.

610
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:45,667
Most importantly,

611
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:48,167
you must respect yourself.

612
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,000
As what you can see,

613
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,459
our company has been developing

614
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:53,417
at an incredible speed,

615
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:55,000
with a huge development potential,

616
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,709
a complete human resource structure

617
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,083
and a stable supply chain.

618
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,209
Director Zhou.

619
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,542
There’s something urgent

620
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:01,918
and please take care of it.

621
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:09,959
Excuse me, everybody.

622
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,292
I’ll be back in twenty minutes.

623
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:12,792
Zhenqi, continue the meeting.

624
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,292
How clumsy you are!

625
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,375
No wonder the baby keeps crying!

626
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,542
I’m not clumsy!

627
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:19,999
I’m not capable enough.

628
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,250
Not capable enough?

629
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:23,709
My baby is hungry! Hurry!

630
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:25,042
I’ll pull the curtains.

631
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,167
Good baby!

632
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:27,751
Stop crying!

633
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,000
I really admire

634
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:29,876
Director Zhou’s professionalism.

635
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,709
The humanistic rules in your company

636
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:32,751
also touch me.

637
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,709
There’ll be no problem with such a company.

638
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,042
Thank you for understanding.

639
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:37,209
Let’s continue.

640
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,918
Time goes by quickly.

641
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:46,542
Everything grows and falls.

642
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:48,667
Everyone lives

643
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,417
his own life.

644
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:53,709
It may not be perfect.

645
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,000
But it’s warm and lucky.

646
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:02,375
And you...

647
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:05,250
How are you doing?

648
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,459
Qi,

649
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,083
Would you marry me?

650
00:34:58,459 --> 00:34:59,334
I had the same dream

651
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,709
for many times.

652
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:44,042
But in fact,

653
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:47,334
it’s nothing,

654
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:48,375
but my imagination.

655
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,334
I don’t know

656
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,375
when my dream will come true.

657
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:11,459
Aunt.

658
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:16,334
Thank you.
