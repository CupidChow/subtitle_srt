51

I’ve liked him so many years.

52
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,667
It took me three years

53
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,000
to get into FlowerPlus.

54
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:54,834
Mo Nan is so not

55
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:55,918
my cup of tea.

56
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,876
But I like him anyway.

57
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,709
I can’t let go.

58
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,000
Me neither.

59
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,459
Ladies,

60
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,125
we are closing.

61
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:17,584
We really need to close.

62
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,751
Don’t close.

63
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,709
Why are you closing?

64
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,999
Ling Guoliang, it’s midnight.

65
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,250
Your daughter is still not home.

66
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:51,834
Bye.

67
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,042
Qi, are you alright?

68
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,459
I’m fine. Bye.

69
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,042
Goodbye.

70
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:58,959
Bye.

71
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:33,209
I didn’t drink.

72
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,334
I didn’t drink.

73
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,751
I didn’t drink.

74
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:54,626
Mom.

75
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:57,834
Where is she?

76
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,584
Qi, you are back.

77
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,167
Don’t, Qi.

78
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:08,918
What happened?

79
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:09,417
What’s going on?

80
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,542
I’m back.

81
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,876
You’re drunk.

82
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:13,209
Young lady,

83
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,250
how could you be so late

84
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
and so drunk?

85
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,125
- Mom. - What if something bad happens?

86
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:17,834
Mom.

87
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,501
I fell out of love.

88
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:22,959
Fell out of love?

89
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,459
Bo Hai has a girlfriend.

90
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,083
So what?

91
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,292
They are not married.

92
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,876
It normal to have a girlfriend.

93
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,959
You can

94
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:34,667
go get him.

95
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,459
But you can’t be drunk…

96
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,209
Ling Guoliang! Ling Guoliang!

97
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,751
Hurry up!

98
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:40,501
Look!

99
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,209
Take a look!

100
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:43,876
She’s so drunk.

101
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:44,584
What happened?

102
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:45,417
Oh my…

103
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,626
Hold her.

104
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,792
Although the flower is owned by someone,

105
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,125
you can still go loosen the soil.

106
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,501
That’s what they say.

107
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,042
That’s right.

108
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:53,959
Loosen the soil.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,584
Whose soil?

110
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:55,792
Your mother has a point.

111
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,167
I’m sweaty now.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,584
It seems we were overthinking it.

113
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:08,709
Go to bed.

114
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,584
Qi,

115
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,542
you are not wearing lipstick today?

116
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:30,918
Ling Lingqi,

117
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:32,667
go get me a cup of coffee.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,584
I caught a cold and it’s contagious.

119
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,959
Mr. Bo, I’ll get it for you.

120
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:41,626
Get yourself ready then.

121
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:42,334
One hour later,

122
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,417
I’m taking you to meet a client.

123
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,250
Any problem?

124
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,334
Weirdo.

125
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,083
Thank you for your cooperation.

126
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:53,999
The pleasure is mine.

127
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:57,999
Xinyan,

128
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,709
yesterday, David went to Bo Hai’s place

129
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:02,959
with Ling Lingqi to get files.

130
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,709
He said it was you who told them that

131
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:05,876
Bo Hai wanted her to go there.

132
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,000
What on earth happened?

133
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,209
I made Ling Lingqi go to

134
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,125
Bo Hai’s place on purpose.

135
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,626
I made a show for her.

136
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,292
I want her quit Bo Hai

137
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,292
for good.

138
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,959
I bet the show was not suitable for children.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,417
This joke is out of line.

140
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,626
Have you ever thought

141
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:25,751
what will happen

142
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:26,459
if Bo Hai learns it?

143
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:27,834
He won’t.

144
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:28,501
Why?

145
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,626
Because you are my accomplice.

146
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,375
How did I

147
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,292
become your accomplice?

148
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,542
I’m so upright.

149
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,000
You are the one who told me

150
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,083
the place of Bo Hai’s spare key.

151
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,876
Zhou Xinyan,

152
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,751
you set me up.

153
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:54,000
Later,

154
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:55,334
Bo Hai will take Ling Lingqi

155
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,125
to discuss He Minglang’s

156
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,125
project of movie set.

157
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,125
I’ve already inquired about it.

158
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,876
The task assigned to Bo Hai this time

159
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,375
is the setting of

160
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:02,626
Lanre Forest in the studio.

161
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,167
The studio is in the shooting base

162
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:04,959
on Canghe Road.

163
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,626
I went on a field trip…

164
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,709
I’ve thought about it.

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,501
It’s not the right time to strike.

166
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,334
But…

167
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,417
After the Floriculture Competition,

168
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,626
Bo Hai is more alert.

169
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:15,626
He even begins to suspect

170
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,083
that there are others behind me.

171
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,417
If we do it now,

172
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,584
it may affect Mr. Mo.

173
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,584
Then I must thank you.

174
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,125
You’re welcome.

175
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,334
Mr. Wen, I don’t understand.

176
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,250
Why did you suddenly

177
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,417
give this opportunity up?

178
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,083
Who said I gave up?

179
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:48,250
But in the elevator…

180
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:49,751
Shi Ji,

181
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:53,501
if you want to succeed,

182
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:56,125
you need to learn to deal with people.

183
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,584
In most cases,

184
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,709
dealing with people is more important
than with things.

185
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,000
I can tell

186
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:03,334
Mo Nan

187
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,792
has feelings

188
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:05,667
for Ling Lingqi.

189
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,334
Such a badass

190
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:09,167
like Mr. Mo

191
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,209
also makes the same mistake

192
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,209
like other men.

193
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:12,667
When

194
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,626
it comes to Ling Lingqi,

195
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,334
he will lose his sense.

196
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:17,834
I understand.

197
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,209
We’ll avoid Ling Lingqi.

198
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,459
Not her.

199
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,709
We’ll avoid Mo Nan.

200
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,501
This brat

201
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,999
has William on his back.

202
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,959
He doesn’t take me seriously.

203
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:38,999
I’ll teach him

204
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,709
the basic manners,

205
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:42,876
and let William know

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,999
who is the biggest hero

207
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,417
behind the FlowerPlus acquisition.

208
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,999
The shoes were given by my dad…

209
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,834
How could you meet the client like this?

210
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,459
How about taking down

211
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,292
the other sole?

212
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,375
You mind is full

213
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,792
of TV dramas.

214
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:26,542
Follow me.

215
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:38,959
Welcome.

216
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,292
Please enjoy yourselves.

217
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,667
What kind of shoes do you need?

218
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:43,334
Suitable for her work.

219
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,292
They are amazing.

220
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:46,667
This is our shop’s

221
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,999
best-selling crystal shoes.

222
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,250
Do you like them?

223
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,792
I do. So shiny.

224
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,334
Those shoes don’t suit her.

225
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:54,334
Too feminine.

226
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:55,375
She can’t handle them.

227
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:56,667
Who says I can’t handle them?

228
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,501
Those shoes are more feminine with me

229
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:58,667
than with anyone else.

230
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,292
You should try these.

231
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:10,542
Come.

232
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,876
This gentleman is very considerate.

233
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:44,209
Check, please.

234
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,209
A second.

235
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:54,459
No.

236
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:55,792
I’ll pay myself.

237
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:56,999
I’ll pay myself. How much?

238
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,209
It’s 3,950 yuan.

239
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:01,167
What?

240
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,999
3,950 yuan.

241
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,709
My leg seems to be cramping.

242
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:20,584
Sorry.

243
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:21,709
It’s OK.

244
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,709
Your girlfriend is quite interesting.

245
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:24,959
Who is her boyfriend?

246
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,626
Who is his girlfriend?

247
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:30,459
He’s my boss.

248
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,042
She’s my employee.

249
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:39,083
Thanks.

250
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,375
Looking forward to your next visit.

251
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:44,334
Mr. He,

252
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:45,834
this is our

253
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,000
new florist,

254
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:47,834
Ling Lingqi.

255
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,209
She is a very talented

256
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,209
rising star.

257
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,334
Nice to meet you, Mr. He.

258
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:52,334
I’m a big fan of you.

259
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,709
Nice to meet you.

260
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,083
I’m mainly responsible for

261
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:57,876
the creation of

262
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,334
the floriculture setting of Lanre Forest.

263
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,501
The specific implementation

264
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:01,959
will be Ling Lingqi’s responsibility.

265
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,417
It seems that Mr. Bo values

266
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,375
you as a newcomer very much.

267
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,709
I look forward to your cooperation

268
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,209
to bring me

269
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,292
a luxurious visual feast.

270
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,459
Rest assured.

271
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,584
We are very confident.

272
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:16,959
We won’t let you down.

273
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,125
Mr. He, please have a look.

274
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,292
This time our movie is positioned

275
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,876
as a magic blockbuster.

276
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:29,876
Combining the most popular

277
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,709
forest landscape floral trends,

278
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:33,209
I want to make

279
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,542
the Lanre Forest

280
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:35,751
a mysterious

281
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,125
dark fairy tale style.

282
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,999
I choose galax urceolata,

283
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,834
Calathea,

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,751
philodendron and others

285
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,667
to enrich forest color gradation.

286
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,667
Matched with dark-toned flowers

287
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,292
such as black butterfly dahlia
and maidenhair vine.

288
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,060
= A Chinese Ghost Story =

289
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:25,626
I heard that Ling Lingqi

290
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:27,334
became the deputy of Mr. Bo this time

291
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,375
as the person in charge

292
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,292
of the movie set.

293
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,209
You’re resourceful.

294
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,667
Ling Lingqi

295
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,083
is not qualified for this position

296
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,501
neither in experience nor in strength.

297
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,459
What is Mr. Bo thinking?

298
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,667
Yes, I am so not convinced.

299
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,334
Do you think Mr. Bo

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,542
has feelings

301
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,042
for Ling Lingqi?

302
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,417
No way.

303
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,292
Well, let’s just say

304
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:55,959
there is a possibility.

305
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:57,334
Come here.

306
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,083
According to my observation,

307
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,292
Chomper’s speaking tone

308
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,167
to Ling Lingqi

309
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,167
is obviously different to

310
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,834
all of us.

311
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:09,292
Zhenqi,

312
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:10,667
you look so pretty

313
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,792
in this skirt today.

314
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,209
Back off. I’m wearing pants.

315
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,459
Nothing different.

316
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,334
You are beautiful whatever you wear.

317
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
This common aspidistra

318
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,167
and liriope spicata lour.

319
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:29,417
Right,

320
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,209
go get some steel wire.

321
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,042
I want Ling Lingqi to try

322
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,000
using steel wire

323
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,167
to assist part modeling.

324
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,125
It seems that these rumors

325
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,876
are not groundless.

326
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,209
We have so many people

327
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,709
in our company.

328
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,918
You don’t show your care to anyone else

329
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,375
but Ling Lingqi alone.

330
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,834
I just recognize

331
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:52,792
her professional ability.

332
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:53,626
Is there a problem?

333
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,999
Come on, dude.

334
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:56,209
No one else is here.

335
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,292
Just me.

336
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:59,167
Is this the first day I know you?

337
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:04,042
Are you saying she has a crush on me?

338
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,626
Not a crush, but love.

339
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,876
So she’s in love with me.

340
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,876
Not just in love with you.

341
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,584
Love is mutual.

342
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,209
Stop right here.

343
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:17,542
You are overthinking

344
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:18,375
again.

345
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,375
On my part,

346
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:21,250
I’m just recognizing her work.

347
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:22,918
However,

348
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,999
she does seem a little bit weird recently.

349
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,250
That’s not

350
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,751
weird at all.

351
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,459
It is because of Zhou Xinyan.

352
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,417
Chen Mo!

353
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:45,999
I’m telling you this.

354
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,000
If you dare to tell anyone

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,459
that I tricked

356
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:49,999
Ling Lingqi,

357
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:50,626
I will…

358
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,792
Xinyan, what are you doing?

359
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:53,999
You are so close to me.

360
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,250
It makes me nervous.

361
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,083
Just say what you want.

362
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,125
I’m listening.

363
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,292
I will end our friendship!

364
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,667
End our friendship?

365
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,083
Our friendship is so strong.

366
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,334
Do you have to put an end to it?

367
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,834
Won’t you just spill it out?

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,584
I got it.

369
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:08,709
I…

370
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,042
I won’t tell anyone.

371
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:12,334
Really?

372
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:21,999
Calm down.

373
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:35,584
Mo Nan?

374
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:46,999
I was waiting to see you

375
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,083
when you come back from the business trip.

376
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,667
But I didn’t see you since.

377
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,876
Let’s go have dinner tonight.

378
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:52,751
I have a lot of bitterness

379
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:53,501
to share with you.

380
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,999
No, I have to work overtime today.

381
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:00,000
Which one is more important?

382
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,209
Friends or money?

383
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,459
It’s not like that. I promised Miss Zhou

384
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,000
that tonight

385
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,375
I’ll finish the plan.

386
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:08,542
Rain check?

387
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:10,542
See you.

388
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,999
It’s gonna be fine.

389
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,042
Hello, Mr. Chen.

390
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,375
This is Ling Lingqi from FlowerPlus.

391
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:09,751
Could you wait for me?

392
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:10,626
I’ll bring the

393
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:11,792
matching files of flowers

394
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:12,626
to you.

395
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,667
I’m coming now.

396
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:15,292
Yes.

397
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:16,709
OK.

398
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,334
Where is Mo Nan?

399
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,584
Isn’t he working overtime?

400
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,000
Liar.

401
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,542
See how I’ll fix you when I’m back.

402
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:34,042
Mo Nan?

403
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:38,959
Mo Nan!

404
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,292
Open the door!

405
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:42,751
Mo Nan!

406
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,042
I know you are in there.

407
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:48,751
Mo Nan!

408
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,542
Open the door!

409
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:54,792
Seriously?

410
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,042
What’s all this?

411
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,542
Just tell me if something’s wrong!

412
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,042
Unbelievable.

413
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,417
Did I say anything wrong?

414
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:04,709
Did I do anything wrong

415
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:05,751
that made you angry?

416
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,083
I have no idea.

417
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,709
That’s why you have to tell me

418
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:14,999
if something goes wrong.

419
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,459
That’s what friends do.

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,250
You don’t say a word

421
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:20,918
and keep yourself angry inside.

422
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,700
= Mo Nan =

423
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,580
= Ling Lingqi =

424
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,501
Mo Nan! Mo Nan! You liar!

425
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,459
Mo Nan! You keep

426
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,417
hiding in there

427
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,083
for your whole life!

428
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,375
You coward!

429
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,375
If you come out,

430
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,584
I’ll beat you every time I see you!

431
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,250
Do you hear me?

432
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:08,584
Mo Nan!

433
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:10,834
Don’t come out.

434
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,876
I’m locking

435
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:12,999
you inside.

436
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,542
Let’s see what you can do.

437
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:19,792
Let’s see what you can do.

438
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,209
Just keep hiding, you!

439
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,542
Qi, I’m sorry.

440
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,667
I can’t tell you

441
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,042
why I am drifting you apart.

442
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:39,959
I have too many

443
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,375
secrets that I can’t share.

444
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:44,417
I just hope

445
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,125
one day when you know the truth,

446
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,167
you can forgive me.

447
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,501
Honey.

448
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:09,417
My girlfriend is

449
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:10,375
so pretty.

450
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:11,250
The guys in the back

451
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,542
are staring at me.

452
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:19,209
I have a question.

453
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,709
What do you like about me?

454
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:25,375
I like your beauty. What’s wrong?

455
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:26,209
Anything else?

456
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:27,834
Else?

457
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:29,918
Isn’t it enough?

458
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,584
If I’m not this pretty,

459
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,417
will you still like me?

460
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:48,167
What are you talking about,

461
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:48,959
honey?

462
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,042
Enjoy the music.

463
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:25,083
Like an injection medicine bottle.

464
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:30,501
Seems to be very moist.

465
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:31,709
Let me try.

466
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,083
Easy, Mom. Almost run out.

467
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,083
Your face is small. You don’t need that much.

468
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,501
That’s enough.

469
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,918
Nice. What is it?

470
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,542
Revitalift Filler.

471
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:47,459
What?

472
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:48,876
It’s the…

473
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,334
There are a lot of

474
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,292
hyaluronic acid and essence

475
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,584
inside the bottle.

476
00:23:57,584 --> 00:23:59,042
Mom, can we change the channel?

477
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,417
Why? I’m following this drama.

478
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,209
If I watch more of their love affairs,

479
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:04,709
I’ll be mentally twisted.

480
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,042
No way.

481
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,584
You should

482
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:08,667
learn from it.

483
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,667
You are too dumb.

484
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,209
Mom, Bo Hai has a secret lover.

485
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:15,334
And,

486
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,959
Mo Nan is ignoring me

487
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:17,626
out of blue.

488
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,042
I feel like I lost

489
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,000
friendship and love,

490
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,667
and it feels so “good”.

491
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:30,959
The hearts of men

492
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,792
are more unpredictable than women’s.

493
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,250
Babe, I think

494
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,083
you are still too young.

495
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:40,667
Do you know what’s

496
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:41,626
the job of women?

497
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,209
Women are born

498
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,876
to control men.

499
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,167
No matter what you do in the future,

500
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:49,709
think more.

501
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:53,709
Mom, you are very experienced.

502
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:57,751
Of course.

503
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,709
Look at your father.

504
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,751
Isn’t he obeying me

505
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,959
very well?

506
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:06,417
If I say one,

507
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:07,876
have you ever heard him

508
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:08,792
say two?

509
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:11,167
No, I haven’t.

510
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,667
Two.

511
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,626
Now I do.

512
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:17,292
Ling Guoliang.

513
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,167
Someone is being murdered.

514
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:24,334
Murder!

515
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,501
No one is murdering anyone, Dad.

516
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,626
You are lying.

517
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:56,667
Yi,

518
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:58,999
the staple gun may break the leaves.

519
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,709
Better use the glue.

520
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:02,375
Sure, Mr. Bo.

521
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:05,417
Mr. Bo.

522
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,667
What do you think?

523
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:11,834
Give us some advice.

524
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,250
I would like to find out something wrong.

525
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,209
But you

526
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,417
don’t give me a chance.

527
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,334
The whole scene now

528
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,334
fully shows the wild

529
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:23,292
and mysterious temperament,

530
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,459
and far exceeds my expectations.

531
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:28,792
You are you.

532
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:30,751
The number one master of

533
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:31,792
the floriculture world.

534
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:34,542
This place

535
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:36,959
needs one more day.

536
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:37,918
Your compliment

537
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
can be saved for later.

538
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:39,459
Minglang.

539
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,417
This is the director.

540
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,250
Nice to meet you.

541
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:42,751
Nice to meet you.

542
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:43,542
In order to catch up with the schedule,

543
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,542
we need to shoot some scenes

544
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,542
on some completed sceneries

545
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:47,125
now.

546
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,417
You can see the results.

547
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,584
Good. No problem.

548
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:55,667
Ghost!

549
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,125
Cut!

550
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,751
OK. Ask everybody to stand by!

551
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,334
Action!

552
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:18,292
Be careful!

553
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:18,959
Run!

554
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:19,667
Watch out!

555
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:34,584
Hurry! Someone got hurt!

556
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:35,501
Call an ambulance!

557
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:36,459
Minglang, are you OK?

558
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:36,918
I’m fine.

559
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,626
What am I going to do with the scenery?

560
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,709
Hello, Mr. Bo?

561
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,000
Coming right up.

562
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,417
I’m taking the files.

563
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:54,792
What?

564
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:56,876
Come on in.

565
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,334
Mr. Wen, it’s done.

566
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,000
This time, let’s see

567
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,999
what Bo Hai can do

568
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,375
to resolve the checkmate.

569
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,751
Hello? The specific cause and process

570
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:21,959
are still under investigation.

571
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,250
I promise to give

572
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,620
a detailed explanation soon.

573
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,626
OK, hold on a second.

574
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,751
Hello, James?

575
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,209
You are an experienced reporter.

576
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:36,542
You can’t

577
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,167
spread rumors.

578
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:39,918
This is simply slandering.

579
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:40,417
It is reported

580
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,792
that an actress was injured at the scene,

581
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:42,375
and has been…

582
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:42,792
Yes.

583
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:43,792
…sent to the hospital for treatment.

584
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:44,584
The loss of items

585
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:45,959
is as high as 10 million yuan.

586
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,751
According to an anonymous...

587
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:48,292
OK, OK.

588
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:49,999
The accident was caused

589
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,125
by improper operation

590
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:52,417
of the floriculture company.

591
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,667
We will continue to

592
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:54,542
follow this accident.

593
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:56,792
On my design drawing,

594
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,083
considering shooting needs,

595
00:28:58,709 --> 00:28:59,999
Granny would be standing on a twig

596
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,542
made by three Chinese fir sticks

597
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,000
bundled together.

598
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,834
But in the materials list,

599
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,334
there is only one Chinese fir stick,

600
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:08,792
and the diameter is not up to standard.

601
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,459
There is also a sponge and bark wrapped

602
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:11,042
on the outside.

603
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,042
Seen from the appearance,

604
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,417
there are no flaws.

605
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:16,042
But the problem is right here.

606
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,626
So you are the culprit.

607
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,740
= List of Floral Landscaping Materials =

608
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,501
But I remember it clearly

609
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,334
that I ordered

610
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,417
three Chinese fir sticks.

611
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,999
Now you are shirking responsibility?

612
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,042
Mo Nan, your people

613
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:41,542
are looking for…

614
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,292
Did you do it?

615
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:52,626
Exactly.

616
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,709
Who allowed you?

617
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:56,918
Allow me?

618
00:29:58,584 --> 00:29:59,292
Mr. Mo, perhaps,

619
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,459
you are mistaken.

620
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,999
I am the one responsible for this project.

621
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:06,209
You are only a commissioner.

622
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,209
Now the wounded

623
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,959
is still on the operating table.

624
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,000
You are crossing the line.

625
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,709
I will let Shi Ji

626
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,167
comfort the wounded.

627
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:16,751
Don’t worry.

628
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:18,375
I am always efficient.

629
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:19,459
Now it has

630
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:19,876
nothing to do

631
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,083
with me.

632
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,083
But Ling Lingqi…

633
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,542
Wen Guangqi, are you insane?

634
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,042
Mr. Wen, Mr. Wen.

635
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:32,083
He Minglang has arrived.

636
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,250
In front of success,

637
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,626
all means

638
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:44,667
will be forgiven.

639
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:51,459
Wen Guangqi,

640
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:53,792
do you think that

641
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,167
I cannot punish you?

642
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,042
Perhaps you do not have the chance.

643
00:30:58,209 --> 00:30:58,876
After I complete

644
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,209
the acquisition of FlowerPlus,

645
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,584
I will tell William that

646
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,167
you are addicted to the beauty

647
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,334
and you are useless in detail.

648
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:19,999
That’s not right.

649
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:21,999
I don’t think this is the list I made.

650
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:24,209
What about the evidence?

651
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:25,334
Last night,

652
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:26,542
when I checked the list,

653
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:27,999
I accidentally spilt the biscuit butter

654
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,334
on the paper.

655
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,000
But now, these

656
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,667
are all clean.

657
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,667
Yes. They are cleaner than my face.

658
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:40,209
Besides you,

659
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:41,584
who else can prove that

660
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:42,959
there was butter on the paper?

661
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,626
When I worked overtime last night,

662
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,250
all the colleagues were off work.

663
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,626
Then it’s your own speech.

664
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:51,542
It’s not trustworthy.

665
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:52,667
I believe her.

666
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,375
Mr. Bo, about what happened today
caused by FlowerPlus,

667
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,000
you must give me an explanation.

668
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:02,918
The setting fees I lost,

669
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:04,209
the time I spent,

670
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,292
and the injured actress.

671
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,760
You must give me a

672
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:07,540
satisfying settlement.

673
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,709
Don’t worry, Mr. He.

674
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:13,751
Please have a seat.

675
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:28,459
Mr. He, we have

676
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,709
arranged florists

677
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:31,083
to rebuild the settings

678
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,542
in order to minimize

679
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:34,542
the loss of the crew.

680
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,459
The person in charge of this accident

681
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,417
is still under investigation.

682
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,125
My actress

683
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,417
broke six bones.

684
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,375
And you are still under investigation.

685
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:48,292
Is this your way to

686
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:49,417
be responsible for clients?

687
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,167
Do you know how much money we will lose

688
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:52,167
if we stop working for a whole day?

689
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,667
Mr. Bo, I am not pushing you.

690
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,542
There are too many

691
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:01,501
voices outside.

692
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,751
I made an international call

693
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:03,709
with DREAM

694
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:04,667
and explained a lot.

695
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,250
They don’t give up and

696
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,375
ask you to give an explanation to

697
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:09,250
the investors.

698
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:11,292
What’s more, if the stock price of FlowerPlus

699
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,667
continue decreasing,

700
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:13,918
perhaps DREAM

701
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:14,876
will reduce

702
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,000
their shareholding.

703
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,125
Dozens of reporters

704
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,167
want to disclose the news that our crew

705
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,375
stops shooting.

706
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,792
This is the largest project

707
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,167
of our company this year.

708
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:27,834
DREAM requires us

709
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,334
to convene a board meeting

710
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,292
to discuss the management issue in leadership.

711
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:35,125
Tomorrow morning.

712
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:36,792
Tomorrow morning,

713
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,751
I will try to recover the scene

714
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,459
and give you the person

715
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:41,542
directly responsible for the incident

716
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,250
as an explanation to you.

717
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:45,792
Fine,

718
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:48,751
I’ll trust you one more time.

719
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:52,125
What if you break your word?

720
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,459
I won’t. I promise.

721
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:03,209
We have to give them Ling Lingqi.

722
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,751
At least it can calm down

723
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,751
He Minglang and DREAM

724
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:06,375
a little.

725
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,000
I believe Ling Lingqi is innocent.

726
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:09,792
No evidence shows that

727
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,667
she is innocent.

728
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,042
Even if she is,

729
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,334
using her to solve urgent needs

730
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:14,751
is also an effective strategy.

731
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:17,792
Is this your

732
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:18,542
crisis PR strategy?

733
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:19,751
I’m telling you.

734
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:21,459
I will not sacrifice innocent employees

735
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,501
to calm the anger of

736
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:23,918
investors and clients.

737
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,626
You won’t sacrifice innocent employees.

738
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:26,209
Do you want to sacrifice

739
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:27,125
your innocent self?

740
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,501
Bo Hai, your feelings for Ling Lingqi

741
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:31,667
are really something different.

742
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:32,334
Shut up!

743
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,834
What you need to do now

744
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,417
is to deal with the problem immediately,

745
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:38,083
instead of debating these

746
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:38,999
meaningless things

747
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,834
with me here!

748
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,542
Understand?

749
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:50,751
I picked up some

750
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:51,751
alternative design options

751
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:52,417
for Mr. Bo to choose.

752
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:53,792
Maybe they can be helpful.

753
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,000
Ling Lingqi,

754
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:55,792
I’m going to

755
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,792
let you pay.

756
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,501
Ignore her.

757
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,292
If anyone insults you again…

758
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:06,999
It’s alright.

759
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,459
I’m very experienced in this.

760
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,876
You’d better go make her happy,

761
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,292
or she will punish you in the evening.

762
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:12,250
Here are the alternative design options.

763
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:19,501
What?

764
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,250
Are they going to wrong Qi again?

765
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:23,626
Now the key is

766
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:24,542
not about

767
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:25,542
wronging her or not.

768
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:26,999
Yes. The problem is

769
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,250
how Mr. Bo is going to

770
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,542
deliver his promise to

771
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:31,042
He Minglang and Wen Guangqi.

772
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:33,125
This is not

773
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:34,334
just face saving.

774
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,542
It’s a life and death matter.

775
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:36,459
Right.

776
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,209
Like this phormium tenax.

777
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:39,375
It’s rare in the local

778
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:40,459
flower market.

779
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,667
I heard the Design Department is trying

780
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:43,999
to purchase them.

781
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,667
But the needs are too large.

782
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:46,626
It’s almost impossible.

783
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:49,000
No.

784
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,375
As the best friend of Qi,

785
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,792
I can’t just stand idly by.

786
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:54,959
Baoni,

787
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,334
I know a flower materials operator.

788
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:58,834
I’ll call him for help.

789
00:35:59,209 --> 00:35:59,667
OK.

790
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:20,959
Mr. Wen, your self-directed play

791
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:22,876
is amazing.

792
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,209
Mr. Bo, you’re flattering me.

793
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,417
It’s getting fun.

794
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,000
I spend all day with you,

795
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,250
which makes no sense.

796
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:37,626
Let’s make it quick.

797
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:41,709
I am a few years older than you and

798
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,792
I have more experiences than you.

799
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,334
And I did suffer more losses than you.

800
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:47,626
Whether the ginger is spicy or not,

801
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,125
you will find out gradually.

802
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,000
I am only fond of spicy food,

803
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,250
which is exciting and appetizing.

804
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,667
You’re in a leisure mood.

805
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,167
You are not busy solving the problems,

806
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,751
but have the mood to come upstairs,

807
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,000
chat with me and enjoy the scenery.

808
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,501
Chat?

809
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,667
I am here to challenge you.

810
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,209
Don’t be arrogant.

811
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,667
The one who plays with fire
will definitely get burnt.

812
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,792
Enjoy more.

813
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,167
When my daughter went out in the morning,

814
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,417
she was fine.

815
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,501
And in half a day,

816
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,959
how could she break six bones?

817
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:36,167
I want to ask

818
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:36,918
how your company will solve it?

819
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:37,792
For this accident,

820
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:38,417
please

821
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:39,667
give us more time.

822
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:40,501
We will surely investigate

823
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,000
the whole story.

824
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:43,501
We will inform you

825
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:44,375
as soon as possible.

826
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:45,626
Please do not be worried.

827
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:46,542
She is the person in charge from FlowerPlus.

828
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,459
Give me my daughter back!

829
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,834
Please listen to me first.

830
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:49,751
Give me my daughter back!

831
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:51,584
The floriculture setting materials

832
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:52,876
were chosen by me.

833
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:53,834
In the process,

834
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,167
there couldn’t be any problems.

835
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:56,501
But I don’t know which part

836
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:57,542
was intervened by others.

837
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,334
Thus, the tragedy occurred.

838
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:00,667
Therefore, in this accident,

839
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:02,000
our company is also a sufferer.

840
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:02,999
Sufferer?

841
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:04,834
They are passing the buck!

842
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:05,834
We need FlowerPlus

843
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:06,876
to give us an explanation.

844
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,042
We will not leave without an explanation!

845
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:08,501
Yes!

846
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:10,042
Do not fight!

847
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,042
Give me my daughter back！

848
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:12,792
Give me an explanation!

849
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:13,918
Give me an explanation!

850
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:14,876
Give me my daughter back!

851
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:15,501
Calm down.

852
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,250
Give us an explanation!

853
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:16,834
Excuse me.

854
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:18,209
Do not be so excited.

855
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:19,417
Give me my daughter back!

856
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,000
Give us some time.

857
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,334
Get away.

858
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,180
We will absolutely give you

859
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:24,999
a satisfying answer.

860
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,042
Stop!

861
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:27,209
Give us an explanation!

862
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,209
Please calm down, aunt.

863
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,375
You cannot solve anything like this.

864
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,000
Why did you let her leave?

865
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:35,501
Actually I just wanted to

866
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:36,417
explain it to them.

867
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,125
Otherwise, they will not report the truth
after going back.

868
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:39,292
It is bad for our company.

869
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,125
You are so naive.

870
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,250
Our rivals

871
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,250
are not them.

872
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:48,167
Go to studio.

873
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,125
Okay.

874
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:13,125
How could Mr. Mo

875
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:14,167
become like this?

876
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:15,542
It’s none of your business.

877
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:18,083
This is a small lesson.

878
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:19,834
If you

879
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,209
cannot separate self-emotion

880
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,751
with missions,

881
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,042
perhaps,

882
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,459
it will be harder next time.

883
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,834
The surgery is successful.

884
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:53,792
For the actress,

885
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:54,501
I also hired

886
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:55,626
the most professional nursing workers.

887
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:56,626
The relatives are

888
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:57,792
calming down now.

889
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,250
As for the crew’s losses,

890
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:00,334
I have calculated

891
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:01,709
market inventory.

892
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,334
I don’t think it’s possible

893
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,626
to recover the original design.

894
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,459
But I have made some modifications.

895
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:07,375
Let’s work harder and

896
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:08,375
stay up one night.

897
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:09,584
It’s still possible

898
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:10,918
to recover all the scenes

899
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,459
before tomorrow morning.

900
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,292
Let’s divide into two groups.

901
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,959
I’ll stay with Qi here.

902
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:17,250
You go back with Xinyan and

903
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,292
protect the company.

904
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,709
Me? I go back?

905
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,292
You are losing your talents.

906
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:25,334
Together with Xinyan?

907
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:28,167
Okay, I will go back.

908
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:41,125
Come here.

909
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:01,959
Turn around.

910
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:03,751
