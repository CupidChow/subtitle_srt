51

But if his

00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,501
new emotional sustenance

53
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,417
does a

reenactment of what happened

55
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,083
and abandons Bo Hai all over again,

56
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,709
there’s a good chance

57
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,876
that his condition

58
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,167
will develop in a direction

59
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,000
which can’t be controlled.

60
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:03,959
Mr. Mo.

61
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,209
Are you really going to force Ling Lingqi

62
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,459
to abandon Bo Hai?

63
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,167
Ji Bin said you are here.

64
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,250
While I’m at it,

65
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,000
I thought I’d pay my respects to your father.

66
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,000
Your father would be

67
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,834
pleased to know

68
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,334
what you have done for him.

69
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,167
My father would be

70
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,334
disappointed to know

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,250
I’m so useless.

72
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,542
I understand your pain and your struggle.

73
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,542
But relationships

74
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,083
are a stumbling block

75
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,042
to success.

76
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:21,209
To defeat the devil,

77
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,542
you must first make yourself

78
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,584
more ruthless than the devil.

79
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,999
Mo Nan just needs a little time,

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,459
and he will make sure

81
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,292
that you rest

82
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:56,709
in peace.

83
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,667
I’m home.

84
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:29,334
I’ll see you tomorrow, then.

85
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,209
Good night.

86
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,834
You should go.

87
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,042
I have to see you go upstairs

88
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,125
so I can leave.

89
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,999
Well, I’m going in.

90
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:44,876
Go.

91
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:45,834
Bye-bye.

92
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,000
Bye-bye.

93
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:48,876
Bye-bye.

94
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,042
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

95
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,125
I don’t want you to go.

96
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,209
I really need to get in there.

97
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:07,834
Bye-bye.

98
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:09,167
Get some rest.

99
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:10,250
Bye-bye.

100
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,459
Qi.

101
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,459
Why are you here?

102
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,792
What do you want from me?

103
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,709
Break up with Bo Hai.

104
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,083
If you guys break up,

105
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:01,959
I’ll let him go.

106
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,792
Is it my ear

107
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:06,959
or your brain in trouble?

108
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:08,834
The plot was blown

109
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,000
and you thought of this reason

110
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,000
to threaten someone.

111
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,667
Who gave you the confidence?

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,834
I’m serious.

113
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,417
And I’m not kidding.

114
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:22,834
I always thought

115
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,042
you had a good head on your shoulders.

116
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,584
I can’t believe you’re making

117
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:26,834
this ridiculous request.

118
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:27,959
Next time

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,959
you’re about to threaten someone,

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
think first.

121
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,250
Qi,

122
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,501
I’ll give you time to think about it.

123
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,125
But the longer you think about it,

124
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,042
the more it’s gonna

125
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,501
cost Bo Hai.

126
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:40,918
You think this through.

127
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,334
He really didn’t look like he’s joking.

128
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,334
What if he mean it?

129
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:10,375
What if he

130
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,918
is going to do something to Bo Hai?

131
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:17,751
So what?

132
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,209
He always

133
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,542
lose to Bo Hai.

134
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,375
And yet,

135
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,584
he’s so cocky.

136
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,292
How good does he think he is?

137
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:48,167
Mr. Mo.

138
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,334
Inform everyone.

139
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,667
Initiate a full takeover.

140
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,167
Got it.

141
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,459
Two old clients

142
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,501
suddenly offer to cancel the contract,

143
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:07,417
even willing to pay

144
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,792
50% of the liquidated damages.

145
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:09,709
There are also

146
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:10,876
a few new clients

147
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:11,751
won’t go

148
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,709
any further.

149
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:14,417
They even don’t answer their phones.

150
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,334
This is so weird.

151
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:16,125
We don’t have

152
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,584
any changes in our sales policy.

153
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,918
Such big clients change

154
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,667
must be done by someone behind our back.

155
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,083
This DREAM

156
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,501
is so haunting.

157
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:26,792
It ended so quickly.

158
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:27,999
They didn’t even give an explanation.

159
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,000
They just wanted to cancel the contract

160
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,792
and pay the penalty voluntarily.

161
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:32,250
Look,

162
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,959
I’ve been working with them for so long,

163
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,626
and they didn’t even give me a chance.

164
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,709
What about me? I’m worse.

165
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,334
Yesterday they said they were gonna sign it,

166
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:40,751
but today

167
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:41,876
they’re gonna cancel it.

168
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,167
Millions of yuan, man.

169
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,751
I hear that DREAM’s up to something again?

170
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,709
Isn’t that to be expected?

171
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,501
But this time they’re coming in hot.

172
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:58,709
It’s not going to be easy.

173
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,125
In this season,

174
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,999
the Chinese rose is particularly easy to

175
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,209
attract arge geei rohwer.

176
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,125
Just snip off sick ones

177
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:07,709
and spray medicine.

178
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:08,876
No big deal.

179
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,501
How are you going to handle it?

180
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:16,209
Strategy?

181
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,083
You told me that

182
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,250
a while ago.

183
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,000
Me?

184
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:21,834
Why didn’t I know that?

185
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,876
This is the strategy.

186
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:28,918
The company’s new product.

187
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,375
The immortal flower of Alice in Wonderland.

188
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,209
The dyeing technique is up to date.

189
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:34,209
In the short term,

190
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,751
our rivals can’t follow up.

191
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,292
Anyway, I’m

192
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:39,751
pretty confident about this product.

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,959
I’m going to push it to the market

194
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:42,542
and

195
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,167
make a good comeback with it.

196
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,980
= The immortal flower box =

197
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,959
Director Liu, I was just looking for you.

198
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,375
This contract is not right.

199
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:34,334
What’s going on?

200
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:35,542
The deposit is so low.

201
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,125
The indemnity clause is so large,

202
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,375
and the amount is so high.

203
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,999
This is the imparity clause.

204
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,542
I know.

205
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:43,042
But this immortal flower

206
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,167
is a new product after all.

207
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,042
The client inevitably lacks trusts, right?

208
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:47,292
And this is a client

209
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,999
that I’ve worked

210
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:49,834
so hard

211
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,000
to get signed.

212
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,125
They are

213
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,834
plundering a burning house.

214
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,709
They’re not stupid.

215
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,417
They know DREAM is planning something.

216
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:58,501
Business is business.

217
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,999
Besides, anyone who’s helping us at this time

218
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,709
is inevitably taking advantage of us.

219
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:03,667
All right.

220
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,626
Special time, special treatment.

221
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:06,626
We’re not signing any more contracts

222
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,459
like this.

223
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,584
Don’t worry. They’re old friends.

224
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,542
They’ve always had good credit.

225
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,999
All right. Go back to work.

226
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:12,542
Okay.

227
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,292
Everyone, I have good news.

228
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:17,959
Good news?

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,459
What’s the good news?

230
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,167
What’s the good news?

231
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,459
Our company’s new product,

232
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,876
The immortal flower of Alice in Wonderland,

233
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,584
is well accepted by our client.

234
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,542
The first battle was won.

235
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,792
Just now,

236
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,876
we made a big deal.

237
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:31,876
Really?

238
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,542
Great!

239
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:35,000
Great!

240
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,334
Great!

241
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:37,959
DREAM is making a fool of itself

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,542
by going against our company, isn’t it?

243
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,459
Yeah! They

244
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,167
call themselves an international fashion company,

245
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,792
to me,

246
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,542
I feel ashamed for their so low level,

247
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,042
right?

248
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,167
- Yeah. - Right.

249
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:51,999
That’s great.

250
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,292
Have you thought about

251
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,751
what I told you?

252
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:18,999
Haven’t you heard?

253
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,209
Our company’s new product,

254
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:21,792
the immortal flower,

255
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,167
has been selling more and more.

256
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,000
What you said yesterday

257
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,042
is a slap in your face.

258
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:27,751
Instead of worrying about other people,

259
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:28,292
think about

260
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:29,209
how you can get your

261
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,292
shame back.

262
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,250
Qi.

263
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,209
As I said before,

264
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,083
the longer you think about it,

265
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,959
the more it’s gonna cost Bo Hai.

266
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,042
Are you a language repeater?

267
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,125
How can you

268
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,334
be so shameless?

269
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:45,751
You can play dirty,

270
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,125
and Bo Hai’s just gonna take it?

271
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:48,209
Keep the curse

272
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,083
to yourself.

273
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,083
Are you asleep?

274
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,125
What’s wrong?

275
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,876
He usually responds in seconds.

276
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,334
Isn’t it possible

277
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,918
that Mo Nan can’t beat him in the market,

278
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,292
so he chose an extreme way

279
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,542
and tried to kidnap

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,584
Bo Hai?

281
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,042
Blackmail?

282
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,292
Kill the hostage?

283
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:32,667
What?

284
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,375
Where are you?

285
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,417
At home.

286
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,042
Are you safe?

287
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,900
= Share a happy life
Build a civilized home together =

288
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,209
I’m just doing a spot check

289
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:08,501
to see if you’re

290
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:09,626
hanging out at night.

291
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,060
= Shop =

292
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:54,959
Tell me.

293
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:57,792
I was

294
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,584
just at home,

295
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:00,459
and then I suddenly

296
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,501
wanted to go for a walk.

297
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,542
I was just walking around…

298
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:04,751
And then you were at my house.

299
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,250
Right, right, right.

300
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,042
Who are you kidding?

301
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,834
It’s over an hour’s walk

302
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,292
from your house to mine.

303
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:09,999
Oh, yeah?

304
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:12,876
I…

305
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,918
You don’t even prepare your lie before lying.

306
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,375
Who lied? I just...

307
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,626
Just what?

308
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:17,501
We’ve been in this relationship for few days,

309
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,709
and you’re already lying.

310
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,167
Why am I so poor?

311
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,459
I finally have a boyfriend,

312
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,667
and how could he be like this?

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,876
Okay, okay, okay.

314
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,334
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

315
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,501
I made you angry.

I’m sorry.

317
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:32,584
Tell me.

00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,000
What do you want me to do to make you feel better?

319
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,667
Okay, you don’t have to say it.

Boss, something’s wrong.

349
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:26,459
This order

350
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:27,959
specifies the immortal flower

351
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,959
as gloriosa superba linn which is very rare.

352
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,083
This kind of flower is

353
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,125
from a small island

354
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,083
in South America

355
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,250
called Martinique.

356
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:35,125
Just yesterday,

357
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,959
there was a general strike in Martinique.

358
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,751
All the flowers are

359
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,918
piled up at the airport

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,209
and there is no way to get them out.

361
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,292
I just got this order

362
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,250
yesterday afternoon.

363
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,876
The client asked for the gloriosa superba linn

364
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,209
to make the immortal flower box.

365
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:47,999
Because of the volume and high profits,

366
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,167
and the company

367
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,125
has been under a lot of pressure

368
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,292
on sales recently,

369
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,209
although the contract

370
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,834
has some imparity clauses,

371
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,209
I still signed it.

372
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,751
The story’s already out.

373
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,417
It’s been a day and a night

374
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,626
since the Martinique strike.

375
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:09,584
Although because of the remoteness of the place,

376
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,626
domestic media did not pay attention,

377
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,876
the foreign media did cover it.

378
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:14,459
This is obviously

379
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:15,751
a setup.

380
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,501
A series of previous

381
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:18,459
campaigns for clients

382
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:19,626
should be the first step

383
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,334
in this trap,

384
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:21,709
designed to

385
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,501
disrupt our pace.

386
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:23,292
So...

387
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,834
So what do we do now?

388
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:30,792
The story

389
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:31,584
has been picked up by

390
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:32,740
some media outlets in small pieces.

391
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,460
= The Immortal Flower Box Supply Agreement =

392
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,292
I’ve been talking to

393
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,542
a couple of the press people I know,

394
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,999
and I’ve asked them not to go any further.

395
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,292
But the cat’s out of the bag.

396
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:39,042
Sooner or later,

397
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,542
it’s gonna be all over the news.

398
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:42,626
Good news stays in the house.

399
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,999
Bad news travels fast.

400
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,375
It’s going to have

401
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,584
a huge impact on sales.

402
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,959
The contract clearly states that

403
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,918
in case of breach of contract,

404
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,584
we will pay

405
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,751
huge damages.

406
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:55,083
If we don’t find evidence

407
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,667
of deliberate fraud,

408
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:57,834
this settlement

409
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,667
will drag us down.

410
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:10,626
We think of our opponent

411
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,125
too simple.

412
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:15,501
Did you do it?

413
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,375
I told you.

414
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,792
The longer you think about it,

415
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,417
the more Bo Hai pays.

416
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:27,417
Mo Nan.

417
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,042
I may have rebuked Baoni,

418
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,417
but I have to ask myself

419
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:34,792
if I can really wipe the slate clean of

420
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,250
your friendship.

421
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:37,834
People aren’t machines,

422
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:38,751
which can delete

423
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:39,792
the memory.

424
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:41,709
But if you leave FlowerPlus

425
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:42,584
and then stop,

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,834
after a few years

427
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,876
I may really forget all of them

428
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,292
and continue to be good friends with you.

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,334
Qi…

430
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:49,501
’No more words.

431
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,083
It’s too late.

432
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:55,876
Baoni and I

433
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,209
still had fantasy for you.

434
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,584
We are so naive.

435
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,125
Now that I’ve taken this step,

436
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,834
I don’t care about anything.

437
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:20,918
Well then,

438
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,667
every day from now on,

439
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,000
we’re enemies.

440
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,250
Turns out,

441
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,834
Mo Nan looks simple outside,

442
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,209
but ruthless and

443
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,042
crafty inside.

444
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,834
Such a man.

445
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,584
When I get my hands on him one day,

446
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:02,792
I’m gonna put a sack over his head and

447
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,000
kick his ass so hard that
his parents wouldn’t recognize him.

448
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,000
Good for you.

449
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:06,292
Baoni!

450
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:07,876
Baoni!

451
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:10,667
Baoni!

452
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:12,792
Your book.

453
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:15,334
Thank you.

454
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:16,042
Sure.

455
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,542
It’s Mo Nan again?

456
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,542
You can forget about Mo Nan.

457
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:49,834
He’s not just

458
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:50,959
a commercial spy.

459
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,751
He’s changed beyond recognition.

460
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:57,459
I know.

461
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,209
But I just can’t get him out of my mind.

462
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,125
Baoni.

463
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:11,999
The most terrible thing

464
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,459
is not the eye cannot see,

465
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,876
but the heart has no direction.

466
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:18,542
You have no idea

467
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:19,999
how despicable Mo Nan is.

468
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,083
He…

469
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:34,000
I thought

470
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,375
I met true love.

471
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:38,792
But

472
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,125
the destiny played

473
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,375
a big, big joke on me.

474
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,250
What are you afraid of?

475
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,792
You, Lu Baoni, are a heartthrob.

476
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:09,876
You throw a brick

477
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,876
at ten men,

478
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,125
eight of them will fall in love with you.

479
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,918
That’s what you always say.

480
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,918
Yeah, I’m a heartthrob.

481
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:19,626
Cheers!

482
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,667
But why?

483
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,999
Why does the man

484
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:39,876
I love

485
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,751
never loves me?

486
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,167
Why would I fall in love

487
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,167
with a con artist?

488
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,375
Why can’t I

489
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,375
get him out of my head?

490
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,292
Qi.

491
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:06,459
Does love always

492
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:08,834
taste so bitter and salty?

493
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,375
I hear your series of attacks

494
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,459
has really put Bo Hai on his knees.

495
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:37,417
This is just the beginning of a big show.

496
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,667
Here. Let’s toast

497
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,834
to our future victory.

498
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:49,667
You’re right.

499
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,667
The only way to become calmer

500
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,876
and more productive

501
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:56,667
is to forget about your feelings.

502
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,334
The gentle and sentimental person

503
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:03,918
always lives very hard,

504
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,334
because this world

505
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,626
is not gentle

506
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,334
and sentimental at all.

507
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,459
A writer said that.

508
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:19,999
I thought so.

509
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:22,834
All right.

510
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,584
I have some

511
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:26,292
board business to take care of,

512
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,334
so I’m gonna leave you alone.

513
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,959
You have fun tonight.

514
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:30,918
Enjoy.

515
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:42,542
Dad,

516
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:45,709
here’s to you.

517
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,540
= Shop =

518
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,501
Why did you bring me here?

519
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,459
You said you wanted to be here.

520
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:23,959
Unbelievable.

521
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:00,918
Hello?

522
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:05,626
Qi.

523
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:06,292
There, there.

524
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,501
Alright.

525
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:12,250
Don’t cry.

526
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:13,501
Qi.

527
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,542
Don’t cry. It’s OK.

528
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:23,125
Alright.

529
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:28,792
Qi.

530
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:30,375
I’m with you.

539
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,250
Hey,

540
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:45,501
it’s late.

541
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,292
Why is Qi still in bed?

542
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,501
She was drinking last night.

543
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:51,667
I’ll wash this dress for her.

544
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,292
Do you think maybe you

545
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,584
could talk to her sometime?

546
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,792
She is a lady.

547
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:57,918
She shouldn’t drink

548
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,209
all day long and get drunk.

549
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,501

00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,918
she’s having trouble with

555
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,083
Bo Hai again?

556
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:14,167
I don’t understand

557
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,417
young people nowadays.

558
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:16,918
They fight today and make up tomorrow.

559
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,125
It’s perfectly normal.

560
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:19,626
That’s what they do on TV.

Qi.

580
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:46,751
All these reporters do

581
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,292
is exaggerating embellishment.

582
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:52,417
- Qi. - Qi.

583
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:53,918
In the eyes of the law,

584
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:55,751
there’s no way to avoid

585
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,125
paying damages.

586
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,459
With that kind of money,

587
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:00,876
the company’s cash flow

588
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,083
could be in trouble.

589
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:04,918
What happens

590
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,751
if we refuse to pay?

591
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,209
I’ve read this contract a dozen times.

592
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:09,834
The level of contract writing by

593
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:10,709
the other party is quite high.

594
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:11,417
Every word

595
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:12,626
is considered.

596
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:15,250
There is no loopholes

597
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:17,626
and no room for maneuver.

598
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,083
Once we’re indicted,

599
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,334
there’s a good chance

600
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,000
we’ll lose.

601
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:21,918
By then,

602
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,542
in addition to paying compensation,

603
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:24,918
there may be other

604
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,459
legal penalties,

605
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:28,459
which is not to our advantage.

606
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,167
Mr. Chen. Ms. Fang.

607
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:34,834
Where is Bo Hai?

608
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,584
Mr. Bo is in a meeting.

609
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,292
Why don’t I take you to leisure bar…

610
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:39,125
Move.

611
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:47,542
Bo Hai.

612
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,292
We’re not happy

613
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,292
with what you’ve done.

614
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,417
On behalf of all the directors,

615
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:53,542
we strongly question

616
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:54,083
the current state

617
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,501
of the company’s operations.

618
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:56,959
At next Monday’s meeting,

619
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:58,709
the board will discuss your impeachment.

620
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,542
We’re replacing the chairman.

621
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:08,834
That’s what capital is.

622
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:10,459
When we make money,

623
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,667
everyone takes us seriously.

624
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,584
Right now, they want

625
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,000
to skin us all.

626
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,209
We’ve tried everything

627
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:19,459
we can think of.

628
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,334
The only way to

629
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:22,751
avoid impeachment

630
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,584
is to get more votes.

631
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,375
But now these small shareholders

632
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:27,751
must be colluding.

633
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,125
They’re clearly trying to seize power.

634
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,918
We don’t stand a chance.

635
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,834
The only way out

636
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,459
is to sell the company to DREAM.

637
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:37,042
It’s a reasonable offer, after all.

638
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:39,083
Isn’t that

639
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,000
what DREAM wants?

640
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:40,918
You call that a solution?

641
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:43,167
If the board

642
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:44,459
fall into their hands,

643
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,918
they will band together

644
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,042
and lower the stock price,

645
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,209
or even initiate

646
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,167
a lock-up.

647
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:49,918
By then,

648
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,751
we’ll be literally out of options.

649
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:53,959
If we are gonna die anyway,

650
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,125
we might as well choose a better way.

651
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:15,209
I hear the board is impeaching you.

652
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:19,459
Is that it?

653
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,709
What about Zhou Xinyan and Chen Mo?

654
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:23,667
What can they do?

655
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,209
Why are you just uh-uh-uh?

656
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,584
Then why do you only ask questions?

657
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:31,792
Come.

658
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:33,918
Look at the flowers.

659
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:35,375
Eyes

660
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,417
are for appreciating beautiful things.

661
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,667
Don’t focus on what’s bothering you.

662
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:49,834
But what if

663
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:50,918
you do lose the company?

664
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:57,125
Then…

665
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,876
Then turn your dad’s shop into

666
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:00,876
a flower shop.

667
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:02,292
So the Relief Flower Shop

668
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,375
can finally have a store.

669
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,459
We don’t open chain stores

670
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,292
or go public.

671
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:07,918
Just a simple little

672
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:08,667
flower shop.

673
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:09,751
With flowers

674
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,792
to dissolve all the troubles and sadness,

675
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,250
and cure all the sorrows and pains.

676
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,584
Bring the simple little happiness

677
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:17,751
to everyone.

678
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:22,292
So, boss,

679
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,542
do you still need a wife?

680
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,417
Of course I do.

681
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:29,501
But,

682
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:31,542
first you need to wear your shoes right…

683
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,375
No, don’t look.

684
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:35,167
No.

685
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:36,584
OK, how about this?

686
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,876
Your boss give you a day off.

687
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:40,334
Go home and change your shoes.

688
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,751
And, by the way,

689
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,125
think about our

690
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:45,000
little flower shop.

691
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:46,000
More importantly,

692
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:47,792
stop worrying too much.

693
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,042
Nice shoes.

694
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:54,751
They are nice.

695
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:57,918
The popular yin-yang shoes.

696
00:36:59,209 --> 00:36:59,999
Take a walk. Let me see.

697
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:01,125
Don’t look.

698
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:52,375
Why torturing yourself

699
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,375
and making yourself so unhappy?

700
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:00,459
I am happy.

701
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,083
I won my first battle.

702
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:11,125
How could I not be happy?

703
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:16,209
Yeah.

704
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,501
Bo Hai is your enemy.

705
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:19,834
Ling Lingqi is the one

706
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,042
you’ve been chasing.

707
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,334
If this plan works,

708
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,667
doesn’t that give you what you want?

709
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:32,209
It’s a bet on

710
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:37,083
how much Qi loves Bo Hai.

711
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:41,626
I certainly hope that

712
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,459
my plan will succeed,

713
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,250
so that Qi will leave Bo Hai

714
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,417
and I can beat Bo Hai

715
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:51,792
and get FlowerPlus.

716
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,792
But I’m also scared that it works.

717
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:04,501
What are you afraid of?

718
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,959
I’m afraid

719
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:16,000
Qi will sacrifice herself

720
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,918
to protect Bo Hai.

721
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,000
Seats are still there,

722
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:43,250
but it’s a shame…

723
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:46,042
It’s not.

724
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:47,999
We just go back

725
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,167
to where we were.

726
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:58,542
What do you think

727
00:39:58,709 --> 00:39:59,709
Bo Hai’s chances are this time?

728
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,959
I don’t know

729
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,292
when everything started to change.

730
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,584
I want to go back

731
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:22,876
to the carefree

732
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:24,834
and simple us.

733
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,459
It’s too bad we can’t go back.

734
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:31,626
Keep reliving the past

735
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:32,501
is just torturing yourself

736
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,584
over and over again.

737
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:36,292
Stop it.

738
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,292
I’m glad I still have you, Qi.

739
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:56,125
I don’t know

740
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:57,792
what’s gonna happen next Monday.

741
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,167
One step at a time.

742
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,876
Worrying about the future

743
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:04,999
makes us can’t enjoy the present.

744
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,167
It’s urgent.

745
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,375
I can’t be relaxed like you do.

746
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,542
Bo Hai once told me

747
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:16,209
that he built FlowerPlus from scratch

748
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:17,667
and got where he is today,

749
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:18,542
in large part

750
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:19,918
because of his good luck.

751
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,209
So I’m pretty sure

752
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,999
he’s gonna get lucky again.

753
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:25,626
Yeah, right.

754
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,626
At this point,

755
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,209
talking about

756
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:30,334
strength and skill is useless.

757
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,334
We can only talk about luck.

758
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:35,292
Let’s not be so pessimistic.

759
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:36,667
You know, luck

760
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:38,083
is a part of strength.

761
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,334
Well, that’s a small consolation.

762
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:45,459
Pick one.

763
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,209
