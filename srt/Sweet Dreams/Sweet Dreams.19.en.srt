to a florist.

54
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,125
Just like taking a rocket.

That’s so fast!

Yeah.

Is Ling Lingqi really that skillful?

58
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:55,918
I don’t believe that.

Me neither.

60

Mr. Bo

61
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,501
must have lost his mind.

62
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,876
What the hell are you talking about?

66
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,167
excellent as Baoni.

Yeah, I’m just jealous.

70
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,459
Too jealous.

71
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,125
Jealousy is a morbid

72
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,501
appreciation sometimes.

73
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:27,876
That’s incisive!

74
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,459
Bootlicker.

75
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,626
It’s a great news,

Mr. Wen, I’m here

83
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,542
to thank you.

84
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:34,626
I heard

85
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,459
you resorted to many private resources

86
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,209
to help me gain publicity

87
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,751
in this competition.

88
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,751
You’re welcome. It was no trouble at all.

89
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:51,792
Thanks to Mr. Wen’s devotion,

90
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,334
our company made a great success this time.

91
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:58,167
Oh right,

92
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,792
I heard you’re in poor health recently,

93
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,834
so I bought you tuber fleeceflower root,

94
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:03,667
to relieve your pressure.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,999
Time and tide wait for no man.

96
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,626
You’re not young

97
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:08,584
like us anymore.

98
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,209
Take care of yourself.

99
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,626
I’m leaving now.

100
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:12,751
Thanks, Mr. Bo.

101
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:15,626
Oh,

102
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,501
when I was little,

103
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,167
I was very good at a game –

104
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:21,375
Hide and Seek.

105
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,250
I heard people from DREAM

106
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,709
like it too.

107
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,751
Mr. Wen,

108
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:37,334
what does he mean?

109
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,334
It’s a provocation.

110
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,667
He should know

111
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,626
there is someone else

112
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,125
working for DREAM here except me.

113
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,459
I’ve been calling Qi the whole afternoon.

114
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:58,417
She didn’t answer.

115
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,792
Or you can go tell her

116
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,042
this great news

117
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:02,834
once you get back tonight?

118
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,999
Better not.

119
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,334
I mean…

120
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:11,792
You wanna give her a surprise

121
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,083
tomorrow morning, do you?

122
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:14,334
Yep.

123
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,417
Good idea.

124
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,417
What’s wrong with you?

125
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,501
I’m on diet, didn’t have lunch.

126
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,042
I feel dizzy.

127
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:30,584
You’re not fat,

128
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:31,834
why on diet?

129
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,959
You boys all like slim girls,

130
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,209
don’t you?

131
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,542
Who told you that?

132
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,876
Not me. I don’t

133
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,167
like skinny.

134
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,417
I think you look good in this way.

135
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,417
Also,

136
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,876
it’s not worthy harming your body

137
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:46,626
to lose weight.

138
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,999
Compared to the slim and pretty one,

139
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,584
I more like the Lu Baoni

140
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,959
I used to know,

141
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,501
who wiped her greasy hands

142
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,083
with her clothes.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,125
Why is it suddenly raining?

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,959
Hurry, run!

145
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:39,918
Get in here.

146
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:43,459
Why is it suddenly

147
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,501
raining so heavily?

148
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,167
Are you all right?

149
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,000
Can you run?

150
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,042
Go.

151
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,083
Hurry.

152
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:18,584
Watch it.

153
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:21,999
We’re here.

154
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:24,000
It stopped.

155
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:25,250
Yeah.

156
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,334
How come it stopped so soon?

157
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:29,042
Nothing.

158
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:30,876
Go back.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,042
My mission accomplished.

160
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:35,417
I’m leaving.

161
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,125

hit on you.

this useless

171

No! No! No!

00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,542
You got a beginner’s luck today,

178
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,334
I’m free tonight.

179
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:49,792
What story

180
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:50,626
for this bouquet

181
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:51,626
today?

182
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,167
No story.

183
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:56,417
It’s for …

184
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:58,709
A friend.

185
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:00,751
A friend?

186
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,042
What a vague answer.

187
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,792
Let me see which friend  she is.

188
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:12,584
Red carnation,

189
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:13,751
means appreciation.

190
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,999
Pink lily,

191
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:18,876
pure and lovely.

192
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,167
And fleur-de-lis here,

193
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,209
means team work.

194
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,125
Ling Lingqi for sure!

195
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:34,709
Don’t deny it.

196
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:36,792
Your flowers have betrayed you.

197
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,167
Don’t move.

198
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,542
Orange rose.

199
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,417
First love!

200
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,250
Orange rose is not only first love,

201
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,959
it also means youth.

202
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:01,751
You know?

203
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:02,459
Fine,

204
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:03,999
if you say so.

205
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,083
Your finger all right?

206
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,292
I’ll find you a Band-Aid.

207
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:25,292
Here for you.

208
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,959
Qi, Qi.

209
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,999
You don’t have to do this anymore!

210
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,083
Then what should I do?

211
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,459
I’m the new intern here.

212
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:34,334
Secretary Chen asked me

213
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,709
to make coffee for everyone.

214
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,459
You are

215
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,042
a real florist now!

216
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,417
Wait a moment.

217
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,501
I’m a

218
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,792
real florist now?

219
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,999
Seriously?

220
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,542
Here, slap me.

221
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,125
No, it’s true.

222
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:51,000
Mr. Bo promoted you.

223
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,000
Now everyone in the company knows that.

224
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:53,792
Really?

225
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,250
Is that true?

226
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:58,918
What should I do?

227
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,584
The waterfall bridal bouquet

228
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,626
fits you better,

229
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:05,959
because you’re slim.

230
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,834
From the overall effect,

231
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,167
I recommend you

232
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:09,834
to select a wedding dress

233
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,250
with long tail.

234
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:14,999
I’m a florist?

235
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,209
I’m a florist now?

236
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,083
Yeah, what?

237
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,334
I announced it yesterday.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,292
I take back the mean words

239
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,125
I said to you before.

240
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:24,417
You finally did

241
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,417
a right thing!

242
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:32,334
Sorry!

243
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:40,834
Excuse us.

244
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,083
It’s OK.

245
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,042
This florist is so cute.

246
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,292
Yeah, probably

247
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,584
only those who’re passionate

248
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,250
about work and life

249
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,626
can deliver good things with flowers.

250
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,580
= Florist Ling Lingqi =

251
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,542
Ling Lingqi, a florist.

252
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,999
Congratulations!

253
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,209
Hope you become more and more beautiful.

254
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:36,999
Mo Nan.

255
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,584
Hurry up.

256
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:47,918
Qi, we came early this morning

257
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,501
to decorate your position.

258
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,959
I got a new computer

259
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,959
for you from HR.

260
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,209
Tool kit, notebook, and tissues

261
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,083
are all in place.

262
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,459
Check what else you need,

263
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,751
just tell us.

264
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,083
Thanks.

265
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:01,542
This is a crystal vase

266
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,417
I bought in Europe,

267
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,417
and now I give it to you

268
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,334
to present your masterpiece.

269
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,626
Thanks, it’s nice.

270
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:11,459
Qi,

271
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,459
actually the first time I saw you in the company,

272
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,709
I knew you will be somebody.

273
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,918
Really?

274
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:20,209
Then why didn’t you tell her until today?

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,626
I…

276
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:27,501
For you.

277
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,083
You start a whole new life

278
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,542
since you become the hottest girl here.

279
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,000
Congratulations, Hot Qi.

280
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:33,626
Our Marketing and HR

281
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:34,584
have decided to hold

282
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:37,209
a grand but small sharing session.

283
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:38,876
You will be the lecturer

284
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,000
to share your experience for success

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,292
with everyone.

286
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,125
We sincerely invite Miss Ling Lingqi

287
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,167
to share her experience of

288
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,918
exceptionally

289
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:46,834
becoming a florist.

290
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,292
Well,

291
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,834
I just got promoted recently,

292
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:52,542
so…

293
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,667
I’ll check on my schedule

294
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,000
to see if I can spare some time.

295
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,000
Qi,

296
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,876
everyone in the company now

297
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:09,918
is eager to see you

298
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:10,876
in the sharing session.

299
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:12,792
Please give us a chance

300
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,417
to learn.

301
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:17,876
Qi, don’t forget the well-digger

302
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,999
while you drink the water from it.

303
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:23,459
For the sake

304
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,918
of your gift,

305
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,125
I won’t forget you.

306
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:27,542
Don’t listen to him.

307
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,834
I picked the gift.

308
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,375
I paid it.

309
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:34,375
Give me one more.

310
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,918
Remember to use it

311
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,209
for seven consecutive days.

312
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,417
Got it.

313
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:45,000
Qi is promoted,

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,417
and I’m so happy.

315
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,667
I’m very happy.

316
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,334
We are under her swing from now on.

317
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,834
How about we go out

318
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:54,626
and have a big meal to celebrate it?

319
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:55,209
Great.

320
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,334
What would you like?

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,709
Crab?

322
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:00,209
Qi is the one got promoted,

323
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,876
yet we two go have a big meal,

324
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,959
don’t you think

325
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,167
we need more  rightful excuses?

326
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,334
We’re not getting marriage license,

327
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:06,918
what rightful excuses do we need?

328
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:07,792
Also,

329
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,834
it’s not the first time.

330
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:12,459
Yi.

331
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:16,375
Well…

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,042
I got something to tell you.

333
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,083
Let’s have lunch together.

334
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,000
OK, OK.

335
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,501
Illusion. It must be my illusion.

336
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,501
Qi, your parcel.

337
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,209
Where there is a dream,

338
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:53,751
there is sunshine.

339
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:55,751
Relief Flower Shop?

340
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,792
Mr. Relief florist sent you flowers again?

341
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,667
Seems he’s celebrating

342
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,083
you becoming a florist.

343
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:04,125
He’s paying close attention to you.

344
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,167
How could he know

345
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,334
I’m a florist now?

346
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,709
These flowers are quite fresh.

347
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,667
No way!

348
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:02,083
I’ll wait for you in the Glass House.

349
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,542
Hurry up. I’m already here.

350
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:08,709
Where are you?

351
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:35,000
You’re looking for me?

352
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:39,626
I helped you in the competition,

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,584
can’t you just say “thank you”

354
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,792
personally in front of me,

355
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:46,375
Mr. Relief florist?

356
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,459
You wanna deny it?

357
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,876
Keep the secret for me, can you?

358
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,667
So the previous flowers,

359
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,709
it was also you?

360
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:04,250
You’ve been helping me all the time?

361
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:10,792
Thanks.

362
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:14,834
You’re welcome.

363
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:16,709
You also helped me

364
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:17,417
in the competition,

365
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,834
so we’re even now.

366
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,083
We’re even?

367
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,959
What do you mean we’re even?

368
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,584
I helped you, and you helped me.

369
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,292
This is the interaction

370
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,999
between the hero and heroine in love movies.

371
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,292
We’re even?

372
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:37,667
I scolded you so many times before.

373
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,000
Why didn’t you just tell me??

374
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,999
What are you hiding?

375
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,876
I don’t want to reveal my scar,

376
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:50,876
and I don’t want the others

377
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,375
to see my weakness.

378
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:00,876
You’re not perfect.

379
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:02,959
You have flaws.

380
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,292
You’re not always brave.

381
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,375
You’re weak sometimes.

382
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,999
You’re not capable

383
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,125
of everything.

384
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,584
Sometimes you lose your bearings.

385
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,834
But this is the real you.

386
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,042
Compared to

387
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,209
you in the posters and TV,

388
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,250
I like the vivid you

389
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,751
in front of me more.

390
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,083
One thing you said about me is wrong.

391
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,667
You said when I can

392
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,209
stop fancying about you,

393
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:30,792
I can become

394
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:31,834
a real florist.

395
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,375
Actually I chose to learn floriculture

396
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:37,709
and became fond of it,

397
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,334
till now,

398
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,667
I’ve become a real florist.

399
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:44,542
It’s all because of you.

400
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:58,125
Because of you,

401
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,375
I’ve found the meaning of my life.

402
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:00,999
Because of you,

403
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,417
I’m no longer naive,

404
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:03,751
or self-willed.

405
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:06,792
Because of you,

406
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,417
I’ve become a better me.

407
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,792
You’re no longer my idol.

408
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,834
You’re my ideal.

409
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:46,674
♪ How long one flower has to blossom ♪

410
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,925
♪ Before it’s seen by another one ♪

411
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:52,918
It seems

412
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,250
I’m in love with Bo Hai.

413
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:57,375
The real Bo Hai.

414
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,709
The ice cream in the summer,

415
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,459
the sugar roasted chestnuts in winter,

416
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,501
the lid of yogurt,

417
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,751
fresh fried chips,

418
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,250
the shrimp meat in the dumplings,

419
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,876
and the popping candy in mouth,

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,042
are nothing compared with you!

421
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,022

422
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:20,937

425
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,834
Go back to your work.

426
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:32,334
Did you say the wrong line?

427
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:33,792
The background music

428
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,999
is not in the chorus yet!

429
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,375
Get back!

430
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:37,417
Bo Hai!

431
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,000
What would you like for lunch, Baoni?

432
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,042
Thai or Sichuan cuisine?

433
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,375
How about the urban square?

434
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:49,667
We got more choices there.

435
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,542
I don’t wanna go there.

436
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,125
You said you got something to tell me?

437
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:57,626
Yeah, well…

438
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,667
Your performance is the last

439
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,959
in your department.

440
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:02,667
Pay some attention to it.

441
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,459
I finished.

442
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:03,792
No.

443
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:05,417
Baoni.

444
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:06,999
You said we’re having lunch together.

445
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:07,459
Baoni?

446
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:19,125
Seems I’ve wronged Bo Hai

447
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,167
all the time.

448
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:21,751
Now the air is cleared.

449
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,876
I must have some misunderstanding

450
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:25,834
in my feelings.

451
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,959
I’ve wronged him all the time.

452
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,042
I’ve been single too long,

453
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,709
and my brain is a mess.

454
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,167
From now on,

455
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,709
I’m gonna take moves on Bo Hai.

456
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,167
It’s time to make a boyfriend.

457
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:38,584
My feeling to Bo Hai

458
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:39,417
is no longer

459
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:40,292
the admiration

460
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,083
of an idol like before.

461
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:42,584
It’s love.

462
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:45,709
Love?

463
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:46,501
Because of him,

464
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:48,959
I’ve become a better me.

465
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,459
So I’m gonna

466
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,125
pursue my love bravely.

467
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,667
Wait.

468
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,334
You said

469
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,584
you’ve got the love,

470
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,542
isn’t it a little earlier to say?

471
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,876
It’s much easier for a woman to pursue a man,

472
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:06,125
but you need tactics  too.

473
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,626
You can’t just get close to him directly,

474
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,876
but show your personality and charm

475
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:11,292
in good time.

476
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,167
You should let him

477
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,125
fall in love with you before he notices it.

478
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,501
I have rich experience in it.

479
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,334
Let me be your adviser.

480
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,125
Before discussing love,

481
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,459
let me eat something.

482
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,459
You foodie.

483
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,209
Thank goodness

484
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,417
I got the last one.

485
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:51,834
You’re my best friend.

486
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,667
It’s glutinous,

487
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:00,250
yummy!

488
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,501
You dog!

489
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:04,125
Qi!

490
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:05,167
What?

491
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,000
It was supposed to be the last one,

492
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,751
but considering

493
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:08,751
your cute face,

494
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,542
I created one more by magic.

495
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:11,751
Happy?

496
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:16,167
That’s more like it.

497
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:18,417
You happy?

498
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,334
For the sake of the rice roll,

499
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:24,709
I forgive you.

500
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,167
Thank you, my fairy.

501
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:27,375
Cheers.

502
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:27,959
Cheers.

503
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:30,918
What time is it?

504
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:35,459
Half past twelve.

505
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:38,626
Half past twelve?

506
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,417
I have an appointment with Yi

507
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:41,334
to meet a client at 1:00 p.m.

508
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:42,292
Help me off.

509
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:44,501
I’m leaving.

510
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:45,751
- Bye. - Bye.

511
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,792
Slow down,

512
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:48,876
you just had a meal.

513
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:49,584
Got it.

514
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,250
The headquarter didn’t blame you

515
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,083
for your failure.

516
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,375
William hopes

517
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,626
you can pull yourself together

518
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,292
and take further moves on FlowerPlus.

519
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,918
He didn’t blame me

520
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,083
directly

521
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,542
but pressured me.

522
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,709
This is his style,

523
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,626
isn’t it?

524
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:17,667
But

525
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,083
he’s quite mercy on you,

526
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,709
you’re his favorite man anyway.

527
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:25,125
Right,

528
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,584
I heard Ling Lingqi

529
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:29,584
helped Bo Hai a lot

530
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:30,667
during the competition.

531
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:32,334
So,

532
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:34,626
she’s automatically on

533
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:35,918
our enemy’s side.

534
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:39,292
It was just

535
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,417
a coincidence.

536
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,375
Mr. Mo.

537
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:46,459
You

538
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,375
seem to be in love with Ling Lingqi.

539
00:25:57,584 --> 00:25:58,584
I remember you said,

540
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,083
for people like us,

541
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,292
it’s a horrible thing

542
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,042
if we can’t stay awake all the time.

543
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:06,292
If you keep tangling with Ling Lingqi,

544
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,501
I’ll be worried for you.

545
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,834
The most horrible thing for people

546
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,375
is not the mistake they make,

547
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,584
but lacking the courage to correct it.

548
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:21,375
Don’t worry.

549
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:23,751
I know what to do.

550
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,375
Baoni said

551
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,000
she’d be my adviser!

552
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:36,334
It’s been two hours.

553
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:37,959
She’s still in the meeting room.

554
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,876
But I got my cellphone!

555

= How to capture a boy’s heart =

556

To capture a boy’s heart,

557
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:02,860
you gonna capture his stomach first.

558
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:09,918
Speaking of food,

559
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,125
I’m second to no one!

560
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,459
Seems I gotta prepare a family feast.

561
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:40,042
Thanks.

562
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,751
Your goal achieved,

563
00:28:00,876 --> 00:28:02,042
and my wish fulfilled.

564
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:03,083
Good things come in pairs.

565
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,751
Shall we go have dinner tonight?

566
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:06,417
Thanks for your kindness.

567
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:07,999
I got more important

568
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,125
matters tonight.

569
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,542
It won’t take you much time.

570
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:15,125
You can’t skip dinner.

571
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:16,626
I’m not hungry.

572
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:18,292
I can do a lot of things

573
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,542
in dinner time.

574
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,626
What time for dinner?

575
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:35,375
And where?

576
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,542
Mr. Bo.

577
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,501
I’ll go to your office later

578
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:47,834
to discuss

579
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,042
the planning case for next quarter.

580
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:50,542
I got an appointment tonight.

581
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,375
Let’s discuss it tomorrow morning.

582
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,083
What to do?

583
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:01,999
My heart is beating fast.

584
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:05,834
How  come you are here?

585
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,100
= Hall 5 Large Screen =

586
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,626
Imported movie.

587
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:11,626
They say the visual effect is amazing.

588
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,334
Go enjoy your time for two.

589
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,250
What’s wrong with you?

590
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:16,250
We don’t even have time

591
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,918
to finish this TV play.

592
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,584
You’re throwing money away!

593
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:20,334
We’re not going.

594
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:21,918
No,

595
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,292
I paid nothing for them.

596
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,292
The company gave them to me.

597
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:25,626
Two tickets.

598
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,834
See, they’re for free.

599
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,999
Also the tickets for this movie

600
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,167
are hard to buy.

601
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:32,292
We’ll think about it.

602
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:33,417
Yeah.

603
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:34,667
You’re creating time

604
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,834
for two of us,

605
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,250
so what about you?

606
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,459
When will you be on a date?

607
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,918
Only you two go out,

608
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:42,999
I got time to worry about myself.

609
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:44,876
It’s OK.

610
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,334
It’s on in half an hour.

611
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,000
Hurry up, Mom!

612
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,876
Take a taxi.

613
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:48,959
You’re getting late.

614
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:49,709
OK.

615
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:51,584
The time for two.

616
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,125
Keep an eye on the shop.

617
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,542
Sure.

618
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,959
Be careful when collecting the money!

619
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:55,959
Yeah, I will.

620
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:56,959
Don’t worry.

621
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:57,999

Excuse me, aunt,

652
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,375
do you know

653
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:21,999
where is Unit 3, Building 5?

654
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:23,083
It’s …

655
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,334
Who are you looking for?

656
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:28,999
202.

657
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,334
202?

658
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:32,125
The Lings?

659
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:37,876
Are you looking for Ling Lingqi?

660
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:38,999
Yeah.

661
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,792
The third one on your left.

662
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:44,083
That way?

663
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:44,751
Yeah, right.

664
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:45,542
Thank you, aunt.

665
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,042
No problem.

666
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,876
Oh my goodness.

667
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:56,042
How this pretty young lad

668
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,501
likes Ling Lingqi?

669
00:31:59,167 --> 00:31:59,709
Fattie,

670
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:02,751
do you think he likes Ling Lingqi or not?

671
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,834
I don’t think so, either.

672
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:15,167
You’re here.

673
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,501
Hi.

674
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:48,876
You made all of these?

675
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,501
Yeah, of course.

676
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,459
You call this a simple meal?

677
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,083
Yes, it is.

678
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,542
I eat this much every day.

679
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,417
Let me introduce them to you.

680
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,167
Shrimp with curry chicken.

681
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:16,999
Stewed tofu with peach.

682
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:18,959
Tea noodles.

683
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,083
Cumin popcorns.

684
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,209
Fried cucumber with pineapple.

685
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,417
And a special dish prepared for you,

686
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:28,459
cold spicy strips.

687
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,999
Simple and worldly happiness.

688
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:39,834
You sure

689
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,167
I would still be alive

690
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,918
after eating them?

691
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,459
I bet you can’t stop eating.

692
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:46,542
Go ahead.

693
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:50,876
OK.

694
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,918
How is it? Good?

695
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:13,792
I told you!

696
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:14,334
These are all

697
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:15,375
my classic dishes

698
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,167
after many years of

699
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,999
practice.

700
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,334
I created them

701
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,375
in a flash of inspiration.

702
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,209
They are masterpieces to be handed down.

703
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:26,626
Actually,

704
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:27,999
cooking needs creation,

705
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,876
just like floriculture.

706
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,334
As an art practitioner,

707
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:33,417
I, Ling Lingqi,

708
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,584
am never short of creation.

709
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,584
Is it that good?

710
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,876
Makes you wanna cry?

711
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,876
Really that good?

712
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:00,209
Mustard.

713
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:01,918
Mustard?

714
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:03,250
Gosh.

715
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,334
I took the mustard oil

716
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,375
as sesame oil.

717
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:15,834
They’re the same…

718
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:21,584
You old goat.

719
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:22,709
All you know

720
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,250
is staying in your little shop

721
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,250
and counting money.

722
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,375
You won’t spare some time for a movie.

723
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,167
Unromantic.

724
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,667
I didn’t have time to wear my coat.

725
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,334
I’m cold.

726
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:31,584
See? You’re shivering.

727
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,042
Let’s go back!

728
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:33,834
Get more clothes.

729
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,501
It’s really a bit cold.

730
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:38,209
Better than the dishes

731
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:39,167
in some fancy hotels, are they?

732
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:41,000
It’s been a long time for me

733
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,042
to have such delicious meal.

734
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:43,083
Of course.

735
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,667
Cooking is like floriculture.

736
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,042
You should use not only your hands and brain,

737
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:52,250
but also your heart and feelings.

738
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:55,959
Except for this spicy strips…

739
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:56,667
Never mind about that.

740
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,083
I invented it today.

741
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,792
How about I

742
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,042
deep-fry it next time?

743
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:04,999
Stir-fry?

744
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:08,709
Don’t ruin my appetite for spicy strips.

745
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,542
OK. OK.

746
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:15,667
You full?

747
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,999
Do you wanna go  take a walk

748
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,042
at the riverside?

749
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,876
I know a place

750
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,334
where we can overview

751
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:30,167
the night scene of the whole city.

752
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:43,334
Qi.

753
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,334
Qi, we’re back.

754
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:48,083
Qi?

755
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,125
Come on!

756
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:57,459
Get up!

757
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,667
Hurry, this way!

758
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:02,584
Here, here!

759
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:03,209
What?

760
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,542
Shut up.

761
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:08,667
No! No!

762
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:10,108
Come on!

763
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,209
Here, here!

764
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:12,330
Hurry! Hide!

765
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,334
Get down!

766
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:14,334
Hide!

767
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:16,709
Take this.

768
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:17,999
Why am I hiding?

769
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:18,459
Hurry up!

770
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,918
Get in! Get in!

771
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,042
Get in!

772
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,709
My dear! My dear?

773
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,250
- My dear. - Qi.

774
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,667
We’re back.

775
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,542
You’re back.

776
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,334
You eat alone?

777
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:34,918
So many dishes?

778
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,250
Extravagant!

779
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,250
I’m promoted

780
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,250
to a florist today.

781
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,501
So I want to

782
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:41,709
celebrate it with you.

783
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:42,459
Should you be watching movie now?

784
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:43,918
Why come back so soon?

785
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:45,042
Ask your dad.

786
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:47,542
We don’t like watching movies.

787
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:48,584
We sold

788
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:49,999
the two tickets you gave me

789
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,626
to a young couple

790
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:51,751
at a discounted price.

791
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:53,792
They need that more than us.

792
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,334
Then I come back with your mom

793
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:55,959
hand-in-hand.

794
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:57,167
We had our romantic hours,

795
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,375
also earned 40 yuan.

796
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,375
Killed two birds with one stone.

797
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,375
Don’t you think

798
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,751
your dad is great?

799
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:02,792
Yeah, great.

800
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,959
Who was having romantic hours with you?

801
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:05,751
I said since we’re here, let’s stay and enjoy it.

802
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:06,542
But he just didn’t want to.

803
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:07,999
So we come back to have dinner.

804
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,459
You should watch.

805
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,250
Why only two bowls?

806
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,000
I’m waiting for you two.

807
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,125
I’ll get another bowl.

808
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:17,999
Sit.

809
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:25,209
Mom.

810
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:26,626
They look great.

811
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:27,584
Qi,

812
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:29,834
I told your dad on the way

813
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,292
about the tickets.

814
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:32,501
Were they given by Bo Hai,

815
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:33,667
so he hinted you

816
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:34,751
to go out with him

817
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,042
but you gave it to us?

818
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:39,209
No, Mom. It’s not what you think.

819
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,584
Look, you’re so good at cooking.

820
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,918
You always cook for us.

821
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But it’s meaningless.

822
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:45,584
Yeah.

823
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:46,626
You should cook

824
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:48,209
for your boss.

825
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,792
Show yourself.

826
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:51,542
Mom, your idea

827
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:52,584
is creepy.

828
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,125
Too suggestive.

829
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,417
Suggest what?

830
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,999
You said it many times

831
00:38:58,999 --> 00:38:59,834
that you wanted to cook for your boss,

832
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:00,999
and something like this.

833
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,792
What are you doing?

834
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,292
Are you crazy, Qi?

835
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,250
Don’t howl anymore! The wolves are coming.

836
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,000
Qi, I’m telling you.

837
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:09,501
You should really

838
00:39:09,918 --> 00:39:11,000
invite your boss

839
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,667
to come here for dinner.

840
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,000
After dinner,

841
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,209
you can say,

842
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,125
Mr. Bo,

843
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,000
shall we take a walk

844
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:19,167
to digest the dinner?

845
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:22,125
You said you know a place

846
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:23,751
with perfect angle to overview

847
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:25,876
the night scene of the whole city?

848
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,667
Right.

849
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:28,125
Mom,

850
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,167
did you peep at my lines?

851
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,209
You’re rubbing salt on my wound you know?

852
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,125
She must have peeped at my lines.

853
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,501
The chopstick is off. I’ll pick it.

854
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:44,792
Mom, I’ll pick it! I’ll pick it!

855
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:45,959
Don’t move! Don’t move!

856
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:46,792
It’s here.

857
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:52,959
What? Did you see a ghost?

858
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:53,709
Let me see.

859
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:56,626
You scared me!

860
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:57,417
Uncle.

861
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:00,792
Get out!

862
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:03,501
Come on!

863
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:04,626
Stop, both of you!

864
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:05,209
Qi!

865
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:07,125
I’m getting mad.

866
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,250
Qi, stop!

867
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,709
Qi, stop there!

868
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:13,417
- Stop! - Stop!

869
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,209
Where are we going?

870
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,459
Here. Come on!

871
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,125
Wait, this way!

872
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,709
Head down.

873
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:27,751
Stop!

874
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:29,792
Here, get in.

875
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,667
- Qi! - Stop running!

876
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:36,667
What are they running from?

877
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,334
Right.

878
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,000
We won’t interfere

879
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,375
them getting on a date.

880
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah.

881
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:43,125
There, check there.

882
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,167
Why are they running?

883
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,542
What are we running from?

884
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:48,542
My mom.

885
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:49,375
We’ll be dead if got caught by her.

886
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:52,083
I feel complicated now.

887
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,209
They’re here.

888
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,125
Hurry!

889
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:15,000
It’s not what you think, Mom!

890
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,667
Ba Hai, Bo Hai.

891
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:18,042
You can’t leave.

892
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,120
Dad! Bo Hai!

893
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,999
Dad! Dad!

894
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,167
Come on, stop him!

895
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:25,999
Grab Bo Hai!

896
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,292
Bo Hai, you can’t leave!

897
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,459
Come back!

898
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:29,918
Qi! Qi!

899
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:30,918
Get off me!

900
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:31,334
Mom!

901
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:34,792
Guoliang, you stop Bo Hai!

902
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:35,834
What’s going on?

903
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,626
Don’t drag me!

904
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:38,667
Bye.

905
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:40,167
Come back!

906
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:42,250
Breaking them up?

907
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:43,834
Caught in bed?

908
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:45,125
No!

909
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,334
Buy or sell by force?

910
00:41:58,584 --> 00:41:59,083
Badass.

911
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:03,792
