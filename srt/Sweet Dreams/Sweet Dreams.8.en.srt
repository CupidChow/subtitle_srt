52
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,999
That or this way?

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,501
Oh my gosh!

54
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,918
It scared me.

55
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:04,959
Haven’t you been taught

56
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:05,999
not to touch others’ stuff

57
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,501
without their permission?

58
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,375
You walk like a cat

59
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,375
with no sound at all!

60
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,417
I didn’t intrude.

61
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,167
Your front door is

62
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:15,918
widely opened.

63
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:16,876
I thought something happened to you.

64
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,000
So I let myself in.

65
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:19,834
There are some rules,

66
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:20,709
you know about that?

67
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,000
What rules?

68
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:23,667
I’ll say only once.

69
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,125
You better note it down.

70
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,417
You gotta be prepared

71
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:32,334
my agenda of the day and report to me’

72
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,042
every morning at 7 o’clock.

73
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:35,709
Before the weekly conference,

74
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:37,250
you need to gather the trends of

75
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,709
the industry in the world

76
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,042
and new works from masters

77
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,834
and make it slides for my reference.

78
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,292
In addition, you must keep

79
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,000
all the company’s products in mind,

80
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,459
I will check at any time.

81
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,209
Have you noted down

82
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,792
what I just said?

83
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:58,459
Only these?

84
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,042
You tell me.

85
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:03,999
From now on,

86
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:05,292
you will be in full charge

87
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,209
of all matters

88
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,667
related to my work,

89
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:08,999
anything that comes to my mind

90
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,125
or not.

91
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,542
You’re on call whenever

92
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,959
on weekdays or weekends,

93
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:13,876
’without complaints.

94
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,375
Anyway, you’re gonna live

95
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:17,667
an action-packed life in the following days.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,167
You wanna see me change?

97
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:42,959
Get it dry-cleaned.

98
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,542
I’ll do it tonight.

99
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,125
Isn’t that Qi?

100
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,459
Why is she behind Chomper?

101
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,209
You know about that?

102
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:21,751
No.

103
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,167
Morning.

104
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:33,626
Mr. Bo,

105
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,250
this is the total sales in the previous quarter.

106
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,250
It can be seen that

107
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,209
big customers have contributed a lot

108
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,834
to the company’s visibility,

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,042
but our profits are still mainly

110
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,459
from individual customers

111
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,792
who order flowers monthly.

112
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,375
And the sales of flower derivatives

113
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,083
is also promising.

114
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:00,999
Assistant Ling,

115
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,542
get Mr. Bo a cup of coffee.

116
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:11,459
Bo Hai,

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,459
Ling Lingqi is so clumsy,

118
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:14,959
how could she be a good assistant?

119
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,459
How about transfer her to the marketing,

120
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,417
I’ll keep an eye on her.

121
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:20,709
No need.

122
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,000
An employee like her who has

123
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,042
a simple mind and developed limbs,

124
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,792
and doesn’t know to act according to face,

125
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,459
I’d better teach her myself.

126
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,375
I feel pity for her,

127
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,334
really.

128
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,250
Who said

129
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,459
she was gonna quit

130
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,667
no matter what happens

131
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,417
and never regretted it?

132
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,834
Yeah.

133
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,584
What happened?

134
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,584
I don’t want to talk about it.

135
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:06,417
You don’t have to.

136
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,459
Someone must be regretful,

137
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,626
insisting on staying here.

138
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,667
Actually I didn’t want

139
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,083
to come back,

140
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,459
but Mr. Bo said

141
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,834
the company can’t work without me.

142
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,667
You know?

143
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:20,834
He came to my home.

144
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,626
He was crying like a baby.

145
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,667
My heart got soft seeing him like that

146
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,334
so I came back.

147
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,000
Cut the crap!

148
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,209
Mr. Bo begged you back?

149
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,125
We don’t believe it.

150
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, you got any proof?

151
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,375
You can do that?

152
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,375
I’ve already got promoted!

153
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,918
Mr. Bo cried to beg me back,

154
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:36,999
what proof you need?

155
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,834
I’m telling you,

156
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:39,667
he was there in my home,

157
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,459
begging me

158
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,792
in tears.

159
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:42,626
I’ll play it for you.

160
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,542
He was like this,

161
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,501
grabbing me and didn’t let go…

162
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,209
That’s enough. Stop!

163
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,209
Hey! They’re watching.

164
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:47,792
What’s wrong with you!

165
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:48,709
He was like this,

166
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,167
dragging my legs and said,

167
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,167
Ling Lingqi, I’m begging you.

168
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,459
You must come back.

169
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,501
I can’t work without you.

170
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:54,083
Chomper kneeled

171
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:54,417
in front of me like this.

172
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,459
What are you doing, Ling Lingqi!

173
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,083
It’s work hour.

174
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,999
Look at you!

175
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,125
Introspect yourself!

176
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:01,792
What’s wrong?

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,125
They’re jealous

178
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,417
if I don’t tell them,

179
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,000
but once I tell them…

180
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,125
Well…

181
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,334
I suddenly come back,

182
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,792
and got promoted.

183
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,250
These colleagues

184
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,501
must be curious.

185
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:35,501
But I

186
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:37,083
can’t tell them the truth,

187
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,459
so I had to make it up.

188
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,042
Actually in some way

189
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,417
I’m helping you.

190
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:45,959
So,

191
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,459
I should thank you?

192
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:50,834
You’re welcome.

193
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,167
It’s my pleasure.

194
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:54,292
Well,

195
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:57,834
since you like talking so much,

196
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,540
= Collection of Floral Materials =

197
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,083
go recite

198
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,209
the whole

199
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,000
Collection of Floral Materials.

200
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,876
How? It’s too thick.

201
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:09,334
Boss,

202
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,250
the meeting is all set.

203
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,125
Let’s go.

204
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:16,918
I’ll quiz you before getting off work.

205
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,042
If you’re wrong about one question,

206
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,626
handwrite the whole book three times.

207
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,626
Basic management of flowers…

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,542
Boss,

209
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,626
I got one question but I don’t know

210
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:32,375
should I ask you or not.

211
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,334
Then don’t ask.

212
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:35,834
If I don’t,

213
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,999
I’ll feel uncomfortable.

214
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,125
You know

215
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,000
there are many ways

216
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:39,959
to shut her up,

217
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,167
but why you choose to

218
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,542
keep her around?

219
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,250
Are you afraid her letting out the secret

220
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,375
or for personal reasons?

221
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,709
I find you

222
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,209
quite leisure recently.

223
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,375
You spend time on these trifles?

224
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,250
We’re short of hands in marketing.

225
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:58,334
Go help them.

226
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,167
You send me

227
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,542
to work under Zhou Xinyan?

228
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,334
No! It’s all my fault, boss.

229
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:07,167
Ling Lingqi

230
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,375
said that?

231
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:09,876
Absolutely true.

232
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,334
I heard it with my ears.

233
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,292
Mr. Wen, no matter what Ling Lingqi said

234
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,125
is true or not,

235
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:15,751
but Bo Hai suddenly

236
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,876
promoted her as assistant,

237
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,751
it’s quite suspicious.

238
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,125
Both of you,

239
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,083
keep an eye on Ling Lingqi.

240
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:23,501
Yes, sir.

241
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,083
I’m waiting to see

242
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,501
what’s between

243
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,250
the two of them.

244
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,000
Baoni!

245
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:45,167
Baoni!

246
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,709
This is the lobsters and an apple

247
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:47,250
I ordered for you!

248
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,542
Baoni, here is the Sashimi

249
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,584
I bought from Japanese restaurant.

250
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,292
Try it.

251
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:50,876
Baoni,

252
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,083
This is the drumstick I prepared.

253
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,250
It’s local chicken, quite nutritious!

254
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,292
- Have mine! - Have mine!

255
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:54,834
Have mine!

256
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,834
- Have mine! - Have mine!

257
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:57,751
Have mine!

258
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:58,876
OK, stop!

259
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,501
Thanks for

260
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,417
your kindness.

261
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,000
But I’m on diet recently.

262
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,584
I only eat vegetables.

263
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,792
Thank you!

264
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,959
She took my apple!

265
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,834
Lu Baoni,

266
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,334
that bitch can do nothing but

267
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,751
flirting with men.

268
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:26,999
Agreed.

269
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:28,501
Even an honest man

270
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,751
like Wang

271
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,417
got obsessed by her.

272
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,501
Let’s see how she’s gonna end it.

273
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,250
Stop gossiping.

274
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,751
I think Lu Baoni is pretty

275
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:39,834
and nice,

276
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,667
it’s quite normal to be popular with men.

277
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:45,876
You have such a good temper,

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,292
that’s why you got bullied.

279
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,125
Baoni!

280
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:53,709
Baoni! Baoni!

281
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:54,959
Have mine. Have mine.

282
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,167
What is it?

283
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,584
It’s just an expression.

284
00:11:58,999 --> 00:11:59,876
Have you noticed

285
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,918
that your popularity

286
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,667
in the company

287
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,709
is so

288
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:05,834
hateful!

289
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,125
What could I do?

290
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,751
They mean good.

291
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,959
I can’t shut them out.

292
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,417
You’re really something.

293
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:17,834
But I need to tell you,

294
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,542
sometimes

295
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,999
a cold rejection

296
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,667
is a mercy compared with

297
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,250
unnecessary gentleness.

298
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,542
Can you speak Chinese?

299
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, it’s normal

300
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,999
you can’t understand what’s said

301
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,334
by a literate cute guy like me.

302
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:36,626
I mean,

303
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,042
don’t play ambiguous.

304
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:41,125
It will get you trouble.

305
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:42,501
Think about it.

306
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:43,501
I’ll deliver lunch to Qi.

307
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,000
Bye.

308
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,334
Dramatic.

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,167
Thank you, Mo Nan.

310
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,000
If it wasn’t you,

311
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:03,125
I could be

312
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,626
starved to death.

313
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:08,334
What important task

314
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,876
Chomper gave you?

315
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,334
You have to work so hard?

316
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,626
Nothing to talk about…

317
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,501
He’s taking revenge on me.

318
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:23,667
Qi,

319
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:27,542
you suddenly quitted

320
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,042
and then

321
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,667
came back again,

322
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,417
isn’t that something to do with

323
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,083
what happened in the venue that night?

324
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,584
You knew it?

325
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,042
Listen to me,

326
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,292
if you have anything to share,

327
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,292
I’m always here.

328
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,459
Don’t close yourself off,

329
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,375
you can tell me about it,

330
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:58,751
maybe I can make some help.

331
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,918
I can’t tell you this.

332
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,626
Even if I tell you,

333
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,999
you can’t help me.

334
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:15,292
So don’t ask.

335
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,125
Never mind if you don’t wanna talk.

336
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:21,667
Anyway keep that in mind,

337
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,834
no matter what happens,

338
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:24,834
Baoni and I

339
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,584
will always back you up.

340
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,709
Rest assured. I know that.

341
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,292
It worked,

342
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,501
really.

343
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,250
Look at me.

344
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:40,751
Look at my face.

345
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,792
Yeah, it’s true.

346
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,542
Your skin is smoother.

347
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:44,250
Check it out.

348
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:44,876
Let me see. Let me see.

349
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,459
Check it out.

350
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,375
I got several speckles here.

351
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,000
Now it’s gone.

352
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,375
Now,

353
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,250
it takes nothing to brag,

354
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,918
you can say anything you want.

355
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,667
My darling

356
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,375
got me a lot of cubilose

357
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,459
from somewhere.

358
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,959
He said it’s best for women to eat.

359
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,167
I’ve had it for a few days,

360
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,209
never thought it has such good effect.

361
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:06,375
My speckles are gone.

362
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,542
My skin got exquisite.

363
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:08,959
Especially my face,

364
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,876
smooth and elastic.

365
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,125
I heard they say

366
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,125
cubilose is good for women.

367
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:14,834
Yeah.

368
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:15,792
It’s magical.

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,542
Look,

370
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,167
people in our ages have this

371
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,501
will look like 10 years younger,

372
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,167
never to mention those young girls.

373
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:23,959
Will they become fairies?

374
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:25,250
Li Lijun,

375
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,375
where did you

376
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:28,876
buy the cubilose?

377
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:30,876
Where?

378
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,083
You don’t have to know.

379
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,999
You can’t afford it.

380
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,792
Why can’t I afford it?

381
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,375
I’m telling you,

382
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,584
my daughter is dating a millionaire.

383
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,167
If they get married,

384
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:42,334
cubilose is nothing,

385
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,667
I can buy as much as I want.

386
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,501
If your daughter

387
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:48,250
can marry a millionaire,

388
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,375
then I…

389
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:51,709
Then I can marry

390
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,417
the president of America!

391
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,584
Believe it or not.

392
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,834
Maybe my daughter

393
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,334
is dating

394
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,125
with him

395
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,626
somewhere now.

396
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,260
= Collection of Floral Materials =

397
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,042
Penglai, also known as monstera,

398
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,542
and monstera deliciosa,

399
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,417
has thick stems and leaves,

400
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,542
and the leaves are oval or heart-shaped.

401
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,417
I just had a short nap.

402
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:21,709
You recited it all?

403
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,125
Almost.

404
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,792
Only reciting is useless.

405
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,999
Here, Seven Heroes and Five Gallants.

406
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,542
Take Bai Yutang and

407
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,334
Zhan Zhao as examples,

408
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:33,042
find the floral materials

409
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,459
which match their temperaments,

410
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,417
and tell me why.

411
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,626
Begin!

412
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:52,584
Only Winter Sweet

413
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:53,584
blossoms in snowy winter.

414
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,709
Winter Sweet is arrogant by nature,

415
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:57,000
and would rather break than bend.

416
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,792
It often blooms alone after snow,

417
00:16:58,918 --> 00:16:59,667
indulged in self-admiration.

418
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:01,083
And Bai Yutang,

419
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,834
became famous when he was young,
proud and arrogant,

420
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,209
but also a righteous man.

421
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,667
Isn’t he like a uncompromising Winter Sweet

422
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,125
distinguished from its kind?

423
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:10,999
What about Zhan Zhao?

424
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:23,626
Calamus?

425
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,417
The calamus is soft and tough,

426
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,417
firm and tenacious.

427
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:29,292
It’s inconspicuous at first sight,

428
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,792
but when putting it with the others,

429
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,417
it always stands out.

430
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,792
Even the ancients felt

431
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:34,792
it’s upright in nature

432
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,876
and used it as a spirit herb

433
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,918
to drive away evils and diseases.

434
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,876
Isn’t it

435
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,167
the upright and impartial Zhan Zhao?

436
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,292
Well, you scraped through.

437
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:46,834
Don’t be happy early.

438
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:48,751
Water all the flowers

439
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:49,626
before you get off work.

440
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,459
Jackass.

441
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:56,417
Badass.

442
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,626
Back from work?

443
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,417
Yeah, I’m back.

444
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,375
You had dinner?

445
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,125
Yes, we had.

446
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,417
Honey, our daughter is back.

447
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:19,167
I know.

448
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,626
Qi, check what your capable mom

449
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,125
made for you!

450
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:32,959
No need to check.

451
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:33,709
Must be

452
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:34,751
some cans close to expiry.

453
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,501
How could I always

454
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:39,918
feed you with expired cans?

455
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:41,334
It’s

456
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,709
cubilose.

457
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,751
Cubilose?

458
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,501
You hit the jackpot, Mom?

459
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,834
You made me cubilose?

460
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,292
I don’t have to hit the jackpot.

461
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,584
I’d spend anything

462
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,626
on my baby girl.

463
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,959
Have it.

464
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,000
You’ll become prettier after eating it,

465
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,626
then you will get a rich husband.

466
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:02,334
How is that?

467
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,083
Why it tastes…

468
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,709
Why it tastes

469
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,000
so familiar?

470
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,417
Did I eat cubilose before?

471
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,167
It’s not cubilose.

472
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,999
It’s minced tremella.

473
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,167
Ling Guoliang!

474
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,000
Why are you lying to me, Mom?

475
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,876
Do you know

476
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,125
what has the same effect

477
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,667
and nutrition as cubilose?

478
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,375
Tremella!

479
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,876
Bingo!

480
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:32,999
Here, Mom.

481
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,292
I don’t wanna eat it. You have it yourself.

482
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,334
Have some more.

483
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,959
It makes you beautiful and keeps you young.

484
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,999
Mom, you should have it in your age.

485
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,999
It’s yucky.

486
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:50,250
Is it expired?

487
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:52,709
Tremella won’t expire.

488
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:18,375
Gosh!

489
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:47,792
Oh my goodness!

490
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,250
I’m so sorry.

491
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,626
I was planning to

492
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,959
have the roof repaired.

493
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,250
But who knows it suddenly rains.

494
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:58,834
Don’t worry.

495
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,667
I got the whole set outfit for you.

496
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,459
I promise you will be

497
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,167
safe and sound tomorrow.

498
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,334
I’m Monkey King.

499
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,542
Welcome to Water Curtain Cave.

500
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,209
Sit down.

501
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,292
I’ll make sure you

502
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:10,542
live through tonight safe and sound.

503
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:11,709
Oh my goodness.

504
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:12,709
My socks got wet.

505
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,417
Come, shelter from it

506
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,334
as much as you can.

507
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Are you all right?

508
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:21,417
I think I got no other places

509
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:22,709
to stay tonight.

510
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:31,292
Wait up.

511
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,709
Wait a minute. Wait for me.

512
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,459
Where are you going?

513
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:57,918
Mo Nan!

514
00:21:58,918 --> 00:21:59,999
Come over!

515
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:07,999
Come on.

516
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:12,542
Be careful.

517
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,167
Oh my goodness.

518
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,292
Qi, you’re great.

519
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:26,501
Isn’t it like camping

520
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,167
now?

521
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:28,667
Yeah.

522
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,918
But if it gets darker,

523
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:31,626
it would be great.

524
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,918
Better no.

525
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,626
If it gets darker then…

526
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,042
Oh, you jinx!

527
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:46,292
Oh my goodness,

528
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,250
what’s that?

529
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,375
What’s that?

530
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,209
What is it?

531
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,417
- I’m scared. - Qi.

532
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,042
Let go.

533
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,501
Qi.

534
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:03,667
Qi, we got a light.

535
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:04,999
Light, light.

536
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:06,167
Check there.

537
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,000
There, there!

538
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,542
What? Nothing there.

539
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,709
I’m scared.

540
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,999
I’ll check around.

541
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,250
OK.

542
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,083
Check there!

543
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:20,125
Nothing here.

544
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:21,792
You scared me.

545
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:24,792
There is nothing.

546
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,250
Is the main switch off?

547
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:33,667
Someone

548
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,042
may get it repaired later.

549
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,459
It’s okay.

550
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,459
It’s good like this.

551
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:41,876
I remember when I was little,

552
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,083
my dad often

553
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,125
took me camping.

554
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,918
Every time when I was in the tent,

555
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,834
it’s pretty much like this.

556
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,209
At night,

557
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,584
my dad would teach me

558
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:55,999
to know flowers and plants,

559
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,501
identify constellations,

560
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:00,501
and this.

561
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,250
Easy.

562
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,459
Move the ears.

563
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:10,792
That’s impressive.

564
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:14,209
Quite vivid.

565
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,334
What about now?

566
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,042
You dad still takes you camping?

567
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,250
My dad’s passed away.

568
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:34,709
I’m sorry.

569
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:36,834
It’s all right.

570
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,584
It’s been a long time.

571
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:47,000
Don’t be sad.

572
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,792
If you want to

573
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:48,709
go camping in the future,

574
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,501
I’ll go with you.

575
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,709
You said you fear of darkness,

576
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:55,042
how dare you come with me?

577
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:55,999
Well…

578
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:57,375
We can bring more lights

579
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,250
and candles.

580
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,000
That will be okay.

581
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,334
Camping is all like that.

582
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,125
Thank you, Qi.

583
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,876
I knew it!

584
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,834
It’s repaired.

585
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:20,667
That’s it.

586
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,083
Ling Lingqi, why you’re still up?

587
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:22,959
It’s late at night!

588
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:24,417
Auntie.

589
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,501
It’s my mom.

590
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,876
She’s scarier than darkness.

591
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:27,375
I’m going down.

592
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,501
I’ll get it repaired tomorrow.

593
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:30,792
Take the flashlight.

594
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:31,959
No need.

595
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:33,626
Be careful downstairs.

596
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:34,501
- OK, bye. – Bye.

597
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,125
- Be safe. - Bye.

598
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:36,751
Slow down.

599
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,542
You accuse me without proof,

600
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,500
but I have certain evidence to prove

601
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,020
your shop is selling counterfeit.

602
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,042
Have a guess whose loss is greater

603
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,417
if we expose these two things the same time?

604
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,292
Since you like talking so much,

605
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:13,375
go recite

606
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,626
the whole

607
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:15,918
Collection of Floral Materials.

608
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,667
I’ll quiz you before getting off work.

609
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:18,792
If you’re wrong about one question,

610
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,250
handwrite the whole book three times.

611
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,292
What you owe me

612
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,250
must pay me

613
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,209

Hope you

620
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,209
can be generous

643

your name, sir?

better not mistake anyone else for me.

00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:37,459
Can you feel

661
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:39,375
a breath of hatred?

662
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,542
Oh yeah?

663
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,250
I can feel

664
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,000
a breath of grievance.

665
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,125
What I’ve suffered these days

666
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:54,334
is more than

667
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,250
what I’ve suffered

668
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,918
in the last two decades.

669
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,375
Qi, it’s two decades and three years!

670
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,834
Does that matter?

671
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,709
Who made you sign the unequal treaty

672
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:06,250
that you can’t quit the job voluntarily?

673
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:09,751
Should I just

674
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:11,417
live the rest of my life

675
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:12,667
miserably?

676
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,918
Actually there is some way.

677
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,375
You got any idea?

678
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,542
You can’t quit voluntarily,

679
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:25,417
but,

680
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:29,959
you can make Chomper

681
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,042
get bored of you and hate you,

682
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,834
then he will fire you.

683
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:36,083
This

684
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,501
isn’t the breach of contract, is it?

685
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,042
Nan,

686
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,959
you’re really my bestie.

687
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,918
Wait for my good news.

688
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,626
Original for me.

689
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,209
Super spicy for Mr. Bo.

690
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:28,626
There!

691
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:50,667
Mr. Bo.

Your curry meal is here.

693
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:55,459
Put it here.

694

You can’t work without rest.

695
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,501
We can’t live without eating.

696
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:01,709
Have a rest.

697
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:02,584
Have lunch first.

698
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,125
Right.

699

00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,334
Okay.

703
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:11,584
Have your lunch.

704
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,083
Mr. Bo, here’s the report.

705
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,580
= Chicken Rice with Green Curry =

706
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,667
You finished?

707
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:52,709
Good?

708
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,292
Not bad.

709
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,375
You felt any difference than before?

710
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,125
What do you want to say?

711
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:03,459
Nothing.

712
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:04,876
Nothing.

713
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,626
It’s strange.

714
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,667
Why can’t he tell the difference?

715
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:34,083
One is spicy,

716
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:35,709
the other is original.

717
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,209
Is that he has no taste?

718
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,292
You’re playing tricks with me,

719
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:26,959
aren’t you?

720
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:29,959
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

721
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:31,292
You changed your spicy

722
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:32,876
meal with mine!

723
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:35,918
I knew it!

724
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:36,834
What file is so important

725
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,250
that you need in lunch time!

726
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:40,626
You bought me

727
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:41,459
super spicy food?

728
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:42,292
I did it for your good.

729
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,626
I wanna change the flavor for you.

730
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:44,501
Oh yeah?

731
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,250
But I think

732
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,042
you’re trying to irritate me

733
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:46,834
so I will fire you

734
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:47,834
in a pet!

735
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:48,792
Good idea.

736
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,792
But what you did is stupid.

737
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,000
I don’t get it.

738
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:56,417
Since you don’t like me,

739
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,042
why do you

740
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:57,709
keep me around?

741
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:58,542
I don’t like you, either.

742
00:36:58,542 --> 00:36:59,083
Why are we

743
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,209
torturing each other?

744
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,167
I think it’s fun.

745
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,459
I don’t think so.

746
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:05,876
Be careful

747
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,209
or I’ll tell everyone about the substitute.

748
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,083
Well, go ahead.

749
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:10,375
I got your whole family

750
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,167
with me.

751
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,125
I suffer no loss.

752
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:15,751
What?

753
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,334
Do you want me to help you

754
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:18,167
call the press?

755
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:19,834
Wait.

756
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:25,959
After a second thought,

757
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,542
I think

758
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,542
it’s a bad idea.

759
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,042
We’d better not

760
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:30,959
harm each other anymore.

761
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:32,751
It’s my fault

762
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:33,751
today.

763
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,751
Please be merciful

764
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,209
and spare me another chance.

765
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,834
But your attempt

766
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,334
to cause mental harm

767
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:44,626
to your superior

768
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:45,959
is an mischievous conduct.

769
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,459
I can’t let it go.

770
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,167
What do you want?

771
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:55,083
How about

772
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:56,834
deduct one month bonus first?

773
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,292
A stumble can prevent a fall.

774
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,459
Ling Lingqi just said

775
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,209
Bo Hai uses substitute?

776
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,626
This is a big scandal.

777
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:22,959
Never thought the famous

778
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,209
florist Bo Hai

779
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:25,250
is a hypocrite

780
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,959
who uses substitute.

781
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,000
Mr. Wen, how about

782
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:29,709
we disclose this news

783
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:30,626
to the press?

784
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:31,292
In this way,

785
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,667
Bo Hai will be totally over.

786
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:33,459
Right.

787
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:34,709
I’ll call the press

788
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:35,292
right now.

789
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:35,999
Come back.

790
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,209
You two have been around for such a long time.

791
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:43,417
Why you don’t learn things?

792
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:44,292
Mr. Wen.

793
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:45,918
It’s a great chance.

794
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,083
We can’t miss it.

795
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:49,083
The greater the chance is,

796
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:50,751
the more careful we should be.

797
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,375
Now all we got is just Ling Lingqi’s

798
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:54,959
empty words.

799
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:56,876
It doesn’t prove anything.

800
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:03,459
We gotta take the long view,

801
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:04,918
and give him a deadly shot,

802
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:09,626
so he will never start over.

803
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:18,792
Who is Miss Lu Baoni?

804
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:20,000
I am.

805
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:21,167
Here is a parcel for you.

806
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,250
Please sign your name here.

807
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:29,250
Here.

808
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:34,792
Thanks.

809
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:39,709
Baoni.

810
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:41,209
Who sent you that gift?

811
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,250
It’s pretty.

812
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:43,417
No need to ask.

813
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:44,459
It must be

814
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:45,334
one of her crazy fans.

815
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:52,792
What’s wrong, Baoni?

816
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,501
Are you all right, Baoni?

817
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:57,375
Who the hell

818
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,334
sent this disgusting staff?

819
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:00,751
Come, wipe it up.

820
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:01,417
I’m okay.

821
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:02,999
You okay?

822
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,125
Just a mischief.

823
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:05,250
No big deal.

824
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:06,751
I’m okay now.

825
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,999
All you know is flirting around,

826
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,417
now you’ve paid for it.

827
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:26,900
Baoni.

828
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,292
Baoni, we’ve heard of that.

829
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,125
Are you all right?

830
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:31,709
I’m fine.

831
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,751
That guy is villainous,

832
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:35,209
if we catch him,

833
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:36,459
we must give him a lesion.

834
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,667
Baoni, you don’t know

835
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:39,751
who sent you the parcel, either,

836
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:40,459
do you?

837
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:43,792
Could it be

838
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,667
one of my pursuers?

839
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,834
Love causes hate.

840
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:49,751
I hope he stay single

841
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,667
for the rest of his life.

842
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,459
But you better be careful

843
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:53,626
before we catch him.

844
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:55,334
Right.

845
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,751
Mo Nan.

846
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:57,584
Help me

847
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:58,709
take care of Baoni these days.

848
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,876
I’m worrying that freak

849
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,125
will get close to her again.

850
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,501
Will do.

851
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,918
If I find who he is,

852
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:04,834
I’ll give him a hard time.

853
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:07,751
Don’t worry about me.

854
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:08,751
I think

855
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,167
he just wants to frighten me,

856
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:11,459
and won’t do anything else.

857
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:13,167
Don’t be so… I’m telling you,

858
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,751
you’d better be careful.
