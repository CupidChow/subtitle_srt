Hello, boss.

178
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:40,709
Hello.

179
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:41,959
Excuse me.

180
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:42,792
Could you check

181
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:43,626
if this express was sent

182
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,834
from your place?

183
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:45,709
This...

184
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, it was.

185
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,584
Who sent it?

186
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,584
Do you still remember?

187
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:50,834
There’s no name on it.

188
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,250
I can’t remember.

189
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:53,250
Well.

190
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,125
Could you think about it?

191
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,626
What does that man look like?

192
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:56,667
A lot of people come here

193
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:57,375
every day.

194
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:58,709
I can’t remember.

195
00:10:58,876 --> 00:10:59,167
Sorry.

196
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,083
Please think about it!

197
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,375
I want to help,

198
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,999
but I really don’t remember.

199
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:04,042
Fine, then.

200
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:04,751
Sorry.

201
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:05,375
Sorry for the trouble.

202
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,375
It’s okay. See you.

203
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,083
What have you got?

204
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,834
Boss, I’ve got nothing.

205
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,459
I guess this clue will be useless.

206
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,375
Okay. I see.

207
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:19,999
Okay.

208
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:37,209
What’s wrong?

209
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:38,584
Nothing.

210
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:40,167
By the way,

211
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:41,918
have we received

212
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,751
the flowers from Xingli?

213
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,751
Huang Xingfa

214
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:46,000
keeps his word.

215
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,709
All flowers arrived this morning.

216
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:48,667
They can be sent to all shops

217
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,709
this afternoon.

218
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,792
Keep a close eye on each link.

219

Don’t let down your guard.

You feel

221
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,083
something wrong?

222
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:02,918
I’m not sure.

223
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,834
But I just feel

224
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:06,667
it’s going too smoothly.

225
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,417
One, two, three.

226
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,501

236

Bravo! Bravo!

Don’t try to leave

unless you explain to us.

239
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,125
Calm down, everybody!

240
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:08,083
Take it easy.

241
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:09,626
We ordered

242
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:11,250
high-quality flowers.

243
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,292
But look at these!

244
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,542
What did you send me?

245
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,709
What are these?

246
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:15,876
What the hell!

247
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,918
You sold bad flowers at high prices!

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,375
You’ve made us

249
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:19,792
almost lose everything!

250
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:21,042
We run the flower shop

251
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,751
with honesty.

252
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:23,501
We will never

253
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:24,834
do such a thing!

254
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,209
How dare you deny!

255
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:27,959
I don’t mean that.

256
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:28,417
Compensate us!

257
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:28,959
Compensate us!

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,918
We’re not leaving

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,042
unless you compensate us!

260
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:31,626
Yes. We’re not leaving.

261
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,709
The TV said your mom was a fraud.

262
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:34,959
My mom isn’t a fraud.

263
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,167
Your mom is!

264
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,626
You’re a little fraud!

265
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,417
No one believes you!

266
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,999
Yes! Little fraud! Little fraud!

267
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,334
Little fraud! Little fraud!

268
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,250
Little fraud! Little fraud!

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,876
You’re back, Hai.

270
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:52,417
I made you

271
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,709
your favorite soy-braised pork.

272
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:00,626
What happened to your face?

273
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,250
Had a fight?

274
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,209
Hello?

275
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,876
I see. I’ll be right there.

276
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,292
Hai, I must go to the shop.

277
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,334
Have dinner yourself.

278
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,709
It won’t be long.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,542
Mom!

280
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:38,834
Mom!

281
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:20,626
Why did you come here?

282
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:23,876
I went to the library.

283
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,751
I’ve known everything.

284
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:29,999
I’m feeling bad.

285
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,584
Let me hug you for a while.

286
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:33,542
Just a little while.

287
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,042
Listen to me.

288
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,792
I don’t care what you’ve known.

289
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,459
I just want to advice you.

290
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:46,375
Don’t waste your time

291
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:47,834
on me.

292
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,999
No matter how long you wait

293
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,167
or what you do,

294
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,209
I will never change my decision.

295
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:54,999
Neither will I.

296
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:56,667
I like you.

297
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,459
Whatever others say or do,

298
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,250
I will not change my decision.

299
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,626
But in love, when you step forward,

300
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:04,626
I should step forward, too.

301
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,501
If you step forward while I step backward,

302
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,000
what will you get?

303
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,083
Then I’ll keep stepping forward

304
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,959
until you stop stepping backward.

305
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,334
Don’t you understand what I mean?

306
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:15,959
There’s no happy ending.

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,542
Why must you continue?

308
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,125
I’ve been hurt all over.

309
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,542
I’ll...

310
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:33,709
I’ll never meet you again.

311
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:52,959
Qi, let’s go.

312
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,542
Qi, he doesn’t deserve

313
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:45,501
your tears.

314
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,918
You know?

315
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,501
In my heart,

316
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,542
I have a girl I like.

317
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,626
But I keep the love

318
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,918
deep in my heart.

319
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:33,751
Because I love her,

320
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:35,834
I hope she can

321
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:36,959
live a happy life,

322
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,042
even though

323
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,584
she doesn’t like me.

324
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,125
But I realize I’m wrong.

325
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,709
I let her

326
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,542
waste her love and time

327
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,083
on a man who doesn’t like her

328
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:59,083
and always suffer.

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,918
This is harm, instead of love.

330
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:07,667
So, I don’t want her

331
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,626
to be hurt again.

332
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,459
Qi.

333
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,876
I’m talking about you.

334
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,292
I like you.

335
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:26,751
I can’t stand it

336
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,000
when Bo Hai fools you.

337
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,501
He isn’t good enough for you.

338
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,999
You’re saying this,

339
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,125
possibly because

340
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,250
you’re out of your mind.

341
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,292
You’re too excited.

342
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:46,209
Qi!

343
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,042
I’m serious.

344
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,125
We’re friends, Mo Nan.

345
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,417
You don’t even know

346
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,000
what kind of man

347
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,167
Bo Hai is!

348
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:00,876
He...

349

Qi, forget him.

350
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,167
Be my girlfriend

351
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,417
so that I can protect you, okay?

352
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,209
No!

353
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,876
No. No way!

354
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,042
If you keep being so obstinate,

355
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:26,334
you will regret!

356
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:32,959
Oh, I think

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,167
I need to go back to the shop.

358
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:35,626
Go to bed early.

359
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,834
When you wake up next morning,

360
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,125
you’ll regain consciousness.

Yes.

But don’t think

370
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,876
you can get away

from killing my dad.

372
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:21,918
When you killed him, you should know

373
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,083
you and your son

374
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,501

Last night...

379
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,999
I almost forget

380
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,375
whatever happened last night.

00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:46,334
the captain of the basketball team

394

who chased you for four years

395

in the college?

396
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,375
Yes. What’s wrong?

And I think

505
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:29,834
Chomper has

506
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,667
lost his head

507

As time goes by,

509
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:35,000
I think

510

they’ll soon be together.

Why could you be so careless?

It’s okay.

514
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,501

00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:17,334
Don’t you think

525
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:18,667
we should celebrate?

526
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,042
We should!

527
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,459
Enjoy yourselves!

528
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:23,209
All on Mr. Bo, okay?

529
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,542
Great!

530
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:25,792
Cheers!

531
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:26,292
Come on.

532
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,209
Cheers.

533
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,459
What good luck we have!

534
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:37,083
We aren’t involved in this incident.

535
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:37,959
Yeah.

536
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:39,959
Customers who used to visit other flower shops

537
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:40,918
ordered bouquets from our shops

538
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:41,834
this year.

539
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:42,959
We have sold more bouquets

540
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,042
than the past years.

541
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,000
It means

542
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,167
Xingli offered bad flowers

543
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,459
to all the other flower shops,

544
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:50,959
except ours?

545
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:52,209
Yeah.

546
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:58,250
I received it, too.

547
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,751
How is it possible?

548
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:00,667
Is it true?

549
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:01,083
How could they do that?

550
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,918
Aren’t they starting a rumor?

551
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,380
Yeah.

552
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,876
= FlowerPlus and Xingli Bullied Small Shops =
Yeah.

553
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:04,860
= FlowerPlus and Xingli Bullied Small Shops =

554
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:06,918
How come?

555
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:12,876
According to an informant,

556
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,250
the bad flower incident

557
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,751
happening today,

558
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,959
was an evil plan from

559
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,918
Xingli Flower and FlowerPlus.

560
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:19,667
FlowerPlus wants to occupy

561
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,334
all the market share of Valentine’s Day

562
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:23,292
with such an undue conduct

563
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,584
and harm the benefits of small flower shops.

564
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:26,918
This was exactly

565
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,999
what Yunhe Flower Shop did

566
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:29,999
twenty years ago.

567
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,584
Meanwhile, the informant says

568
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,250
CEO Bo Hai of FlowerPlus

569
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,834
who is behind all this

570
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,876
turns out to be the son of Lu Yunqing,

571
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,125
the founder of Yunhe Flower Shop.

572
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,125
Our reporter has checked and confirmed that

573
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:41,667
the boss of Xingli Flower, Huang Xingfa,

574
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:43,834
has already disappeared.

575
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:48,709
Go tell Bo Hai!

576
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:51,584
Look!

577
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,834
What’s wrong?

578
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:53,542
Look!

579
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:54,667
What happened?

580
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:55,792
Look!

581
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:56,459
It’s him!

582
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:58,042
It’s him!

583
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:58,542
How could he do that?

584
00:30:58,876 --> 00:30:59,375
Just this shop!

585
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:00,751
Sir, here is your bouquet.

586
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,000
You can just pay at the counter.

587
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,626
No. No.

588
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,542
We don’t want it.

589
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:05,459
We can’t buy bouquets here.

590
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:06,334
Let’s go!

591
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:06,792
Don’t buy anything.

592
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:07,834
Let’s go.

593
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,250
This is customized for you.

594
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:10,000
How can you

595
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,709
just refuse to pay?

596
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:11,501
Screwed! Screwed!

597
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:12,751
Manager, look!

598
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,209
What should we do?

599
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:21,999
Lisa, give me the coat.

600
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:23,083
Lisa.

601
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:24,417
Thank you.

602
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:25,834
Manager, where are you going?

Small shop owners like us

605
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,417
took all the trouble to raise the fund

606
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,459
and run the shop.

607
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,751
I had planned to make money on Valentine’s Day

608
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,667
and repay the loan.

609
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:37,959
Unexpectedly, I can’t repay the loan.

610
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,334
And I’ll even lose my shop.

611
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:40,083
What happened?

612
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,918
Bo Hai is

613
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,542
behind all this!

614
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:43,999
There he comes!

615
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:45,999

with the bad flower incident.

619
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:51,083
We have never

620
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,417
and we will never do anything

621
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,292
against professional ethics.

622
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,834
Mr. Bo, according to the informant,

623
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:56,918
you are the son of Lu Yunqing,

624
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,626
the founder of Yunhe Flower Shop.

625
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:58,667
Is that true?

626
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,167
So, his mother

627
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,292
was a fraud!

628
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:02,709
Yeah. She was a fraud!

629
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,626
What do you want? Want a fight?

630
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,083
We want justice!

631
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:07,375
You fraud!

632
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,209
We want justice!

633
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,417
You fraud!

634
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,709
Fraud!

635
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:11,626
Give the refund!

636
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,250
The TV said your mom was a fraud.

637
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,334
My mom isn’t a fraud.

638
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:30,417
Your mom is!

639
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,709
You’re a little fraud!

640
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,334
No one believes you!

641
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,375
Yes! Little fraud! Little fraud!

642
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,751
Little fraud! Little fraud!

643
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,918
Little fraud! Little fraud!

Bo Hai!

648
00:32:58,542 --> 00:32:59,000
Bo Hai!

649
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,501
Bo Hai, open the door.

650
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:04,834
I know you are home.

651
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:10,959
Open the door,

652
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:11,792
or I won’t leave

653
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:12,709
until I see you.

654
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:19,876
I’m fine.

655
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,834
The reporters and shop owners

656
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,375
said something bad today.

657
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,417
Ignore them.

658
00:33:57,751 --> 00:33:59,083
They were so angry

659
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:00,959
that they spoke without careful diction.

660
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,501
I’m tired.

661
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:06,792
Leave me alone.

662
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:09,042
I’m going to sleep.

663
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:10,709
Bo Hai.

664
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:12,876
I believe

665
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:13,542
you didn’t collude with

666
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:14,501
Xingli Flower.

667
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,834
Since we can’t change the past,

668
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:20,584
let’s try hard

669
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,125
to change the present and future.

670
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,042
If this incident

671
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:25,709
can help you

672
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,501
accept the past,

673
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,751
it will also be a good thing.

674
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,250
I’m leaving then.

675
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:01,709
I’ll leave you alone.

676
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,292
It feels so good

677
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,334
to see my enemy in trouble.

678
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:48,999
If there’s another choice,

679
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,667
I don’t want you to be involved in

680
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,292
such evil tricks.

681
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:55,626
I helped you

682
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,334
find your father’s old colleague.

683
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:00,167
I wonder if I helped you

684
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,292
or hurt you.

685
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,959
William, don’t say that.

686
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:07,042
You stopped me,

687
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,667
but I insisted on

688
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:09,876
taking care of

689
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,125
FlowerPlus acquisition project.

690
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,834
This time,

691
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:15,375
you helped to find out the truth

692
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,751
twenty years ago.

693
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,250
I’m truly grateful.

694
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,375
Since you funded for

695
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:23,375
my college,

696
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:24,999
you’ve helped me a lot.

697
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:27,125
I’m grateful to you!

698
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,999
How would you hurt me?

699
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,125
Lu Yunqing was the one

700
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,542
who truly hurt me.

701
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,999
Since she escaped her due punishment,

702
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,876
I’ll make her son pay the price.

703
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:52,999
Hope you will not regret

704
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,334
what you’re doing now.

Getting more excited?

711
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:46,999
Well, stop! Stop!

712
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:47,959
Have some rest.

713
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:48,834
Stop! Stop!

714
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:49,792
Okay. Have some rest.

715
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,709
We’ll have some rest, too.

716
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:53,459
Turn the music off.

717
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:54,375
Okay. We’ll have some rest, too.

718
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:58,542
How indifferent you are!

719
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,250
Your daughter is going to lose her job.

720
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:01,042
But you’re still

721
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,667
enjoying the square dancing.

722
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:03,667
My daughter

723
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,167
has a desirable job.

724
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,250
Even if all your families lose your jobs,

725
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,918
my daughter will still work.

726
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,667
Someone is always jealous.

727
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:12,709
Aren’t you just

728
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,125
being jealous?

729
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,999
Who do you think

730
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,292
you are talking about?

731
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,000
You have no idea, don’t you?

732
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,375
Let me show you.

733
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,125
Come on. Let me show you.

734
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,000
It’s big news on the Internet.

735
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:25,125
Ling Lingqi’s company

736
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:25,999
is suspected of fraud

737
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,709
and harmed many small flower shops.

738
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,042
Read it carefully.

739
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:30,334
Bo Hai and his mother

740
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,834
are frauds!

741
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:32,584
So many people

742
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:34,125
are going to take revenge.

743
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,542
You still think

744
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:36,667
I’m jealous?

745
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:37,125
You...

746
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:38,751
But...

747
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:42,959
Everything was fine yesterday.

748
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,209
Why did it happen

749
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,584
so suddenly?

750
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:47,083
Give it back.

751
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,375
Don’t waste my data plan.

752
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:00,959
Do you think

753
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,834
our company is going to fail?

754
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:05,250
Shut up!

755
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:06,542
It’s been long

756
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,959
since we sold bouquets last time.

757
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:10,501
Do we need to find another job?

758
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,667
I’m saving money for an apartment.

759
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,542
I can’t lose my job.

760
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:17,999
Don’t be ridiculous.

761
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:19,918
This is just a misunderstanding.

762
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,083
Everything is going to be fine.

763
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:22,667
It’s no big deal.

764
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:24,876
How dare you buy their bouquets!

765
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,334
Listen to me!

766
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,834
This is a defrauding shop.

767
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,083
They make dirty money!

768
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:30,834
They sell bad flowers at high prices.

769
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:31,792
If you buy their bouquets,

770
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:32,334
go have a look.

771
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,125
You’ll just have bad luck.

772
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:34,220
Don’t buy any!

773
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,792
= New Arrivals =

774
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:35,918
= New Arrivals =
If you buy their bouquets,

775
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,792
you’ll have bad luck at home.

776
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:38,999
What’s wrong with you?

777
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,542
Why talking nonsense in front of our shop?

778
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:41,792
What nonsense?

779
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:44,125
This is a defrauding shop!

780
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,334
You colluded with Xingli Flower

781
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,667
and sold bad flowers at high prices.

782
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:48,959
Small flower shop owners like us

783
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,417
have lost all our business.

784
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:51,209
You know what?

785
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,292
I’ll stand here for the whole day.

786
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:54,584
When we do no business,

787
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,250
you won’t do any, either.

788
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,542
Manager, what should we do?

789
00:39:58,751 --> 00:39:59,459
Get him a chair.

790
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:00,792
You two, go get him a chair.

791
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,250
And you, go get some hot water.

792
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,709
Get him a chair?

793
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:04,876
It’s okay. Just go!

794
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:05,584
Go!

795
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:09,209
Calm down! Don’t be angry.

796
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,501
Did you buy any bouquets

797
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:12,375
from our shop?

798
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,584
Yes.

799
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:14,417
If anything goes wrong

800
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,542
with our bouquets,

801
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:16,417
we will take

802
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:17,375
full responsibility.

803
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,083
She looks generous.

804
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,626
Yeah. She’s a nice person.

805
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,125
They even get him a chair!

806
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:23,834
What are you doing?

807
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:25,918
Didn’t you say

808
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,250
you would stand for the whole day?

809
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:27,999
When you’re tired,

810
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,292
you can sit down for some rest.

811
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:30,417
And it’s cold.

812
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,083
Have some hot water to warm yourself.

813
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:32,918
If you’re tired

814
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:33,999
with sitting out here,

815
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:34,751
you can also come in

816
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:35,626
and have some rest.

817
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:37,584
Everybody, welcome to our shop

818
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,167
and enjoy the flowers.

819
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:40,167
Thank you.

820
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:41,375
Let’s go.

821
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,292
Go! Go!

822
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,125
I think he just came to start a rumor.

823
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:54,125
Manager, that was a good move!

824
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:54,876
That man

825
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,459
stops yelling immediately!

826
00:40:57,918 --> 00:40:58,876
