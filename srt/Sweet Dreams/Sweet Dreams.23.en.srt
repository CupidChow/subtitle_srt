= Episode 23 =

51
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,626
You’re right.

52
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,292
Wen Guangqi hurt the girl

53
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,292
he shouldn’t have hurt.

54
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,501
So, I had to kick him out.

55
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,918
But through this case,

56
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:54,918
I’ve realized my true heart.

57
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:58,918
I can

58
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,125
shut down a company

59
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,334
within one month,

60
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,292
turn expensive shares

61
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,292
into useless paper,

62
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,626
and even fire thousands of employees

63
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:09,918
once at a time,

64
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,834
but I can’t let go of Ling Lingqi.

65
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,000
Mr. Mo, in this case,

66
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,209
why don’t you…

67
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,167
I know what you’re going to say.

68
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,083
Don’t worry.

69
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,417
I’ll keep a balance between them.

70
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,584
When you make up your mind,

71
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,042
no one can change it.

72
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,334
Wish you a speedy success.

73
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:46,751
On which do you mean?

74
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,042
On chasing Ling Lingqi,

75
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,334
or on acquiring FlowerPlus?

76
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:55,709
You have no idea.

77
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,334
Chasing a girl

78
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,792
is much harder than acquiring a company.

79
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,125
I’m sure

80
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,042
Bo Hai likes you.

81
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,626
Don’t listen to Mo Nan.

82
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,709
He was talking nonsense.

83
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,626
He was just talking nothing,

84
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,167
but sour grapes.

85
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,999
We’re talking about Bo Hai.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,999
Don’t bring Mo Nan up.

87
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,626
How do you explain

88
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:23,667
Bo Hai’s secret love?

89
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,959
Qi, you mean

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,834
Bo Hai likes to

91
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,167
flirt with women

92
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,709
and he’s a bad ass?

93
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,000
What do you mean

94
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,250
a bad ass?

95
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,083
He just has universal love.

96
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:37,876
He’s so handsome.

97
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,000
A lot of girls like him,

98
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:39,918
don’t they?

99
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,417
And he must show them

100
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,918
his care,

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,959
so that they could feel

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
how sweet it is.

103
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,250
Am I right?

104
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:48,584
Song Lingling.

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,375
Are you nuts?

106
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,417
Ling Guoliang, say that again!

107
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,125
I will!

108
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,083
Ling Guoliang!

109
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,542
Well, I think… I think…

110
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:05,209
Qi.

111
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,918
Do you get it wrong?

112
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,125
Secret love

113
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,751
can be a total misunderstanding.

114
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,209
I think so. It’s possible.

115
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:15,792
What’s that?

116
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,834
Evil plan of the rival in love.

117
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,584
Yes. I’m going to

118
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:25,542
have a full set of spa.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,751
I’ll be right there.

120
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,918
I have an important activity tomorrow.

121
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,751
Do me a favor.

122
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,375
Thanks. See you later.

123
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,792
The team building

124
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:44,083
isn’t that important, is it?

125
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,125
To you, it is not.

126
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,334
Are you…

127
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,709
Are you going to play tricks again?

128
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,584
Stay out of this.

129
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,375
If you’re free,

130
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:02,834
care more about yourself.

131
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:03,751
You’re no longer young.

132
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,918
But you still have no girlfriend.

133
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:05,792
I… I…

134
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:06,375
What do you mean

135
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,292
no longer young?

136
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,042
I’m still young, all right?

137
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:10,542
Don’t you even know

138
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,626
what you really are?

139
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:12,167
Bye-bye.

140
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,792
What? You…

141
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,626
I’m so pissed off!

142
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,417
I’m handsome, aren’t I?

143
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:30,792
You have such a poor taste.

144
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,918
These are all the things you bought me.

145
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,334
Baoni, what do you mean?

146
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:47,626
I mean

147
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,167
I’m going to say goodbye

148
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,042
to my past.

149
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,834
Excuse me?

150
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,459
Anderson, sorry.

151
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,667
I never like you.

152
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,751
I used to think

153
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:05,918
all these gifts

154
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,417
presented love.

155
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,584
But later I realized that

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,999
they’re nothing,

157
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,667
but bags, shoes or perfumes.

158
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:19,751
And you…

159
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,792
Do you really like me?

160
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,667
You like me,

161
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:25,918
just because

162
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,292
I’m a beautiful girl.

163
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,334
Does anyone of you care for me?

164
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:34,334
Do you care

165
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:36,417
if I’m healthy

166
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:38,250
or if I have been

167
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,250
feeling aggrieved?

168
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,667
Baoni, did anything happen

169
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,792
to you?

170
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,834
Stop pretending to

171
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:47,167
care for me.

172
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,709
I’m fine!

173
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:53,792
Baoni.

174
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,083
Seems like

175
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,042
your bag

176
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,584
doesn’t match you.

177
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:02,167
Yeah.

178
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,000
I think so, too.

179
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:05,918
But you know what?

180
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,125
It’s light and convenient.

181
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,709
And it’s big enough.

182
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,125
I don’t need to worry

183
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,709
it might be scratched.

184
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:13,751
I don’t need to spend money

185
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,209
in maintaining it.

186
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,959
Most importantly, I like it.

187
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,042
I ordered the dishes.

188
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:29,459
But enjoy the dinner yourself.

189
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,959
It’s on me.

= Bo Hai Zhou Xinyan =

191
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:44,999
Bo Hai and Zhou Xinyan

192
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,042
are in a relationship.

193
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,334
One, two, three, four, five.

194
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,125
Five evidences.

195
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,542
Bo Hai and Zhou Xinyan

196
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,000
aren’t in a relationship.

197
00:07:56,584 --> 00:08:00,167
One, two, three, four, five. Still five.

198

= Childhood Sweetheart =

199
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:03,959
What the hell?

200
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,542
What did I write?

201
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,000
Five for each side.

202
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,417
How can I judge?

203
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,000
Is rational analysis

204
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,375
unreliable now?

205
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,000
I’ll have an irrational one then.

206
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,999
Is the coin here?

207
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:31,584
Where is it?

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,709
Well, I’ll do this.

209
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,209
If its mouth goes left,

210
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,250
they’re in a relationship.

211
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,626
If it goes right,

212
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,501
they’re not in a relationship.

213
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,042
Okay. Three, two, one.

214
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,709
Are they in a relationship or not then?

215
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,751
Gosh!

216
00:08:58,876 --> 00:08:59,834
What the hell do you want me to do?

217
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,459
I can’t judge it at all.

218
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,542
Neither rational nor irrational way

219
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,918
can help me.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,375
Ling Lingqi, what the hell are you doing?

221
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,709
Why don’t you sleep yet?

222
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,167
I am sleeping!

223
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,417
Demon, watch it!

224
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,834
Dear, you get me wrong.

225
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,792
I’m not a bad guy.

226
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,125
Look at your face!

227
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,042
Do you even believe that?

228
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:10,709
Why don’t you ask yourself?

229
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,334
You set everything.

230
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,584
Just because you have so much prejudice

231
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,834
against me.

232
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,209
Caichen.

233
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:29,083
Granny just bullied me!

234
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,459
She wants to kidnap me as her concubine

235
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:35,042
just because I’m beautiful!

236
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:37,417
Concubine?

237
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:38,959
Before you lie,

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,876
think about your gender!

239
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,209
Ridiculous!

240
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,584
That’s my sword!

241
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:14,584
Zhou Xinyan.

242
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,125
Why do you never go away?

243
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:45,584
So, you’re Granny?

244
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,125
Dear, I’m the real Xiaoqian.

245
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:39,459
Don’t I look like that?

246
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:41,751
What about having some music?

247
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,918
This is exactly what I want.

248
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,083
Wake up, Ling Lingqi.

249
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,417
What’s wrong with the knocking?

250
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,250
Ling Lingqi!

251
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, my dear mother.

252
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,125
She always knocks

253
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,542
at the best part of the dream!

254
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,083
She’s really a love spoiler.

255
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:06,584
Could it be

256
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,751
Zhou Xinyan is a fake girlfriend?

257
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,792
And Bo Hai really likes me?

258
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:23,459
Ling Lingqi.

259
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:24,542
Gosh! You scared me!

260
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,459
Miss Ling Lingqi.

261
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,876
Wipe off the saliva

262
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,209
and stop daydreaming,

263
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:31,999
will you?

264
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:33,709
You’re going for

265
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,792
the team building, huh?

266
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,959
You should take the chance.

267
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,209
You mustn’t be defeated by…

268
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:43,999
Zhou Xinyan?

269
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:44,834
Okay?

270
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,334
Amazing!

271
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,083
How luxurious!

272
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:40,667
Look over there. Look!

273
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:48,334
Bye-bye.

274
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:49,542
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

275
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:50,209
See you later.

276
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:50,667
See you.

277
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:51,918
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

278
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,417
He Minglang is really the best actor.

279
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,209
How generous he is!

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That’s because

281
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,459
Qi took the trouble to complete the set for him.

282
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,375
Since boss is so generous,

283
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,125
tonight,

284
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,250
you must make him happy.

285
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,542
Don’t worry.

286
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,250
We’ll try everything we can

287
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,042
to get our boss high.

288
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,000
Let’s get hammered!

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,209
Xinyan, you know what?

290
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,417
We live in rooms

291
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,250
next to each other.

292
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,000
If you get drunk,

293
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:17,626
and walk into my room

294
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:18,751
by accident,

295
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,542
you’ll be always welcome.

296
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:21,667
Buzz off.

297
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:22,999
What?

298
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:23,709
Are you

299
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,959
going to Bo Hai’s room?

300
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,083
Let me help.

301
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:29,667
Why were you so careless?

302
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,375
Stop talking nonsense.

303
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:36,792
I was

304
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,792
just kidding.

305
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,876
Why aren’t you humorous

306
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,667
at all?

307
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,542
I’m not that boring.

308
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,460

00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,542
It hurts! It hurts!

350
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,000
Which part? Here?

351
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,459
Here.

352
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,501
How about this?

353
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,000
Let me take you to the hospital for a check.

354
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:41,876
No. No.

355
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:42,999
Don’t bother.

356
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,292
Why don’t you rub it for me?

357
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,167
When I twisted my ankle,

358
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,501
I just rubbed it. No kidding.

359
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,083
Baoni, what’s wrong with you? Baoni.

360
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:58,918
None of your business.

361
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:01,918
She twisted her ankle.

362
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:03,417
Baoni, don’t be afraid.

363
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,250
I’m with you.

364
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,292
You know what?

365
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,667
I can do all kinds of

366
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,375
massages.

367
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,459
Let me show you.

368
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,584
Good. I’ll leave her to you.

369
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:12,792
See you.

370
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,417
Mo Nan. Don’t go. Mo Nan!

371
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,709
Baoni, how do you feel?

372
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,292
Do you feel

373
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,584
your heartbeat

374
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:29,999
boom boom pow?

375
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,417
What the hell boom boom pow?

376
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:35,584
Baoni, you…

377
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:37,459
Baoni!

378
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:45,209
A pair of three.

379
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,626
That’s not powerful enough.

380
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,167
Pass.

381
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,459
Seriously?

382
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,167
Pass for a pair of three?

383
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:55,751
So…

384
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,334
if something belongs to you,

385
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,125
you will have it.

386
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,918
Don’t force it if it doesn’t.

387
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:03,667
Or you’ll lose more.

388
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:06,542
My best advantage is that

389
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,417
I’m always thick-skinned.

390
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,667
So, I will fight with you

391
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,125
till the end, Director Zhou!

392
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:12,667
Really?

393
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,792
Fighting till the end

394
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,834
will get you to lose more.

395
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,375
Boss, everyone else is having fun.

396
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,501
Why are you sitting alone?

397
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:35,626
They finally have fun.

398
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,250
If I sit too close,

399
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,792
they’ll enjoy themselves less.

400
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:39,542
You mean

401
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,250
you sacrifice yourself

402
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:41,209
and give up the chance

403
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,417
to have fun with them,

404
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,250
because you want them to enjoy themselves?

405
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,000
You’re right!

406
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,125
Why do I think

407
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,167
you just want to be cool?

408
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,959
Look! Look!

409
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:01,834
Look!

410
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,542
Double six. Double six.

411
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,000
Awful! Awful!

412
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:06,501
You cheated.

413
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:08,751
Boring!

414
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:09,542
I’ll quit.

415
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,083
Why did she cheat?

416
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:27,751
Xinyan, do you need to cheat

417
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:28,918
just to win a game?

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,751
What are you laughing at?

419
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,167
Go get me some sugar.

420
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,167
Okay.

421
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:57,167
Xinyan?

422
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,000
Xinyan!

423
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:06,792
Ignores me? It’s weird!

424
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:30,459
Ling Lingqi, when I succeed tonight,

425
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:31,999
I’ll see how you can compete with me.

426
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,751
What big shrimps! Look!

427
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:51,918
Don’t bother me.

428
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:53,083
Can’t you see I’m busy?

429
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,626
What’s going on between you and Mo Nan?

430
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,250
I’ve made up my mind.

431
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,667
I’m going to chase Mo Nan.

432
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:03,834
Seriously?

433
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,542
You still fail to

434
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:05,626
get rid of his charm?

435
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,167
A lot of men

436
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,167
used to chase you.

437
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,542
Now you’re chasing a man?

438
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,250
We have to try new things.

439
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,459
Mo Nan is different.

440
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,042
I’ve made up my mind.

441
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,042
I’m very serious.

442
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,292
Mo Nan is different.

443
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,417
You make me sick.

444
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:29,792
Doughnuts.

445
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,292
Don’t eat so much!

446
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:32,667
Enjoy the food.

447
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,083
If we don’t,

448
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:34,334
we’ll not have such a chance again.

449
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:35,626
Cheers.

450
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,042
Come. Sit down.

451
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:44,405
Well…

452
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:45,542
- Mr. Bo. - Mr. Bo.

453
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:46,999
- Mr. Bo. - Mr. Bo.

454
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:47,918
- Mr. Bo. - Mr. Bo.

455
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:48,626
- Mr. Bo. - Mr. Bo.

456
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:48,918
Well…

457
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:49,501
Mr. Bo.

458
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:50,584
A toast to you.

459
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,334
Okay. Cheers.

460
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:56,918
Mr. Bo.

461
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:58,542
We’re all here.

462
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,709
You must be fair.

463
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,125
You should drink with everyone.

464
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,999
Let me fill your glass.

465
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,209
Come on. Mr. Bo. Try this.

466
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:05,876
I just filled it for you.

467
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:06,918
Okay. Thank you.

468
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,626
Hello? David. It’s me.

469
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:14,250
Don’t forget what I asked you to do.

470
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:24,667
Come on. A toast to you.

471
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,999
Cheers, Mr. Bo.

472
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:26,959
Bottoms up!

473
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,375
Xinyan?

474
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:31,125
Xinyan?

475
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:35,918
No way.

476
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,792
I saw her coming this way.

477
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,626
Is she not back yet?

478
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:46,999
Come on. Cheers.

479
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:47,751
Go on. Go on.

480
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:48,334
Cheers.

481
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:48,959
Cheers.

482
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,501
Fill your glass.

483
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:51,417
Fill your glass.

484
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:52,792
Okay. Come.

485
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:53,918
Cheers.

486
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:54,959
Come.

487
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,959
1508?

488
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,709
Why do I remember it’s 1507?

489
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,542
It’s 1508. What’s wrong with your eyes?

490
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,584
Why are you here?

491
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,375
We’re destined to meet.

492
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,876
In such a small hotel,

493
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,209
it’s normal to meet each other.

494
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:32,999
Wait a sec.

495
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,167
Since we’ve met,

496
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,626
why don’t we have a talk?

497
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,334
Talk to yourself. I’m tired.

498
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:56,959
Qi.

499
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,000
What are you doing here?

500
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,626
I found Bo Hai a little weird.

501
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:04,459
You’re the weirdest guy

502
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:05,292
I’ve ever met.

503
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:06,667
I never saw a girl

504
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,501
dillydally so much

505
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,667
when chasing a man!

506
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,999
You know what, men are…

507
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,000
Ling Lingqi, did you see Mr. Bo?

508
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:15,167
He’s back to his room.

509
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,667
So early?

510
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:17,334
He said

511
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:19,000
he wanted to have some rest early.

512
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,876
But I think

513
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,501
he’s hammered.

514
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:23,459
When he saw his room number,

515
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:24,375
he thought he was in Room 1507

516
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,626
instead of 1508.

517
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:27,999
He murmured 1507 again and again.

518
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,999
Wait. Which room does Bo Hai live in?

519
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,375
1508.

520
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:32,709
Doomed!

521
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:34,542
What’s wrong?

522
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:35,667
I’ll go have a look.

523
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,000
Wait for me!

524
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:37,999
What’s happening?

525
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,375
Zhou Xinyan

526
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,792
must have switched the room cards.

527
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,125
No wonder

528
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,125
she sneaked around so early.

529
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,709
So, she had a plan

530
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,209
to flirt with Bo Hai.

531
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,542
Wait. You mean…

532
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:53,709
They’re not in secret love?

533
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,626
Shut up. How is that possible?

534
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,083
I knew it!

535
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,751
What the hell!

536
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:00,999
Who told you that?

537
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:01,709
It doesn’t matter.

538
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:02,709
The point is we must find Bo Hai

539
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,292
and stop him from

540
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:04,042
making a mistake.

541
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:05,042
Yes. Yes. Yes.

542
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,042
Where are we going?

543
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:32,959
Room card. Room card.

544
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:38,334
Sweety? Here we meet again.

545
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:38,999
Sweety?

546
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,042
He’s hammered.

547
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:40,417
When I was away,

548
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:40,959
what the hell

549
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:41,834
happened to you?

550
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:43,000
We…

551
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,167
Nothing. He’s drunk.

552
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:46,876
This is for a vacant room.

553
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,792
Take him to have some rest.

554
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:48,542
What about you?

555
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:49,375
I’m going to

556
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,501
deal with Zhou Xinyan.

557
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:51,792
Okay. See you.

558
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:52,542
Where are we going?

559
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:53,626
Come with us.

560
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:54,709
Go ahead. Go.

561
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,250
Come with me!

562
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,876
Luckily, you didn’t go to Zhou Xinyan’s room.

563
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,626
Otherwise, you would have

564
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:07,459
lost your chastity

565
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,501
to her.

566
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,626
I heard the strong tea helps to sober up.

567
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:34,542
I wonder if it’s true.

568
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:46,667
Don’t you feel it hot?

569
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,999
You hurt me!

570
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,417
Who did that?

571
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:00,709
You must compensate me.

572
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,334
What do you want?

573
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:11,999
Blow on my mouth.

574
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:17,042
No way, Ling Lingqi.

575
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:18,959
You mustn’t take advantage of him.

576
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,459
Well, we’re both well-educated.

577
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,999
Let go of body contact.

578
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:30,417
Say something else,

579
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:31,876
and I’ll do it, okay?

580
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,250
Play with me, then.

581
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:47,959
Bo Hai.

582
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,501
Don’t be scared. I’m Xinyan.

583
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:50,792
I really like you.

584
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:51,584
Don’t worry.

585
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:52,667
I’ll be responsible for you.

586
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,542
Xinyan. Xinyan. You get the wrong guy.

587
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,709
I’m not Bo Hai.

588
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,167
Why is it you?

589
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:19,083
I don’t want to see you anymore!

590
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:19,626
Get out!

591
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,584
Xinyan. Xinyan. Listen to me.

592
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:22,292
Let me explain.

593
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:24,250
It was dark in the room.

594
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:25,125
You pushed me to the wall,

595
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:25,999
without saying anything.

596
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:27,292
I couldn’t even talk.

597
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:28,083
You know what?

598
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,501
I was the victim.

599
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:30,626
Let go of me.

600
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:31,709
I don’t want to see you anymore!

601
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:32,417
Listen to me.

602
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,042
I know.

603
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:34,417
You don’t want to be humiliated.

604
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:35,542
I swear.

605
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:36,834
I swear to you.

606
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,751
No one will know this,

607
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:39,709
except us two.

608
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:08,417
No one will know this,

609
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,334
except us five.

610
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:11,918
Get lost!

611
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:13,792

You come to laugh at me, huh?

657
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:24,999
I come to teach you.

658
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,209
I know clearly

659
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,834
how it feels

660
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,125
to like someone.

661
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:40,959
Just because I know it,

662
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:42,167
I used to

663
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,334
turn a blind eye

664
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,250
on whatever you did.

665
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,167
I indulged you,

666
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:48,083
defended you

667
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,042
and made you happy.

668
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,792
But Xinyan,

669
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:56,792
you were going too far today.

670
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,417
Have you thought about it?

671
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:02,918
If Bo Hai entered your room

672
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:03,751
today,

673
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:06,375
how would you face him in the future?

674
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:10,918
Stubborn as he is,

675
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,125
he’ll no longer work with you.

676
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:13,959
He won’t even be your friend anymore.

677
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,834
I understand.

678
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,584
But I can’t wait.

679
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,459
I’m 26 years old.

680
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,584
It’s been

681
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:27,250
six years

682
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,918
since I met Bo Hai.

683
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:31,083
I don’t know how many six years

684
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:32,709
I can still have

685
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:33,542
to wait for him.

686
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:36,459
I really don’t know

687
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:37,959
what I can do.

688
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,000
There are some sayings

689
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:47,167
that may sound old-fashioned

690
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,292
to you.

691
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,751
But they make sense.

692
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:52,834
For example,

693
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,667

it’s never too late to mend.

you have a sad day,

I’ll sacrifice myself

and borrow you my shoulder.

704

Don’t be stubborn.

705
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:43,417

I found you annoying.

he drove back alone

Why did they

both behave like that?

762
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:23,667
Mr. Mo.

763
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:25,250
Tell me.

764
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:26,626

in such a hurry?

766
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,876
I just got the news.

767
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,167
After you dealt with Wen Guangqi

768
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:30,999
with Bo Hai,

769
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,000
the board of directors

770
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,167
were totally annoyed.

771
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,542
Someone has even offered

772
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:36,292

773
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:38,125
with someone else.

774
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:39,626

775
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:40,584
even William can’t help you.

776
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:42,667
I knew it.

777
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,417
William told me.

Then why don’t you worry?

780
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,375
Now,

781
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:50,834
we must do something.

782
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:51,876
Or we will fail to

783
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:52,999
explain to the superiors.

784
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:56,918
