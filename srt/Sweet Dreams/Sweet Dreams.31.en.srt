51

Do you want me

52
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,292
to cure you, too?

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ling Lingqi.

54
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:46,250
There are so many guys

55
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,334
in this world.

56
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,375
Can’t you just

57
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,250
find another one

58
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,042
who is easier to get on with?

59
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,584
Why must you haunt me?

60
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,959
Aren’t you stupid?

61
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,167
I am!

62
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:56,250
Love is always

63
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,667
a stupid thing.

64
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,876
Sometimes,

65
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,375
loving someone

66
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,083
feels better than

67
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,209
being a smart guy.

68
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:04,959
Besides,

69
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,626
when I like you,

70
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:08,083
I have become

71
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,667
a better self.

72
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,167
What about you?

73
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,667
Why don’t you try

74
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,292
making yourself

75
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:16,542
an easy-going man?

76
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:21,709
Bo Hai, as long as

77
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,209
we give each other a chance,

78
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,626
and try hard on it,

79
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,417
no difficulty will stop us.

80
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,000
I didn’t say I would give you a chance.

81
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,584
Didn’t we make a deal?

82
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,999
You made a deal by yourself.

83
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,999
And I didn’t agree.

84
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,667
Bad boy! He cheats!

85
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,834
He doesn’t keep his words.

86
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:06,459
Qi.

87
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,918
Why are you here alone?

88
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,542
What? In bad mood?

89
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:16,834
I’ve been trying so hard.

90
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:18,751
But Bo Hai still doesn’t accept me.

91
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:21,042
What a bad man!

92
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:22,959
Qi.

93
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,083
You shouldn’t have wasted your time and love

94
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,125
on a man like him!

95
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,501
But I like him. What can I do?

96
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,459
He always hurts you!

97
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,250
Are you still okay with that?

98
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:39,501
I was just

99
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:40,999
complaining about it.

100
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,375
It’s no big deal.

101
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:48,375
Let’s go.

102
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:01,542
Qi, you’re back?

103
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,250
Baby, let me hug you.

104
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:05,584
Why didn’t anyone

105
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,000
drive you back?

106
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,542
Are you tried with overtime work?

107
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,042
Why do you look like

108
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,584
you have a hangover?

109
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:13,876
Bad luck with overtime work?

110
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,751
I don’t mean the real work.

111
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,667
I mean the love work.

112
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,292
You really worked overtime?

113
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,292
Oh, I see.

114
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,999
She’s in bad mood.

115
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,876
Let’s have something to eat.

116
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,375
You’ll be in good mood soon.

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,999
Not the small one. Let’s have a bigger one.

118
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,292
Eat the small one!

119
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,751
What a surprise!

120
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:40,501
Lu Yunqing

121
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,250
killed your father.

122
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:46,876
From now on,

123
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:48,209
I will

124
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,000
avenge my father

125
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,667
and ask the murderer to pay the price,

126
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,542
though she has escaped for twenty years.

127
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,459
If your father knows it,

128
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,083
he will die in peace

129
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,000
in the heaven.

130
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,459
Lu Yunqing thinks

131
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:07,918
she can get rid of debt of blood

132
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,542
when she’s missing.

133
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,709
She’s too naive.

134
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,709
Just like her son Bo Hai.

135
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,209
Hypocritical and unscrupulous.

136
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,626
Since she ran away,

137
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,334
her son will pay the price for her.

138
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,584
You know,

139
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,417
life is mystical.

140
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,209
I sent you to FlowerPlus

141
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,626
for the acquisition project.

142
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:36,792
Unexpectedly,

143
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,501
the CEO of FlowerPlus

144
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,501
is Lu Yunqing’s son.

145
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,542
Maybe,

146
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:45,792
your father led you

147
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,000
to find the truth

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,459
in the past

149
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,042
so that you can avenge him.

150
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,042
I’ve made up my mind, William.

151
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,042
I’m not going to quit the project.

152
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,626
I take back what I said.

153
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:08,709
Do you remember

154
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,083
what I told you

155
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:10,999
on your first day of work?

156
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,083
In our industry,

157
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,501
the biggest taboo is

158
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,792
to put your personal feelings

159
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,125
in a mission.

160
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,209
Numbers have no feelings.

161
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,167
An excellent investor

162
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,209
must always be

163
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,751
cool-headed.

164
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,167
Sorry.

165
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,959
I was too impulsive.

166
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,876
But...

167
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:30,959
Nothing is absolute.

168
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,459
Investing is a technique,

169
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,125
and also an art.

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,667
When you hate Bo Hai,

171
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,709
maybe you will make the project

172
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,876
more exciting.

173
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:47,751
And you will get

174
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:50,918
more important added values.

175
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,709
Thank you, William.

176
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:56,375
Headquarters have approved of

177
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,417
my application.

178
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,334
I will stay in China

179
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,167
until you complete the project.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,209
Just go for it!

181
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,792
DREAM and I

182
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:14,167
will always support you.

183
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:41,876
Baoni.

184
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,459
This is the information

185
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:44,542
I’ve got from

186
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,667
a famous foreign detective agency.

187
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:47,709
This is Mo Nan’s tax payment

188
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,375
over the past years overseas.

189
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:51,959
So much?

190
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,876
Director Luo. Think about it.

191
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,292
Why does some guy

192
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,709
who has a super working experience,

193
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:05,709
I mean, working on

194
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:06,834
Wall Street,

195
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:09,501
prefer to rack his brains

196
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:10,751
to hide his experience

197
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,417
and work as

198
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,542
a minor employee?

199
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:15,751
It’s a simple question.

200
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,918
He’s a mad man.

201
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,542
Or he’s a commercial spy

202
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,999
sent by a rival company

203
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,792
for undercover work.

204
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:28,918
Baoni.

205
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,459
What are you reading?

206
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,501
Another love letter?

207
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:35,626
No. No.

208
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,792
The payroll. It’s secret.

209
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,709
Your apartment has

210
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:41,501
so many secrets!

211
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,542
Look how scared you are! You look pale!

212
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:47,167
Okay. Thank you.

213
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:06,999
Sorry.

214
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,083
I hold so many flowers.

215
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,459
Didn’t you see?

216
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,209
What the hell!

217
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,375
What’s wrong? Glycopenia again?

218
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,042
I stood up too fast and I feel dizzy.

219
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:30,375
Thank you.

220
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:34,417
Thank you.

221
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,292
Be careful.

222
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:40,292
You’re alright?

223
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:41,375
Yes.

224
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,250
We’ve got a problem.

225
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,584
In mysterious hidden orders this week,

226
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:52,999
there’s a cut flower milkweed.

227
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,542
The supplier didn’t completely preprocess

228
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,125
the milkweeds

229
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,459
as we require.

230
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:57,751
Since we realized the problem,

231
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:58,417
we have recalled

232
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,083
all the orders.

233
00:09:59,209 --> 00:09:59,918
But two hundred bouquets

234
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,334
have already been sent to the clients

235
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,292
and can’t be recalled immediately.

236
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:03,292
As we know,

237
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,959
milkweed is a common flower.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But without being preprocessed,

239
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,083
it may lead to allergy.

240
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,417
The possibility is very low.

241
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:08,918
But it may

242
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,083
still happen.

243
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:12,709
The supplier for milkweeds

244
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,125
is new.

245
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,542
But he is

246
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,042
an old friend of mine.

247
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:18,125
I didn’t expect him

248
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,876
to make such a simple mistake.

249
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,584
I’m to blame.

250
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,167
Well.

251
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:26,709
Chen Mo.

252
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:27,834
Take the lead

253
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,584
and set up an emergency handling team.

254
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,417
You must recall all the two hundred

255
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,250
bouquets.

256
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:32,834
Besides,

257
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,542
make a perfect compensation plan.

258
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,334
Copy.

259
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:37,459
If the media

260
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,167
make groundless accusations,

261
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:39,918
there will be

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,209
a very bad influence.

263
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:41,999
Xinyan.

264
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,626
Go prepare the crisis PR.

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,667
I’ll do it right away.

266
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,417
I’ll ask all departments

267
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,542
to cooperate with you,

268
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,334
so that we can minimize

269
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:50,167
possible influence.

270
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:51,000
- Copy. - Copy.

271
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:52,042
Go.

272
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:02,167
This is

273
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,209
the specific background

274
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,250
for this problem.

275
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,667
Any confusion?

276
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,459
Director, didn’t Mr. Bo

277
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,167
choose the supplier by himself?

278
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,876
If the media ask,

279
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,417
what shall we say?

280
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,584
Don’t answer any question

281
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,083
about the supplier.

282
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,250
If any media ask,

283
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,459
take them to me.

284
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:20,501
I’ll give them

285
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,000
a gentle explanation.

286
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,709
If there’s no further question,

287
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:25,959
I’ll assign the missions.

288
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,042
Mo Nan, issue an emergency notice

289
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,250
on our official website.

290
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,417
Create emergency handling pages

291
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:32,459
for Official Accounts

292
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:33,876
on Weibo and WeChat.

293
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,584
And keep in touch with

294
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,626
clients and the media,

295
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,626
to coordinate the communication.

296
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:40,334
Zhenqi.

297
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:41,918
Coordinate with the Customer Service Department.

298
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:42,834
Before ten,

299
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,417
they must send messages

300
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,709
to remind the clients

301
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,209
not to touch the flowers.

302
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,542
Especially VIPs.

303
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:49,709
Send a message

304
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,751
and then make a call.

305
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:51,209
Understand?

306
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:51,792
Yes.

307
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,501
Okay. Dismiss.

308
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,751
What’s wrong with Bo Hai?

309
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:04,667
He was just scared

310
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:05,417
when he was in a fire

311
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,626
as a little boy.

312
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,417
I thought it would be something worse.

313
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:12,417
I’ve been studying animal psychology

314
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,667
for such a long time,

315
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:14,417
but I still don’t know

316
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,918
what’s wrong with him.

317
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,501
He really makes me

318
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:18,834
angry and depressed.

319
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,876
Wow, food can heal everything!

320
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,459
Qi.

321
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:35,792
Think about it.

322
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:37,709
If one day,

323
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,792
you find the man you love

324
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,209
has a very big secret,

325
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,000
what will you do?

326
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,459
So what?

327
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,584
Look at Bo Hai.

328
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,042
He behaves normally.

329
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:50,584
Who knows

330
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:51,918
he has such serious mental problem?

331
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:52,709
But I still

332
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:53,999
love him desperately.

333
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,584
No. You get me wrong.

334
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,459
I mean

335
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,334
some very personal secret.

336
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,542
Mo Nan is married secretly?

337
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,375
Or he has cancer?

338
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:13,751
Is he an alien?

339
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,334
No more imagination, okay?

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,375
What’s wrong with him?

341
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:20,751
Nothing.

342
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,501
I... I just suppose.

343
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,959
Do you eat meat? I don’t have any in mine.

344
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,000
Here you are.

345
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:27,959
Take mine.

346
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,501
So much meat!

347
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,876
You don’t want any? On a diet?

348
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,667
- Changhe! Changhe! - Dad!

349
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:28,459
Dad!

350
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,542
Mr. Bo, sorry.

351
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,250
We’re going to make an advertising video.

352
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,000
I wanted to clean it.

353
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,751
But I broke it accidentally.

354
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,626
It’s okay.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,375
These are replicas.

356
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:00,501
Be careful next time.

357
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,125
Okay.

358
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:08,209
Director.

359
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:09,751
Bad news! Bad news!

360
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:10,918
Something wrong!

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,834
What’s wrong?

362
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:12,667
I don’t know

363
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:13,834
who spilt the beans,

364
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:14,792
but News Weekly

365
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,626
released our problem,

366
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,292
with a shocking headline.

367
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,459
FlowerPlus recalls toxic flowers?

368
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:26,375
CEO Bo Hai is to blame?

369
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,042
Soon after it was released,

370
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,250
all the other media have reported it.

371
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:31,626
On Souinfo,

372
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,918
we hit the headlines.

373
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,250
News Weekly

374
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,959
published several critical data.

375
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:41,292
These data

376
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,125
are only known to our own staff.

377
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,375
So,

378
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,083
one of you

379
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,459
must have betrayed us.

380
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:49,334
Who did that?

381
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:56,751
No one admits it, huh?

382
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:58,834
All right.

383
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:00,751
What I hate most

384
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,542
is betrayers.

385
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,000
After I complete

386
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:04,834
the crisis PR,

387
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,501
I’ll find him out,

388
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,042
whatever it takes!

389
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,000
Now, we’re having

390
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,667
a press conference to explain to them.

391
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,083
Zhenqi, invite the media.

392
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,751
Mo Nan, arrange the place.

393
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:20,792
Aye.

394
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,792
Dear media friends,

395
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,751
first,

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,792
I’d like to apologize on behalf of FlowerPlus.

397
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,209
Our supplier

398
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,626
did make a mistake.

399
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:39,375
Two hundred bouquets of milkweeds

400
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,834
were sold on market

401
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
before they were preprocessed,

402
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,542
which caused potential danger

403
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,667
to our clients.

404
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:45,834
Our company

405
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,709
always adheres to

406
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,042
customer-first principle.

407
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,334
We’re truly sorry.

408
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:55,667
Next,

409
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,417
let me explain

410
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,334
what we’ve done

411
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:00,834
after the accident.

412
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,125
At the first opportunity,

413
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,167
we texted and called

414
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,959
all involved clients,

415
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,876
and used the logistics system

416
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,542
to recall the bouquets.

417
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:11,709
Within one hour,

418
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,667
all flawed bouquets have been controlled.

419
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,334
When we called back,

420
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,876
three clients told us

421
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,959
they might have allergy.

422
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:19,999
Without delay,

423
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:20,959
we contacted them

424
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,792
for proper treatment.

425
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,125
Next, the Customer Service Department

426
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,792
will tell them the compensation plan.

427
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:28,167
They’ll have free bouquets and vases.

428
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:29,459
All the clients

429
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:30,876
have recognized us

430
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:31,667
and forgiven us.

431
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,125
So far, within two hours

432
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,584
since the problem happened,

433
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:36,417
we’ve completed

434
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:37,626
the centralized emergency treatment

435
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,125
for this accident.

436
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,709
Later,

437
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:41,999
we’ll continue to follow up

438
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,751
and learn a lesson from the mistake.

439
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,042
And we’ll establish unified safety regulations

440
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,792
and industry standards

441
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:48,792
for China’s flower industry.

442
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,542
We’re sincerely grateful for

443
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,834
our clients’ understanding and cooperation

444
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,250
during the emergency recall.

445
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:53,999
Everybody, thank you for

446
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,501
your accompanying with our growth.

447
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,876
Floriculture is a wonderful cause.

448
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:00,167
It means

449
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,834
we bear a heavy burden.

450
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,751
FlowerPlus and I

451
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,167
will take full responsibility for this accident.

452
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,250
Thank you again.

453
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,375
The press conference was a success.

454
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,125
I calmed the media down, too.

455
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,667
I want to apologize to you.

456
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,918
The leaked data were my mistake.

457
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:34,751
But I will

458
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:35,626
find out

459
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:36,501
the big mouth!

460
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,167
Don’t be guilty.

461
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,083
It was hard to

462
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,292
keep such a big secret.

463
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,959
If there was just a big mouth,

464
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,042
that’s no big deal.

465
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,792
I’m afraid

466
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:49,792
this wasn’t

467
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,667
a mere mistake,

468
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,999
but a deep-laid scheme.

469
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:55,417
No way?

470
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,876
Didn’t we just get rid of

471
00:18:58,999 --> 00:18:59,999
Wen Guangqi and Shi Ji

472
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,959
from DREAM?

473
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,459
Yeah.

474
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,501
But we should be careful, anyway.

475
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,751
Dear friends.

476
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:12,999
I have some good news

477
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,375
to tell you.

478
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,501
I decide to stay.

479
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:17,792
I’m not leaving.

480
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,125
You don’t want big fortune?

481
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,751
That’s nothing, compared to you.

482
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,083
Besides,

483
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:28,999
there’s something

484
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,167
to be finished.

485
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,292
What is it?

486
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,501
Something like

487
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,042
career or ideal.

488
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:44,709
Corny, isn’t it?

489
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,709
But I thought about it.

490
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:52,667
As a young man,

491
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,459
I shouldn’t often switch jobs.

492
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:56,959
I should stay

493
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,542
and work hard.

494
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:00,250
I can’t

495
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,876
always be greedy.

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,792
Yeah. Look at Bo Hai.

497
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,083
He’s young,

498
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,792
but he’s devoted to floriculture.

499
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,250
Then he becomes

500
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,834
a bossy CEO.

501
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,250
You should learn from him.

502
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,918
Why do you want to change your job?

503
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,709
Could you say something new,

504
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,209
instead of Bo Hai?

505
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:21,834
No!

506
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:22,959
Bo Hai, the naughty man!

507
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,417
He torments me

508
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,542
and breaks my heart.

509
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:26,459
I won’t ever

510
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:27,250
give up

511
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,792
unless I have him!

512
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,626
You don’t understand Bo Hai at all.

513
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:38,417
I don’t understand him?

514
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,000
Do you?

515
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,375
Wait. What do you mean?

516
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:45,292
What does that mean?

517
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,626
Sounds informative!

518
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,626
What do you mean?

519
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,417
Could you stop

520
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,167
talking about Bo Hai?

521
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,584
You’re bending my ear!

522
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:54,834
Couldn’t we talk about something

523
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,459
profound?

524
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:59,501
Bo Hai. Bo Hai. Bo Hai.

525
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:00,918
Bo Hai.

526
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,334
Mo Nan.

527
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,999
Whatever happens,

528
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,083
or wherever you go,

529
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,834
you’ll still be our friends,

530
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,167
won’t you?

531
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,042
What?

532
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,083
Didn’t I tell you I wasn’t leaving?

533
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,959
Why are you still so sentimental?

534
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,459
I just suppose.

535
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:49,459
You know what?

536
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,042
After I came to FlowerPlus,

537
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:53,667
meeting you and Qi was the best

538
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,792
I’ve got.

539
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:58,250
Don’t you remember?

540
00:21:58,709 --> 00:21:59,667
I said

541
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,999
our friendship would be eternal

542
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,834
like the stars up in the sky.

543
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,709
Here comes the taxi. Let’s go.

544
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:16,834
Come.

545
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:19,083
Bye-bye.

546
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,584
Bye-bye.

547
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,626
I don’t care how many lies you tell,

548
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,417
why you come here

549
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,584
or who you are.

550
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:47,501
You’re true to me, at least.

551
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,584
I meet you and love you.

552
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,250
It’s true, too.

553
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,167
That’s enough.

554
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:11,042
Next,

555
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,209
I’m giving you an urgent mission.

556
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,334
I don’t care what you do.

557
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:16,584
But tonight,

558
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,542
you must make Bo Hai wear the bracelet.

559
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,334
You’re done here. You may go home.

560
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:36,999
Okay.

561
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,459
Boss.

562
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,501
You haven’t worn

563
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:42,751
the sleeping bracelet lately?

564
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,542
Do you have poor sleep again?

565
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,918
I’ve learnt a new massage

566
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,584
as a sleep aid.

567
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,000
Would you like a try?

568
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,167
Massage?

569
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:55,834
You do it to me?

570
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,292
Yeah.

571
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:57,626
I don’t want that.

572
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,083
But you haven’t tried it yet.

573
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:00,959
That’s great!

574
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,751
Trust me! Come on!

575
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,501
What are you doing?

576
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:09,626
Don’t you feel comfortable?

577
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:15,209
Stop! Stop!

578
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:15,792
What’s wrong, boss?

579
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:17,167
Stop! It hurts!

580
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,792
Hurts? Well...

581
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,125
Shall I do it on another part?

582
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,375
No! No! Stop!

583
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:24,667
Let me rub your back.

584
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:25,584
I have a few strength levels.

585
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:26,834
Tell me if it hurts.

586
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:27,792
Don’t hold it!

587
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:28,375
Right?

588
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,542
Feeling better?

589
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:34,626
Let me knead it.

590
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,209
Don’t pinch me!

591
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,375
Okay. Still hurts?

592
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:40,209
I’ll be gentle.

593
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:42,209
Come on. Can you really do it?

594
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,709
I’m very professional

595
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,959
according to reponses of all experiencers.

596
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:48,375
Let me knead your legs.

597
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,584
Legs. Legs.

598
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:50,542
Let me relax them.

599
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:53,000
Don’t be nervous. Too stiff!

600
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:55,375
Better, huh?

601
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:57,292
Okay?

602
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:58,292
That’s more like it.

603
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:58,999
Why do we think

604
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,459
it’s comfortable to have a massage?

605
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,709
Because it hurts

606
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,584
when you take the massage.

607
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:04,876
But when it finishes,

608
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,751
you’ll find

609
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,083
it feels good being alive!

610
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,000
Comfortable, aren’t you?

611
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,042
Boss?

612
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:29,709
Boss!

613
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,125
Mission completed!

614
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,083
Chen Mo!

615
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:30,501
The most romantic date ever.

616
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:36,834
Dream.

617
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:44,209
Bo Hai, here I am!

618
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:03,792
Boss.

619
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:04,959
I did that for your own good!

620
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:05,626
I just want you

621
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,959
to have a romantic relationship.

622
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,834
I really put a lot of effort!

623
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,834
= Ling Lingqi =

624
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:20,780

Mission failed!

625
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,542
Come over!

626
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,334
Since you like me, too,

627
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:57,792
why can’t you

628
00:27:57,918 --> 00:27:59,083
give me a chance?

629
00:27:59,501 --> 00:27:59,999
Can’t you just

630
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,000
find another one

631
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:02,834
who is easier to get on with?

632
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,209
Why must you haunt me?

633
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,792
Aren’t you stupid?

634
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:06,959
Love is always

635
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:08,167
a stupid thing.

636
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:10,334
Sometimes,

637
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:10,751
loving someone

638
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:11,626
feels better than

639
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:12,584
being a smart guy.

640
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,375
Besides, when I like you,

641
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:17,000
I have become

642
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,542
a better self.

643
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:25,334
Qi.

644
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:27,876
You just want an answer, don’t you?

645
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,125
I’m giving it to you.

646
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:07,751
Mom. Mom. Help me!

647
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:10,626
Mom!

648
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,209
Hai! Hai!

649
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,167
Mom!

650
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,042
- Mom! - Hai!

651
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:17,584
Hai!

652
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:19,542
Mom. Get me out!

653
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,959
Mom! Mom!

654
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:27,834
Hai!

655
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,250
Mom! Mom!

656
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:30,584
Hai!

657
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,667
Mom!

658
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,209
Mom!

659
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:45,292
Mom! Mom!

660
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:46,999
Mom!

661
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,083
Mom!

662
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,250
Mom! Don’t go!

663
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:58,292
Don’t leave me alone!

664
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:00,918
Mom!

665
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:06,334
Mom! Mom!

666
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,000
Mom!

667
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,876
Mom!

668
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,209
Mom!

669
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,000
Mom!

670
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,417
Mom!

671
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,125
The Marketing Department has done

672
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:05,834
an initial investigation

673
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,375
on the leak incident.

674
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:08,667
The news was leaked

675
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:09,542
before noon.

676
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,667
At that time, the rest of us

677
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,250
were having a meeting.

678
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:14,959
Director Zhou asked us

679
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,209
not to bring phones or computers.

680
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,709
But you...

681
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,375
You were absent, saying you didn’t feel well.

682
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,125
So, Mo Nan.

683
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,167
Where were you?

684
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,292
And what were you doing?

685
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:29,000
I was...

686
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,083
Mo Nan was with me.

687
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,751
With you?

688
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:37,334
Yeah.

689
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:39,918
I don’t want to tell you

690
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,834
what we were doing.

691
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,584
I didn’t want Zhenqi to get you wrong.

692
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,542
So, I just lied.

693
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:57,751
Don’t mind.

694
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,000
Zhenqi shouldn’t have

695
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,501
suspected me.

696
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:01,876
Think about it.

697
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:03,709
There are many other ways

698
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:04,501
to spill the beans,

699
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,083
rather than computers or phones.

700
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:07,584
And it may not be leaked

701
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,167
during the meeting.

702
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,000
Right?

703
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:12,834
I mean...

704
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,417
You rushed to

705
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:14,709
explain for me,

706
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,209
if someone exposes your lie,

707
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:17,959
it’ll be worse.

708
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:22,999
You mean

709
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:25,167
I was doing a disservice?

710
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,417
Not really.

711
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,125
Thank you for the help!

712
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:32,918
I’ll buy you a big meal. Okay?

713
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,334
Be careful next time.

714
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,000
I’m leaving, then.

715
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,375
Okay.

716
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
= Yunhe Flower Shop
Becomes Well-known Enterprise =

717
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:00,250
Qi.

718
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:01,000
Where are you going?

719
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,292
Why didn’t you press the button?

720
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:03,751
Here I am.

721
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,834
For this year’s Valentine’s Day,

722
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,000
we have traditional bouquets.

723
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:11,250
Also, we will cooperate with

724
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,125
famous international cosmetics brands

725
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:14,834
and sell flower gift boxes,

726
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:15,834
to meet...

727
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:20,542
To meet the clients’ needs

728
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,876
at different levels.

729
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:26,834
Detailed proposal

730
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,375
will be sent to you

731
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:29,876
by email.

732
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:32,542
Mr. Bo.

733
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:33,792
As far as we see,

734
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:35,417
we don’t have enough shop assistants

735
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:36,626
to deal with the customers

736
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:37,999
on a busy day

737
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,167
like Valentine’s Day.

738
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,250
Don’t worry.

739
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,334
We will send employees

740
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,626
to help at all shops.

741
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,042
Okay.

742
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:47,626
How is it going

743
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,792
with the flowers for Valentine’s Day?

744
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:49,709
At present,

745
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:50,709
all roses on the market

746
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,334
have been monopolized

747
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,792
by a flower supplier

748
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,876
named Xingli.

749
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,918
We sent a purchase invitation.

750
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,667
But there has been no reply.

751
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:58,417
Director Zhou is checking on that.

752
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:00,792
Xingli Flower

753
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:01,999
was little known.

754
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,250
But it suddenly became resourceful,

755
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,792
without a reason.

756
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:05,501
Yeah.

757
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:07,000
I hear

758
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,542
flower shops, big or small,

759
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,709
all beg them for flowers.

760
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,000
Well.

761
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:14,501
Make an appointment with Xingli’s boss.

762
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:15,751
I’ll meet him personally.

763
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:16,918
Xinyan will go with us.

764
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:17,667
Copy.

765
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,751
Okay. We may dismiss if nothing here.

766
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,125
Bo Hai.

767
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,667
Boss, the car is ready.

768
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:04,292
Okay.

769
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,083
What’s wrong with him?

770
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:48,042
Qi.

771
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:48,667
Yes.

772
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,667
What are you doing here?

773
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:52,501
I...

774
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,584
I’m inspecting other supermarkets.

775
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:05,250
Wow, is there anything

776
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,999
wrong with you?

777
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,501
You have a rare chance to come back.

778
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,083
Why do you come here,

779
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:11,250
instead of badgering Bo Hai?

780
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,250
What happened?

781
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,459
I finally realize

782
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,167
I don’t

783
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:24,167
know him at all.

784
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:26,584
I swore to

785
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,125
bring him out of the shadow.

786
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:28,667
But I don’t even know

787
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,876
what happened to him

788
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:30,584
in the past.

789
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,751
You love him.

790
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,999
But you have to pretend to be a stranger.

791
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:43,459
You don’t know how to face him.

792
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,876
Nor do you know how to help him.

793
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:48,999
That’s how it feels!

794
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,209
Baoni, how do you know it

795
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:52,000
so clearly?

796
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,751
Don’t interrupt.

797
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:55,959
Well...

798
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,083
What’s your plan then?

799
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,125
Will you give up on Bo Hai?

800
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,083
No way!

801
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:05,334
In such a big world,

802
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,042
I finally meet someone I love.

803
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:08,834
How could I easily give up?

804
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:10,250
You’re right!

805
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:11,417
You really are my bestie!

806
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:12,792
Let’s go.

807
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,999
By the way,

808
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,876
some employees will be

809
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:19,792
sent to shops for help.

810
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,334
I applied for you and Mo Nan!

811
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:21,834
Come on!

812
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,667
Really?

813
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,375
Terrific! Terrific!

814
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,417
I asked about it.

815
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,375
Mr. Huang is said

816
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:31,918
to be a tough man.

817
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:33,667
Even though he’s tough,

818
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,167
we have to meet him.

819
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:39,751
Sorry. Sorry.

820
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:41,792
Sorry, I’m late.

821
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:42,751
Sorry.

822
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:44,375
- I’m Huang Xingfa. - Mr. Huang.

823
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:45,250
You must be Mr. Bo!

824
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:45,999
I’m Bo Hai.

825
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,292
I’m very pleased to meet you.

826
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:48,375
Please be seated.

827
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:49,667
- Be seated. - Please be seated.

828
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:50,375
Come on.

829
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:51,959
Fill the glass first.

830
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,042
Thank you.

831
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:53,959
Let me do it.

832
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:54,584
Okay.

833
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:08,042
Mr. Huang.

834
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,834
Mr. Bo wants to see you,

835
00:39:09,918 --> 00:39:11,000
to talk about the rose order

836
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,709
for Valentine’s Day.

837
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:13,959
Mr. Huang.

838
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:15,542
Everyone knows that roses are in high demand

839
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,459
for Valentine’s Day.

840
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,417
We’d like to order your roses

841
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,751
with a price

842
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,209
20% above the market price.

843
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:22,417
Mr. Bo.

844
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:24,292
What you said

845
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,000
underestimates me.

846
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,334
Am I someone

847
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,375
who raises the price for festivals?

848
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:34,542
You mean?

849
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,209
Pay the market price.

850
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,125
I’ll give you

851
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,000
however many roses you want.

852
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:43,417
Seriously?

853
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,876
Go ask about me.

854
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,125
Everyone knows

855
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:49,999
what I say...

856
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:50,918
Carries weight!

857
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,209
Yes. Yes.

858
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:54,167
What I say carries weight.

859
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,209
Mr. Huang, you offer timely assistance.

860
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:57,584
Everyone in our company

861
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,042
will remember

862
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:00,292
what you do.

863
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:01,918
It’s no big deal.

864
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,334
To you, it is.

865
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:04,417
But to us,

866
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,834
it’s a big deal.

867
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,999
I’m a rough man.

868
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,999
But I admire smart and talented young men,

869
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,125
like Mr. Bo.

870
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:15,250
Let’s do the business

871
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:16,751
and make friends.

872
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:17,876
Okay?

873
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:18,999
- Okay. - Come on.

874
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,292
Let’s propose a toast

875
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,667
to our happy cooperation

876
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,667
and fortune.

877
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:23,501
To happy cooperation.

878
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:24,292
To happy cooperation.

879
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:24,584
Okay.

880
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,417
Mr. Huang...

881
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,375
Mr. Bo is allergic to alcohol.

882
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:29,459
He can’t drink.

883
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:31,125
Well, I’ll drink with you.

884
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,375
To enjoy ourselves. All right?

885
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:34,792
Well, don’t care about that.

886
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:35,709
Today, I will drink

887
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:36,959
with Mr. Huang, definitely.

888
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,083
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

889
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,876
Terrific! Cheers!

890
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,501
Thank you.

891
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,667
Sorry... Sorry.

892
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:58,542
I’m drunk.

893
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:03,459
Wait...

894
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:05,959
I can...

895
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,834
I can buy you a new one!

896
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:10,667
Generous!

897
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:20,209
I didn’t expect

898
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,000
Mr. Huang to be so nice.

899
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:24,292
I shouldn’t have worried.

900
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,334
Xinyan.

901
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,459
Xinyan.

902
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,125
Xinyan.

903
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:44,918
Oh, Bo Hai.

904
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,042
What’s going on

905
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,375
with you and Ling Lingqi?

906
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,501
Why did she avoid you

907
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,042
at today’s meeting?

908
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,375
If Ling Lingqi can

909
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,709
give up,

910
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:07,083
it may be a good thing

911
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,167
for her.

912
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:11,959
If you keep disappointing her like that,

913
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:13,834
she may leave you.
