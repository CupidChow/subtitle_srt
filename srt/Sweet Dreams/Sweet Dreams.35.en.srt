51
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,334
Why are people with DREAM

52
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,709
like mad dogs?

53
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,417
They always hunt us!

54
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:58,751
Xinyan.

55
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,083
When you go up,

56
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,667
give Mr. Zhang a brief introduction.

57
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:02,999
Tell him

58
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,292
I have something urgent to attend to.

59
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,542
I’ll talk to him later.

60
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,334
Where are you going?

61
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:12,167
Hello?

62
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,667
Secretary Zhang asked me to go up.

63
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:15,417
I see.

64
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,042
Follow that car.

65
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,125
I guess you’re right.

66
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,999
He drove that fast.

67
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,167
He must be with DREAM.

68
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:17,584
We’ve competed for a long time.

69
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,542
Now we should meet each other.

70
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,709
I’ve heard a lot about you, Mr. Bo.

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,834
You’re the representative

72
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:25,918
from DREAM?

73
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:26,792
Yes.

74
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,083
I’m DREAM’s representative in China

75
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,417
and I carry out the acquisition case

76
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,083
for FlowerPlus.

77
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:33,959
Mr. Bo, you stopped me

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,876
in such a unique way.

79
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,501
I wonder

80
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:37,959
what you want to talk about.

81
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:39,667
Nothing serious.

82
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,083
I just want to know

83
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,667
why you’re so interested in

84
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:43,834
what happened to

85
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,292
Yunhe Flower Shop

86
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,542
twenty years ago.

87
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:48,709
That’s simple.

88
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:49,751
I check up on everything

89
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,209
that can help

90
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,125
to defeat you

91
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,375
and then use it.

92
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,709
Only for this?

93
00:03:59,167 --> 00:03:59,751
Or why do you think

94
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,751
I spent my time

95
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,209
checking up on

96
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:03,918
Yunhe Flower Shop?

97
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:05,876
Mr. Bo.

98
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,584
Either the order from Antia

99
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,584
or the acquisition of FlowerPlus,

100
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,709
I’m sure to get it.

101
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Bo, be careful.

102
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,584
Any time.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,667
Come. Give them to me.

104
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,250
Let me help.

105
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,042
Give them to me. Let me help.

106
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,667
I’m promoted. Do you know?

107
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,792
Oh? Congratulations!

108
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,501
I’ll treat you to afternoon tea.

109
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,501
Qi.

110
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,334
You have succeeded in

111
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,501
both your career and love.

112
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,042
You’re promoted to be manager

113
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,292
and you get the boyfriend

114
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,876
you’ve been dreaming of.

115
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,751
Congratulations!

116
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:29,167
Thank you.

117
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:30,876
What makes me happiest is that

118
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,250
the bad flower incident

119
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,083
has been figured out.

120
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,501
And there’s no more misunderstanding

121
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,751
about Bo Hai.

122
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:38,209
Yeah.

123
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,209
I think

124
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,667
I misunderstood him, too.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,542
Forget it.

126
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,999
Let bygones be bygones.

127
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:44,959
Hope you won’t

128
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,667
misunderstand Bo Hai

129
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,751
ever again.

130
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,459
Go!

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,584
What?

132
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,292
The one who got off the car

133
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,626
isn’t DREAM’s representative.

134
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,334
He is the camouflage.

135
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,792
So that he can protect the man

136
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,209
who is really behind this.

137
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:12,751
But why doesn’t he

138
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,167
come out to us?

139
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:16,959
There is only one reason.

140
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,709
The man in the car

141
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,667
must be the spy

142
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:21,918
hiding himself in FlowerPlus

143
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,000
who we’ve been looking for.

144
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,000
You are

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,375
freaking me out.

146
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,918
It’s time to clear out the spy.

147
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,584
But we have so many employees.

148
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,125
How can we find him?

149
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,042
Baoni, print me the list of employees

150
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,918
who are absent today.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,709
Whoever has left the office

152
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,000
for over one hour,

153
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,834
regardless of any excuse.

154
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:49,834
Okay.

155
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,200
= Marketing Department Mo Nan =

156
00:06:59,167 --> 00:06:59,626
Secretary Chen.

157
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,125
Why don’t I send it to you

158
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,000
after I print it out?

159
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,000
Don’t bother. Just do it now.

160
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,000
I’ll wait here.

161
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:06,501
Okay.

162
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,042
Come.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,375
Baoni.

164
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,125
Baoni.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,042
I have something to tell you.

166
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:21,918
Well...

167
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:23,334
Let me put them down first.

168
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,375
No. I can’t wait.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,501
Baoni.

170
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:41,834
What is it?

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,918
Secretary Chen asked me to give him

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,459
the list of absent employees.

173
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,417
So what?

174
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:53,834
Stop pretending!

175
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,709
I already knew it.

176
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,626
You’re the commercial spy with DREAM.

177
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,042
And then?

178
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:10,209
Shouldn’t you

179
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,292
tell Bo Hai about it?

180
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:14,042
Or do you want to

181
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,626
threaten me

182
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:16,417
with it?

183
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,042
I’ve never thought of that.

184
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,000
I’m telling you about it,

185
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,876
so that you can take precautions.

186
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,250
You know I’m with DREAM.

187
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,542
But you still help me?

188
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:36,709
I don’t know

189
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,000
if I’m doing the right thing.

190
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,459
I just don’t want you to be in trouble.

191
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,292
Baoni.

192
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,626
I’m going to say it only once.

193
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,751
Hope you’ll remember.

194
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:19,250
I don’t need your help.

195
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,250
And I won’t be grateful to you.

196
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,125
From now on,

197
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,167
whatever I do has nothing to do with you.

198

= Absence List =
This is the list of

199
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,700
= Absence List =
absent employees.

200
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,250
After investigation,

201
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,959
these are suspicious employees

202
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,740
we’ve figured out.

203
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,420
= Absence List =

204
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,740
= Marketing Department Mo Nan =

205
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,292
Why is Mo Nan absent?

206
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,292
He visited the media.

207
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,709
I confirmed it.

208
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,375
He’s clear.

209
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,792
In the list,

210
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:28,542
there’s a Wang,

211
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:29,999
who can’t explain where he has been.

212
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:30,792
I checked

213
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:31,834
his bank account.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,459
Every month,

215
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,083
he receives some money without a reason.

216
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,334
Fire him right away.

217
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,334
You think he’s the spy just because of this?

218
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:44,292
Isn’t it too rash?

219
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,125
I don’t want any risk.

220
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,042
We’ve been tricked by DREAM

221
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,501
for so many times.

222
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,167
I don’t allow

223
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,626
any suspicious employee

224
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:52,709
to stay in FlowerPlus.

225
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,792
Lili, stop crying!

226
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,584
Yeah. Look at your face.

227
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,042
The makeup is off.

228
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:09,542
How...

229
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,876
How can he be the spy?

230
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,209
They must’ve got it wrong, Sisi.

231
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:29,918
Tell me.

232
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,000
Is Wang really a spy

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,542
from DREAM?

234
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,042
I’m asking you.

235
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:40,709
Wang.

236
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:42,626
What’s this?

237
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:44,250
It...

238
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,709
It looks awesome!

239
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,292
Milky Way of Roses.

240
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,250
Milky Way of Roses?

241
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,000
What is it?

242
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:53,792
I had wanted to go,

243
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,334
but I always failed to go.

244
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,626
Why didn’t you go?

245
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,209
Couples always go there.

246
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,000
I’ll be jealous if I go alone.

247
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,751
But now,

248
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:05,999
you’re no longer alone.

249
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,709
You’ll go with me?

250
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,083
Well, you look poor.

251
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,918
Let’s go and make others jealous.

252
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,125
Great! Let’s go tomorrow.

253
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:14,709
Tomorrow?

254
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:15,334
Yes.

255
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,626
I don’t think I can make it.

256
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,167
How about the day after tomorrow?

257
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,459
I don’t think I can make it, either.

258
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,999
But you just said you would go!

259
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:26,000
Two days after tomorrow?

260
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,334
Next month? Next month?

261
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,876
Next month? Why don’t you say next year?

262
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,999
The exhibition will be over!

263
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,834
No! No!

264
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:50,751
Everything is done?

265
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:51,834
Don’t worry.

266
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,959
All information in and out of China

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,125
has been wiped out.

268
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,250
Bo Hai will not suspect

269
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,000
you’re with DREAM.

270
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,626
That was close this time.

271
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,125
Luckily, you’re prepared

272
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,751
and didn’t fall in Bo Hai’s trap.

273
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,209
He wanted a spy.

274
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:09,999
And we gave him one.

275
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,959
Bo Hai saved the critical situation.

276
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,000
He not only calmed the flower shop owners down,

277
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,999
but also changed the public opinion.

278
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,167
It’ll be harder

279
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,042
to deal with him.

280
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:25,751
Anyway, I’ve got nothing else

281
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:26,959
to lose.

282
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,042
As long as I can defeat Bo Hai,

283
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,375
I’ll have enough patience.

= Meeting Room MR =
our new product

348
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,700
= Meeting Room MR =
Mini Vase Series.

349
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,292
This series

350
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,501
is perfect for desks,

351
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:31,584
dressing tables

352
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,792
and writing desks.

353
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,876
These are common places,

354
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:34,834
but are closely linked with

355
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,459
our daily lives.

356
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,709
When first seen,

357
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:38,792
a mini vase

358
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,292
may not look eye-catching.

359
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,459
But I believe,

360
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,292
it will gradually become

361
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,501
an indispensable part of

362
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:44,834
our daily life.

363
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,501
Just like a long-married husband.

364
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:48,417
He might care for you

365
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,709
with tiny love.

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,709
But the love is everywhere.

367
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,042
And you can see.

368
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:55,125
For this bouquet,

369
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,125
we will use different flowers

370
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:57,709
as the embellishment,

371
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:58,334
just like...

372
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,959
Mr. Bo. An urgent express

373
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,250
you have to sign for.

374
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:19,542
Continue without me.

375
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,459
Mr. Bo is away for the moment.

376
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,542
Let’s continue the meeting.

377
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:27,542
Go on.

378
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,042
This mini vase

379
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,125
is open to booking

380
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,501
on the Internet.

381
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,876
It’ll be officially launched in the next season.

382
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:39,834
Meanwhile, it will be sold

383
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:40,918
in our shops.

384
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:47,626
Ruan.

385
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,918
This is an important file for a client.

386
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:50,626
Please send it out today

387
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:51,584
as soon as possible.

388
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:52,292
- Okay. - Thank you.

389
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,250
Just put it here.

390
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,792
Who sent the urgent express to Mr. Bo?

391
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,000
I don’t know.

392
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:02,125
Oh,

393
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,584
it was sent by Lu...

394
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,042
And Qing...

395
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:10,918
Lu Yunqing?

396
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,083
I guess so.

397
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,334
I can’t remember clearly.

398
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,083
Okay. Thank you.

399
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:15,667
You’re welcome.

400
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,334
Aren’t you tired with walking around?

401
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:37,918
No.

402
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,167
Even if you’re not tired,

403
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,334
you might ruin

404
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:44,459
my flowers.

405
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:53,751
What’s in the express

406
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:54,667
you received today?

407
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,000
Qi.

408
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:03,751
There’s something

409
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:05,918
I can’t tell you for the moment.

410
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,459
Give me more time, okay?

411
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:13,959
All right, then.

412
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:15,792
If one day,

413
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:16,876
you’re sad and depressed,

414
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:17,999
and you need someone,

415
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,125
I’ll always hug you.

416
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,834
Qi.

417
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:32,334
Tell me.

418
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,209
If...

419
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,792
I mean if...

420
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,083
If someone you hated

421
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,000
for years

422
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,000
suddenly turned up,

423
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,250
what would you do?

424
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,167
Hated for years?

425
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:49,542
Has he done something

426
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:50,918
to hurt me?

427
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:53,584
Yes.

428
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,250
Then I would ask him in his face.

429
00:19:59,626 --> 00:19:59,959
I would ask

430
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,209
why he hurt me.

431
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:02,125
Then I would

432
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:02,834
scold him!

433
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,125
You don’t drink in a bar.

434
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,667
How disappointing!

435
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,584
I don’t want to get drunk.

436
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,999
I must always remain sober.

437
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:30,751
What happened?

438
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:32,709
William.

439
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:35,792
My enemy is back.

440
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:37,999
Your enemy?

441
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,584
You don’t mean Lu Yunqing?

442
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:43,250
I do.

443
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,042
It’s been twenty years.

444
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:50,209
She’s been hiding herself for twenty years.

445
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,334
And now,

446
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,375
she’s coming out.

447
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:55,584
Twenty years ago,

448
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,459
only she and my father

449
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,999
were in the fire.

450
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,999
My father died in the fire

451
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:04,000
with no clear reason.

452
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:06,918
But she disappeared

453
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
without the least trace.

454
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,792
I want to ask her

455
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,626
how she killed my father.

456
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,667
Lu Yunqing is a sly woman.

457
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,209
You may not be her opponent.

458
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:26,083
I don’t think

459
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,792
you should act rashly.

460
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:29,751
I can’t wait!

461
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:32,751
I’ve been waiting for twenty years!

462
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:35,918
William.

463
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,834
This time,

464
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:41,584
I will not let her

465
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,459
get away from me.

466
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,584
Boss. Boss!

467
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,125
I found her!

468
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:54,999
What’s wrong with Secretary Chen?

469
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,000
He’s so excited!

470
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:56,918
So is Mr. Bo.

471
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,542
I’ve never seen him

472
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,918
so anxious!

473
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,042
What’s happening?

474
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:31,667
If you don’t want to get it,

475
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:32,167
why don’t you

476
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,459
leave it to me?

477
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,292
I have to see her, anyway.

478
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:38,042
Let’s go.

479
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,420
= Yile Sanatorium =

480
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:06,918
Excuse me, who are you looking for?

481
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,083
Hello. I’d like to know

482
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:09,876
if there’s a lady Lu Yunqing

483
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,918
staying here?

484
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,792
Wait a sec. Let me check.

485
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,459
We do have a customer

486
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:17,792
named Lu Yunqing.

487
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,125
May I ask

488
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,375
which room she stays in?

489
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:21,834
Could I

490
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,959
visit her?

491
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,501
Who are you?

492
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,375
I’m her old neighbor.

493
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:28,792
Here’s the thing.

494
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,167
Ms. Lu said

495
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,667
she would only receive her relatives.

496
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,375
You can leave your name

497
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:34,501
and identity.

498
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,501
After I ask Ms. Lu for permission,

499
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:37,959
I’ll let you know. Okay?

500
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,083
Oh, I see.

501
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,876
But she might not

502
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,292
remember my name.

503
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:46,167
And I don’t come for

504
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,083
anything important.

505
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,918
Thank you all the same.

506
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:49,417
Okay.

507
00:24:58,834 --> 00:24:59,375
Hello? Mr. Mo.

508
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,792
You’re right.

509
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,459
Lu Yunqing sent the express.

510
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,167
She’s staying in a sanatorium

511
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:05,459
in the suburbs.

512
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:08,584
Carry on with that.

513
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:09,292
Okay.

514
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:14,542
Lu Yunqing.

515
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,334
Since you dare to

516
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,959
turn up,

517
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:21,501
I’m not letting you go

518
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,042
this time.

519
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:29,584
Lili.

520
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,626
How is Wang doing lately?

521
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:34,375
What a surprise!

522
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:35,250
He looks like

523
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,334
an honest man.

524
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:37,250
But he turns out to be

525
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,250
a commercial spy from DREAM.

526
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:39,501
Don’t talk nonsense.

527
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,584
He can’t be

528
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:41,417
the commercial spy.

529
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,667
He must be framed up.

530
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,083
I didn’t accuse him.

531
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,167
Mr. Bo did!

532
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,042
Why are you yelling at me?

533
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,292
All right.

534
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:48,292
We know you talk,

535
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:49,417
but why don’t you shut up?

536
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,999
Lili, don’t be too sad.

537
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:56,959
Sorry.

538
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,792
Baoni, it’s not your fault.

539
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:02,000
Why do you apologize?

540
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:03,042
I...

541
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:04,417
What’s wrong, Baoni?

542
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:06,834
You guys. Come and move some stuff.

543
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:07,876
Okay.

544
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:08,459
- Okay. - Coming.

545
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,667
- Go. - Let’s go.

546
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:11,250
Mo Nan.

547
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,792
You’re just in time. Go.

548
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,042
Come and help with the labor work.

549
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:19,584
You can just

550
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,999
carry the boxes in.

551
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:22,167
Remember to put them down carefully.

552
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:23,375
Don’t drop them.

553
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:25,292
Be careful.

554
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:26,792
Be careful.

555
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:27,834
Thank you, guys.

556
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:28,751
- Put it here! - Here.

557
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:42,209
Baoni.

558
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:43,999
Be careful. Let me help you.

559
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:46,334
Thank you.

560
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:50,999
Director Zhou.

561
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,000
What is

562
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,876
all this junk?

563
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:54,667
These are old things

564
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,125
from Yunhe Flower Shop.

565
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:57,918
After the fire,

566
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,667
no one claimed them.

567
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:01,125
The Flower Association

568
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,626
kept them.

569
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,375
Now, the Flower Association

570
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,542
gave them back to Mr. Bo.

571
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,459
All right. Let’s go on.

572
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:08,751
Okay.

573
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,900
= Yunhe Flower Shop =

574
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,140
= Honorary Credential =

575
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:27,918
Sorry.

576
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:51,375
Mo Nan.

577
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:54,584
Let go of it. You’re bleeding!

578
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,000
Hurry!

579
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:18,334
It’s done.

580
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:19,292
Thank you.

581
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:23,918
I know.

582
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:26,501
You feel the worst.

583
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:30,042
Mo Nan, listen to me.

584
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:31,417
Stop it.

585
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,375
It’s none of your business.

586
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:34,626
Mo Nan.

587
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:39,918
I don’t understand.

588
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,709
In my heart, you’re honest and kind.

589
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:44,292
You help your friend,

590
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:45,542
at whatever cost.

591
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:46,999
Why are you

592
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:48,626
behaving like this?

593
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,375
Is your ambition that important?

594
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,584
More important than our friendship

595
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,292
or your conscience?

596
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:56,792
Enough!

597
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,459
You know nothing!

598
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,751
Mo Nan!

599
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:06,876
Tell me.

600
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,209
Do you have a reason for that?

601
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,792
I don’t need to explain to you.

602
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:21,709
And don’t try to understand me.

603
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:23,751
If you really don’t like what I do,

604
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:26,042
you can tell on me to Bo Hai.

605
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:27,626
Otherwise,

606
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:29,501
don’t always

607
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:30,959
stand in my way.

608
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,334
You’re back? Was everything going well?

609
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:05,918
Yes.

610
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:08,999
Things from Yunhe Flower Shop have arrived.

611
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:10,375
They’re put in the storehouse.

612
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,417
Let’s decide how to deal with them later.

613
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:13,834
Thanks.

614
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,542
When are you going to

615
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,083
tell Ling Lingqi?

616
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,000
I don’t want to get her involved.

617
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:25,709
I’ll just wait.

618
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,542
This is my shop.

619
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:57,501
And it’s also yours.

620
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:58,584
This is our flower shop.

621
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,751
Ours?

622
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,334
Awesome!

623
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:05,125
Mom, help me!

624
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:05,792
Hai!

625
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:06,709
Mom!

626
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:07,709
Hai!

627
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,000
Mom!

628
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,542
Mom!

629
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:07,459
Nan.

630
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,000
The happiness of life

631
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,501
matters more than money.

632
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,334
Kindness matters more than happiness.

633
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:15,417
A man can be poor,

634
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,125
but he must be kind.

635
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,083
No one lives well without kindness.

636
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,292
Nan?

637
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,959
Two carrots.

638
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,042
Two potatoes.

639
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,834
One onion.

640
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:46,250
OK.

641
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,250
What a surprise, Mr. Bo!

642
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:54,292
You said you would make a big meal.

643
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:55,501
You mean the hot pot?

644
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,167
Have some confidence in your boyfriend,

645
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,459
will you?

646
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,334
You know what?

647
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:01,834
I’ve reviewed all recipes

648
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:02,626
on the Internet.

649
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,834
At last, I made my decision.

650
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,876
It’s easier to

651
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,125
make a hot pot.

652
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:09,709
It can hardly go wrong.

653
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:13,292
Weird.

654
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:15,375
I never knew

655
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:17,042
there would be carrots or onions

656
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,209
for a hot pot.

657
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:19,918
You don’t understand, huh?

658
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,459
According to the Internet,

659
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:22,751
I’m making

660
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,542
the most popular

661
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:25,999
nourishing hot pot.

662
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:27,542
Just wait.

663
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,042
Okay.

664
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:36,501
Qi.

665
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:38,918
Do you know about

666
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,501
Mo Nan’s parents?

667
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:42,459
Why do you ask?

668
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:45,375
He’s your best friend.

669
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,125
I want to know more about him, too.

670
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,292
He never mentioned

671
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:52,626
his mother.

672
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:53,626
But I remember

673
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:54,959
his father was dead.

674
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:55,834
He was?

675
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:58,751
Do you know

676
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:00,999
how his father was dead?

677
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:03,167
He never told me.

678
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:09,083
Do you know

679
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,459
you touched your eyes?

680
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,501
You cut the onion

681
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,000
and then touched your eyes.

682
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:16,918
Aren’t your eyes burning?

683
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:22,667
Stop pretending.

684
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:23,834
Come on.

685
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:24,626
Hurry! Get me the tissue!

686
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:25,459
Put your hands down!

687
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,834
Put your hands down!

688
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,167
Get me a tissue.

689
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:29,999
Open your eyes.

690
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,626
Get me the tissue. What are you doing?

691
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,209
I’m recording!

692
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,042
Come on, stop!

693
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,250
Get me the tissue.

694
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:40,167
How do you feel?

695
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,209
It looks delicious,

696
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,417
doesn’t it?

697
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:45,834
I get such a great boyfriend!

698
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,125
You have a perfect figure

699
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,792
and you’re handsome.

700
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,083
You work well and even cook.

701
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,334
How I wish to show off to the whole world!

702
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,209
No!

703
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:57,667
I can’t do that!

704
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:58,709
If I show off,

705
00:35:58,709 --> 00:35:59,417
a lot of girls

706
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,751
will fall in love with you.

707
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:03,167
Don’t worry.

708
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:04,999
I only cook for you.

709
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,334
Come on. Have a try.

710
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:14,999
Be careful! Don’t burn yourself.

711
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:24,459
No man is perfect.

712
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:25,125
I don’t think

713
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:26,292
you should force yourself to cook.

714
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:27,542
It doesn’t taste good?

715
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:29,667
Impossible!

716
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:30,834
I made the soup

717
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:31,751
according to the recipe.

718
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:32,918
Let me have a try.

719
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,250
= Yile Sanatorium =

720
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:56,709
= Yile Sanatorium =
Mr. Mo.

721
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,667
As far as I’ve investigated,

722
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:00,375
this sanatorium

723
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,667
is strictly managed.

724
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:02,542
Only customers

725
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:03,792
and internal staff

726
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:04,834
can enter it

727
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,083
with identification.

728
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,000
Every Monday afternoon,

729
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,999
no visitors are received.

730
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,792
Bo Hai will not come.

731
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,250
It’s the best chance for you

732
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,209
to approach Lu Yunqing.

733
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,292
Mr. Mo, I checked that

734
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:21,125
Lu Yunqing moved in

735
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,667
last month.

736
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,250
Her room is on the fourth floor.

737
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,209
This is the plan for the fourth floor.

738
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:29,000
Take the elevator to the fourth floor

739
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,000
and walk to the last room.

740
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,042
There she is.

741
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:35,042
Of course,

742
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:36,667
you may run into someone

743
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,209
who works in the sanatorium.

744
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,292
But don’t worry.

745
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:41,667
Many part-time doctors

746
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,501
work there.

747
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:44,876
There’s a high staff turnover.

748
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:46,959
When a strange doctor turns up,

749
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,542
no one will suspect.

750
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:09,083
Wang looks honest

751
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,209
and dull.

752
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,292
I don’t think he’s the spy.

753
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:15,667
He isn’t, without doubt.

754
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:17,959
A fox is always sly.

755
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:19,375
If we want to catch a fox,

756
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:22,167
we must let down its guard.

757
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,334
Oh, I see.

758
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,250
You fired Wang,

759
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,751
so that the real spy will let down his guard.

760
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,042
Exactly.

761
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,501
Boss...

762
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:33,834
What are we going to do then?

763
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,918
I think

764
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,459
the spy must have something to do

765
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:40,334
with Yunhe Flower Shop.

766
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:41,334
This time,

767
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,000
I’ll make him bite the hook.

768
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,459
Completed.

769
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:48,542
Well done!

770
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,792
The spy hasn’t done anything so far.

771
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,042
Will he

772
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,209
really come to us?

773
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,584
Yes. He will.

774
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:08,918
Everything of Yunhe Flower Shop

775
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:11,292
is related to Lu Yunqing.

776
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:13,709
The key figure who was missing for twenty years

777
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:14,709
suddenly turned up.

778
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,250
Seems like

779
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:19,250
the puzzle will be readily solved.

780
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,375
No one can say no

781
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:23,876
to this temptation.

782
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:42,626
Stop what you’re doing!

783
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:44,834
There’s no Lu Yunqing!

784
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,167
It’s Bo Hai’s trap!

785
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,000
That was close!

786
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:08,584
