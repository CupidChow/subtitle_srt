51

I just got the news

52
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:46,375
that AiFan Household’s new products

53
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,751
has now reached the top three

54
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,792
trending topics online

55
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,501
after the press conference.

56
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:52,626
AiFan’s Marketing Department

57
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,709
just called that

58
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:54,876
their orders for the new products

59
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,626
today has skyrocketed.

60
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,959
We got good news in our shops too.

61
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,375
Our customer flow has returned

62
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,292
to the standard before this crisis.

63
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:06,792
Director Liu said

64
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,918
the big clients we lost

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,292
have also called over

66
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,584
for cooperation again.

67
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:12,959
The wind has finally subsided

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,542
and the waves have calmed down.

69
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,667
Don’t be happy too early.

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,417
The water is not tranquil yet.

71
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:21,375
The video

72
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,167
I got this morning,

73
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,667
it was doctored.

74
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:25,542
Doctored?

75
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:26,918
How do you know?

76
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,584
It was not Wen Guangqi?

77
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:32,999
It was his person.

78
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,125
But not Fang Cheng.

79
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,542
His slip

80
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,417
was too obvious.

81
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,751
You mean,

82
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,417
the real manipulator

83
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,083
is another one

84
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,209
under Wen Guangqi?

85
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:45,999
Not necessarily under him.

86
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,292
Could be above him.

87
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,375
They only have one reason

88
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:49,626
to do this.

89
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:50,876
Sacrifice Fang Cheng,

90
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,626
to cover the more important one.

91
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,083
Lu Baoni said

92
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,542
she wanted to celebrate together,

93
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:06,792
but she abandoned us for work.

94
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,501
I’ll represent her.

95
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,375
Tell me, what would you like to eat?

96
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,125
My treat.

97
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:15,584
If it weren’t you and Baoni,

98
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:16,459
I don’t think I can make it through

99
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:17,876
this time.

100
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,459
We’re besties.

101
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,083
Don’t take me as an outsider, OK?

102
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,876
Baoni is different from you.

103
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:25,918
I’ve known her

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,167
for nearly 7 years.

105
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:28,375
We went to high school together,

106
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,375
then to college.

107
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,459
I took the blame for her

108
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,876
and she takes for me.

109
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,626
But you’re different.

110
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:34,542
We’ve just met

111
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:35,250
for a short time.

112
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,626
And you’re willing to help me.

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,959
It’s some kind of destiny.

114
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,792
Mo Nan.

115
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,417
Thank you, Mo Nan.

116
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,125
Best friends, forever!

117
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,792
Both Baoni and I are trouble makers,

118
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,167
we might need your help again.

119
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:29,792
See ya.

120
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:43,250
It’s OK.

121
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,042
You can ask me for anything you need.

122
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:09,501
Oh right,

123
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:10,999
you’ve long known

124
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,417
Ling Lingqi didn’t do it?

125
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,250
Of course.

126
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,083
Not only he has long known

127
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,584
Ling Lingqi was wronged,

128
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:18,834
he also asked us

129
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,792
to act this play

130
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:21,000
for Wen Guangqi.

131
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,083
What?

132
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,292
Mr. Bo

133
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,417
didn’t let you take a leave

134
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,209
but ask you to do physical work

135
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,542
in flower base?

136
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:32,000
But now I’m thinking,

137
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,792
if Ling Lingqi finds out

138
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,250
he’s been acting the whole time…

139
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,000
Bo Hai, you remember?

140
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,459
When she came

141
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,250
to confront you the other day,

142
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:44,876
the horrible look in her eyes,

143
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:46,417
and before that, how she

144
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,417
tried to bug you in every way she could?

145
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,334
The imposing manner

146
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,918
is no easy one, you know that?

147
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,167
I’m so scared.

148
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,709
I got goose bumps right now.

149
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,375
Horrible.

150
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:01,792
Yeah.

151
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,000
Secretary Chen asked me

152
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,459
to get the copier repaired.

153
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:05,334
And the snacks are also

154
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,792
Secretary Chen asked you to give me?

155
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,918
Yeah, he said,

156
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,083
Mr. Bo wanted

157
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,209
no one knows about it.

158
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:12,250
How do you know about that?

159
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,876
I’m here. I gotta go. Bye.

160
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,999
I… I gotta go too.

161
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,709
Where are you going?

162
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:18,918
This floor got toilets,

163
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,292
I… I need to pee!

164
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,999
Chen Mo, you…

165
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,250
Chomper, you’ve been

166
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,334
playing with me the whole time?

167
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,042
Mr. Bo?

168
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,584
Mr. Bo?

169
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,584
Mr. Bo?

170
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,292
You scared me.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,876
Now you go out

172
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,292
and check if Ling Lingqi is there.

173
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:25,501
OK, Mr. Bo.

174
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:36,584
Mr. Bo,

175
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,876
no one is outside.

176
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:40,751
Thanks.

177
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:43,417
You take your time.

178
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,626
Take your time.

179
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,626
Don’t you think

180
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,999
I dare not enter the men’s room.

181
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,042
If you don’t apologize to me today,

182
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,083
don’t you ever want to leave.

183
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,167
Apologize?

184
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:31,959
For what?

185
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:33,876
For everything you’ve done wrong.

186
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,000
You wanna deny it?

187
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,250
You’re the most

188
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:37,667
shameless person I’ve ever met.

189
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:39,626
Am I wrong

190
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,125
for helping you secretly,

191
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:41,959
or

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,167
helping you find the truth?

193
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:45,584
You’ve already known

194
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,417
it wasn’t me.

195
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,751
I didn’t do it.

196
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:48,876
Why didn’t you explain it to everyone

197
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,125
that I was wronged?

198
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,584
I didn’t know
whether you’re the hidden traitoror not.

199
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,626
I don’t believe intuition,

200
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:54,792
but only evidence.

201
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,334
Based on the evidence we gathered,

202
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,834
you were the first suspect for sure.

203
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,709
So I went ahead

204
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:00,667
to keep Wen Guangqi in a puzzle

205
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,083
and look for evidence at the same time.

206
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,083
So the truth would come to light.

207
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:06,751
You were using me,

208
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:07,626
you know that?

209
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:08,999
You should be happy

210
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:10,792
that you were still valuable.

211
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,334
Why the company used me?

212
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:15,584
Why should I sacrifice

213
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:16,626
for your own interest?

214
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,250
You know what I’ve been through

215
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,375
these days?

216
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,209
Does anyone care

217
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,501
for my feelings?

218
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:35,709
Should I care for the feelings

219
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,876
of each employee?

220
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:37,999
It’s what

221
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:38,709
psychologists would do,

222
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,792
and they charge by hour.

223
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,584
I’m your boss

224
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:42,167
who pays you salary.

225
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,959
Please correct your attitude

226
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,667
towards work before me.

227
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,209
Or you won’t live easier

228
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,125
in the following days.

229
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:19,125
Baoni,

230
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:20,042
you look charming

231
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,334
while you work.

232
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:22,667
It’s over 4 o’clock.

233
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,999
You haven’t had lunch yet.

234
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:25,334
Fried chips.

235
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:28,459
Baoni doesn’t eat

236
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,292
puffed foods, am I right?

237
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,042
Chestnut cake?

238
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,918
Here, your favorite.

239
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,542
You know me.

240
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:51,125
A lot of fruits.

241
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,334
Wanna hear

242
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,792
an explosive news?

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,667
Qi just went to Bo Hai.

244
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,876
Isn’t it frightening?

245
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,667
We both know the ending,

246
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,709
but she is still gutsy.

247
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,167
That’s true.

248
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,459
Seems your attention

249
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,250
is all on Qi

250
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,083
recently.

251
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,459
My fairy Baoni,

252
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,334
more juice, less jealous.

253
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:35,667
OK?

254
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:39,709
But,

255
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,417
when can I

256
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,250
have your

257
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,417
meticulous

258
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,000
VIP service?

259
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,292
Aren’t you

260
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:56,250
having it

261
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,292
every day?

262
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,626
Who are sheltering you

263
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:00,792
from your crazy pursuers?

264
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:03,876
And,

265
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,042
now I can feel

266
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:09,334
their cold look and

267
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,709
strong hostility here.

268
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,584
Last time you said Wen Guangqi is

269
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:29,584
protecting someone from DREAM,

270
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,584
do you know who is he now?

271
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:31,626
If it’s that easy

272
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,459
to find him out,

273
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,292
Wen Guangqi wouldn’t have

274
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,000
sacrificed Fang Cheng.

275
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,167
Use your superb acting skill

276
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,042
to think

277
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,626
who loves pretending the most.

278
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,209
Why do you look at me?

279
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,459
You think I did it?

280
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:45,834
No,

281
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:46,918
not with your intelligence.

282
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:51,042
Mr. Bo.

283
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:04,292
From now on,

284
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,083
your bad luck

285
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,459
will be totally gone.

286
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,584
You’ll start over

287
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,042
as a totally new person.

288
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:11,751
Mom,

289
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:12,918
from which TV play

290
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:13,584
you learn about

291
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,626
those things?

292
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,876
I don’t remember.

293
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:17,834
Just some TV play.

294
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:18,834
They’re all like this.

295
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:20,042
Yeah.

296
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,250
Qi,

297
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:25,792
I got something to tell you.

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Your problem in the company

299
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,375
has been solved,

300
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,083
and there’s no need for a lawsuit now.

301
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:33,375
How about

302
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,709
you return me

303
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,042
the money

304
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:36,834
I lent to you

305
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:37,876
yesterday?

306
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:38,876
Right, I’ll get it for you.

307
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,584
Sit here.

308
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,740
= Postal Savings Bank of China =

309
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:58,834
Mr. Ling Guoliang,

310
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,626
I got something to ask you.

311
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:03,792
Do you know

312
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,417
there are

313
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:07,709
10,000 extra money in it?

314
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,375
I remember when I deposited it…

315
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,167
You remember it wrong.

316
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,125
Do I?

317
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:16,876
Ling Guoliang,

318
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,709
you’re saving money behind me again?

319
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:20,542
Do you want me to…

320
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,000
- Stop. Stop. - Mom. Mom.

321
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,459
Calm down, Mom.

322
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,292
What are you thinking about?

323
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:26,626
Look,

324
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:28,876
Qi, you can testify for me.

325
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,751
Your mom is very good to me.

326
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:31,751
She’s doing great

327
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,542
at home.

328
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,834
Especially for me,

329
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,334
she’s never reluctant in spending money.

330
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,125
Of course.

331
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:39,959
Under this situation,

332
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,334
if I dare keep money without telling her,

333
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,959
I’ll be split into two halves.

334
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,250
I’ll have no conscience.

335
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:44,959
OK.

336
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,584
You remember it wrong.

337
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,584
OK, I believe you.

338
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:48,959
So this money

339
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,083
I’ll take it as a pie

340
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,292
from the heaven.

341
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,876
Since no one’s claiming it.

342
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,375
My friends

343
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,542
asked me to

344
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,167
join in the tour to Hainan.

345
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:57,834
Well,

346
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,292
I’ll just take this money

347
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,083
and have a luxury tour.

348
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,999
Okay, go.

349
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,626
Have fun.

350
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:27,626
Mr. Chen,

351
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:28,751
sorry for

352
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:29,375
keeping you waiting.

353
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,417
Mr. Bo will be here in a minute.

354
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:31,459
It’s OK.

355
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,792
If you have to choose,

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,375
I think

357
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,375
the black and yellow

358
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:41,417
is better.

359
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:44,834
Since you have already selected

360
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,209
a vivid contrast color,

361
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,501
you might as well be bolder

362
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,999
in color matching.

363
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,334
It would look better.

364
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:52,667
Please wait a second.

365
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,834
Mr. Chen, have a look.

366
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:12,459
I added

367
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,000
some white between the black and yellow

368
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,751
as embellishment,

369
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:16,626
do you think

370
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:17,667
it makes the overall

371
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:18,459
color look brighter?

372
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,060
Doesn’t it conform to what

373
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,584
= Rich in 98% Fermentation Essence =
Doesn’t it conform to what

374
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:20,167
= Rich in 98% Fermentation Essence =
the theme of L’Oreal this time

375
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:20,620
= Rich in 98% Fermentation Essence =
Youth Code

376
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,083
Youth Code

377
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,334
wants to deliver?

378
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,918
People will sense

379
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,209
the breath of life in spring

380
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,334
once they see this bouquet.

381
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,083
I should have you

382
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,501
make the sample.

383
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:32,626
Little girl,

384
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:34,959
you must be the backbone

385
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,751
in your company, aren’t you?

386
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:37,667
No, I’m not.

387
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,167
I never found

388
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,459
Ling Lingqi

389
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,751
has this cleverness.

390
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,000
She’s just

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,417
an assistant doing chores.

392
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,709
Mr. Chen.

393
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:52,834
Hi.

394
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:53,501
Hello.

395
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:53,918
Have a seat.

396
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:54,417
Hi.

397
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,125
The bouquet Mr. Chen ordered

398
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:02,375
is an anniversary gift

399
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:03,260
for VIP customers.

400
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,959
The yellow and black

401
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,100
are the colors

402
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,042
of the trademark.

403
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,918
But you ignored the intent of the design

404
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,667
and added the jumping

405
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:11,834
and distracting white, which disorganized

406
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,667
the original color connotation here.

407
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:15,918
White chrysanthemum

408
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,751
is a flower which has rich meanings.

409
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,751
It’s easy to violate a taboo

410
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:21,959
of some customers.

411
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,834
So except some special occasions

412
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:24,626
like condolence,

413
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:25,709
a professional florist

414
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,334
will definitely give up using this flower.

415
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,626
Excuse me, Mr. Chen.

416
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,000
Sorry, Mr. Chen.

417
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,501
My assistant just made a joke with you.

418
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:37,834
It’s OK.

419
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,667
So,

420
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:44,999
which one do you prefer

421
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:45,751
between the two works

422
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:46,918
Mr. Li offered to you?

423
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,083
Chomper is so…

424
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,667
Talk like an unconcerned person.

425
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:53,999
Embarrass me in front of the client.

426
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:55,709
What a jerk.

427
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,667
Ling Lingqi, the florists in our company

428
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:07,751
have received strict

429
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:08,667
and professional training.

430
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:09,584
What they represent are

431
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,250
the most professional floriculture standard

432
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,292
and craftsmanship.

433
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:13,459
I’m warning you,

434
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:14,876
stop pretending a florist anymore.

435
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,042
You’re discrediting the company.

436
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,709
The client thought

437
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,417
I’m the backbone florist here.

438
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:21,834
What does it mean?

439
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,584
It means I have the ability.

440
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:27,876
You have a deep misunderstanding

441
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,000
about “ability”.

442
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,083
A person lack of sincerity

443
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,209
and with evil intentions like you

444
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,334
can never be a florist.

445
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,667
You’re right,

446
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,292
I was here with other intentions.

447
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,876
But I’m sober now.

448
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,792
Now I have

449
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,999
one intention,

450
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:46,792
the only one,

451
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,375
which is to diss you.

452
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:51,459
Wait for me.

453
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,125
Sooner or later,

454
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,501
I’ll become a florist.

455
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,918
Ok, I’ll be waiting.

456
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:01,417
The Spanish customer is waiting

457
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,459
in the meeting room.

458
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:03,959
Hurry and bring the fruit tray.

459
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,000
And make a cup of tea.

460
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:25,250
Tell us,

461
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:26,792
what you’ve learnt since

462
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,459
you’ve been here for a long time.

463
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:31,959
Sweep the floor.

464
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:33,375
Wipe the table.

465
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,959
Mop the floor.

466
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:36,876
All those I’ve never done

467
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:37,751
at home.

468
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,834
And document printing

469
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,000
on both sides.

470
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,250
And peel the fruits.

471
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,334
I make fruit dish

472
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,751
better than a professional cook.

473
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:49,000
And you want to be a florist?

474
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:54,209
That’s your so-called ability?

475
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:57,792
I need time

476
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:58,876
to learn more.

477
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,417
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

478
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,834
Don’t you think you made your life goal

479
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,667
a bit randomly?

480
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,167
Quite randomly.

481
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:10,834
Are you my best friends

482
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,209
or not?

483
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,292
Just because we’re your friends,

484
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,459
we must help you
realize the situation you’re in now,

485
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,584
then you can get to know the moving direction.

486
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:22,584
For what he did to me

487
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:23,876
about AiFan Household,

488
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:24,918
I thought

489
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,167
he would be a bit guilty

490
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:26,959
to me.

491
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,584
He might be

492
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:28,876
a bit nicer to me.

493
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:31,959
But I never expected

494
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,834
Chomper is just Chomper.

495
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,167
But it makes sense,

496
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,000
if he has a little conscience,

497
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,709
he wouldn’t be called Chomper.

498
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,167
The more conscienceless he is,

499
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,459
the more courage I got.

500
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:44,292
I swear I’ll become

501
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,334
a real florist!

502
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:46,125
If no one teaches me,

503
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,167
I’ll learn it by myself.

504
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:47,999
I can learn from

505
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,250
the owner of that online Relief Flower Shop

506
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,792
I’ll become a real florist

507
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,709
and prove it for him.

508
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,125
He won’t get away with it.

509
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:09,542
About this bouquet,

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,709
it doesn’t meet the client’s needs,

511
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:12,667
but I think

512
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,999
it looks quite good.

513
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:17,542
Take a picture of it

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,792
and record it

515
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,334
in the florist training manual.

516
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,959
Really?

517
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,999
As a negative example.

518
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,250
You’re so annoying.

519
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,667
People like her

520
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,459
with no wit

521
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:29,751
but only

522
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:30,417
tricks

523
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,167
don’t worth

524
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,250
me being nice.

525
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,834
I’m waiting and see

526
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,542
who will be over first.

527
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,083
How old are you?

528
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:40,375
You’re in high spirits.

529
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:42,375
But I think

530
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:43,542
since Ling Lingqi

531
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:44,959
becomes your assistant,

532
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,042
you find it pleasant in dissing her.

533
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,125
You’re refreshed and energetic.

534
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,709
Ling Lingqi is good.

535
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:55,667

I’m so sorry.

574
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I didn’t mean it.

575
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:19,959
Sorry.

576
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,250
He’s a president for god’s sake!

577
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,417
I just burned him a bit with hot water,

578
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:36,959
but he thinks out

579
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,501
this stupid way

580
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,042
to punish me.

581
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:43,876
So annoying.

582
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:44,626
I really don’t know

583
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:45,417
when can I finish

584
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,125
drawing this.

585
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:48,292
It’s quite a lot.

586
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,125
You wanna be a florist, don’t you?

587
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:54,501
Now

588
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,083
take it as an opportunity

589
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:57,792
to learn

590
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,626
how the other florists design.

591
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,584
It can also

592
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:01,792
improve your drawing level.

593
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,709
You’re stealing the others’ work.

594
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,250
You’re benefiting by that, all right?

595
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:10,584
The way you comforting people

596
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:11,667
is quite special.

597
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:18,709
Light color.

598
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,042
Oh, my waist.

599
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:38,626
Come,

600
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:40,834
have supper first.

601
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:42,834
Golden seafood.

602
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,292
Instant noodles again?

603
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,999
What do you mean again?

604
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,626
It’s Golden Seafood Noodles.

605
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,042
I won’t have it

606
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:55,542
until weekends.

607
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,999
I’m having bad days,

608
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,125
but God is still

609
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:04,209
merciful to me.

610
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:05,834
You see when I’m

611
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:06,709
down and out,

612
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:07,292
I still got

613
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:08,334
a best friend like you.

614
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,125
I’ll eat.

615
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:11,751
Go ahead.

616
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:13,709
It’s not weekend anyway.

617
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:15,999
No it’s not. I’m not having it.

618
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,417
I leave it to you.

619
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,205
Twenty minutes.

620
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:24,782
Only a small spoon in it.

621
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,645
Seems Cotillard is quite interested

622
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,651
in our works.

623
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,337
It’s his typical look.

624
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:41,680
This is not his feeling towards work

625
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,880
but a courtesy…

626
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,582
This French’s taste is…

627
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:49,257
Wei, have you ever felt that

628
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:52,571
it’s just about an entering right in a store?

629
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,542
Why you’re home so late today?

630
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,626
Next week there’s gonna be a line dance

631
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:00,501
competition in our community.

632
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:01,584
Although I am

633
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,626
a seeded dancer now,

634
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,918
I can’t relax.

635
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,834
I must live up to the expectation

636
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,918
of our neighbors.

637
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:09,167
Yeah.

638
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:13,042
Where is Qi? Qi.

639
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,417
Working upstairs with Mo Nan.

640
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:20,626
What? Working with Mo Nan?

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,501
What?

642
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:24,667
Isn’t she working with Bo Hai

643
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,125
all the time?

644
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,417
How could she

645
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:28,501
work with that lad

646
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:29,417
living in the balcony?

647
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:31,709
He’s in the Marketing Department,

648
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,834
she is the boss’s assistant,

649
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,083
I don’t know

650
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,042
what kind of work they need to do it together.

651
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:38,792
You’re right.

652
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:45,709
You lost your vigilance.

653
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:46,959
I’m telling you, Ling Guoliang,

654
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,334
I’m so disappointed

655
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,083
in you

656
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,459
for your education to Qi.

657
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:54,542
I’m gonna go check it.

658
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,501
Mo Nan, open the door!

659
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,125
Uncle, aunt, Qi is asleep.

660
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,292
You violated the law, you know that?

661
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:18,709
Move!

662
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,250
Qi, Qi.

663
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,792
Qi? Qi? Qi?

664
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:25,959
Wake up, you can’t sleep like this.

665
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:26,959
You’ll catch a cold.

666
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:27,626
Come on.

667
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:28,542
Little girl, why don’t you know

668
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:30,083
how to protect yourself?

669
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,459
Come back home if you wanna sleep.

670
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,375
Go home.

671
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:32,834
Come.

672
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,000
Go.

673
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,334
Wait.

674
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:35,876
I’ll

675
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,042
bring those to you later.

676
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,584
Mo Nan, listen carefully,

677
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,792
don’t you think

678
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,083
you look pretty

679
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,292
so you can

680
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,999
hit on Qi.

681
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:48,209
Aunt, I…

682
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,000
You think who I am,

683
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,417
and what kind of person I haven’t met?

684
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:51,792
You,

685
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,250
you are good at nothing.

686
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:55,709
All you have is your sweet words

687
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:56,918
and pretty face to coax girls.

688
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,167
I despise people like you.

689
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:00,834
Don’t you dare hit on Qi again!

690
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,250
Qi, your parcel.

691
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,125
Thanks.

692
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:35,918
This is

693
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,459
Mr. Relief florist’s work!

694
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:38,999
You’re picked by him?

695
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,125
You’re in the shade,

696
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:41,417
but you can still blossom.

697
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:54,626
Ling Lingqi,

698
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:55,959
since you’ve picked

699
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,375
by him,

700
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,834
you’ll definitely become a florist.

701
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,918
You happy?

702
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:20,709
These are all good designs,

703
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,375
but your copies are so ugly.

704
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,626
I haven’t complained

705
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:27,918
your designs yet.

706
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:29,501
They look bluffing,

707
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,083
but each of them is flashy

708
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,083
without substance.

709
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,667
I recommend you to check an online shop

710
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:34,792
named Relief Flower Shop.

711
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,250
It’s a small shop,

712
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:37,459
one order for one week only.

713
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:38,334
But their design is

714
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:40,167
spiritual and meaningful.

715
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,000
Grand design is different

716
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,334
from small bouquet.

717
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,125
Don’t talk irresponsibly

718
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,209
if you know nothing.

719
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:48,667
Whatever you’re

720
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:49,501
jealous or quibbling,

721
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:50,292
it’s no use.

722
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,667
I’m telling the truth.

723
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,334
They’re a clear flow in flower arts.

724
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,125
You’re mudflow.

725
00:29:56,667 --> 00:30:00,125
What? I’m mudflow?

726
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:01,667
With underserved reputation.

727
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:04,042
Keen on small tricks.

728
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,292
If you’re not mudflow then what?

729
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:07,501
Well,

730
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:09,250
if you admire that online shop

731
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:10,584
so much,

732
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:11,626
go facsimile

733
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:12,876
all their designs.

734
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:14,167
OK, I’ll do it.

735
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,292
Better than facsimiling yours.

736
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,375
I just don’t get it.

737
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,334
Why there are so many girls

738
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,584
who can’t find boyfriends,

739
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:53,667
but you

740
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,918
have so many men around you,

741
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:57,167
and those men

742
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,167
are so obsessed by you and

743
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,584
throwing themselves at your feet?

744
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:02,876
Why?

745
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,626
God is so particularly

746
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:07,626
unfair.

747
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,876
If there is anything to blame,

748
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,501
it’s my damn charm.

749
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,626
I’m serious,

750
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:21,501
I’m your good sister

751
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,292
but I haven’t had lunch yet.

752
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,709
You pulled me over so

753
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,999
I want my performance fee.

754
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,999
Performance fee. Performance fee.

755
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:30,667
OK, OK.

756
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:32,999
You haven’t started performing yet.

757
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,542
Stop putting yourself on airs.

758
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,042
All right.

759
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:38,667
I’ll treat you crayfish.

760
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:39,334
Is that OK?

761
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:40,417
Let’s go.

762
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,083
That’s more like it.

763
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,660
= International Sunyard =

764
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:55,417
Li.

765
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:56,167
Baoni.

766
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,375
Hi.

767
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,250
Baoni.

768
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:03,709
Him again?

769
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:04,959
It was him last month.

770
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:07,667
Yeah, why I’m so obsessed by him?

771
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:11,417
Baoni, you’ve changed.

772
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:13,501
Your boyfriend never

773
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,999
lasted one month before.

774
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:21,250
Yeah, boys to me

775
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:22,459
are like dresses.

776
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:23,792
Always new if changes.

777
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,792
But Mo Nan is different.

778
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:28,709
He’s more like a

779
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:29,709
Haute Douture.

780
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:30,751
Once you put it on,

781
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,626
you don’t wanna take it off.

782
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:50,042
Miss Lu,

783
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:51,667
my body is not on sale.

784
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:52,709
Shut up.

785
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:55,918
Oh right,

786
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,209
you don’t mind my boyfriend

787
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,292
joining us for lunch, do you?

788
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,667
Joining my ass!

789
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,999
Waiter, check!

790
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,000
Bill on them.

791
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:09,459
Don’t leave.

792
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:10,792
No one is paying your bill.

793
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:16,584
Lu Baoni.

794
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:19,417
I’ll buy you spicy crayfish.

795
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,125
No, I don’t want that.

796
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,083
I wanna eat here.

797
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:29,417
Lu Baoni,

798
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,667
although you’re my fairy,

799
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:33,501
I’m warning you,

800
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:35,584
if you ever

801
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:36,667
take advantage of me again…

802
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,042
you better inform me in advance.

803
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:41,375
Look at you.

804
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,999
It was just an improvisation.

805
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,000
I don’t mind at all,

806
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,709
what are you pretentious about?

807
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,209
Like you never

808
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,584
hugged a girl before.

809
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,501
Did you really never hug girls?

810
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,250
I… I did.

811
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,125
Qi hugged me before.

812
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,417
But I never took you two

813
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:07,167
as girls.

814
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,709
Goodness!

815
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:10,292
Haven’t you ever been in

816
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,792
a relationship before, have you?

817
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:12,667
What are you talking about?

818
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:18,918
I’m an aggressive man.

819
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:23,334
Young people should focus on their careers.

820
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:25,999
Falling in love is a waste of time,

821
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:26,959
and money.

822
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:27,667
And,

823
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,042
if I got a girlfriend,

824
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,667
she will definitely make me

825
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,709
stay away from you two,

826
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:36,918
especially you.

827
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,959
You can’t say.

828
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:42,459
Unless she’s blind.

829
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:50,375
You know I’ve been

830
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,667
working overtime for three days.

831
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,167
The best employee for this year

832
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:56,250
has to be me.

833
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:57,751
Forget about it.

834
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,542
You got poor production at work.

835
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:00,542
Bullshit.

836
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:02,667
Seriously, our boss

837
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:03,792
is a workaholic for sure.

838
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:05,667
He often works

839
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:06,626
day and night.

840
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,292
He went to hospital a few days ago

841
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:08,959
for overwork.

842
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,042
Really?

843
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:11,918
No way.

844
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,584
I saw Mr. Bo

845
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:16,042
quite well days before.

846
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,501
Why the car hasn’t arrived yet?

847
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,042
It won’t.

848
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,000
It’s a nice day today.

849
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,834
I’m gonna walk to the office.

850
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You did this

851
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:58,792
because you saw me yawning,

852
00:35:58,792 --> 00:35:59,751
didn’t you?

853
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:03,083
Yeah.

854
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,709
I did.

855
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:05,584
If I don’t refresh you up

856
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:06,626
through walking,

857
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:07,667
how can you keep working?

858
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,125
Get up.

859
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:12,334
Get up.

860
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:31,667
Chomper,

861
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,459
today I’ll enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

862
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,501
Miss, my flower, my flower.

863
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:47,792
Ling Lingqi.

864
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:50,292
Are you out of your mind?

865
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:55,999
How could it…

866
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,375
Grandma, how much is it?

867
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:03,209
I’ll buy it.

868
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,584
Never mind.

869
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:07,542
I’ve been here the whole day

870
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,459
but never sold one.

871
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:10,751
Just take it.

872
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:16,959
Why don’t you catch up?

873
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:19,375
It’s lunch break.

874
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:20,334
Just go rest

875
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:21,083
in any places you like.

876
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,459
I’m resting here.

877
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:23,876
But, you…

878
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:24,667
Grandma,

879
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,751
you won’t sell

880
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:26,292
a single flower

881
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:27,125
if you put them like that.

882
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,083
It doesn’t look good.

883
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:29,626
If you trust me,

884
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,042
let me pack it for you.

885
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:32,459
Pack?

886
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,751
The craft shop in the front

887
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:58,501
threw them out,

888
00:37:58,501 --> 00:37:59,250
so I picked them up.

889
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,000
These wastes are quite suitable

890
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,501
for being flower basket.

891
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:10,667
Aren’t they?

892
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,501
These small wild flowers

893
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,083
are inconspicuous,

894
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,709
but they have their original

895
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:20,667
natural vitality.

896
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,900
= Hey boys, are you still holding
dyed roses with golden thread? =

897
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,340
= Bouquet ¥30/bundle =

898
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,420
= Bouquet ¥30/bundle =

899
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,460
= Hey boys, are you still holding
dyed roses with golden thread? =

900
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:41,334
Thank you.

901
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:44,250
Friends over there,

902
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:44,959
do you need flowers?

903
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:45,792
Sold out.

904
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:46,292
Out?

905
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,417
- Never thought
- Sold out.

906
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:48,999
it’s sold out so soon.

907
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:49,417
Yeah.

908
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:50,834
It’s so great.

909
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,042
Thank you!

910
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,042
It’s OK.

911
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:57,292
Grandma,

912
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:58,292
we’re leaving.

913
00:39:58,501 --> 00:39:59,584
Be careful on the way home.

914
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:00,959
OK.

915
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:02,167
- Thanks. - OK.

916
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:02,999
Bye.

917
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:03,584
Goodbye.

918
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:04,709
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

919
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:07,459
Ling Lingqi,

920
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,667
you did an amazing work.

921
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,125
I still remember that

922
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,125
someone told me

923
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,000
I’ll never be a florist.

924
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:15,999
Street florist,

925
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:18,375
I would be embarrassed to say it.

926
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:23,250
Street florist?

927
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:24,334
I’ve sold them

928
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:25,209
within 20 minutes.

929
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:26,167
I don’t think

930
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,292
you can do that.

931
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:28,584
The real flower art is

932
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,667
neither merchandise easy to sell

933
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:32,292
nor ornamentation which is aesthetic,

934
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:34,375
but a secret prescription
that can heal someone’s soul.

935
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:35,792
Every florist

936
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,083
is a messenger of nature.

937
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,459
They communicate with flowers and

938
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:40,417
plants with their heart

939
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:41,876
to heal the souls nowhere to place,

940
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,334
and to make them feel

941
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:45,792
the light and warmth in the dark.

942
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:47,999
You’ve almost bluffed me

943
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,542
by saying this.

944
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,083
Don’t worry.

945
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:52,918
I’ll ask your…

946
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,375
I’ll ask him how to heal your mind

947
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,083
next time I meet him.

948
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:56,709
Shut up.

949
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:08,959
Are you speechless

950
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:09,959
and shedding tears now?

951
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,140
= Outpatient =

952
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,083
This is the hospital

953
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,125
Bo Hai came before.

954
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,083
Zhang was hemmed about this,

955
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,584
I believe he’s hiding something.
