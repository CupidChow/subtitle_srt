Have you heard about it?

52
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,125
Mr. Bo has signed up for the competition!

53
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,542
After keeping a low profile for five years,

54
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,792
he came out again.

55
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:53,751
Was Mr. Bo being stimulated

56
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:54,751
or something?

57
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:55,999
As the special coordinator

58
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:56,792
for the Floriculture Competition,

59
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:57,918
our company shall

60
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,083
transfer some employees

61
00:01:59,167 --> 00:01:59,709
to help at the contest.

62
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:00,626
I signed up for that.

63
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,667
When Mr. Bo takes part,

64
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,751
Marketing Department shall send a guy there, huh?

65
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,501
Yeah, sure.

66
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,292
It must be tough work.

67
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,083
Why would it be?

68
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,292
Everyone in the company

69
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,250
wants to join in the fun.

00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,375

72
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,459
must be wonderful.

73
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:20,876
Well, do me a favor.

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,417
Take me to have a look.

75
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,292
How will you thank me?

76
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:25,501
We’re good friends.

77
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,209
Are you serious?

78
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,042
Qi, come with us.

79
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,334
Even if I don’t want to go,

80
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:32,626
I can’t get rid of it.

81
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,167
Hand over your work.

82
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,167
From tomorrow on,

83
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,083
go to the International Floriculture Competition

84
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:39,999
with me

85
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,417
as my assistant.

86
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,292
Do you want me

87
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,501
to take cover for you?

88
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,751
So what?

89
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:51,834
I still have something

90
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,292
on you, your father’s shop.

91
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,501
That was great, Chomper.

92
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:57,584
When you beg me for help,

93
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:58,792
try to be nicer!

94
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,000
Or we’re done

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,667
and I’ll no longer help you.

96
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,125
Let’s see who will lose more.

97
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:03,918
Is it your company,

98
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:04,584
or my father’s shop?

99
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,584
You know what?

100
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,334
I’ve been

101
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,459
working tiredly.

102
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,999
I didn’t sleep well or eat well.

103
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,918
I don’t think

104
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,209
I can work for you.

105
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,042
What a drama queen!

106
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,417
No. No.

107
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,125
Why don’t you get

108
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,375
another assistant?

109
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:25,834
I’m going home

110
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,334
to take a good rest.

111
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,250
Stop!

112
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,083

113
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,292
Waiter.

114
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,876
Get me the menu, please.

115
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,000
Hello. What else do you want?

116
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,000
A stew.

117
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:24,334
Okay.

118
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,876
Shredded potatoes and rice.

119
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Okay. Wait a second.

120
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:27,459
Thank you.

121
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:33,542
Have you never

122
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:34,959
been full in your life?

123
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,250
I’m full.

124
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,459
But I can still eat if I try to.

125
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,876
If you spent

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,083
as much enthusiasm

127
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,083
in work,

128
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,125
you would have been a florist.

129
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:52,417
If you spent

130
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,626
as much enthusiasm

131
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,542
in your life,

132
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:55,334
you wouldn’t have been

133
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,250
such an annoying man!

134
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,125
Forget it. I don’t argue with a man

135
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,709
who only enjoys the spicy gluten.

136
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,876
You have no idea!

137
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:03,667
I’m enjoying

138
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,459
the simple happiness.

139
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,459
You always

140
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,626
look poker-faced.

141
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,626
But sometimes,

142
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:12,918
you look cute, too.

143
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,918
It tastes so good!

144
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,000

Please double the things

148
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:29,667

149
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,584
and pack them for me.

150
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:31,375
I’ll take them away.

151
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,083
Okay.

152
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,250
Such delicious dishes.

153
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:34,834
I’m taking them home

154
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,959
for my parents.

I’m too full to walk.

157
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,000
This is the pedestrian street.

158
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:54,792
We can’t get a taxi

159
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:55,918
until we walk 1km farther.

160
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,042
You really picked a good place.

161
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,292
Thank you!

162
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,292
Chomper!

163

How dared you fall on me!

164
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:49,792
Fat enough to protect me!

Look!

167
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,000
You ordered so many dishes.

168
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,959
And you waste the rest of them!

169
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,167
You’re right.

170
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,000
Take this.

171
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,667
They all taste so delicious.

172
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:23,834
I don’t even know

173
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,083
where to start.

00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,250
is really generous to you.

178
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,417
He ordered so many dishes

179
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:35,834
and they’re all expensive.

180
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:37,751
It means that

181
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:39,209
she’ll have a boyfriend.

182
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,125
I’m not sure about others.

183
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,918
But he’s so generous

184
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,250
to our daughter.

185
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,709
Qi, does he have a crush on you?

186
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:53,542
Qi, what’s wrong with you?

187
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,209
What’s wrong?

188
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,834
The Chomper’s fault!

189
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,751
He nearly crushed my waist!

190
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,626
- Waist? - Waist?

191
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,542
Not in the way you imagined!

192
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:07,751
No!

193
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:15,751
I read your report.

194
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,792
A series of data

195
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,999
remain stable.

196
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,125
In the past few years,

197
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,751
you have always

198
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:23,751
been stable

199
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,083
unless you have a relapse.

200
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:25,709
So,

201
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,751
I think you can take part in the competition,

202
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,375
providing there are no

203
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,000
impressive external stimulation.

204
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,834
As long as you relax

205
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,999
and care little for the result,

206
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,417
you’ll be all right.

207
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:41,501
Thank you.

= Psychology Department Consulting Room 1 =

No. 23.

210
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,167

211

This is the proposal

214
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:37,876
for the shop event next month.

215
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,334
Director asked us to

216
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,459
prepare the supplies,

217
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,125
coordinate the media

218
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:43,792
and arrange the cameramen.

219
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,334
Oh,

220
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,999
don’t forget the training for shop assistants.

221
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:47,959
Okay.

222
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:00,459
Boss.

223
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,626
Tomorrow is the pre-competition.

224
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,542
Ling Lingqi and I will be waiting for you

225
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,834
at half past eight in the morning on the site.

226
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,250
What’s wrong? Stressed?

227
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:15,792
I understand.

228
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,209
You know what?

229
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,042
In tomorrow’s contest,

230
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,709
if I have a relapse,

231
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,876
I may give away all my career

232
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,000
to someone else.

233
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,667
If you change your mind,

234
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,667
tell me immediately.

235
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,292
I’m going to tell the organizing committee.

236
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,250
There’s still time.

237
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,334
My illness is a time bomb

238
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,792
for our company.

239
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,250
Over the years, I’ve been panicking,

240
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,584
in case it might explode someday.

241
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,417
Don’t be so sensitive.

242
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:49,083
We’re good, aren’t we?

243
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,667
The illness isn’t the most terrible thing,

244
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,667
but my fear is.

245
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,125
So, this time,

246
00:10:58,834 --> 00:10:59,918
I must take the initiative.

247
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:03,876
You make some sense.

248
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,459
Before you want to defeat others,

249
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,167
you have to defeat yourself.

250
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:10,584
All right.

251
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,667
That’s a good point.

252
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,667
I agree with that.

253
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:16,709
Where are you going later?

254
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,167
It’s getting dark, and where are you going?

255
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,209
I’m not going anywhere.

256
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,375
Why don’t you have fun with me?

257
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,667
What fun?

258
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,626
Come on.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,667
Come on.

260
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:29,751
Who wins?

261
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:30,792
I win, huh?

262
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:31,542
Shame on you!

263
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:32,959
Come on.

264
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,620
Why do you

265
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,667
look like an alien?

266
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:41,792
I am an alien!

267
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,918
Come over. Come.

268
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,542
Why…

269
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,959
Why can I only lean?

270
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:45,375
Something wrong!

271
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,083
Look!

272
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,000
Another dream?

273
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,584
And what’s this all about?

275
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,876
Yunhe Flower Shop?

276
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,375
Mom.

277
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,501
Mom. Mom.

278
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,542
Mom. Mom.

279
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,375
Mom!

280
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,167
It doesn’t feel right.

281
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:16,501
His dream

282
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:17,876
is always naive.

283
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:19,000
Since when was it

284
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,209
so pathetic?

285
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,000
Mom!

286
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:29,667
Help me! Help me!

287
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,167
Help me!

288
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,918
Help me! Help me!

289
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,459
Help me!

290
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:05,083
The four-yearly

291
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,459
International Floriculture Competition

292
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,125
is now officially started

293
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,417
in the Exhibition Center.

294
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:10,999
In this competition,

295
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,918
we have

296
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:12,918
37 competitors

297
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,667
from 23 countries.

298
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,125
The most eye-catching one

299
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:18,501
is certainly Bo Hai from China.

300
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:19,999
As a legend

301
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,042
in Chinese floriculture industry,

302
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,626
Bo Hai has never taken part in

303
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,626
any competition before.

304
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,209
Mr. Bo.

305
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,999
Taking part in this competition

306
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:26,792
also broke

307
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:27,792
his practice.

308
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:30,209
That’s really worth expecting.

309
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:30,959
For the sake of the competition,

310
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,167
we won’t answer your questions now.

311
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,167
Later, our colleague

312
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,125
in the Marketing Department

313
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:34,751
will answer your questions

314
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,042
on behalf of Mr. Bo.

315
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,501
Make way. Make way.

316
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,626
Mr. Bo, don’t go.

317
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,584
Mr. Bo, could you hold on a second?

318
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,667
When I can watch such a top competition,

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,292
I’m really excited.

320
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:47,626
If you didn’t get me out

321
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:48,792
from my director with an excuse,

322
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:49,959
I would have certainly missed

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,626
such a good chance of great fun.

324
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:52,999
My fairy asked me for help.

325
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,167
And I must do that for you.

326
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,209
Thank you!

327
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,334
I’ll reward you later.

I’ll announce it.

358
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:13,167
Okay.

359
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:15,834
Everybody.

360
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,417
Through the appraisal of the jury,

361
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,667
we already have

362
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,083
the list of competitors

363
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:24,792
for the final.

364
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,959
Please look at the screen.

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,834
Congratulations.

366
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,626
Chinese florist Bo Hai

367
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,876
enters the final as the first place

368
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,042
in the pre-competition.

369
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,940
How cool Mr. Bo is!

370
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,340
= Flowers Make It Perfect =
How cool Mr. Bo is!

371
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,460
= Flowers Make It Perfect =
Yes!

372
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,375
So cool!

373
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:55,959
I even want to forgive him

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,417
for deducting my salary for three months.

375
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,918
He really convinced me!

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,292
Shut up. I can hear nothing!

377
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,250
Go. Go.

378
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:19,626
Director Zhou.

379
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,334
Why did you turn it off? Turn it on!

380
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,167
How did Mr. Bo do?

381
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,042
He’s the first in the pre-competition.

382
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:37,709
Didn’t you see it?

383
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,417
Bo Hai did perfectly in the pre-competition.

384
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:40,501
Take it easy.

385
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,542
The competition just started.

386
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,083
If it goes smoothly,

387
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,918
Bo Hai can even be the champion.

388
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,667
If it can really go smoothly,

389
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,000
why didn’t he take part in any competition

390
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,959
in the past years?

391
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,459
And he even saw a psychiatrist

392
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,918
before the contest.

393
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,542
I’m worried.

394
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,083
We trapped him

395
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,042
to take part in the competition.

396
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:00,918
Hope we won’t

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,459
shoot ourselves in the foot.

398
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:05,167
All right. Don’t panic.

399
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,250
Keep checking on

400
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,542
the psychiatrist stuff.

401
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:08,876
I’ll take care of the competition.

402
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,334
I’ve got a feeling that

403
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,792
we will achieve something

404
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:17,834
this time!

405
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:23,584
Who were you calling?

406
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,375
What do you mean achieving something?

407
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,334
Baoni.

408
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,334
You must keep the secret for me.

409
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,959
This is totally about my promotion.

410
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:41,125
Let me explain.

411
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,167
I…

412
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:44,876
I just called

413
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,125
to get in touch with

414
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,083
some familiar media.

415
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,626
I asked them

416
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,626
to issue some important articles

417
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,834
regarding Mr. Bo’s competition.

418
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,542
Half page at least.

419
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,834
Why must you keep it secret?

420
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,334
See? You have no idea.

421
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,334
I take advantages of my own friends.

422
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,292
It’s not a mission assigned by Director Zhou.

423
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,167
Think about it. How jealous she is!

424
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,250
If she knows,

425
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,501
she’ll think I steal her thunder.

426
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,375
I’m a mere employee.

427
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,375
I have to keep a low profile.

428
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,626
Besides, look…

429
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,751
After the articles

430
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:20,209
are published,

431
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:21,999
the media will follow up.

432
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:23,876
Boss will know

433
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,083
I helped with that.

434
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,709
He’ll reward me.

435
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,375
And Director Zhou can’t blame me then.

436
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,167
I’ll treat you to dinner!

437
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:32,542
That’s a good plan!

438
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:33,292
Isn’t it?

439
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:35,542
Let’s go.

440
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:50,542
Mr. Bo.

441
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,417
- Mr. Bo. Hello. - Mr. Bo.

442
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,501
We’re floriculture enthusiasts.

443
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,083
We really, really adore you!

444
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,042
Could we take a photo with you?

445
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,542
And the autograph. Sign for us, please.

446
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,000
Come.

447
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,834
Three, two, one.

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,584
My turn. My turn.

449
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:06,292
Okay.

450
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,292
Okay.

451
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:09,667
Thank you.

452
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,542
Thank you, Mr. Bo.

453
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:12,959
Fangirls!

454
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,083
You designed a good bouquet.

455
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,959
But compared to Mr. Relief florist,

456
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:17,751
you still have

457
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,209
a long way to go.

458
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,417
Why doesn’t Mr. Relief florist

459
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,999
take part in the competition then?

460
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,501
Because he doesn’t show off

461
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:24,876
like you do.

462
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,751
He’s too unskilled

463
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,167
to show up.

464
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,209
Anyway, in my heart,

465
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,792
Mr. Relief florist is always the uncrowned king.

466
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:36,542
I hear you talking about

467
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,584
Mr. Relief florist.

468
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,999
I find him awesome, too.

469
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,083
But he’s kind of weird.

470
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:44,083
He sells flowers online

471
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,417
on the sly.

472
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,250
I don’t know if he’s really a man.

473
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:48,334
Besides,

474
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:49,292
he always

475
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,709
moans and groans

476
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,459
with depressed young people online.

477
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,209
Can he be a psychopath?

478
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,250
Bo… Bo Hai.

479
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:02,834
Bo Hai.

480
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,834
Bo Hai, I come to tell you that

481
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,542
the organizing committee

482
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,125
has a special show during the lunch hour.

483
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,584
We must go for that.

484
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,459
You!

485
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,667
Come for the show after lunch.

486
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:14,626
You mustn’t ask for leave.

487
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:17,876
I’ve been standing for the whole morning.

488
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,417
My legs gave out.

489
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,459
I don’t think I can come.

490
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,417
Someone you can’t handle?

491
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:24,334
I’ll give you

492
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:25,584
a double pay for working overtime.

493
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:27,542
Triple!

494
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:29,751
Deal!

495
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:32,209
Boss!

496
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,584
I’ve been working hard

497
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,334
for so many years.

498
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,542
But you have never given me

499
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,709
a triple pay.

500
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:38,083
I don’t know

501
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,334
why I promised her.

502
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:40,792
Hurry up.

503
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,250
I’m making a mint. Hurry.

504
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,209
Don’t stand on ceremony.

505
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:43,959
All for you.

506
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:44,709
And…

507
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,626
The sandwich is getting cold.

508
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,459
Enjoy it soon!

509
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:53,459
In the Marketing Department,

510
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,209
only Mo Nan is working overtime.

511
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,334
And I hear that

512
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,042
he applied for that.

513
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:01,834
I didn’t expect him

514
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,167
to be so aspirant.

515
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,167
Seems like

516
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,834
he wants to be a model worker.

517
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,042
I’m surprised, too.

518
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,999
When Mo Nan isn’t here,

519
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:08,584
you can’t even

520
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,083
enjoy your lunch.

521
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,751
Really fell in love with him?

522
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,334
No.

523
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,834
Look at your face. No?

524
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:22,542
You see me in pain,

525
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:23,709
and how dare you still

526
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,209
laugh so happily?

527
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,375
Anyway,

528
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:29,667
you used to hurt

529
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,292
many boys’ hearts.

530
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,876
I think Mo Nan is sent

531
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:35,584
to conquer you.

532
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,000
Could it be

533
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,709
the so-called retribution?

534
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,501
I was always being chased

535
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,083
for the past twenty years.

536
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:45,876
Since when

537
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,250
did I have a crush on someone else?

538
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:50,999
Anyway, I’m not worried.

539
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:51,876
You get into love soon,

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,459
and get out of it soon, too.

541
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:54,834
You’ll be alright soon.

542
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,083
You’re right.

543
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,250
Maybe,

544
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:58,999
I’ll have a new

545
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,125
and reliable pursuer.

546
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,626
Then I’ll totally

547
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:02,417
forget about Mo Nan.

548
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,250
Yes. It must be like that.

549
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,501
Baoni, wake up!

550
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,209
Why do you like Mo Nan?

551
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:12,959
No way.

552
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,209
It doesn’t make any sense.

553
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:14,709
Stop!

554
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,417
You’ll forget him soon, won’t you?

555
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,209
That’s ridiculous!

556
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,667
That’s impossible!

557
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,501
Who likes Mo Nan?

558
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:22,375
She does!

559
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:25,167
Me?!

560
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:26,876
Qi?

561
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,209
Isn’t she a fangirl for Chomper?

562
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,292
Have a new sweetheart?

563
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:38,125
This is the psychological prescription

564
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,834
I just got.

565
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,292
One piece was torn off.

566
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,209
Judged by the date,

567
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,220
the torn-off prescription

568
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,900
= Prescription =
the torn-off prescription

569
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,083
is likely to be Bo Hai’s.

570
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,959
Seems like he’s vigilant.

571
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,375
Good.

572
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,083
The more vigilant he is,

573
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,501
the more suspicious he is.

574
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:06,501
Give me a pen.

575
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,060
= Prescription =

576
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,250
The organizing committee

577
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,125
is holding

578
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,375
a welcome show.

579
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,125
Should we present him

580
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:36,751
something special?

581
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:52,292
Xinyan.

582
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,000
Didn’t I ask you

583
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:55,918
to stay in the company?

584
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,000
Why do you come?

585
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,125
It’s lunch hour.

586
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,042
I have the invitation

587
00:24:59,042 --> 00:24:59,792
for the show

588
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,667
from the organizing committee.

589
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:01,792
So, I come to visit you.

590
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:02,626
Where’s Bo Hai?

591
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,667
He’s resting in the lounge.

592
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:06,501
I’ll go see him.

593
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,918
Stop bothering him.

594
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,375
He already has much pressure.

595
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:11,918
If you really want to see someone,

596
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,125
see me.

597
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:14,501
I’m quite free.

598
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:17,334
Xinyan!

599
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:20,083
Five minutes left.

600
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,876
Hurry up!

601
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,209
It’s starting! Hurry up!

602
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:22,834
Take it to me asap!

603
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,083
- Okay. Okay. - Yes. Yes.

604
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,667
Hurry up!

605
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:32,125
- Come. - Mr. Bo.

606
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,083
Give this to…

607
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,250
- To… - Be careful.

608
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,792
It’s messy here. Don’t get hurt.

609
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:42,918
Okay.

610
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:57,876
Bo Hai.

611
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,334
Why is he sitting there?

612
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:09,250
I told you

613
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,501
not to leave him a seat.

614
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,834
But I’m sitting here.

615

00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,900
= Fire =
I’ve been to Mr. Bo’s house once.

617
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,999
He doesn’t even have a kitchen.

618
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,000
I remember once

619
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:42,167
during a fire safety inspection,

620
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,083
we already had

621
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:44,042
the number of standard equipment

622
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,584
by 1.5 times.

623
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:47,042
But when Mr. Bo heard it,

624
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,417
he asked the Administration Department right away

625
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:49,751
to get one more set.

626
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:50,501
HR Department

627
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:51,375
took a lot of trouble

628
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:52,584
to hire a designer.

629
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:53,959
But he was fired just because

630
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:54,918
he smoked

631
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:56,626
in front of Mr. Bo.

632
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,083
He has changed a mask?

633
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:19,542
Doomed!

634
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,542
Bo Hai must have a relapse again.

635
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:22,792
You mustn’t stand up!

636
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:24,918
Or you’ll alert the enemy

637
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,000
and confess it.

638
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:30,459
Awesome!

639
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:48,501
What’s wrong with you?

640
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:17,584
These are soft drinks

641
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,083
we prepared for men.

642
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:20,999
I like this. Give me a cup.

643
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:21,751
Okay.

644
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:23,375
Give him a cup of it.

645
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:25,083
Hello.

646
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:25,626
Hello.

647
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,459
This is

648
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:27,501
roselle fruit tea we prepared

649
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,792
especially for women.

650
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:29,876
It helps with maintaining beauty
and keeping young.

651
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,167
And this is

652
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,292
fructus momordicae tea we prepared

653
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:33,250
especially for men.

654
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,501
It helps to clear away heat.

655
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,000
Thank you.

656
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:39,375
Are you alright?

657
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,417
I’m going to get you

658
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:41,334
the eye drops.

659
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:42,250
Stay and wait for me.

660
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:45,751
Busy?

661
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:46,709
Not really.

662
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:47,167
Let me help you.

663
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:55,334
Mr. Bo.

664
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:57,209
You don’t feel well?

665
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,292
I’m fine.

666
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,918
Have some tea.

667
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:00,792
Thank you.

668
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,459
The red is roselle fruit tea,

669
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,459
for women.

670
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:05,501
The brown is fructus momordicae tea,

671
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,459
for men.

672
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:14,584
What are you doing?

673
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:15,250
Don’t go.

674
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,125
Choose one.

675
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:46,542
Thank you.

676
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,459
Bo Hai.

677
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,125
How do you feel?

678
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,000
Bo Hai.

679
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,626
It’s my fault.

680
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:28,501
I should have confirmed

681
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,542
what show there would be.

682
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,459
I thought there will only be singing and dancing.

683
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,626
I didn’t expect there to be a fire show.

684
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:35,999
Anyway, you survived.

685
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,501
I didn’t.

686
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:45,542
What do you mean?

687
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:46,792
No way.

688
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,167
When you picked the tea,

689
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:48,834
you managed to

690
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,542
pick the brown tea.

691
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:53,667
By accident.

692
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:54,918
Doomed!

693
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:56,501
The last thing we want to happen

694
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:57,709
still happened.

695
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,792
What should we do?

696
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:11,918
Shall we get a substitute?

697
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:13,584
We mustn’t!

698
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,334
In such an international competition,

699
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:16,709
they have to make bouquets on the spot.

700
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,042
Yeah.

701
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:21,125
And the flowers

702
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,584
are assigned by the organizing committee.

703
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,375
We have no way

704
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,918
to mark them.

705
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:30,501
What can we do?

706
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:36,999
What about the phone?

707
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,209
It can’t be used.

708
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,667
I’ve checked the site.

709
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:40,999
It’s strictly managed.

710
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,542
And there’s radio jammer.

711
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,334
We can’t cheat

712
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,125
through the phone or wireless earphones.

713
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,000
Who is it?

714
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,751
It’s me. Ling Lingqi.

715
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:01,667
Ling Lingqi.

716
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:08,667
Well…

717
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:09,959
We’re asked to go.

718
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,334
All competitors will gather in the flower shed.

719
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,459
The special part of the final

720
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,626
officially starts at 3 p.m.

721
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,626
Three?

722
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:16,459
We have one hour to go.

723
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,042
Take the stuff and go.

724
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:25,918
What’s going on?

725
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,459
Look at Bo Hai.

726
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:59,125
How can he continue the competition?

727
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:00,375
All I can do now

728
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,751
is to pray to Heaven that

729
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:03,167
he can survive it by luck.

730
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:13,375
When you watched the show,

731
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:15,000
why did you grab my hand?

732
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,167
You don’t dare to admit it?

733
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:23,459
I didn’t expect you to be

734
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:24,751
such a coward!

735
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:25,542
Don’t think

736
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:26,626
you can grab my hand,

737
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:26,999
just because

738
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:27,918
you give me a triple pay.

739
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,999
I’m not a casual girl.

740
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:30,792
What are you doing?

741
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,459
You take advantage of me

742
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:32,626
for granted?

743
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,751
Don’t move. Please!

744
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,375
Each year,
the International Floriculture Competition

745
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,626
has a new idea

746
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:47,667
on its form.

747
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,375
The special part for this year’s final

748
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,417
will be held in the flower shed.

749
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,334
Later, competitors from different countries

750
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:54,999
will pick flowers

751
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,334
based on the theme,

752
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:57,542
My Most Unforgettable Memory.

753
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:58,542
This part

754
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,042
isn’t part of the formal competition.

755
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,209
But it still tests

756
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,667
how competitors master

757
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,083
the growth of flowers

758
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,876
and the color match.

759
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,792
It’s kind of the warm-up

760
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,083
before the final.

761
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,334
Okay. I’ll say no more.

762
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,250
Let’s go to the flower shed

763
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,792
and have a look.

764
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:35,000
Boss.

765
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:37,459
If you still don’t pick flowers,

766
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:38,417
you’ll be late.

767
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,125
Do something!

768
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:48,667
If he picks flowers casually,

769
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,083
people will notice him.

770
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,167
When he does nothing,

771
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,334
people will notice, too!

772
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:52,999
Look!

773
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:15,375
Yellow, green and pink flowers are of

774
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,083
lively vitamin colors.

775
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:16,834
How can you match them

776
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:18,626
with the elegant purple?

777
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:20,584
Even green hands don’t make such a mistake.

778
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,042
I know.

779
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:29,083
Whatever.

780
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:29,918
Anyway, I’m not

781
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:30,999
the competitor.

782
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,626
Light colors match deep colors.

783
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,167
You made all possible mistakes.

784
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:44,709
Next.

785
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,125
Let’s visit the next competitor.

786
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,334
Pasqueflower, larkspur, love-in-a-mist

787
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,542
and carnation.

788
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:52,667
I think this competitor

789
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:53,542
is going to show us

790
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:55,417
the warmth of childhood.

791
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:57,209
All right.

792
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,250
Here we see Mr. Bo Hai

793
00:37:58,417 --> 00:37:59,501
has been ready.

794
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:00,292
Let’s move on and see

795
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:01,751
what the seeded player Bo Hai

796
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:03,709
has prepared for this part.

797
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,125
Mr. Bo Hai has picked

798
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,792
dahlia,

799
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,042
yellow dancing lady orchid

800
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,667
and scabiosa.

801
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,584
He also gets Alexandra tulip.

802
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,125
In terms of color match,

803
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,083
Mr. Bo Hai seems

804
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,292
to be audacious

805
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:19,751
and imaginative.

806
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,417
I can hardly imagine

807
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:22,209
what Mr. Bo Hai

808
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,167
is going to show us

809
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,501
at tomorrow’s final.

810
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,125
Let’s wait and see.

811
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:37,709
Bo Hai is flurried.

812
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,751
Seems like he was totally shocked

813
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:42,959
this noon.

814
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,918
You and Mr. Mo

815
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,501
did a great move.

816
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:48,959
Next

817
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:49,918
let’s see

818
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,375
how the great florist

819
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,626
will fall to the ground.

820
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,209
Gosh.

821
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,125
The color match Mr. Bo did

822
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,918
is too ugly to understand.

823
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:03,999
Let me have a look.

824
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:06,751
How could them

825
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,042
be picked by Mr. Bo?

826
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,083
Yeah. Mr. Bo is

827
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,083
the odds-on winner for the final.

828
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,501
Does he want to

829
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:16,417
find a new way out

830
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:17,751
with an unconventional method?

831
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:18,459
Such weird colors

832
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:19,542
are even going against

833
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:20,375
the basic creation rules.

834
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,417
What a new way can he find?

835
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,250
Anyway, I don’t understand.

836
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Does he have

837
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,292
too much stress

838
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:28,292
before the competition

839
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:29,959
just like Olympic champions?

840
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,999
So, he picked the flowers poorly?

841
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,167
I don’t know.

842
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,459
But I’m sure

843
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,918
about one thing.

844
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,459
The reputation of our company

845
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,417
is likely to be ruined.

846
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:50,959
What did you say?

847
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,334
Do you believe I’ll fire you immediately?

848
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,709
Could you focus on your own work

849
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:04,751
instead of gossiping behind others’ back?

850
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,000
Look at you!

851
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:21,375
You don’t have

852
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,334
much professionalism

853
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:23,876
and you like to play tricks.

854
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:24,334
But you shouldn’t have

855
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,834
behaved so poorly.

856
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,709
Think about the colors you just picked.

857
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,083
Nothing could compare that,

858
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,876
except the square dance.

859
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:32,584
Is your most unforgettable memory

860
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:33,667
the square dance

861
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:34,999
with some aunts?

862
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,501
What’s wrong with you?

863
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,751
Since this afternoon,

864
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:43,167
you’ve been acting weirdly.

865
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,125
Tell me if there’s anything wrong.

866
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,417
I’m your assistant, anyway.

867
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:47,000
Maybe,

868
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,250
I can help you.

869
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,459
Are you feeling unwell?

870
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:54,751
Mind your own business!

871
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,876
Okay, I will!

872
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:02,209
I won’t talk to you again!

= Parking Lot =

874
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:22,876
Are you nuts?

875
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:23,792
Even if you’re depressed,

876
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:24,501
you should have watched the traffic lights.

877
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,501
Trying to kill yourself?

878
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:27,751
What the hell!

879
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:41,876
Red.

880
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,042
Dull-red.

881
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:46,334
Pink.

882
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,334
This is rose red.

883
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:51,918
Pure pink.

884
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,083
Stop!

885
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,542
Bo Hai.

886
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,042
What do you think the chances are?

887
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,375
If I can recover my color vision

888
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,000
and make good use of the flowers,

889
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:11,125
I’ll lose the contest in a decent way, at least.
