= Episode 29 =

51
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,375
I prepared a long speech

52
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,250
to make you happy.

53
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,167
But look at you!

54
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:05,000
You’re lively so soon!

55
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,999
I shouldn’t have wasted my time.

56
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,542
Sure. Who am I?

57
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:11,334
By the way,

58
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,709
are you still going to chase Mo Nan?

59
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:14,626
After all this time,

60
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:15,999
I fall in love with a man.

61
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,292
If I fail to be with him,

62
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,876
how humiliating!

63
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:20,792
Where have you got to?

64
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,375
Tell me about it.

65
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:26,876
Today, in the company,

66
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:27,918
I officially announced that

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,250
I like Mo Nan.

68
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,083
I believe the strong public opinion

69
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,125
and mental suggestion

70
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,751
will directly influence

71
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,375
Mo Nan’s feelings,

72
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,334
so that he will gradually

73
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:39,876
fall in love with me.

74
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:42,959
Now you come to

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,167
a theoretical level!

76
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,375
You really impress me!

77
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:48,834
Sure.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,792
I know more tricks

79
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,459
than you can ever imagine.

80
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:52,999
Isn’t that true love?

81
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,125
Why do you still need tricks?

82
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,167
Doesn’t sound like true love.

83
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,292
Come on!

84
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:59,209
I am a pick-up artist!

85
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,042
It’s art, instead of trick.

86
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,667
Miss Lu Baoni,

87
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:06,834
dear pick-up artist!

88
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,999
Why don’t you teach me some tricks?

89
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,125
Look what Bo Hai has done.

90
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,542
He kicked me out of his company.

91
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,083
And he even unfriended me on WeChat.

92
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,250
Obviously, he isn’t

93
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,501
going to see me again.

94
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:18,292
You know what?

95
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,459
You always take indirect actions.

96
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:23,501
That brings little effect.

97
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:24,250
He doesn’t meet you.

98
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,959
Why don’t you go meet him?

99
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,709
Even if you have to trick him.

100
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:31,876
Got it!

101
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:34,876
Don’t worry.

102
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,459
I’ll try every possible way

103
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,626
to approach him.

104
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,209
Just watch.

105
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,709
Hello? Secretary Chen.

106
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:48,375
Well,

107
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:50,459
as my ally,

108
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:52,834
could you do me a favor?

109
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:05,918
What’s up?

110
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,167
Boss, Mr. Ma from Zhicheng asked to

111
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:09,542
meet you at Chin-Chin

112
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,000
Restaurant & Bar at eight tonight.

113
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:14,542
Didn’t he just call,

114
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:15,334
saying he’s going to the US tomorrow

115
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,334
and will meet me next week?

116
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,751
He just

117
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,999
called me again,

118
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,584
saying the flight is cancelled

119
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,584
because of the snowstorm in the US.

120
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,000
So, he wants to meet you today.

121
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,709
Okay. I see.

122
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,209
Shall I ask the driver to pick you up

123
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,626
at half past seven?

124
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,792
Okay.

125
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,083
With your confirmation, I’ll upload it.

126
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,626
Mo Nan can’t be an ordinary guy.

127
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,000
He’s the first man who stays around me

128
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,250
but totally ignores me.

129
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:58,667
And he’s the first man

130
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,250
I’ve fallen in love with.

131
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,918
He’s such an extraordinary man.

132
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:02,918
But I was using

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,918
simple and rude tricks.

134
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,501
No wonder I keep failing.

135
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,834
A pick-up artist usually takes

136
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:15,375
flexible actions.

137
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,292
According to circumstances,

138
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,042
I shall take corresponding actions.

139
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,042
Grace.

140
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,000
There’s a new employee

141
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,292
in our company.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,459
Could you help me

143
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,709
do a deep background check?

144
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:04,209
It hurts!

145
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:04,959
Come on.

146
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:05,626
Let me help.

147
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:06,501
Don’t!

148
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:06,959
Be careful!

149
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,417
What the hell!

150
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,375
No wonder Baoni is so hungry that

151
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,042
she has hypoglycemia.

152
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,125
What a tight dress!

153
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:15,999
All right.

154
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:17,999
Looks good!

155
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,042
Baoni has good taste!

156
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,626
Nice!

157
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,626
Except this,

158
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,999
I’ve got another trump card for you.

159
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,334
I can hardly breathe.

160
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:30,999
This is the love amulet

161
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:34,125
that beats everything.

162
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:35,876
What is this?

163
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,250
I bought it for you.

164
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:39,459
Come on. Put it on.

165
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:41,250
No. No. No, thanks.

166
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,709
Put it on.

167
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,209
Why don’t I just carry it?

168
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:46,250
Bo Hai is a love weirdo, isn’t he?

169
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,334
This amulet

170
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,709
works specially for weirdos

171
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:49,999
like him.

172
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,667
No matter he’s mad physically

173
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,209
or mentally,

174
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,542
you’ll finally get him

175
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,584
with this amulet.

176
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,959
You look good in this dress.

177
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,626
It’s a nice dress!

178
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,542
Gorgeous!

179
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:05,542
It’s too tight.

180
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:05,959
All right.

181
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:06,792
Pull your stomach in.

182
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:07,292
Pull it in.

183
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,334
I feel like exploding!

184
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,459
Boss, Mr. Zhao is waiting at the counter.

185
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

186
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,250
I have something else to do.

187
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,292
I’ll go handle it over there.

188
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:20,792
Okay. Go ahead.

189
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:21,292
Okay.

190
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:36,584
Why are you here?

191
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,000
Since you come,

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,125
why don’t you have a cup of drink?

193
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,125
Chen Mo!

194
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,709
I’m not interested in any drink.

195
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,459
Nor am I interested in you.

196
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,375
Wait a sec.

197
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:51,876
To get you here,

198
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,751
I racked my brains.

199
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,250
Don’t spoil it, will you?

200
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:54,959
You know what?

201
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,667
Let me go, or I’ll call the police.

202
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:57,375
No way.

203
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,334
I must be with you.

204
00:07:58,417 --> 00:07:59,042
Let go of me!

205
00:07:59,209 --> 00:07:59,834
No!

206
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:00,250
Let go of me!

207
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:00,751
No!

208
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:01,292
Let go of me!

209
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,375
- Let go! - No!

210
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:04,584
Wait. Bo Hai. Wait.

211
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,751
Missy, if he doesn’t want you,

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,209
I will!

213
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:08,709
Sorry.

214
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:09,167
Don’t ruin my date!

215
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:09,999
See you.

216
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,501
I come to

217
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,626
date with you!

218
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,584
Gosh!

219
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,709
What’s wrong with you?

220
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:15,459
Let go of me!

221
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:16,125
Don’t do that!

222
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,083
I’m not giving up!

223
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,000
My idol has just left.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,542
Don’t be like this!

225
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,042
Gosh! Oh, gosh!

226
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,918
Ma’am, I’m sorry!

227
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,375
Let go of me, will you?

228
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,083
Let go of me!

229
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:29,584
Qi!

230
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,334
Qi! Qi!

231
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,000
Why are you bleeding?

232
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:37,584
Qi!

233
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:44,209
Qi!

234
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:45,459
Are you feeling awful?

235
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:46,751
Do you feel dizzy?

236
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,751
Hold on, I...

237
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,292
Ling Lingqi, you’re going too far!

238
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,042
What do you mean?

239
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:04,959
What did I do?

240
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,209
You misunderstood that.

241
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,417
You know what?

242
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,667
Don’t let me see you ever again!

243
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:10,292
You don’t want to see me.

244
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:11,042
But you still care for me.

245
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:11,918
So many people were in the bar.

246
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,667
No one else misunderstood,

247
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,250
but you.

248
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,209
Just because you cared for me.

249
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,417
If you come back to beg for mercy,

250
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,501
I will forgive you!

251
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,209
Don’t regret!

252
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,167
He isn’t a bossy boss!

253
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,083
He’s hypocritical!

254
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,000
A total coward!

255
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:41,083
Chen Mo!

256
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:47,626
Boss.

257
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,083
Did you have a good time last night?

258
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,792
You dared to

259
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:50,501
trick me

260
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,709
with someone else, huh?

261
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:54,000
What do you mean trick?

262
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,000
I was considering

263
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,334
for your marriage.

264
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:57,417
Ling Lingqi

265
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:58,626
truly loves you.

266
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,584
Unlike you!

267
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:00,918
You always refuse her,

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,417
with a poker face.

269
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,042
Even I feel cold.

270
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,125
No more explanation.

271
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:09,876
Don’t resist her.

272
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,042
Ling Lingqi is a good girl.

273
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,501
She has a high degree, majoring in medicine.

274
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,751
Veterinary medicine.

275
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,167
So what?

276
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,083
It’s still medicine!

277
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,626
You’re sick and she knows medicine.

278
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,083
You make a perfect match!

279
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,209
Do you have any other trick,

280
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,667
except deducting my bonus?

281
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:29,667
I’m telling you!

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,167
In front of justice and love,

283
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,209
I’m not going to yield

284
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,959
for such a trifling profit!

285
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,959
You know what?

286
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,792
Just the bonus, I...

287
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,709
Boss!

288
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:42,417
Baoni.

289
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,459
Baoni, your package.

290
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:45,459
Thank you.

291
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,209
Baoni, according to

292
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,125
the name and other information

293
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,209
you gave me,

294
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:06,876
I’ve got nothing

295
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,751
about his degree

296
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,959
or working condition in China.

297
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,999
But I found something

298
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,459
on some foreign websites,

299
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:13,626
for your reference.

300
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,083

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,940
= Basic Information of Employee =

303
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,584
Senior Investment Director?

304
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,751
How could this be Mo Nan?

305
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:30,626
Impossible!

306
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:32,292
Baoni, give me the attendance

307
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,042
for last month.

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,417
Baoni!

309
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,083
Attendance.

310
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,501
Director Zhou, what a coincidence!

311
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,334
So crowded.

312
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:50,959
Secretary... Secretary Chen.

313
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,626
I’m not a gay.

314

= Marketing Director =

315
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,999
Xinyan, file the promotion expenses

in the last three years,

317
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:08,542
for the stockholders’ meeting later.

318
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:09,042
Okay.

319
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:09,751
I’ll print the file out

320
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:10,292
and send it to you.

321
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:10,876
Okay.

322
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:24,667
From Chen Mo?

323
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,709
Bouquet for love?

324
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:30,459
I don’t know

325
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:31,751
what’s wrong with Chen Mo lately.

326
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,167
He doesn’t want to give up.

327
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:34,542
He insists on chasing me.

328
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,918
I don’t know what to do.

329
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:43,292
Don’t take it away.

330
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,501
The cleaner will come.

331
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:47,834
He attacks you with a bouquet.

332
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,292
You should use the same thing against him.

333
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,542
Oh, I mean them.

334
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,751
Hopeless love?

335
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:55,999
Ling Lingqi, look!

336
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,501
This is the heartless bouquet

337
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:58,417
from Xinyan.

338
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,709
She and Bo Hai

339
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:00,959
are challenging us!

340
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,709
Are you going to give in?

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,999
I’ve prepared you

342
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:06,918
the weapon to fight back with.

343
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,042
We’re not going to lose this time!

344
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,542
Love of Nirvana?

345
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:33,834
Coward!

346
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,959
Do you dare to bet with me?

347
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,667
Let’s see whether Chen Mo

348
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:38,626
can get Zhou Xinyan or not.

349
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,501
If they’re in a relationship,

350
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,375
why don’t you give up

351
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,000
and give us a chance too?

352
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,292
Boring.

353
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:56,918
I’m back to work then.

354
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,709
How is that possible?

355
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,459
How could that be Mo Nan’s background?

356
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,417
Could it be a man of the same name?

357
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,542
I’ll talk to you later.

358
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,709
Hello? Grace.

359
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:52,999
Didn’t you say

360
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,083
you could find something about Mo Nan

361
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,250
before 2015?

362
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,501
Could you try and figure out

363
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,000
what he’s been up to

364
00:16:59,167 --> 00:16:59,999
in the past two years?

365
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:20,083
William?

366
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:41,375
You look thinner.

367
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,334
I’ve been tired.

368
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:45,334
And I don’t sleep well.

369
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:46,876
Be seated.

370
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,167
A balcony is hot in summer and cold in winter,

371
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,459
with leakage of water and electricity.

372
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,167
How could you sleep well?

373
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,626
But compared to leather sofa,

374
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,000
silk pillow

375
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,417
and the office

376
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,042
at Canary Wharf,

377
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,000
I prefer the life

378
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,083
I’m living now.

379
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:08,918
You know what?

380
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,709
I live a more wonderful life than the film.

381
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:13,083
That’s exactly

382
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,501
your professional charm.

383
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,125
I heard

384
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,083
you want to quit this mission?

385
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,626
That’s why you come,

386
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:26,792
isn’t it?

387
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,000
As your boss,

388
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:32,334
I don’t want you to fail

389
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,834
on the verge of success.

390
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,375
Anyway, in DREAM,

391
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:38,626
you know most

392
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,959
about FlowerPlus project.

393
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,584
But as your friend,

394
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,042
I hope you can quit.

395
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,167
In the past few years,

396
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,250
you’ve been working so hard.

397
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,626
You should take a rest,

398
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:53,375
forgetting the work

399
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,167
and enjoying your life.

400
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,542
Then who wins,

401
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,751
the boss or the friend?

402
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:01,751
My rule is that

403
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,292
you work to get a better life.

404
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:08,250
Cheers.

405
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,000
Thank you, William.

406
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,125
To our lives.

407
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:20,334
In fact, I come

408
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:21,999
to tell you

409
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,083
something else.

410
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,250
You asked me

411
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,542
to check on your father.

412
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,584
I’ve got a clue.

413
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:30,792
This man is

414
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,417
your father’s old colleague.

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,083
This is his address.

416
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,334
I think

417
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,999
you should ask him personally

418
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:43,709
about what you want to know.

419
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,620
= Yunhe Flower Shop Is The City’s
Biggest Floriculture Company =

420
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,100
= A Big Fire in Yunhe Flower Shop =

421
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,501
The last reunion dinner in my memory

422
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:50,999
was twenty years ago.

423
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:54,751
Ove the past years,

424
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,000
the harder I try to remember

425
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,542
everything about my dad,

426
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:01,709
the dimmer

427
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,167
his face gets in my mind.

428
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:11,918
Dad, if there was something

429
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,042
behind the accident,

430
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,000
and if there was someone behind it,

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,584
I’ll never let him go.

432
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,417
Zhenqi, where’s Mo Nan?

433
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,584
Mo Nan asked for a leave,

434
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,542
saying he’s going to visit

435
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,417
a sick family member.

436
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,167
He didn’t tell me.

437
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,167
Morning, Director Luo.

438
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:03,959
Morning.

439
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:04,999
Director Luo.

440
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:10,542
What would you like? Let me help you.

441
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,459
Black tea, green tea or coffee?

442
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:14,667
Coffee, please.

443
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:16,542
With milk and without sugar.

444
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:17,334
Okay.

445
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,375
Director Luo.

446
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:30,167
Think about it.

447
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,459
Why does some guy

448
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,667
who has a super working experience,

449
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:35,292
I mean,

450
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,834
working on Wall Street,

451
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,125
prefer to rack his brains

452
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,584
to hide his experience

453
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:42,417
and work as

454
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:44,501
a minor employee?

455
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:45,626
It’s a simple question.

456
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,959
He’s a mad man.

457
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,626
Or he’s a commercial spy

458
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:51,042
sent by a rival company

459
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:52,000
for undercover work.

460
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,459
Are you alright?

461
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:58,792
Yes. Yes.

462
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:04,918
Baoni.

463
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,459
Did you mean

464
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,459
someone in our company?

465
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,626
Who is he?

466
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,834
I’ve been reading

467
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,083
a workplace novel.

468
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,918
I mean the hero of the novel.

469
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:23,209
So, he’s a spy.

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,834
Thank you for the help.

471
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:32,083
Your coffee.

472
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:32,626
Okay.

473
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you.

474
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:45,000
Afternoon tea made by Ling Lingqi.

475
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:46,709
Milk tea with soy sauce.

476
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,667
Spicy mango cake.

477
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,250
They may

478
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:51,375
look weird.

479
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,792
But they taste great!

480
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,751
I couldn’t help

481
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:54,876
trying some for you.

482
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,375
Traitor!

483
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,042
I don’t care if I have to

484
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,334
be a traitor for love.

485
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:02,501
Because when you

486
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,918
have a happy ending,

487
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,876
you will hug me

488
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,417
and snivel to me

489
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,542
with gratitude.

490
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,250
You know nothing about love.

491
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:11,334
Every day,

492
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:12,584
you only care about business

493
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:13,709
and report forms.

494
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:14,542
Could you

495
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,459
let go of your work

496
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:16,167
and experience

497
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,542
some sweet life?

498
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,125
If one day,

499
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,042
I manage to teach you

500
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:21,125
how to enjoy your life,

501
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:23,000
I’ll be kind of a success.

502
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:28,667
There’s ten minutes before the meeting.

503
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:30,334
I’m going to punch you

504
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:31,542
within the ten minutes.

505
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:33,751
Come on.

506
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:35,250
Come on!

507
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,209
Brilliant, huh?

508
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,167
Use the whip?

509
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,751
I’ll ask someone for help!

510
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:47,375
Come over! Come!

511
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:48,667
Don’t try to dodge.

512
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:49,792
I’m not dodging. I’m right here.

513
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:50,501
Come over. Come.

514
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:51,250
You come. Come.

515
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,042
Come on.

516
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:54,667
Come. I...

517
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,250
So nervous.

518
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:57,459
The blood is running out.

519
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,083
Sorry, Boss.

520
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,334
No more game?

521
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:11,042
Boring.

522
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:13,042
Well, I’m going to

523
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:13,876
chase my girl.

524
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:14,709
Wish me good luck.

525
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,667
And wish you bad luck.

526
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,751
Secretary Chen.

527
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:38,959
Hello, Secretary Chen.

528
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:06,417
Let’s go.

529
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:39,542
Xinyan, as a friend,

530
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:40,792
I have something to ask you.

531
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,999
Will you accept Chen Mo?

532
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:44,751
As a friend,

533
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,042
thank you for the care.

534
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,250
But let me make myself clear.

535
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,709
Chen Mo and I will only be friends.

536
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:55,167
I can tell that

537
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,125
you also care for him.

538
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:57,834
Why don’t you

539
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,125
give him a chance?

540
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,876
Do you care for me then?

541
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,584
Sure, as a friend.

542
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:09,999
Will you give me a chance?

543
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:15,083
That’s different.

544
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,209
Here is the thing.

545
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:17,918
Sometimes,

546
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,292
love isn’t a long trip,

547
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:20,584
but a complicated one.

548
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,584
You’re in such a hurry.

549
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:22,751
When you stop and look around,

550
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:23,876
you’ll find

551
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,999
the most beautiful view around you.

552
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:28,709
Have you found

553
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:30,000
your own love?

554
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,042
Why do you always ask me?

555
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:35,876
You’re never in a relationship,

556
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,209
but you’re seriously teaching me

557
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,292
how to get in love.

558
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,542
That feels awkward.

559
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:42,042
Seriously, I can’t accept

560
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,292
your inspiration.

561
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:49,584
All right.

562
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:51,417
Stop trying to persuade me.

563
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,292
Why don’t you focus on your work?

564
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,417
Okay. I give up.

565
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,417
Let’s get back

566
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,626
and talk about work.

567
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:03,626
The other day,

568
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:05,083
my husband and I were so boring that

569
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,125
we went to the matchmaking corner

570
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:06,876
in the park.

571
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,125
I mean, I want to

572
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,542
get a girlfriend

573
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:10,751
for my son Jianqi.

574
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,375
Guess what?

575
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,792
After I told them

576
00:30:14,918 --> 00:30:16,709
my son’s advantages.

577
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:17,918
Oh, dear.

578
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,042
Those girls filled me

579
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:19,999
with their

580
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,209
files and photos.

581
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:22,959
Within minutes,

582
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,792
I received a lot!

583
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,083
I must go back home

584
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,501
and review them.

585
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,083
Your son is such a good man.

586
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,584
Why does he need a blind date?

587
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,167
Girls who adore him

588
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,334
will be lining up

589
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,000
across the street.

590
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:38,584
Why do you need to worry?

591
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:39,501
Yeah.

592
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,292
How can I not worry?

593
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,125
Months ago,

594
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,292
he had a girlfriend.

595
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,292
You knew it, didn’t you?

596
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:47,250
She was beautiful.

597
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:48,584
As gorgeous as a film star.

598
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:49,459
The point is...

599
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,167
The point is her family.

600
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:51,999
Yeah.

601
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,834
She has a rich family!

602
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:55,042
My son told me

603
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:56,999
he dumped that girl after only two months

604
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:58,167
in a relationship.

605
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,792
Oh, by the way,

606
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,334
he told me

607
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,918
he fell in love with a new girl.

608
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,250
That girl

609
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,167
feels kind of an artist.

610
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,501
I don’t understand young guys.

611
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:11,542
- Son. - Mom.

612
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:12,209
Come on.

613
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:12,918
Come here.

614
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,209
Tell these aunts

615
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:14,918
about the girl

616
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:15,918
you fall in love with,

617
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,334
the girl who feels like an artist.

618
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:18,626
Tell us about it.

619
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,751
Hello, Aunt Song.

620
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,667
Aunt, where is Qi?

621
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,501
Qi? She isn’t back from work yet.

622
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,334
Aunt.

623
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,083
Could you give me

624
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,292
her phone number?

625
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,626
You want her number?

626
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:40,292
But why?

627
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,334
So that I can date her.

628
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,834
You want to date her?

629
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,042
Your mom said you fell in love with a girl

630
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,292
who feels like an artist.

631
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:02,417
So that is my daughter?

632
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:02,999
Yes. Yes.

633
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:05,959
Aunt, just give me her number.

634
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,459
Wait.

635
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:08,959
You want to date Qi?

636
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:09,417
Yeah.

637
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,042
I don’t know

638
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,125
if she wants to date you.

639
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,000
Aunt, why don’t you just

640
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,250
give me her number?

641
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,501
Do you hear him?

642
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,209
I was wondering

643
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,751
who Li Lijun’s son fell in love with.

644
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,209
It turned out to be my daughter.

645
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:36,792
Qi.

646
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,501
You really make your mom proud.

647
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,083
It means

648
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,167
the love amulet works!

649
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,334
When Qi wears it,

650
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,167
she has good luck in love.

651
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:49,959
What good luck?

652
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,584
Such a bad luck.

653
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:54,167
But it’s still luck.

654
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:55,918
Don’t be anxious.

655
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,375
You must be patient.

656
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,876
No one can stop good luck if it really comes.

657
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:00,959
I’d rather

658
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,292
exchange all my good luck in love

659
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,792
for Bo Hai who I really like.

660
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:05,792
But you only have bad luck.

661
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:06,667
I don’t think you can exchange it.

662
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,250
Give it to me.

663
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,000
Why can’t you just

664
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:11,918
say something

665
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,125
to encourage our daughter?

666
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,083
Good evening, Mr. Bo Hai.

667
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,209
Good evening,

668
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,250
everybody.

669
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,792
Today is June 3, 2018.

670
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,292
You’re watching the evening news

671
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:51,417
with Bo Hai TV.

672
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:52,667
Let’s go on with

673
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:53,459
the news headlines.

674
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,000
Am I bewitched?

675
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,751
Who is bewitched?

676
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,999
I... I’m bewitched?

677
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:49,584
The TV.

678
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,834
What’s going on?

679
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,542
You have time for a soap opera,

680
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,125
but no time for a relationship?

681
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,584
Qi.

682
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,334
Feng Jianqi, what brings you here?

683
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:44,667
What have you been up to?

684
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,209
I haven’t seen you for days.

685
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,584
I’m working. I can’t talk.

686
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,375
Can’t talk?

687
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:53,959
I don’t come to talk.

688
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,125
I come to buy a bouquet.

689
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:57,334
Bouquet?

690
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:02,542
I want a bouquet of sweet love.

691
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,501
That way.

692
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:14,542
Your bouquet. Hope you’ll get the girl you like.

693
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:22,334
Qi, could you be my girlfriend?

694
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,334
I’ve been into you for a long time.

695
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:30,876
Qi.

696
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:03,209
Yeah.

697
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,417
This is the right way

698
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,292
to tell a girl you like her.

699
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:31,250
You get the wrong person.

700
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:34,626
Let go of me.

701
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:35,751
I’m warning you!

702
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:37,292
Don’t try to get Ling Lingqi!

703
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:38,751
Who are you?

704
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:39,834
Does that ever

705
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,042
bother you?

706
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,542
I’m the security director

707
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:48,542
of her company.

708
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:51,918
Security director?

709
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,667
You can’t interfere my relationship, can you?

710
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:54,584
Go away!

711
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,250
I’m doing this for your own good.

712
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:58,959
You know what?

713
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:02,000
Ling Lingqi is sick.

714
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,584
Sick? What do you mean?

715
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:06,250
She has

716
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,542
manic depression in love.

717
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,792
Once she’s in a relationship,

718
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:11,792
she will be possessive

719
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,000
on her boyfriend.

720
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,209
She will stalk you, harass you

721
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,375
and sometimes she will

722
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:17,751
even attack you.

723
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:19,334
Some colleague in our company

724
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:21,375
has suffered from her.

725
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:22,209
Because of her,

726
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,417
he has a mental problem.

727
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,417
Seriously? But...

728
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,709
I’m going to take her to a film.

729
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,999
My boss sends me

730
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,626
to check on Ling Lingqi regularly.

731
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,334
Luckily, I came in time.

732
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:37,792
But you just told her

733
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,042
you liked her,

734
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:40,751
and it drew

735
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,542
her attention.

736
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,292
Dude, listen to me.

737
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,501
Leave right away.

738
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,584
Don’t let her see you again.

739
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,209
Or...

740
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:48,375
All right. Thanks.

741
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:50,334
It’s so kind of you. I’m leaving right away.

742
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:51,250
See you.

743
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:53,999
You’re welcome.

744
00:38:58,709 --> 00:38:59,542
Security director?

745
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,250
I like it

746
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:04,334
when you talk nonsense seriously.

747
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:09,501
Why did you ask him to leave?

748
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:09,999
Maybe,

749
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,042
I’m into him.

750
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:14,709
I’ll get him back.

751
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:15,959
Wait a sec.

752
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:22,167
Do you think

753
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,334
timidity is your only drawback?

754
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:24,792
It’s just

755
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:25,709
one tiny point

756
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:27,125
among your massive drawbacks.

757
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:29,834
Look at you.

758
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,584
You’re unreasonable and boring

759
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:32,918
with no romantic feelings.

760
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:33,417
And you are

761
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,334
so fragile.

762
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:44,667
But I like you.

763
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,042
I like the way you are.

764
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,584
Since you like me, too,

765
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:54,709
why can’t you

766
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:55,459
give me a chance?

767
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,042
I’m talking to you!

768
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:05,751
Why do you pretend you don’t hear me?

769
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:11,834
I gotta go.

770
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:14,999
Run!

771
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,250
Run away.

772
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,417
But wherever you run to,

773
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:18,584
I’ll get you back!

774
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:30,876
What?

775
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,626
Pretend to be Chen Mo’s new girlfriend?

776
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,042
I just want you

777
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,709
to arouse Zhou Xinyan.

778
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:38,999
Besides,

779
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,584
we just want to goad her.

780
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,417
Look how poor Chen Mo is!

781
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:45,167
Aren’t I poor, too?

782
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,000
Pretend to be his girlfriend?

783
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:48,417
Why do you have

784
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:49,709
such a bad idea?

785
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:50,709
I...

786
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,167
I didn’t come up with this,

787
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,375
until Bo Hai turned up

788
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,042
and enlightened me.

789
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,209
If he wasn’t jealous,

790
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,999
he wouldn’t have

791
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:58,292
come today.

792
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:04,042
However,

793
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:06,709
a pick-up artist

794
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,876
also plays cat and mouse.

795
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,000
Theoretical basis is required.

796
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:14,626
But everyone in the company knows

797
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,292
I like Mo Nan.

798
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:17,876
I can’t do that casually.

799
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:18,334
What if...

800
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,667
What if Mo Nan knows...

801
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,751
No, I can’t do that.

802
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:21,334
But...

803
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,417
Mo Nan is back to his hometown.

804
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:24,792
How will he know?

805
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:25,709
Besides,

806
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:27,125
he’s a rational man

807
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,834
and he’s always helpful.

808
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:29,959
If he knows

809
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,125
it concerns the happiness of four guys,

810
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,459
he will certainly help.

811
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:41,834
Baoni.

812
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:48,667
Give you an inch,

813
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:50,959
