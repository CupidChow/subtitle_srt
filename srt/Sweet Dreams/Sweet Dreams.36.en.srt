51
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,334
It’s hard to

52
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,501
believe that

53
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,584
the spy in our company

54
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:55,792
placed by DREAM

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,626
is Mo Nan.

56
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:00,417
Bo Hai,

57
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,083
why are you so calm?

58
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,999
Did you already know

59
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:05,959
Mo Nan’s identity?

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,667
I had doubts about him

61
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,125
some time ago.

62
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,459
But there was no conclusive evidence

63
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,751
at that time.

64
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,584
It was not confirmed until today.

65
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,167
Well, Xinyan.

66
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,375
I want you to go through the

67
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,167
company files that Mo Nan’s been in contact with.

68
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,125
Find out how much he knows

69
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,626
about company secrets.

70
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,083
Also, tell Director Luo to

71
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,501
call Wang back.

72
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:28,542
Sure.

73
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,834
Oh, no.

74
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,083
Ling Lingqi has always regarded Mo Nan

75
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,792
as her true best friend

76
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,792
and poured her heart out to him.

77
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:42,459
If she knows

78
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,000
that Mo Nan is the spy,

79
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:47,375
it would kill her.

80
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:49,709
Bo Hai,

81
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,584
You’ve been keeping secrets from Ling Lingqi

82
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,042
about our plan to catch the spy.

83
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,000
I’m afraid you can’t hold it any longer.

84
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:01,167
Are you alright?

85
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,792
I’m sorry. My cover’s blown.

86
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:05,876
Have a seat.

87
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,501
It’s not your fault.

88
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,584
Bo Hai is too crafty.

89
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:15,792
The other day you came to tell me

90
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,709
that Lu Yunqing’s appearance at
91

91
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,083
is too coincidental.

92
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,959
And then I went to investigate.

93
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:21,834
Sure enough,

94
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:24,375
he rented a room

95
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:25,918
in the sanatorium

96
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,542
in the name of Lu Yunqing.

97
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,250
It’s a pity that

98
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,209
I found out too late.

99
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:42,876
Oh, good.

100
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,876
I’m getting impatient, too.

101
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,584
From now on,

102
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,626
I can fight Bo Hai

103
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,167
fair and square.

104
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,918
How about Ling Lingqi?

105
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,125
If this is gonna get ugly,

106
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,417
you might as well tell her yourself.

107
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:07,417
It’s better than

108
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,042
her getting it from Bo Hai.

109
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,959
Guess who I am.

110
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,292
Xinyan, stop it.

111
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,918
Who are you calling by?

112
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:33,792
I beg your pardon?

113
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,375
Wait. See?

114
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:36,626
I love it

115
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,667
when you get all

116
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,876
mad and jealous.

117
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,626
Who is jealous?

118
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:41,000
Don’t flatter yourself.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,999
Yeah, yeah, I’m just flattering myself.

120
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,042
Look.

121
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,250
What is this?

122
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,501
The new season product?

123
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:53,459
It’s beautiful.

124
00:05:58,876 --> 00:05:59,584
Qi.

125
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,167
There’s something I want to tell you.

Right.

127

Well…

128
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:06,709
My mom made you chicken soup.

129

I’ll go get it for you.

132

Keep drawing.

133
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:11,501

Chen Mo.

137

139
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:37,334
I’m on my way

141

I need you to bring someone to meet me.

142
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,542
Remember, keep it secret.

143
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,000
Some… Some… Some…

144
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,083
Some what?

145
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:47,999
Straighten your tongue before you speak.

146
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,167
Something’s wrong.

147

Mo Nan took Ling Lingqi away.

148
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:52,751
What the hell?

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,250
What’s this Mo Nan up to?

150
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,584
Does he want all die together?

151
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:56,876
What did you say?

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,876
What happened to Qi?

153
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,292
I can’t explain it now.

154

Now, Bo Hai

155
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,792
is on his way to the dock.

156
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:01,834
Let’s go and help him.

157
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,792
Then hurry.

158
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,334

Qi.

166
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:52,876
Think about it.

167
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,667
You already knew the answer.

168
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,375
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

Fang Cheng was just a scapegoat.

00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:22,709
Qi.

177
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,751
This is a new proposal
from the Marketing Department

178
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:29,999
that needs to be signed by Mr. Bo.

179
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,292
Ring a bell?

180
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,792
How is that even possible?

181
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,584
How can you be the spy?

182
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:41,334
Mo Nan,

183
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,459
you must be kidding me.

184
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:42,792
Come on.

185
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,292
Let’s go find the spy, okay?

186
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:45,999
I’m sorry, Qi.

187
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,417
How is that even possible?

188
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,250
Didn’t you help Bo Hai

189
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,959
expose Wen Guangqi?

190
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,000
If you’re the spy,

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,709
why did you do that?

192
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:53,501
This is all

193
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:01,792
because

194
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,292
Wen Guangqi’s methods were so low.

195
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:06,959
He caused me a lot of trouble

196
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,834
by getting in my way.

197
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:13,375
So I didn’t do it to help Bo Hai.

198
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,042
It’s about getting rid of this weak teammate.

199
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:19,876
Qi.

200
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:22,000
When I first took

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,167
this assignment,

202
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,375
I didn’t expect

203
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,417
to meet you.

204
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,000
I never thought I’d fall in love with you.

205
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:30,501
Now that

206
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:32,000
my cover’s been blown,

207
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,501
I’m not going back to FlowerPlus.

208
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:37,209
Why don’t you come back with me?

209
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:38,918
You can talk to them,

210
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,250
and I’ll help you.

211
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,209
Then Bo Hai and everyone

212
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,501
will forgive you.

213
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,417
I don’t need anyone’s forgiveness.

214
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,375
If there is to be a reckoning,

215
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:49,125
it is Bo Hai who has wronged me.

216
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:53,876
I brought you here today

217
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,000
not only to tell you

218
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,209
who I am,

219
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:58,918
but to show you

220
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,209
who he really is.

221
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,542
Bo Hai.

222
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:44,542
Qi?

223
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:00,999
Mo Nan is

224
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,751
the son of Yin Changhe.

225
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,876
Anybody?

226
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:47,292
Bo Hai!

227
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,250
Bo Hai!

228
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,999
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

229
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:54,959
It’s OK.

230
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,250
It’s OK. This is not real.

231
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,167
Don’t worry. I got you.

232
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,626
Let’s go. Get up.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,542
Easy.

234
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,626
Bo Hai, are you alright?

235
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,125
How does it feel

236
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,209
to choke to death

237
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,542
in a fire?

238
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:21,250
Are you OK?

239
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:22,876
Mo Nan, I had no idea

240
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,375
you were a man

241
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:25,125
who would do anything

242
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,292
to hurt an innocent man for wealth.

243
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,626
He’s innocent?

244
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:31,959
Qi,

245
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,000
are you saying the son of Lu Yunqing is innocent?

246
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,542
What’s done is done.

247
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,584
I might as well tell you the truth.

248
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,000
I went after him

249
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,542
not just for DREAM,

250
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,250
but for myself,

251
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,501
for my father.

252
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:55,792
My father

253
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:58,417
was a good friend of his mother’s.

254
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,292
He was also a founder of

255
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,292
the Yunhe Flower Shop.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,792
My real name is Yin Monan.

257
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,792
20 years ago,

258
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,375
his mother made bad loans

259
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,459
and shoddy work,

260
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,918
which brought the company into disrepute.

261
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,959
Not long after the story broke,

262
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,542
the company mysteriously went up in flames.

263
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,334
In the fire,

264
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,000
only his mother

265
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,000
and my father were there.

266
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,834
My father died for no reason,

267
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:33,626
and his mother

268
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,167
disappeared without a trace.

269
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:35,876
There’s no such thing

270
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,334
as a coincidence!

271
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,834
Lu Yunqing

272
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,083
must be responsible

273
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,584
for my father’s death.

274
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,918
But that was a generation ago.

275
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:48,792
What does this have to do

276
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:49,834
with you and Bo Hai?

277
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:50,667
Why would you do something

278
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,709
that hurts everyone, including yourself?

279
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,167
The son shall pay for his mother’s debt.

280
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,083
I want Lu Yunqing’s son to know

281
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,999
what it’s like to lose everything.

282
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:07,334
You are crazy.

283
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:10,209
He’s out of his mind.

284
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:11,667
It’s no use talking about it.

285
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:14,918
Mo Nan.

286
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,751
Your cover’s been blown.

287
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,834
I don’t think the back-stabbing thing

288
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,417
is gonna work again.

289
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:32,584
Fine.

290
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,292
I’m tired of hiding behind the scenes anyway.

291
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,501
Let’s fight real

292
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,000
to the death.

293
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:42,959
However,

294
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:45,792
in the future,

295
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,667
try not to lose too quickly.

296
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,751
Otherwise, I won’t enjoy myself.

297
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:03,792
Are you OK?

298
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,834
Where is Bo Hai and Ling Lingqi?

299
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,292
If you hurt them,

300
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,250
I won’t spare you.

301
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,959
If you get there now,

302
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,959
you’ll see each other one last time.

303
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:26,250
Mo Nan.

304
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,751
Bo Hai!

305
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,667
You can’t die! Bo Hai!

306
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,501
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

307
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,167
You’re not dead.

308
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,792
I won’t die before you do.

309
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,292
Mo Nan just lied to me again.

310
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:10,667
Scared the wits out of me.

311
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,584
It’s all my fault.

312
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:41,834
Actually, I already knew

313
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,292
his identity.

314
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,751
If I had told you sooner,

315
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,000
Mo Nan wouldn’t be

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,501
going so far

317
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:51,501
with no way back.

318
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:55,999
It’s not your fault.

319
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,042
If you like someone,

320
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,417
you want to protect him

321
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,542
with all your heart.

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,792
How can that be wrong?

323
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,167
It’s not you. It’s Mo Nan.

324
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:10,459
But I…

325
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:11,417
I really didn’t expect

326
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,876
he’d turn out like this.

327
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,876
What’s the big deal?

328
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,667
You lost a man.

329
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,250
Look around you.

330
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,250
I am such a good friend

331
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,209
and you don’t cherish me.

332
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,375
Qi.

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,375
You don’t blame me

334
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,125
for what I did to you, do you?

335
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,876
How could I be mad at you?

336
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,334
I’m not that cheap.

337
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,209
Well,

338
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:42,584
I’ll give the crawfish

339
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,876
all to you.

340
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:45,584
Really?

341
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,375
Yes.

342
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:50,709
You are so nice to me.

343
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,250
When we take selfies together,

344
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,209
can you make my face

345
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,709
as small as yours?

346
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,167
No. Don’t go too far.

347
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:00,542
You said yes.

348
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,334
No, no.

349
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:03,792
All right.

350
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:04,584
I’m just messing with you.

351
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:05,000
No.

352
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,417
Mr. Mo.

353
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,834
We’re almost done packing.

354
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,459
Anything else in particular you’d like to take?

355
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:36,999
No.

356
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:38,709
Everything here

357
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,042
was never meant for me.

358
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:42,501
Let’s go.

359
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:14,959
Mr. Mo.

360
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,334
Ji Bin.

361
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:23,876
Take this for me.

362
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:31,167
Ji Bin.

363
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,375
You go ahead. I’ll meet you in the car.

364
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:07,751
Qi.

365
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,501
I know you don’t want to see me.

366
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:22,626
I lied to you. I’m sorry.

367
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:23,999
But I really have

368
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:25,209
my reasons, so

369
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:26,999
please understand me, okay?

370
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:32,125
I can’t.

371
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,667
My best friend was wearing

372
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,250
the world’s ugliest mask.

373
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:36,792
How am I supposed to understand?

374
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:37,999
Have you ever wondered

375
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,542
who did this to me?

376
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,292
I don’t want to hear your excuses.

377
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,042
The worst thing is not to be heartless,

378
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,167
but to take advantage of the feelings of others.

379
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,751
I had no idea you were like this.

380
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,334
You’re gonna find out

381
00:23:58,167 --> 00:23:59,209
who I really am.

382
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:01,876
But I warn you,

383
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:03,375
get away from Bo Hai.

384
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,501
He’s really dangerous.

385
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,542
Stop this nonsense.

386
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:05,834
I…

387
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:06,334
Things have gone

388
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:07,000
like this.

389
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,542
Don’t you know

390
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:08,876
who is the most dangerous man?

391
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,042
The worst thing

392
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,959
in the world isn’t the devil.

393
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,751
It was the man who made me

394
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:16,417
a devil.

395
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,959
I don’t want to hear this.

396
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,417
Just leave.

397
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,167
I’ll pretend

398
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,000
I ’never know you.

399
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,792
What are you doing?

400
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,792
Qi, I won’t stop.

401
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,501
Compared to what happened to my family,

402
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,083
the price Bo Hai paid

403
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,584
was nothing.

404
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:38,042
Qi,

405
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:40,125
take care of yourself.

406
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:25,292
Move out?

407
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,501
Why did you make such a decision?

408
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:29,918
Right, Mo Nan.

409
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:30,792
If you

410
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:32,542
have any problem

411
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:33,667
or you’re short of money,

412
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:34,459
you can still

413
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:36,417
keep on living here.

414
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:37,709
You can pay the rent

415
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:39,000
when you have money.

416
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,292
Mo Nan. Here is the thing.

417
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,542
We don’t

418
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,209
want to rent our house

419
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,417
to other people.

420
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,501
We don’t trust them.

421
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:46,918
Right, right, right.

422
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,000
Rent it to you is the best.

423
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,042
You know what?

424
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:51,375
You don’t have to eat out

425
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,709
on your own anymore.

426
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:53,751
We can have dinner

427
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:54,959
at our house, OK?

428
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,334
Right, right, right.

429
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,918
It’s just a matter of extra chopsticks.

430
00:25:57,918 --> 00:25:58,626
Uncle. Aunt.

431
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,167
I’ve found a place.

432
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,167
Where? A big house?

433
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,167
Son,

434
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:09,167
It’s expensive

435
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,501
out there now.

436
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,999
How expensive it is to rent a house!

437
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,167
You are single.

438
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,292
Why would you live there?

439
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,959
Isn’t the balcony a good place to live?

440
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,792
There’s no password on this card,

441
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:23,417
and the money in it

442
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,292
is a forfeit for my early return.

443
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,334
The rest of the money

444
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:29,918
is for your

445
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,292
taking care of me.

446
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,292
A little gift.

447
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,542
Uncle.

448
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,459
No, no, no.

449
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:36,959
Don’t. No.

450
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:38,584
Aunt.

451
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,459
Look at you.

452
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,375
You are very thoughtful.

453
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:54,667
Thank you.

454
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,709
Take care.

455
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,375
I heard you are moving.

456
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:44,501
So I thought I’d stop by

457
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:45,999
and see if I could help.

458
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:05,209
Mr. Mo. The car is ready.

459
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,334
Guess I’m just thinking too much.

460
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:20,959
A man like you now

461
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,584
doesn’t need my help.

462
00:28:25,918 --> 00:28:26,792
Sorry to disappoint you.

463
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,667
I already knew who you are.

464
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:34,417
But I’m sure

465
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,375
whatever you’re doing,

466
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,334
you’re doing it for a reason,

467
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,167
right?

468
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,999
Take care of yourself.

469
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,334
And take care of Qi.

470
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,292
Mo Nan.

471
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,918
Mo Nan from Marketing Department.

472
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,417
Due to his serious violations of

473
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,459
the company’s relevant rules and regulations,

474
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:22,667
resulting in significant losses,

475
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,780
= Notice of Dismissal =
after the investigation of president’s office,

476
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,125
the company decided to give him dismissal.

477
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:29,792
As of this date, Mo Nan has

478
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,959
no official relationship with the company.

479
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,626
Serious violations of rules?

480
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,042
What did he do?

481
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,042
You’re so lack of news.

482
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:38,918
Mo Nan

483
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,751
is DREAM’s commercial spy.

484
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,918
He looked like a honest person,

485
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,959
but he was actually playing Mission Impossible.

486
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:47,042
Right, Secretary Chen?

487
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,792
How is that possible?

488
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:54,959
Qi is here.

489
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,209
She is Mo Nan’s best friend.

490
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:57,459
She must know something.

491
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:57,918
Yes, yes, yes.

492
00:29:58,542 --> 00:29:59,999
Qi! Qi!

493
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:00,584
Doesn’t Mo Nan

494
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:01,542
live in your balcony?

495
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:02,709
Don’t you see he’s a spy?

496
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,042
Right.

497
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:04,417
You were always a group.

498
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:05,501
Is he trying to get information out of you?

499
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:07,083
Qi, you really

500
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:07,834
didn’t find

501
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:08,959
out anything?

502
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,542
Qi!

503
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:10,375
Qi! Talk to us.

504
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:11,042
Qi…

505
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,250
This is the best suite in the hotel.

506
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,334
I’ve got it all prepared for you.

507
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:25,042
This is where you’re gonna live.

508
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:27,834
It has a great view.

509
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,459
When you look at it from here,

510
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:30,792
it gives you a kind of pleasure

511
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:32,626
to see all the mountains at once.

512
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,167
Thank you, William.

513
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,667
And more importantly,

514
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:39,792
if you look at it from this angle,

515
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,167
you can see FlowerPlus,

516
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:50,292
which is that short and small building.

517
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:52,834
How is it?

518
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,375
If you look at FlowerPlus

519
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:57,709
and Bo Hai from another angle,

520
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,709
is it much easier?

521
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:04,459
Over the past few months,

522
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:05,375
I’ve been getting to know FlowerPlus

523
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,292
inside and out.

524
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:08,584
Then

525
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,626
it’s our turn to attack head on.

526
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,834
There’s more good news for you.

527
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,709
Headquarters has officially named you

528
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,083
the President of Greater China.

529
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:20,959
I thought

530
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:21,999
this was gonna be

531
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:23,667
my reward for taking down FlowerPlus.

532
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:25,542
With your ability,

533
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,876
there’s no doubt to do it.

534
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,125
So I suggest headquarters that

535
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:31,125
you should sit

536
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,250
in this position earlier,

537
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:33,918
so that you can mobilize

538
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,083
more resources,

539
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,584
and complete the task as soon as possible.

540
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:39,125
Don’t worry.

541
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,042
I won’t let you down.

542
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,334
Honey.

543
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,584
Card… Card… Card…

544
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,375
Did you check? How much?

545
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,792
50,000 yuan.

546
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:54,918
Why would the guy who rented the balcony

547
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,375
give away so much money?

548
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,459
I think there is something

549
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,709
wrong with that kid.

550
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,876
He stopped renting the house

551
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,626
and gave us all his savings.

552
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:04,999
Or he’s got the wrong card.

553
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:06,751
I don’t think so.

554
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,751
It’s a big deal.

555
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:10,042
No, I have to call the police right now.

556
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,667
DREAM, the fashion giant,

557
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:12,459
announced the appointment

558
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:13,959
of President of Greater China today.

559
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,420
Mo Nan, a business whiz with a lot of

560
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,584
= News Release Conference =
buying experience…

561
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,125
Look! Mo Nan.

562
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:19,125
Mo Nan!

563
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:21,375
It’s really him.

564
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:24,459
President of Greater China.

565
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:25,876
This kid.

566
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:27,417
Was he pretending poor?

567
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,167
The rich pretending to be poor
usually means bad things.

568
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,167
Qi said

569
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,083
there’s a spy in her company.

570
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:36,250
Could it be him?

571
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:38,417
So what’s the money for?

572
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:39,209
Hush money?

573
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:40,999
Hush who?

574
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:41,918
We don’t know

575
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,125
anything.

576
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,292
It’s too important.

577
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:47,501
We don’t know things.

578
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:49,125
We’re not taking this money.

579
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,125
50,000 yuan!

580
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,667
Well, if it’s a thank-you,

581
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,834
I’ll take it.

582
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:58,876
I cooked him

583
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,250
sweet and sour pork.

584
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:03,417
But if he’s the spy,

585
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:04,751
we can’t take the money,

586
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,083
not a penny.

587
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:08,000
Well, that’s a relief.

588
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,334
Honey, I’m really relieved that

589
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,667
you’re so mature.

590
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:11,834
Ling Guoliang,

591
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:12,542
I’m a woman

592
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:13,876
with my principle.

593
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,209
And this... This…

594
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:18,375
Call Qi.

595
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:19,709
That’s a good idea.

596
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:41,167
Thank you.

597
00:33:52,918 --> 00:33:53,876
Dangerous enemies

598
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,334
do not appear to us

599
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:56,918
in the most terrible form.

600
00:33:59,125 --> 00:33:59,626
How could we

601
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,918
have been so stupid?

602
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,459
He had cheated us for so long.

603
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,083
Neither one of us knew.

604
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,459
Qi, Mo Nan was wrong.

605
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:11,876
But I think

606
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:12,834
we should

607
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,667
put ourselves in his shoes.

608
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,999
What he did

609
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,501
makes some sense.

610
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,000
What’s wrong with you, Baoni?

611
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,876
Mo Nan has a mission.

612
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:27,042
You can’t tell who’s right and who’s wrong

613
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,292
in business competition.

614
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:32,584
He may have played tricks,

615
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,250
but Bo Hai is not always

616
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,876
above board.

617
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:36,667
And plus

618
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:37,999
the history of their parents.

619
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,792
Mo Nan has his reasons.

620
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:40,667
I think

621
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,792
he has his reason to hate Bo Hai.

622
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,375
Even if his childhood

623
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,375
was unfortunate,

624
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,167
his world is distorted,

625
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:49,876
this does not mean that

626
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:51,292
he can use his distorted outlook

627
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:52,542
to harm others.

628
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,250
Qi, what you said

629
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,501
is just a lecture.

630
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:58,999
Baoni,

631
00:34:59,542 --> 00:34:59,999
I know

632
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,876
how much you like him.

633
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,459
But the only reason

634
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,501
he came to us

635
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,584
was to cover his commercial espionage.

636
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:08,876
We’re just props

637
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:10,250
for his ambition.

638
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:18,209
All this BFF talk,

639
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,501
all this sisterhood talk,

640
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,375
are all fake.

641
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:24,542
Even the Mo Nan you like

642
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,459
is a fake. Wake up!

643
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:12,751
I can’t.

644
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:14,334
My best friend was wearing

645
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:15,792
the world’s ugliest mask.

646
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,292
How am I supposed to understand?

647
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:18,667
Have you ever wondered

648
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,042
who did this to me?

649
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:21,709
I don’t want to hear your excuses.

650
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:22,375
I…

651
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,250
The worst thing is not to be heartless,

652
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,042
but to take advantage of the feelings of others.

653
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:28,709
I had no idea you were like this.

654
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,542
Mr. Mo, I found something new.

655
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:43,751
What is it?

656
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:44,584
I found Bo Hai’s

657
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:45,584
psychologist.

658
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,209
There’s something wrong with him.

659
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,584
Now I’ve seen what it’s like

660
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,834
to kill a flower.

661
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,999
You want to skip work and hang out?

662
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,334
Can’t you see I’m not in the mood?

663
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:18,542
All right.

664
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,209
I’ll call Xinyan and

665
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,834
see if she has time.

666
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:28,792
Don’t harass people.

667
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,083
Even if the person behind this

668
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,250
is identified,

669
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,125
I still

670
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:42,250
feel a little

671
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:44,209
weird inside.

672
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,292
After all, you lost a good friend.

673
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,834
It’s gonna be hard.

674
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:53,250
Although I know

675
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,834
it’s all fake,

676
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:57,125
just like Baoni,

677
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,501
I still

678
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,125
can’t let go.

679
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,959
All right, look on the bright side.

680
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,375
You lost a bad friend.

681
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:08,709
But most of all,

682
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,626
you have

683
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,792
the man of your dreams.

684
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:11,459
Think of it this way.

685
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:12,876
Don’t you think you made a fortune?

686
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:16,167
Well, think about it this way.

687
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,501
It is a win.

688
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,292
If we think about it this way,

689
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,209
I have such a boyfriend,

690
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:25,501
whatever is bothering me

691
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,000
is forgotten in an instant.

692
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:28,584
Your boyfriend

693
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:30,083
is really something.

694
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:32,417
My really something boyfriend,

695
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,250
where are we going?

696
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,042
With a boyfriend like this,

697
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:37,876
you have to show him off.

698
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,000
I heard your whole neighborhood

699
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:40,667
don’t believe you

700
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,000
have such a great boyfriend.

701
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:47,000
What do you mean?

702
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:48,501
But from the looks of you,

703
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,667
I’d say you’re full of it.

704
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,918
Who are you talking about?

705
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,083
It’s broken.

706
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,542
What to do? I can’t drive.

707
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,584
What to do? I can’t drive.

708
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,250
Help me.

709
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:12,125
Just drive.

710
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,999
Look at others.

711
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:30,542
No, no, no.

712
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:31,292
I know, I know.

713
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:32,501
Here we go. I’ll lead.

714
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,501
Why do you keep stepping on my foot?

715
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,125
No, no, no.

716
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,083
I can’t do the man step.

717
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,125
I can’t.

718
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:41,375
Didn’t you say you found

719
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,751
a male partner?

720
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:43,834
Where is he?

721
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,876
I actually met one down by the river.

722
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,792
He’s agreed to come.

723
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:47,999
He’s a good dancer.

724
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,042
Look at the time.

725
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:51,999
This guy’s a flake.

728
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,667

729
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:04,959
A handsome guy!

730
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,375
Bo Hai!

731
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,542
Handsome boy!

732
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,250
What are you doing here?

733
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,125
Don’t you need a male partner?

734
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:14,626
How do you know?

735
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,459
This is the handsome man

736
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,792
you found by the river?

737
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:19,626
Right.

738
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,584
It’s him?

739
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,667
Yes.

740
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:25,417
Dance with me first.

741
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:33,626
Bravo!

742
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,375
- Good dance! - Good dance!

743
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,709
Bravo!

744
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:40,667
Young man,

745
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:41,959
are you Qi’s boyfriend?

746
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,125
Yes, I am.

747
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,999
I’m Ling Lingqi’s boyfriend.

748
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:47,999
Boyfriend!

749
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,209
Boyfriend!

750
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,501
You are the boyfriend of Ling Lingqi?

751
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,751
Can’t he be?

752
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:58,000
Yes, of course.

753
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,626
He can.

754
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:01,792
Would you like to take a picture

755
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:02,876
with my son-in-law?

756
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,083
Yeah.

757
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:05,250
Mom.

758
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:06,709
Qi, there you are.

759
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:07,792
Let me take your picture.

760
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:08,209
Sure.

761
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:10,167
Don’t push. Stand still. Stand still.

762
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:11,459
Come on, come on, Stand still, Bo Hai.

763
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,459
OK. Smile.

764
