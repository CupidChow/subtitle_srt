51
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:44,000
Dear bracelet,

52
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,375
you gotta help me this time.

53
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:47,209
Don’t put me

54
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:48,876
in dilemma like last time.

55
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,042
What happened?

56
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,334
Why I dress like this?

57
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:02,751
Remember,

58
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,876
after that guy drinks up the poison,

59
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:06,626
you smash the cup on the ground,

60
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,501
then we will rush in

61
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,167
to put him down.

62
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,000
Who is that guy?

63
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:16,292
What do you mean?

64
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,792
What they want

65
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,334
is Chomper?

66
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,459
Great.

67
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,959
I’ll get even with him.

68
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,542
Your liquor, sir.

69
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,999
Sir, you don’t drink my liquor.

70
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,792
Do you dislike me?

71
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:12,709
No.

72
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,292
You want me to drink your liquor.

73
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,542
You should show some sincerity.

74
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,667
You mean?

75
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,209
Liquor doesn’t make a man drunk
if he’s not in the mood.

76
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,417
If I can kiss you

77
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,125
while I drink the liquor,

78
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,292
that would be perfect.

79
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,083
You want me to feed you with my mouth?

80
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,417
If you’re reluctant,

81
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,876
I won’t make you.

82
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,626
No, you can’t kiss him!

83
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,959
Don’t do it! Don’t!

84
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,083
- You can kiss him.
- Don’t kiss him!

85
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,584
- You can kiss him.
- Look at his face,

86
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,501
are you really gonna do it?

87
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,083
No!

88
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,542
I’d rather take the risk!

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,125
You’re gonna be dead!

90
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:21,959
OK, I’ll use my mouth.

91
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,876
Here we are again.

92
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:41,876
You play tricks!

93
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,792
I play tricks?

94
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,417
You’re murdering me

95
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,792
with your fellow gangsters!

96
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,209
Sorry.

97
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,125
Get him, brothers!

98
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,292
Why is the poison still not working?

99
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,083
Is it fake?

100
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:10,834
Fake or not,

101
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:11,959
tell it yourself!

102
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,626
Mr. Bo, here is your file.

103
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,626
Mr. Bo, here is your file.

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,042
Out! Don’t come in

105
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,250
unless I ask you to.

106
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:21,834
Nuts.

107
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:22,709
OK, I’ll go out.

108
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:23,918
You think I want to see you?

109
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:44,918
- What’s wrong, Baoni?
- What happened?

110
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,209
What’s that?

111
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,250
It’s sick.

112
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:51,626
Gross.

113
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:03,792
What’s wrong, Baoni?

114
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,667
It’s OK, just some doll. Don’t be afraid.

115
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:13,542
Don’t look anymore. Go back to work.

116
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,792
Never saw a mischief?

117
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,083
Lu.

118
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,334
Lu.

119
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:22,918
Go deliver this file.

120
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:24,834
It’s important.

121
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,918
Make it done today.

122
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:27,751
Got it.

123
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:33,292
You all right?

124
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:33,959
Yeah.

125
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,501
Just scared.

126
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:36,459
Don’t panic.

127
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:45,918
Baoni!

128
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,250
Mo Nan.

129
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,501
You all right? Want me to go with you?

130
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:53,334
Don’t worry.

131
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:54,709
Just deliver the file.

132
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:55,626
I’ll be back soon.

133
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:56,709
See you.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,459
See you.

135
00:10:59,209 --> 00:10:59,999
Be careful.

136
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:05,459
Okay,

137
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,542
that’s it,

138
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,751
if you have no other questions.

139
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,000
- Okay, let’s… - Wait!

140
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:11,250
I got something to say.

141
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:14,959
I don’t know have you noticed

142
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:16,542
that recently

143
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,709
our exposure rate

144
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:18,751
is dropping down.

145
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,876
So I made several plans

146
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,584
to discuss with you.

147
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:26,042
The World Trade Center

148
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:26,876
is celebrating their

149
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,292
three years anniversary.

150
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,375
They’re looking for a florist…

151
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:30,999
No!

152
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,250
Director Zhou, I haven’t finished yet.

153
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,918
How do you know it won’t work?

154
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,709
Who they invited

155
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:41,876
last year were

156
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,167
all common florists.

157
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,626
If Mr. Bo goes there,

158
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:47,417
he’d be depreciating his value.

159
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,250
Yeah, you’re right.

160
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:52,584
It’s OK.

161
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:53,709
There is also

162
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:54,918
a reality show

163
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,209
sending an invitation to us.

164
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,709
This reality show is mainly about

165
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,876
the following shots of

166
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,709
some experts in various industries.

167
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,000
I’ve checked it up,

168
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,709
it has great audience rating.

169
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,042
It’s not good.

170
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,083
Secretary Chen,

171
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,292
it’s a golden opportunity.

172
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,334
Some want to go but they can’t.

173
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:15,501
I know,

174
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,292
these are all good opportunities.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,834
But the TV shooting…

176
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:19,667
Many staff will rush

177
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,584
in our company.

178
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,959
It will affect our work.

179
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,000
And,

180
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:23,918
Mr. Bo

181
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,334
is the core of our company.

182
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:26,834
If they capture

183
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,959
our business secret,

184
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:29,209
who’s gonna be responsible for that?

185
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,584
Yeah, it’s true.

186
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,375
In this case,

187
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:35,834
there is only one left.

188
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,083
The TV interview.

189
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,250
But just sitting in there and talking

190
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:41,375
can’t show

191
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,584
Mr. Bo’s talent in floriculture.

192
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:45,083
This sounds good.

193
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,292
I’ll go for it.

194
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,667
Interview has high profile

195
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,876
which agrees with

196
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,083
our market positioning

197
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,042
in online flower subscription.

198
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:53,417
It’s great.

199
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,709
Mr. Bo, what do you think?

200
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:02,501
It’s rare that Mr. Wen could do

201
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,584
something good to the company,

202
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,083
I won’t spoil it.

203
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,876
Let’s do it.

204
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:08,167
Secretary Chen,

205
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,584
contact with them.

206
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:10,501
Okay, Mr. Bo.

207
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,542
I got something to discuss.

208
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,250
Interrupted by Mr. Wen just then.

209
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:16,667
This is our latest modified

210
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:18,167
color scheme

211
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,250
and the two previous old schemes.

212
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:21,792
Do you think

213
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,626
it is satisfactory?

214
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,751
Mr. Bo?

215
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:38,209
Mr. Li,

216
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,083
how about you leave the drafts,

217
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,501
when Mr. Bo decides,

218
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:42,375
he will let you know.

219
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:43,709
OK, no problem.

220
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,000
Wait.

221
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:03,375
This one.

222
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:07,667
This…

223
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:09,501
This is our latest

224
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:10,459
color scheme

225
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,417
and the top one

226
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,501
in our department.

227
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:13,834
Thank you, Mr. Bo.

228
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:18,876
OK, dismiss.

229
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,542
Mr. Bo, coffee.

230
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:52,667
Out!

231
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,125
I’ll leave when I put it down.

232
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,417
Get out!

233
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:00,792
What’s wrong with you?

234
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,167
You think I want to see you?

235
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,180
= Outpatient =

236
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,250
Your condition is caused

237
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:48,209
by psychological shadows.

238
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,626
It requires your own efforts to regulate

239
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,834
and maintain a good optimistic attitude.

240
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:56,751
How long

241
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:58,751
can I recover my color vision?

242
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,375
This is hard to say.

243
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,501
The causes of mental illness are complex

244
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,709
and there are many ways to cure it.

245
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,667
Sometimes when your heart knot is untied,

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,459
your health will be restored soon.

247
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,000
Sometimes it attacks now and then,

248
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:13,542
no progress for a long time.

249
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:14,751
Okay,

250
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:15,751
I’ll prescribe some medicine

251
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,667
to relieve your tension,

252
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,417
let’s see if it helps.

253
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,459
Sorry for the trouble.

254
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,042
It can’t be my bad day!

255
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,250
Baoni, you OK?

256
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,542
Mo Nan.

257
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:10,584
It’s OK now.

258
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,584
I’m so scared.

259
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,167
Baoni, Baoni.

260
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,167
I’m so scared.

261
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,250
Baoni, I advise you

262
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,542
stop eating stinky tofu, fried chicken

263
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,459
or anything like that.

264
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,042
You’re heavy.

265
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,167
I can barely bear it.

266
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,501
I should have listened to you.

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,584
I should have rejected them.

268
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:42,751
Look now,

269
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,751
I have my nemesis.

270
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,417
There, there. Don’t cry.

271
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,709
Don’t be superstitious.

272
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:48,626
You just sprained your ankle.

273
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:49,459
And it was my fault.

274
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,125
Not just sprained my ankle.

275
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,042
The red ink.

276
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,209
And that bloody doll.

277
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,042
It scared me.

278
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:02,042
Tell me.

279
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,042
Do you want to catch that

280
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,292
freak fan?

281
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:09,501
You know how?

282
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,709
Actually I already know

283
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:12,876
who he is.

284
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,334
And,

285
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:15,584
I can make him

286
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,876
admit it himself.

287
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:17,626
How is it?

288
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,042
Good.

289
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,626
Let’s go, Miss Justice.

290
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:29,167
Wang.

291
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,626
Come with me.

292
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:41,584
This.

293
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:45,792
What’s going on?

294
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,959
Our HR director is having a word with Wang.

295
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,918
It must be nothing good.

296
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,209
You don’t know what’s going on?

297
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:53,709
No, what is it?

298
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:55,709
I’m telling you,

299
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,209
Wang could be

300
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,959
the freak fan harassing Baoni.

301
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:01,999
Really?

302
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:02,542
Yeah.

303
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,125
He’s gonna be fired.

304
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:05,584
No way! He…

305
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,918
He seems nice.

306
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,209
Fair without, foul within.

307
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:26,542
Baoni.

308
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,459
I got something to tell you.

309
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:33,918
Baoni,

310
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:35,959
can you say something nice

311
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,876
for Wang

312
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,375
and ask Director Luo not to fire him?

313
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:39,584
Why would I do that?

314
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:40,709
If he’s not fired,

315
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:41,584
what if

316
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,959
he does something to hurt me

317
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,501
again?

318
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,542
Lili, I know you got a soft heart,

319
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:47,792
but you should

320
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:48,999
stay out of this.

321
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:51,459
Baoni,

322
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,834
the freak fan you’re looking for

323
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,667
is not Wang.

324
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:57,751
It was me.

325
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:00,959
Who the hell

326
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:02,667
sent this disgusting stuff?

327
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:05,209
Don’t go there.

328
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:05,709
Why?

329
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:06,959
If the freak fan

330
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,000
knows you’re with her,

331
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,334
he might revenge on you too.

332
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,042
I can’t stand

333
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,334
you hooking up with them

334
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,834
and playing them around,

335
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:16,167
so…

336
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:17,375
So I pretended

337
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,876
the freak fan to scare you.

338
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:20,209
Don’t worry.

339
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,999
I’ll resign

340
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:22,792
and won’t do anything

341
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:24,042
to you again.

342
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:25,876
Lili,

343
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,709
you have a crush on Wang?

344
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:33,667
How do you know?

345
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,334
You’re such a silly girl.

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,501
No worries.

347
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,542
No one is firing Wang.

348
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,918
And you don’t have to resign.

349
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,083
Also, I promise you,

350
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:56,792
I won’t tell anyone else

351
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,959
about what you just said.

352
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,876
You always wanted to

353
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,167
give that freak fan a hard time,

354
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:15,751
didn’t you?

355
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,709
Now you know who did that,

356
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:18,959
you let her go?

357
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,584
Anyway,

358
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:22,626
no matter what happened,

359
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:23,834
I started it.

360
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,876
You’re right.

361
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,501
A cold rejection

362
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,417
is a mercy compared with

363
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,250
unnecessary gentleness.

364
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,501
Good for you.

365
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:38,626
You can realize that,

366
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:39,709
I’ll be relieved.

367
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,626
My effort is not in vain.

368
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,501
You’ve grown up.

369
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,125
Watch your behavior. We’re in the office.

370
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,417
Wait up, my sis.

371
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:57,417
Ling Lingqi,

372
00:21:58,834 --> 00:21:59,501
can you do me a favor?

373
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,459
No.

374
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,417
Can you at least hear it out?

375
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:03,834
I know what you wanna say.

376
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:04,834
It must be something

377
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:05,667
about Chomper.

378
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:06,834
Smart girl,

379
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,542
that’s why my boss values you!

380
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,542
Here is the thing.

381
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:14,125
Today,

382
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,167
Bo Hai is gonna meet

383
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,501
a valued client.

384
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:17,584
But Xinyan and I

385
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,999
have other matters.

386
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,709
Can you do me a favor

387
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:21,834
to meet the client with him?

388
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,167
As return,

389
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,250
from now on,

390
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,584
the one-month afternoon tea

391
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,709
is on me.

392
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:30,584
Three months.

393
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:31,792
One and a half.

394
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,292
Four months.

395
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:34,751
Two… Two months.

396
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:35,667
Half a year.

397
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:36,959
Okay, three months.

398
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,417
Deal.

399
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:40,125
Anyway,

400
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,751
the client

401
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:42,542
got a hobby.

402
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:43,459
Drink.

403
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:44,751
So you must try anything

404
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,042
to change the wine in Bo Hai’s glass

405
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:46,918
into water.

406
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,250
Because once he’s drunk,

407
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,667
something terrible

408
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,000
would happen.

409
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:52,417
Got it.

410
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:53,375
I’m serious.

411
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:54,250
I know.

412
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,459
Three months.

413
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:12,167
This way.

414
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,250
Shut your month

415
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:19,250
until I ask you to talk.

416
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:20,459
Remember?

417
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,459
This way, Mr. Bo.

418
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,417
Mr. Bo,

419
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:32,209
long time no see.

420
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,250
Mr. Zhao, how do you do?

421
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,083
You’re busy,

422
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,459
it’s quite hard to meet you in person.

423
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:37,999
Let me introduce,

424
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,417
this is my secretary, Wu.

425
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,167
Hi, Mr. Bo.

426
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:40,501
Hi.

427
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:43,667
This is?

428
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:44,542
No one matters.

429
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,667
Hi, I’m Ling Lingqi.

430
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,834
I’m Mr. Bo’s assistant.

431
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:48,999
You can call me Qi.

432
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:50,918
Hi, Miss Qi,

433
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:51,918
you’re cute.

434
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,209
Come, have a seat.

435
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:57,167
Mr. Bo,

436
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,042
I have someone

437
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,751
to get me

438
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:02,334
two bottles of good wines,

439
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:03,959
you must have a drink with me today.

440
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:04,709
Sure.

441
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:06,959
For the sake of our friendship.

442
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,542
Go ask the waiter to open it up.

443
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:08,999
Okay.

444
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:10,417
Let me.

445
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,125
I’m good at this.

446
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:14,751
Sit.

447
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:15,459
Please.

448
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,125
The wine is not ready.

449
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,042
Miss Ling, the wine?

450
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:48,209
In a minute.

451
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,250
Here.

452
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:09,584
This one.

453
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,918
Come, Mr. Bo, let me pour for you.

454
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:15,626
Mr. Zhao,

455
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,042
how can I let you do it?

456
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:17,751
I’ll do it.

457
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,167
Make yourself at home.

458
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:21,334
Mr. Bo and I are friends.

459
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:22,083
Allow me.

460
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:25,417
Thanks.

461
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,626
Damn, what to do now?

462
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,459
You pour it too.

463
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:32,250
Mr. Bo, the first glass,

464
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:34,459
to our cooperation!

465
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:35,542
And success!

466
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:36,542
To our cooperation!

467
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,542
I’m done.

468
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,167
Here, pour some.

469
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:51,042
Mr. Zhao, here to you.

470
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:52,209
Thank you

471
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:52,792
for your support

472
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:53,876
in these years.

473
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,375
Without the support

474
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,042
of old clients like you,

475
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,209
we can’t make it today.

476
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,626
Cooperation makes mutual benefits!

477
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:00,584
Thanks.

478
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:00,999
Here.

479
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:10,876
Seems

480
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,459
nothing happened to Chomper.

481
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,042
Did Chen Mo worry for nothing?

482
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:16,292
Have some dishes.

483
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:16,667
OK.

484
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:17,667
Here. Have some dishes.

485
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:19,959
Mr. Zhao.

486
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,834
Don’t drag me. I’m not drunk.

487
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:22,292
Mr. Zhao.

488
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,125
I’m telling you, Qi.

489
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,417
I’m fine, not drunk.

490
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

491
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:26,959
Take care of Mr. Bo.

492
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,626
Mr. Bo, this wine tastes good.

493
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:30,125
Mr. Zhao, this way.

494
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,584
Let’s drink again.

495
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,417
I’m fine, really.

496
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:35,501
I’m telling you,

497
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:37,459
it’s not all about business,

498
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,417
we drink as friends too.

499
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:40,667
Yes, yes.

500
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:42,584
Be careful, Mr. Zhao.

501
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:45,334
Qi,

502
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,375
you better go take care of Mr. Bo.

503
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:48,209
OK.

504
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:48,834
I’m fine.

505
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:50,375
You can leave me.

506
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:51,501
Mr. Zhao.

507
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:52,125
Where is…

508
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,125
Mr. Zhao, watch out.

509
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,292
Where is my car?

510
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,334
Hello, have you seen

511
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,375
a man this high

512
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:11,125
in camel coat,

513
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,417
and has fox eyes?

514
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,000
No.

515
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,834
No?

516
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,792
No.

517
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,417
It can’t be.

518
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,820
= Central Square | Siena Square |
Verona Street | South Parking Lot =

519
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,000
Stop running!

520
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:25,959
Stop.

521
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,667
Why you…

522
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,876
Leave without me?

523
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,375
Tell me,

524
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:57,167
who is more handsome,

525
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,083
me or this fox?

526
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,292
Are you really drunk?

527
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,584
I’m dead.

528
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,292
Of course me!

529
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:34,751
Get up. What are you doing here?

530
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:36,542
Let’s go. It’s freezing.

531
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:36,876
No.

532
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,250
Let’s go. We have work tomorrow.

533
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,417
No, I want ice cream!

534
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:42,167
What are you doing?

535
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,167
Lining up! It’s so embarrassing.

536
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,375
Mom.

537
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:58,667
What?

538
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,417
He took my ice cream.

539
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,334
Are you a psychopath?

540
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:04,918
Sorry.

541
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:06,000
He didn’t mean it.

542
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:06,751
We’re sorry.

543
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,667
He didn’t mean it,

544
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,334
but he can’t bully a kid!

545
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,083
Can you keep an eye on your boyfriend?

546
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:12,999
He took things from kids!

547
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:13,667
Where are you going?

548
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:14,042
We’re sorry.

549
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:14,876
Sorry for that.

550
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:15,667
Stop crying.

551
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,000
Wait up.

552
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:22,417
Wait up.

553
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,209
Go away, I bought those coins!

554
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,000
Get away.

555
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:33,876
You go away!

556
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:34,959
You don’t know how to play.

557
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:35,626
Let me help you.

558
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,042
Bo Hai!

559
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:36,626
Go away!

560
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,042
Bo Hai!

561
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:38,918
These are my coins. Darn you!

562
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:39,417
Let’s go.

563
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:40,125
Is he drunk?

564
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:41,042
Sorry, sorry.

565
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:41,834
Why he robs from kids?

566
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,167
Don’t run!

567
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:42,918
I shot it.

568
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:44,334
How much is this?

569
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:45,125
30.

570
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,042
Wait.

571
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,125
Keep the change.

572
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:49,501
OK.

573
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:01,501
Lean on it.

574
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:02,459
Don’t move.

575
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:09,250
You’re really something.

576
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:13,792
Don’t look at me.

577
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:27,292
Now I know

578
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,083
why Chen Mo doesn’t

579
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,083
let you drink.

580
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:29,751
You usually

581
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:30,918
behave so arrogantly,

582
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:31,667
now look

583
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,959
how childish you are

584
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:33,876
after drinking.

585
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,334
Isn’t it so called extremes meet?

586
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:42,501
I refer to you!

587
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,292
What are you looking at?

588
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,542
Did I see you in my dream?

589
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,334
What are you talking about?

590
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:34,501
You’re drunk, you know that?

591
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:42,751
I’m sure.

592
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:45,709
I must have seen you in my dream.

593
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,334
I…

594
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,042
Don’t sit on the ground.

595
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:54,876
Get up!

596
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,209
Oh my goodness.

597
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:58,834
Get up.

598
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,918
I’ll be damned.

599
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:47,459
What happened?

600
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,042
You’ve finally answered my call?

601
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,250
Something happened.

602
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:51,792
I’ll show you a video.

603
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:25,667
Come on.

604
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:28,959
Watch out!

605
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:34,542
Oh my goodness.

606
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:39,626
You look

607
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:43,667
quite skinny,

608
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,209
but why you’re so heavy?

609
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,000
There.

610
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,999
I asked for trouble.

611
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:49,083
I should have left you

612
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:50,250
in the playground!

613
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,125
No, I shouldn’t have

614
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,375
met the client with you!

615
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,542
Oh my goodness, stand still.

616
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:57,792
Stand up!

617
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:01,709
Stand still.

618
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,042
Oh my goodness.

619
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:05,042
Wait.

620
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:08,918
Lie down.

621
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:36,459
Don’t you think you can

622
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,292
take advantage of me while you’re drunk.

623
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,000
Go to hell!

624
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,999
You bully me at work,

625
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,751
now look at you.

626
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,626
Get up, bite me!

627
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:08,250
Get up!

628
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:22,959
No.

629
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,000
If he wakes up tomorrow,

630
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,584
he would know I did this.

631
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,459
OK, that’s it.

632
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:54,167
Ling Lingqi!

633
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:25,209
Shouldn’t you

634
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:26,959
pick up Chomper to work?

635
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,459
That’s what an assistant does.

636
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,584
Why are you by yourself?

637
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,042
Hiding here

638
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,292
like a thief?

639
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,459
I did something

640
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,584
I shouldn’t do last night.

641
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:35,417
I could be

642
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,501
silenced soon.

643
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:40,918
No, you won’t.

644
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:43,667
He got regular meeting this morning,

645
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:45,542
and has no time to silence you.

646
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:46,417
Really?

647
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:48,167
If you’re lucky,

648
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:50,999
you might survive to the lunch time.

649
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,959
Then I’m going out.

650
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,459
Come on, have a faith!

651
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:17,999
Mr. Bo said

652
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:19,667
you got no work to do today.

653
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,250
Just clean the toilets of each room

654
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,667
in the whole building.

655
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,083
If you still got time,

656
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,542
clean them in the next building too.

657
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,542
Chomper requites kindness with enmity!

658
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:31,584
If it wasn’t me

659
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:32,167
who’s so smart

660
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:32,876
to buy him a mask

661
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:33,876
to cover his face,

662
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,250
he would shame

663
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:37,918
the whole company.

664
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,459
I told you it’s important

665
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,292
but you ruined it.

666
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:45,334
Since you haven’t accomplished

667
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,626
the task I assigned

668
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,125
and Mr. Bo got drunk after all,

669
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,999
our agreement on the afternoon tea

670
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:51,292
doesn’t count anymore.

671
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,709
What do you want to eat, Baoni?

672
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:10,417
I’ll buy it for you.

673
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,375
Baoni, this is what I bought for you.

674
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,999
Your favorite crayfish.

675
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,501
Take-out is no good for health.

676
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:17,751
Baoni, what would you like to eat?

677
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:18,918
I’ll take you out, all right?

678
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:19,709
What do you want to eat, Baoni?

679
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:20,125
I’ll buy it for you.

680
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,083
Thanks, all of you,

681
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,626
for your affection for me.

682
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:24,501
But from now on,

683
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:25,375
please don’t waste time

684
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:26,751
on me anymore.

685
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:28,459
Because love

686
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:29,876
cannot be forced.

687
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:31,000
If I ever

688
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,125
had anything to anyone of you,

689
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:35,083
I won’t wait till now,

690
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,000
right?

691
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,709
Have you ever thought about it

692
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:41,876
that there might be

693
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,667
girls around you who are worthy of

694
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,876
your love more than I am?

695
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:47,417
Please pay more attention

696
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,542
to someone beside you.

697
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,000
Baoni?

698
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,209
Baoni, you’re giving us up?

699
00:39:57,626 --> 00:40:00,292
Baoni, you don’t love me,

700
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:01,834
but you can’t stop

701
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:02,999
me loving you!

702
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,375
You rejected your fans

703
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,417
so cruelly,

704
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,125
do you feel a bit reluctant

705
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,918
deep in your heart?

706
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,959
I’ve made up my mind.

707
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,459
From now on,

708
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,125
I’ll conceal myself,

709
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,751
especially in front of the female colleagues.

710
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,042
The girl is still worth teaching.

711
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,292
You’re learning.

712
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:40,334
What happened to Qi?

713
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:41,959
Let’s check on her.

714
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,918
What’s the matter, my dear?

715
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:52,000
What else can it be?

716
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:57,918
She offended Chomper!

717
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,417
Chomper

718
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,918
is really a heartless,

719
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:06,000
conscienceless and inhuman asshole!

720
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:07,626
I just failed to stop him

721
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,501
from drinking,

722
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,250
why he is so cruel on me?

723
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,334
Damn him.

724
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:13,501
What he did to you?

725
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:18,918
He asked me to clean up

726
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,250
all the toilets in this building.

727
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,083
His mind is so narrow!

728
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:27,501
That’s outrageous!

729
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,501
Baoni, Nan,

730
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,876
I know you two care for me.

731
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,250
As it goes,

732
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,709
best friends share happiness

733
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:39,999
and hardship.

734
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,125
I did a rough math,

735
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,959
there are 36 toilets

736
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:44,501
in this building

737
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,542
and I just finished 6 of them.

738
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,000
Now there are

739
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:49,626
30 left.

740
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:50,626
So if we three

741
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:51,626
can work together,

742
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:52,918
I’m sure we can finish it up

743
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,167
before dark.

744
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,000
Let’s do it together.
