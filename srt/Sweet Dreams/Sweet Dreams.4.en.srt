Ling Lingqi.

53
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,580
What are you doing?

54
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,330
He’s arrived. Stand properly.

55
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,910
Stand properly!

56
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,200
Hello?

57
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,120
Okay. I’ll be right there.

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,950
Be careful!

59
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,080
Bo Hai!

60
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,250
You didn’t see that.

61
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,580
The floral basket fell

62
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,910
directly on her

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,450
and smashed her down.

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,290
She looked ridiculous!

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:34,990
Shut up!

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,370
Was that so funny?

67
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,120
Qi.

68
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,950
It was your luck that

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,330
you didn’t meet Bo Hai today.

70
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,250
You know what?

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,950
The first impression matters a lot

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,540
in a relationship.

73
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,580
Relationship?

74
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,700
As far as I’ve seen,

75
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,450
you

76
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,200
have a crush on somebody.

77
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,200
So what?

78
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,830
You have a crush on him?

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,910
And want to snatch him?

80
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
No...

81
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,790
Though there is

82
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,250
a great distance

83
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,200
between you

84
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,500
and your future husband,

85
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,080
as your good friend,

86
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,620
I still wish you could

87
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,500
chase him asap.

88
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,620
Cheers! Come on!

89
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,620
I’m home.

90
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,200
You’re home.

91
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,450
I’m going back.

92
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:38,950
Don’t talk nonsense

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
when you come to our shop tomorrow.

94
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,450
I swear I’ll keep my lips buttoned.

95
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,080
Anyway, I’m now

96
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,370
your bestie.

97
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,450
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

98
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,290
Bye-bye.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,450
Let’s go.

100
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,040
Tell me. Where do you live?

101
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,120
Since I walked her home,

102
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
I’ll walk you home, too.

103
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,540
What?

104
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,910
Anything on my face?

105
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,990
Or do you think

106
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,950
I’m too handsome?

107
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,910
Stop pretending!

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,660
What do you mean?

109
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,000
You approach Qi and me,

110
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,370
just because

111
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,700
you want to chase me, huh?

112
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,700
Oh, you see me through.

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
What do you think of me then?

114
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,080
You look decent,

115
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,950
and are well-spoken.

116
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
But not rich enough.

117
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,450
You have a poor career.

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,330
And just for this,

119
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,000
you should be eliminated.

120
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,250
However,

121
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,950
you’re doing better

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
in hitting on me

123
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,790
than those idiots

124
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,120
who just flirt with me.

125
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,410
But unfortunately,

126
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,790
I’m too experienced in

127
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,200
judging men.

128
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,750
Well, Miss Lu Baoni

129
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,160
who is experienced in judging men,

130
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,250
why can’t you tell that

131
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,580
I only

132
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,750
want to be your bestie?

133
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,000
You really look

134
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,910
elegant and gorgeous.

135
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,160
But you’re also

136
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,000
super narcissistic!

137
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,080
I’m a young man

138
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,580
with dreams and ambitions,

139
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,580
instead of an animal

140
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,750
in the zoo.

141
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,790
Why will I rush up to

142
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,790
whatever female animal I see?

143
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,950
Aren’t you quibbling

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,370
because I see you through?

145
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,660
I, Mo Nan,

146
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,330
will never fall in love

147
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,040
with Lu Baoni,

148
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,410
whenever it is.

149
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,290
Because,

150
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,000
I never treat you as a woman!

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
I never treat you as a man, either!

152
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,950
You’re angry?

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,950
Don’t be angry.

154
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,410
Do you know

155
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,450
why I invested in FlowerPlus?

156
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,830
Once our deal is revealed,

157
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,410
your stock will be doubled.

158
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,450
This is one reason.

159
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,910
Your client Nicolas

160
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,250
is a good friend of mine.

161
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,200
He told me

162
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,450
a story about you.

163
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,250
Before the wedding of

164
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,830
him and Madeline,

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,620
you communicated many times

166
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,910
with them.

167
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,620
But Madeline still asked for

168
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,700
pink roses abruptly.

169
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:25,870
Unexpectedly,

170
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,120
you saved the situation.

171
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,620
I established FlowerPlus,

172
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,500
not for making money,

173
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,120
but for a sense of mission

174
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,750
to deliver the niceness.

175
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,830
As a saying in the investment industry goes,

176
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,990
we invest in persons,

177
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,950
instead of business.

178
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
So, I didn’t invest in

179
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,330
your company,

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,290
but you.

181
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,450
I will be

182
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,830
the best project

183
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
in your investment career.

184
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,370
Come on!

185
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,870
Prince Jack, hug me.

186
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,330
Let’s fight together.

187
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,080
Prince Jack!

188
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:26,870
Boss.

189
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,830
I don’t really understand

190
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,580
this look on your face.

191
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,620
I managed to defeat DREAM,

192
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,910
all because of a dream.

193
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,040
Dream? What dream?

194
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,620
Since DREAM haunted me,

195
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,120
I’ve been having the same nightmare,

196
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,120
until the one turned up.

197
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,700
The guy or the girl?

198
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,910
Don’t be so vulgar, will you?

199
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,120
I can’t even remember

200
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,370
her face.

201
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,250
I just remember

202
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,290
some important parts.

203
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,000
Her?

204
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,200
Boss, I’m not vulgar.

205
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,660
You’ve never had a girlfriend
even at the age of 28.

206
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,370
If you didn’t have the dream,

207
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,540
I would wonder

208
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,990
if you liked nobody,

209
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,750
but me.

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,950
You’re so…

211
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,330
You’re so…

212
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,250
Hello?

213
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Okay. I see.

214
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,410
Good news.

215
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,290
DREAM cancelled the acquisition plan.

216
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,910
But giving up so fast

217
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,500
isn’t the way they used to be.

218
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, keep an eye on them,

219
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,790
especially on Wen Guangqi.

220
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,750
I see.

221
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,830
Claiming to cancel the acquisition plan

222
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
is a strategy from the headquarters.

223
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,660
DREAM hasn’t given up

224
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,080
its ambition on FlowerPlus.

225
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,750
Now, everyone curses me

226
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,620
behind my back.

227
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,250
There’s no turning back.

228
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,500
Seems like I have no choice,

229
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,870
but to keep helping you.

230
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
But don’t worry.

231
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,620
I’ll spare no efforts

232
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,080
to work for you.

233
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,000
And I hope

234
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,580
you’ll keep your promise.

235
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,370
Rest assured.

236
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,500
William will keep his promise.

237
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,250
Mr. Wen.

238
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,950
As long as

239
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,830
you show us you can help,

240
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,700
you’ll not only get 20% of the stock

241
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,330
and the post of chairman.

242
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,950
We will also give you

243
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,580
an attractive reward

244
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,370
far beyond your expectation.

245
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,500
To me,

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,450
FlowerPlus is the best reward.

247
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,500
I’m confused.

248
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:56,990
Why do you insist on

249
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,700
possessing such a small

250
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,330
floriculture company?

251
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,790
That’s the story

252
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,790
between Bo Hai and me.

253
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,410
As for DREAM,

254
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,990
I believe,

255
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,330
we will be

256
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,200
the best partners.

257
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,080
Okay.

258
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,000
From now on,

259
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,370
we will start plan B

260
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,200
against FlowerPlus.

261
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,950
Fortunately, William knew

262
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,290
Bo Hai would strike back.

263
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,330
So,

264
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,200
he had a plan B.

265
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,040
Great news!

266
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,500
The Marketing Department is taking

267
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,660
publicity photos for Mr. Bo.

268
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,910
So?

269
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,450
What does it concern me?

270
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,000
I’m an emerging elite in the Marketing Department.

271
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,540
If you beg me,

272
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,330
I will

273
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,540
think about taking you to the headquarter

274
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
to see your idol.

275
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,290
Think about it.

276
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,910
Who bullied me again and again

277
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,290
the other day?

278
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,160
Luckily, I’m strong enough.

279
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,990
Don’t push your luck!

280
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,660
Yes. Yes.

281
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,950
Stop. Just go.

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,790
The manager is off duty today.

283
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,830
I’ll take cover for you.

284
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,540
Thank you, Qian!

285
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,120
Come on. You can’t get in without me.

286
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,660
Boss, cool!

287
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,620
So cool!

288
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,580
Well, let’s

289
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,990
have a provided situation

290
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,080
and make the poses.

291
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,950
All right?

292
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,290
Okay.

293
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,250
Do what I do.

294
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,700
Totally turn around.

295
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,910
Turn, turn around.

296
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,950
Face the wall.

297
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,700
- The wall? - Yes.

298
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,910
Now, imagine

299
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,330
you’re Prince Charming

300
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,120
in the mountains.

301
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,990
When I say three, two, one,

302
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,790
turn around.

303
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,200
All right? Let’s have a try.

304
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,000
Three, two, one. Turn!

305
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,870
Your arms are in wrong place.

306
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,580
Your left shoulder…

307
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,620
Keep it low.

308
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,790
Raise your face and smile.

309
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes. Your eyes are important.

310
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,620
Give a murderous look, understand?

311
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,500
Killing intent!

312
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
Murderous look! Killing intent!

313
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,200
Yes. Let’s try it again.

314
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,700
Come on. Get ready.

315
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,830
Come on. Three, two, one. Turn!

316
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,750
Seems like

317
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,950
we really need talent for something.

318
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,200
Why don’t we

319
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,500
hire the best photoshop guy

320
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,950
and simply take the photos?

321
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,000
Deduct my pay again?

322
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,160
It means okay!

323
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,080
Take it easy.

324
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,330
Don’t behave like

325
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,750
- you’re a thief. - Who do you mean thief?

326
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,410
Ling Lingqi?

327
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,080
Director.

328
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,120
Director.

329
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,120
Please sign this.

330
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,540
Bo Hai!

331
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,990
What are you doing?

332
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,700
Let me calm down.

333
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,870
I’m too excited!

334
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,660
You don’t look?

335
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,620
Let me describe him for you.

336
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,910
Bo Hai,

337
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,620
a man.

338
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,830
He looks

339
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,120
stocky.

340
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:07,790
That’s a perfect word

341
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,200
for him.

342
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,290
And he has a perfect figure as 1:1.

343
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,080
Feels like

344
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,500
he has tough power all over him.

345
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,660
His hands

346
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,080
are rough and strong,

347
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,120
just like hands of experienced farmers,

348
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,750
which can easily remove the wilted leaves.

349
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,830
Together with

350
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,120
his shiny hair

351
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,620
as if a calf licked.

352
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,290
He has total virile hormone,

353
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,120
caressing my face.

354
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,410
Take a look!

355
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,000
Sorry. Sorry.

356
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,250
Well…

357
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,000
A bird just flew past.

358
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,620
One left, one right.

359
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,370
Pick one and go!

360
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,700
Should I turn left or right?

361
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,450
Hello? Qi.

362
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,500
Where have you been?

363
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,450
Are you a rabbit?

364
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,750
Why are you gone so fast?

365
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,990
I think I’m lost.

366
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,040
Oh, dear.

367
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,370
Why can you get lost

368
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,200
in such a small place?

369
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,580
You really impress me!

370
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,990
No. I just…

371
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,250
I just passed a reference room.

372
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,330
- Reference room?
- And now I…

373
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,620
Listen to me.

374
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,500
The elevator is on your right.

375
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,450
Stand facing the reference room

376
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,580
and turn right.

377
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,950
Then turn left

378
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,160
at the second turning.

379
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,120
Reference room. Turn left…

380
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,660
Who are you?

381
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,790
Ling Lingqi from the Sales Department.

382
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:42,660
You’re a salesperson,

383
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,120
but why are you here

384
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,950
in working hours?

385
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,660
I come to see you.

386
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,700
You left your post, regardless of your duty.

387
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,990
You’re fired.

388
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,540
Mr. Bo.

389
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,250
I invited her here

390
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,410
for the research on

391
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,910
our advertising videos.

392
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,160
She just left

393
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,910
and went to the toilet.

394
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,290
Unexpectedly, she didn’t know the way

395
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,500
and got lost.

396
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,160
Could you stop staring at me?

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,790
Clean the storeroom after work.

398
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,580
Wake up!

399
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,870
Clean the storeroom after work!

400
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,080
I…

401
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,700
Bo Hai

402
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,120
is a real demon!

403
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,450
With a trumped-up charge,

404
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,540
he sent us here

405
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,450
for hard work.

406
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,200
He’s just strict, okay?

407
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,750
Ling Lingqi.

408
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,120
You really are a weirdo!

409
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,950
He abused you, but you applauded.

410
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,580
He’s the boss.

411
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,080
Shouldn’t he be strict with employees?

412
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,950
Fair enough.

413
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,700
Okay. You make sense.

414
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,790
You win!

415
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,000
I give up.

416
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,370
Qi…

417
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,540
Boss.

418
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,910
Coffee time.

419
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,830
Would you like to hear a gossip?

420
00:18:59,290 --> 00:18:59,910
What gossip?

421
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,580
That girl

422
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,830
applied to work for us

423
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,870
for three years.

424
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,160
She’s your fangirl.

425
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,370
So what?

426
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,290
I mean

427
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,450
you didn’t fire her.

428
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,540
Did you have sympathy

429
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,540
for her?

430
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,500
Am I that boring?

431
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,330
I’m a cool guy.

432
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,000
But no one likes me.

433
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,660
You look just so-so.

434
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,160
But a lot of girls like you.

435
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,500
What’s wrong with this world?

436
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,080
Forget it.

437
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,000
What a waste!

438
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,450
Bo Hai!

439
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,000
Xinyan!

440
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,370
Bo Hai.

441
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,620
I asked a friend in my hometown

442
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,160
to bring me the rare medicinal material.

443
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,500
You’ve been under great pressure.

444
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,580
Take some to improve your health.

445
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,540
But I don’t know how to cook it.

446
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,330
It’s simple.

447
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,700
Cook porridge or soup

448
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,290
with some.

449
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,790
Shall I cook it for you?

450
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,290
When it’s done,

451
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,370
I’ll send it to your office.

452
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,950
Okay?

453
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,410
What time is it?

454
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,290
I have a date. I’ll leave you alone.

455
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,120
Xinyan.

456
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,750
Well, I…

457
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,990
I’ve been weak, too.

458
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,000
Shall I have it

459
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,950
for Bo Hai?

460
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,040
Go to hell!

461
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,080
Xinyan.

462
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,160
Why are you so rude to me?

463
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,410
Hang in there!

464
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,830
Hang in there! Hang in there!

465
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,580
Look at you!

466
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I brought you all the way to see your Mr. Right.

467
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,000
Instead of chasing him,

468
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,790
you got me punished with you.

469
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,910
For the work,

470
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,250
you got hurt before you did much.

471
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,354
- I have to take care of the rest.
- It’s OK. It’s OK.

472
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,540
Done!

473
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,540
It was unwise of me.

474
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,750
I should have checked

475
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,080
the almanac or horoscope

476
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,370
before I left home.

477
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,370
Mo Nan.

478
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,330
From now on,

479
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,370
you’re my bestie

480
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,620
that I will never break up with.

481
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,410
Really?

482
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,660
Which one of us matters more,

483
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,990
Lu Baoni or me?

484
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,330
You, of course.

485
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,000
For today, at least.

486
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,450
All right. That’s enough.

487
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,450
Well, sit here.

488
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,080
I’ll do all the work.

489
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,250
Seriously?

490
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,080
Take a good rest.

491
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,370
Is it okay?

492
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,940
= 24-hour Convenience Store =

493
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,870
My head!

494
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,830
My head. Help me! Help me!

495
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,660
I can no longer hold it.

496
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,620
I don’t know

497
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,950
if I should tell you something.

498
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,040
Go ahead.

499
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,700
We’re besties.

500
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,870
We have no secrets.

501
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Well, I’m going to say it.

502
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,540
I haven’t

503
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,620
contacted Bo Hai.

504
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,790
But some colleagues tell me that

505
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,580
Bo Hai is never

506
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,870
a Mr. Right.

507
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,500
He’s a demon!

508
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,700
They say

509
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,500
he’s stubborn, picky

510
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,750
and merciless.

511
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,000
You know.

512
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,200
I didn’t believe them.

513
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,290
But when I saw

514
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,250
what he did to you,

515
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,250
I thought

516
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,200
maybe they were right.

517
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,160
I think

518
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,410
Bo Hai must have punished them.

519
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,250
That’s why they speak ill of him

520
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,330
behind his back.

521
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,370
No.

522
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,750
Do you know

523
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,450
Bo Hai’s nickname in the company?

524
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,990
Chomper!

525
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,950
The nightmare for all girls.

526
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,910
I don’t believe you.

527
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,040
You don’t know him.

528
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
Do you know him then?

529
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,450
Ling Lingqi.

530
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,080
I think

531
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,330
you have some misunderstanding

532
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,830
on the word “know”.

533
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,290
You win! Fangirl!

534
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,120
Is Bo Hai a good man

535
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,200
or a bad man?

536
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:11,830
Which one

537
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,750
is the real him?

538
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,120

545
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,160
His smile.

546
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,620
So sweet!

547
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,250
He’s obviously a susceptible prince.

548
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,620
What does Chomper concern him?

549
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,120
Ling Lingqi!

550
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,830
How can you suspect Bo Hai

551
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,620
like that?

552
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,500
Chomper?

553
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,250
Ling Lingqi.

554
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,370
Don’t you feel ashamed?

555
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,000
How can you get him wrong?

556
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,840

If you don’t explain clearly

563
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,250
about what happened,

564
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,200
you’ll never get over it.

565
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,500
Don’t move!

566
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,040
Do I allow you to move?

567
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,540
Ling Guoliang, you know what?

568
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,450
Let me tell you,

569
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,950
this is a matter of principle.

570
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,990
How many years have we been married?

571
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,200
Tell me how many years!

572
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,370
Tell me how many years!

573
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
25 years!

574
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,450
25 years! You know?

575
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,450
You’re making a lot of noise!

576
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,290
Yesterday

577
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,990
in our shop,

578
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,750
your dad

579
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,540
gave a discount to Li Lijun.

580
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,830
A discount, you know?

581
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,790
20% off!

582
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,790
He used to be

583
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,870
a tightfisted man.

584
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,160
If you gave a discount to everyone else,

585
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,990
I’m okay with that.

586
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,750
But why did you

587
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,580
give a discount to Li Lijun only?

588
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,620
That’s abnormal!

589
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,540
There must be something fishy!

590
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,950
Tell me! Is there?

591
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:19,750
Tell me!

592
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,370
Yesterday,

593
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,790
I was playing Chinese chess.

594
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,410
I lost three games in a row,

595
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,910
so I was very depressed.

596
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,790
Just then,

597
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,250
Li Lijun came for shopping.

598
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,790
You know her.

599
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,870
She won’t leave without a discount.

600
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,290
She chattered,

601
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,250
discount, discount.

602
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,790
She was making an awful din.

603
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,700
And it upset me a lot!

604
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,120
Then I said, “Okay, I’ll give you a discount.”

605
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,330
That’s the story.

606
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,370
You heard him, Qi?

607
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,990
Tell me who is right.

608
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,160
Isn’t your father

609
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,040
the ringleader

610
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,450
to break our family?

611
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,330
I think,

612
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,410
a man does something abnormal

613
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,540
when he is

614
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,620
rather upset.

615
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,080
For example, my boss was in a bad mood today.

616
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,580
He criticized me.

617
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,950
But I could understand.

618
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,290
See?

619
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,330
- Look! - Am I right?

620
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,660
Qi!

621
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,450
I want you to help me

622
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,750
and defend me!

623
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,660
What are you doing?

624
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,290
Why are you

625
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,830
helping your father instead?

626
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,040
I’m just telling the truth.

627
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,200
You two!

628
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,540
How dare you!

629
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,870
How dare you! Ridiculous!

630
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,950
How dare you!

631
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,370
Bo Hai must have been upset,

632
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,040
just like my father was.

633
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,910
It makes sense then!

634
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,200
I’m going to bed. Good night!

635
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,500
I heard you and Mo Nan

636
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,830
were punished by Mr. Bo yesterday?

637
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,290
Nonsense! Who told you that?

638
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,990
Stop pretending!

639
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,540
Mo Nan told me.

640
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,200
And he asked for a leave today,

641
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,620
because of exhaustion.

642
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,500
We just…

643
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,950
We just had bad luck.

644
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,580
Mr. Bo was in a bad mood yesterday.

645
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,950
If you think so,

646
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,660
he has never been

647
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,750
in a good mood.

648
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,620
Attention.

649
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:25,870
Tomorrow,

650
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,330
there’s a charity sale of bouquets.

651
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,950
Mr. Bo

652
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,450
picked our shop to do that.

653
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,120
Many guests and reporters

654
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
will come.

655
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,040
Gather your strength

656
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
for the charity sale

657
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,290
and don’t make trouble.

658
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,290
Okay.

659
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,990
Do the best you can.

660
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,580
Do you hear me?

661
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,370
Yes.

662
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,120
Manager.

663
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,990
Will Chomper…

664
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,290
I mean, will Mr. Bo come?

665
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,540
Sure, he will.

666
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,160
He designed the special bouquet

667
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,990
for the charity sale.

668
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,870
All right. Get back to work.

669
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,500
Baoni.

670
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,290
Baoni.

671
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,830
So sweet.

672
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:19,990
Baoni.

673
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,990
Look! Look!

674
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:29,990
Baoni.

675
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,750
Today, I come

676
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,870
to tell you that

677
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,910
it was my bad

678
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,870
for all the displeasure.

679
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,700
You know.

680
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:37,950
I’m really

681
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,080
a bit irritable.

682
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,250
I’m not romantic, either.

683
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,000
I care less for you and…

684
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,450
Enough. Get to the point.

685
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,120
Let’s stop bickering.

686
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,870
Shall we?

687
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,410
We’re not bickering.

688
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,580
We broke up!

689
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,580
I thought

690
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,620
you were kidding about that.

691
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,250
Chill out.

692
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,620
Think about it carefully.

693
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,330
In fact,

694
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,000
there is nothing we can’t solve

695
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,120
- between us. - There is.

696
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:03,830
What?

697
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,290
I have a new boyfriend.

698
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,580
Are you sure?

699
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,830
Who makes fun of that?

700
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,000
I don’t believe you.

701
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,540
Where are you going?

702
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,870
To the toilet!

703
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:28,990
Hello?

704
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,500
Why haven’t you come yet?

705
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,330
Hurry, or I’ll die.

706
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,500
You know what?

707
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,500
Later, you must

708
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,790
try your best.

709
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,750
Don’t be nervous.

710
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,450
Don’t be scared.

711
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,040
The Oscar award is

712
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,370
waving at you!

713
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,990
Come on!

714
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,580
Hurry!

715
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,870
You’re back?

716
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,160
Baoni.

717
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,700
When you were away

718
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,080
in the toilet,

719
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,290
I thought carefully about

720
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,330
our relationship.

721
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:10,790
After thinking it over,

722
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,370
I still believe I’m your best choice.

723
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
For example,

724
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,580
I have a good job,

725
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,370
a high degree,

726
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,040
and of course,

727
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,330
a handsome face.

728
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,370
So, I think we should…

729
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,200
Baoni.

730
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,410
Sorry to keep you waiting.

731
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,120
I just had a meeting.

732
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,330
Nice to meet you.

733
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,990
This is?

734
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,000
I’m Mo Nan, her boyfriend.

735
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,540
Sorry, I have kept you waiting.

736
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,080
Baoni told me

737
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,580
you work at Waterstone.

738
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,250
We are

739
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,200
the biggest investment bank in Asia.

740
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:13,950
I am

741
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,950
in full charge of

742
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,200
the investment in

743
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,500
AI, big data and VR

744
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
in the East China region.

745
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
What a coincidence!

746
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,540
I’m in charge of the regions

747
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,330
you just mentioned.

748
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,910
But I always stay

749
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,290
in the headquarter in Singapore.

750
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,700
No wonder I haven’t seen you.

751
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,790
Oh, I forgot to introduce him.

752
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,790
He works at Waterstone, too.

753
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,450
He’s in the headquarter.

754
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,620
Director.

755
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,660
Senior director.

756
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,160
Babe, do you really not care for

757
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,120
my identity?

758
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,120
You know.

759
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,500
Baoni doesn’t like to

760
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,950
talk about business.

761
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,750
She’s interested in gym.

762
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,580
And I am exactly

763
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,370
a member of a gym.

764
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,330
And we met each other

765
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,000
in the gym.

766
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,660
No wonder we like each other.

767
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,080
I like doing sports, too.

768
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
But you know.

769
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,580
I’m too busy at work now.

770
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,790
I have no time for that.

771
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,370
But when I was in colleague,

772
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,620
I continued to

773
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,870
be the champion for US Amateur Marathon

774
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,790
for three years.

775
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,700
To be honest,

776
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,540
I didn’t realize

777
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,700
I was fiddling about

778
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,990
and wasting my life

779
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,660
in the past

780
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,000
until I met Mo Nan.

781
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,200
Well,

782
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,910
I’ll leave you alone.

783
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,540
Okay.

784
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,000
May you live happily.

785
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:06,870
Thank you.

786
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,000
It’s yours.

787
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,450
= Mo Nan Three-peat of US Amateur Marathon =
Forget it.

788
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,140
= Mo Nan Three-peat of US Amateur Marathon =
I made it myself.

789
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,450
That was good, Mo Nan.

790
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,990
You really gave

791
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,500
a perfect performance.

792
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,120
Even I trusted you!

793
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,000
You bet!

794
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,250
When I was in colleague,

795
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,990
I was the backbone of drama club.

796
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,620
I won

797
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,700
the Best Walk-on.

798
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,080
I borrowed the suit.

799
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,120
The watch is a high-quality fake.

800
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,370
No one can tell it

801
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,290
unless he’s an expert.

802
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,620
What’s wrong, Qian?

803
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,500
I’ve never

804
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,700
taken care of cattleya.

805
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,120
The roots weren’t in the water.

806
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,790
And the flowers were withered.

807
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,950
But the charity sale

808
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,330
is tomorrow morning.

809
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
If Mr. Bo knows

810
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,580
I messed up with

811
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,450
his design,

812
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,080
he will certainly be furious!

813
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,910
Ling Lingqi.

814
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,450
What should I do?

815
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,830
Wait. Take it easy.

816
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,410
What are you doing?

817
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,910
I’m a salesperson.

818
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,990
But I signed up for

819
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,790
the florist recruitment.

820
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,990
We have no other way.

821
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,250
Let’s use these

822
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,620
to replace the cattleya.

823
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,580
What do you think?

824
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,000
They seem similar.

825
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,080
They have similar colors.

826
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,200
Thank you, Ling Lingqi.

827
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,370
Let’s do it then.

828
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,250
Come. Come with me.

829

say thank you.

862
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,330
Thank you for coming to

863
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,830
the charity sale

864
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,380
with benevolence.

865
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,950
We’ve been

866
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,950
keeping up with the children’s growth.

City Children’s Home.

876

Let’s welcome Mr. Bo

877
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,120
and the children.

878
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,700
Go up onto the stage. Go.

879
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,790
Be careful.

880
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,910
Come. Stand in line.

881
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,540
Next,

882
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,870
Mr. Bo and the children

883
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,250
will sing a song for you,

884
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,020

Mr. Bo.

898
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
This is our gift for you.

899
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,651
Thank you. Go have fun.

900
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,080
This is a happy and perfect moment

901
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,330
to show you

902
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,000
the theme bouquets

903
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,370
for this charity sale.

904
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,290
This type of bouquet

905
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,080
is designed by Mr. Bo,

906
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,620
known as Embrace of Love.

907
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,450
Let’s have Mr. Bo

908
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,780
give a speech.

909
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,000
He’s so cool.

910
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,620
These children,

911
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,500
standing here with me,

912
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,790
are from City Children’s Home.

913
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,660
We sell

914
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,200
the theme bouquets

915
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,540
to raise special fund

916
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,750
for them.

917
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,990
And most importantly,

918
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,750
to call on the whole society

919
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,870
to pay attention to and care for

920
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,250
these children.

921
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,790
- Wipe off the slaver.
- If you have time,

922
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,750
please visit the Children’s Home

923
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,580
and hug them.

924
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,950
Give them a hug,

925
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
so that they can feel

926
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,370
the arms of parents.

927
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,540
Hope your love

928
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,330
will soothe their broken hearts

929
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,750
and satisfy their broken feelings

930
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,790
just as flowers do.

931
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,080
Thank you.

932
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:48,980
Mr. Bo.

933
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,370
Doomed! Something wrong!

934
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,910
What happened?

935
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,660
I checked the flowers

936
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,910
before I left.

937
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:21,950
This…

938
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,500
Last night, I…

939
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,450
It was my fault.

940
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,290
Sorry.

941
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,120
I failed to keep the flowers well.

942
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,410
The cattleya

943
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,660
were rotten.

944
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,500
But the shop was closing

945
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,080
when I found that.

946
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,250
In case today’s event might be affected,

947
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,830
I made a decision without authorization

948
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,870
and replaced the cattleya.

949
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,410
That’s a good excuse.

950
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,910
Sorry, Mr. Bo.

951
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,200
I didn’t mean it.

952
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,120
I will never

953
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,950
make a mistake again.

954
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,540
Can you forgive me?

955
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,160
You’re fired.
