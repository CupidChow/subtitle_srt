51
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:47,792
Red.

52
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,083
Dull-red.

53
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,167
Pink.

54
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,334
This is rose red.

55
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:57,792
Pure pink.

56
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,209
Stop!

57
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:01,918
Bo Hai.

58
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,125
What do you think the chances are?

59
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,667
If I can recover my color vision

60
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,292
and make good use of the flowers,

61
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,417
I’ll lose the contest in a decent way, at least.

62
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,459
But you can’t just recover your color vision

63
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,584
as you wish.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,292
I’ll think it over. I will.

65
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,709
What Bo Hai just did proves

66
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,876
that our plan has worked.

67
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:37,209
Bo Hai

68
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,417
has natural fears to the fire.

69
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,042
He saw a psychiatrist.

70
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,709
He must have been terribly ill.

71
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,709
In the substitute incident,

72
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,292
he managed to get away.

73
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,459
But think carefully about it.

74
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,709
It can’t be a groundless rumor.

75
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,292
Now, we kind of

76
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,918
find out the reason.

77
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:01,834
Whatever secret

78
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:02,876
he is hiding,

79
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:03,834
the truth is

80
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,542
beginning to come out.

81
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,375
If I were Bo Hai,

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,834
in such a hopeless case,

83
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,542
I would give up a rook to save the king.

84
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,834
I’ll quit.

85
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,626
Quitting the competition

86
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:19,459
is the only solution.

87
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,209
Yeah.

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,918
Quitting the competition

89
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:22,959
will disgrace you a little bit,

90
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:23,918
and damage

91
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:24,918
the company’s reputation.

92
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,042
But it’ll be better

93
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,792
than a complete loss.

94
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,584
You would make such a choice,

95
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,334
but Bo Hai won’t.

96
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,209
He isn’t going to quit.

97
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:33,667
I’m not going to quit.

98
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:35,999
Like I said,

99
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:37,959
this International Floriculture Competition

100
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,292
is a gamble.

101
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,000
Since I’m in,

102
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,042
quitting means giving in.

103
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,584
If he quits the competition,

104
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:49,417
the media

105
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,250
will condemn him

106
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,125
both in speech and in writing

107
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,334
like sharks chasing after blood smell.

108
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:58,999
By then,

109
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,292
no suppliers, distributors or investors

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,459
dare to cooperate with him.

111
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,000
Quitting seems to help with the competition,

112
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,042
but turns out to be a complete loss.

113
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,209
Quitting seems to be a solution.

114
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:18,209
But it’s in fact a road to ruin.

115
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,000
If I were Bo Hai,

116
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,125
I’d rather

117
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,167
risk my company and career

118
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,375
for a chance!

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,375
Since I’m stuck in despair,

120
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,209
I can’t get out of it

121
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:33,959
unless I fight a way out.

122
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:40,083
Xinyan, go back

123
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:40,876
and prepare

124
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:41,876
a proposal for PR in crisis.

125
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:42,999
You must

126
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,167
do the proposal personally.

127
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,083
Sure.

128
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,667
I won’t use it

129
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:47,584
until I have to.

130
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:48,834
Keep this a secret

131
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,709
among us three only.

132
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,250
Okay.

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,834
What about Ling Lingqi?

134
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,417
Don’t tell her!

135
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,751
Bo Hai told us

136
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,083
Ling Lingqi was talented

137
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,334
in the floriculture.

138
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,375
She’s especially excellent

139
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,542
in matching colors.

140
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:07,999
How about this, Bo Hai?

141
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,709
This time,

142
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,125
ask her to work in the competition

143
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,042
as your assistant.

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,834
It’s a heaven-sent

145
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,000
plan B for us.

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,209
Don’t get her involved.

147
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:16,667
Why?

148
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,083
We’re in an emergency!

149
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,709
I said! I don’t need her help.

150
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:23,459
Well, forget it.

151
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:33,501
Do me a favor.

152
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:37,584
Write down

153
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:38,709
colors and features of flowers

154
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,250
on this note book.

155
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,999
Record the colors with exact

156
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,959
lightness and saturation.

157
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:45,626
Mark

158
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:46,834
the type of flowers,

159
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,542
and make a detailed record of

160
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:50,292
shapes and colors,

161
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,792
especially stems and leaves.

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,375
Okay.

163
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,667
You may start.

164
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:54,918
Qi.

165
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,209
Come and tell us

166
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,501
what happened in the flower shed.

167
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:58,542
Yeah.

168
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,209
Mr. Bo picked the flowers poorly.

169
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,959
There must be an explanation behind it.

170
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,125
I’m sure you know it.

171
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:04,292
Hurry and tell us.

172
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,125
I’m a mere assistant.

173
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,876
What explanation do I know?

174
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,417
No explanation?

175
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:10,667
I don’t believe

176
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,083
that was what Mr. Bo could really do.

177
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,834
The live broadcast

178
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,876
was worse than expected.

179
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,250
There’s something far worse!

180
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:20,834
You just didn’t see that.

181
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,375
Who is Bo Hai’s assistant?

182
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,542
Hello. I am.

183
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:25,042
Well,

184
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,999
these are attentions

185
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:27,792
for the final.

186
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:28,459
Have a look.

187
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:29,250
Okay. Thank you.

188
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,999
What… What do you want?

189
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,751
Oh, the organizing committee gave me

190
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:54,959
the attentions for the final.

191
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:56,709
I’m giving them to Mr. Bo.

192
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,834
What are you doing? So mysterious.

193
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:03,999
Well…

194
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,083
What’s wrong?

195
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:07,834
What else do you want?

196
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:12,876
You’re doing little tricks

197
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,250
in the lounge again?

198
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,125
Awesome.

199
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,375
This is International
Floriculture Competition, dude.

200
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,334
No. No. Don’t talk nonsense.

201
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,918
You won’t help us.

202
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,083
If you have nothing to ask,

203
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:23,999
you may leave.

204
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:26,999
Go!

205
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:27,667
All right.

206
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:33,999
There must be a secret, huh?

207
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:38,292
Be careful!

208
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:42,667
You!

209
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,667
Red pearl roses.

210
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,709
Are these red pearl roses?

211
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,709
Yes. Red.

212
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,459
Are these the same flowers?

213
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,542
This is a pink rose, flesh pink.

214
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,501
Pink rose, flesh pink.

215
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:05,709
These are different colors.

216
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:06,959
It has pink rims.

217
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,709
What’s the difference?

218
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,292
The flesh pink rose has bigger petals.

219
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:13,751
This one has smaller ones.

220
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,667
Yes. Testing me?

221
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:45,876
Qi, let’s go.

222
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,334
The free escort service

223
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,167
is ready for you.

224
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:50,083
Doomed.

225
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,209
I forgot to clean up the kit.

226
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:53,834
If Chomper knows,

227
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:54,959
he’ll certainly have endocrine disorder.

228
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,918
I must go back.

229
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,501
Let me go with you.

230
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,375
No. No. No. Baoni.

231
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,959
She needs an escort.

232
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,209
Wait a sec. Hurry.

233
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,626
Hurry.

234
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,125
Well, Baoni will go with you.

235
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,125
Hurry. Hurry up.

236
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:08,792
What about you?

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,167
I’m going back

238
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:11,542
to see Chomper.

239
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:13,459
Hurry. Go!

240
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:20,959
How could I forget to

241
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,876
clean up the kit?

242
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:24,918
Oh, dear.

243
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,542
Rhodes rose, high saturation.

244
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,042
Flowering index, 3. Yellow.

245
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,542
Rhodes rose, high saturation.

246
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,501
Flowering index, 3.

247
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,459
Stem is 70cm long.

248
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,792
Rhodes rose.

249
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,626
Master carnation.

250
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,125
Rhodes rose.

251
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,584
Rhodes rose.

252
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,667
Master carnation. Red.

253
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,501
Master carnation. Red.

254
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,999
Stem is 70cm long.

255
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:14,292
Master carnation. Red.

256
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,999
Master carnation. Red.

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,584
It is purple.

258
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,667
What the hell is he doing?

259
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,125
Lascaru green carnation.

260
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,834
Lascaru green carnation.

261
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:37,918
Carnation.

262
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,042
Boss, have some coffee first.

263
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,501
Put it there.

264
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:51,375
What the hell is going on?

265
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,250
Why does Mr. Bo

266
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,083
suddenly fail to distinguish the colors?

267
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:53,667
Stop asking.

268
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,542
I won’t tell you, anyway.

269
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,292
Whatever you saw,

270
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,042
please pretend that you didn’t see it.

271
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,792
Do you think I won’t know

272
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:57,834
just because you don’t tell me?

273
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:58,751
Does Bo Hai…

274
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,751
Is he color blind?

275
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:17,918
It doesn’t make sense.

276
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:19,667
In the pre-competition this morning,

277
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:20,792
he was all right.

278
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,501
He is not complete color blind.

279
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,584
He has intermittent illness.

280
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,000
Since you see it through,

281
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:27,667
let me tell you.

282
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,334
Twenty years ago,

283
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,000
he was caught in a big fire.

284
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:33,792
It was fierce.

285
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,125
Mercifully,

286
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:38,417
he finally survived

287
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,292
the fire.

288
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:40,792
But he has had

289
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,959
a great psychological toll.

290
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,959
When he sees the fire,

291
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,125
his color blindness will relapse.

292
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,125
To ordinary guys,

293
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,042
this isn’t

294
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,334
a big real.

295
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:52,542
But to Bo Hai,

296
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,125
the matchless

297
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,834
florist in China,

298
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,083
it’s a deadly weapon

299
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,876
that will destroy his future.

300
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:06,459
That explains

301
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,918
why he hires a substitute

302
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,417
when he’s skilled in the floriculture.

303
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,501
We didn’t have a choice,

304
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,626
but to hire a substitute.

305
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,000
We were never

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,250
morally corrupt.

307
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,250
You really get him wrong.

308
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:25,250
Help me!

309
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:27,709
Help me!

310
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:28,959
Help me!

311
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:52,999
You said

312
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,501
you were never in a relationship.

313
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,876
If girls like you,

314
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,626
has any of them chased you?

315
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,751
I don’t know. I don’t think so.

316
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:02,501
Has any?

317
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,709
How do I know?

318
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,375
Bestie.

319
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,542
Can’t you just make up stories

320
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:10,918
to lie to me

321
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:11,834
and make me happy?

322
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,334
Oh, Lu Baoni.

323
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,167
You really are a startling

324
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,042
weirdo.

325
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:18,501
What?

326
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:20,626
Nothing.

327
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,334
I’m home.

328
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,959
I’m getting in.

329
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,000
Bye-bye.

330
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:27,501
Good night.

331
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:27,999
Good night.

332
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,083
Go to bed early.

333
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,340
= Sanxin Home =

334
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,792
Mr. Mo, you really

335
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:00,999
look awful lately.

336
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:02,334
Recently,

337
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,792
you’ve been exhausted.

338
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,834
This is the most challenging acquisition project

339
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,584
since I ever worked.

340
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:12,999
After we complete it,

341
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,709
I’ll ask William

342
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,125
to reward you.

343
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,125
But I don’t

344
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:20,751
feel as easy as I think

345
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:21,459
it would be.

346
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:23,292
Why?

347
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:28,542
Maybe I don’t want to lose

348
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,834
such a good opponent as Bo Hai.

349
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,000
Or maybe,

350
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,792
things will not go

351
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:35,918
as smoothly as we think.

352
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,125
Your concern is misplaced.

353
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:40,167
Considering what happened today,

354
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,292
tomorrow’s final

355
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,792
will be the death knell for

356
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:44,417
Bo Hai and FlowerPlus.

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,626
We’re sure to win.

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,792
Hope so.

359
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,042
Tonight is

360
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,667
going to be a sleepless night.

361
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,250
Let me help you.

362
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,918
Doomed! Doomed!

363
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:28,083
Bo Hai warned me

364
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,083
not to tell Ling Lingqi!

365
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,250
Not to tell her!

366
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,834
Why did I have a loose tongue?

367
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,959
But I don’t think

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,876
she will tell others

369
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,083
indiscriminately.

370
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,834
That’s not important.

371
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:46,417
The point is

372
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,584
how we can win tomorrow’s final.

373
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,209

Mr. Zhang.

411
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,334
Mr. Zhang, what brings you here?

412
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:34,918
How can I not come?

413
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,083
Today’s result

414
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,250
concerns our orders

415
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,125
for exhibitions

416
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,417
in the next three years.

417
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,083
Yes. Yes.

418
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:43,834
I saw the rebroadcast yesterday.

419
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:47,792
Your boss picked flowers in a unique way.

420
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,542
Seems like

421
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,626
he’s going to win by a surprise move.

422
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:55,709
Well. I’m getting in.

423
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:56,083
Okay. Okay.

424
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:09,000
Mr. Wen.

425
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,042
Mr. Wen, what a surprise!

426
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,709
You’re not only good at acquisition,

427
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,542
but also

428
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:17,876
interested in the business.

429
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,501
Don’t make fun of me.

430
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,083
I come to learn from Mr. Bo.

431
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,167
Today,

432
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,542
I’ve invited

433
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,042
many familiar media friends

434
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,000
to write the reports for Mr. Bo.

435
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,334
If I don’t come,

436
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,501
they will fail to write.

437
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,125
Xinyan.

438
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,125
Getting angry with such a jerk

439
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:44,834
is insulting our mind.

440
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:51,250
Through the creation

441
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,959
over the whole morning,

442
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:54,999
all competitors and their assistants

443
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,751
have completed the bouquet

444
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:57,959
for the final’s theme,

445
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:59,751
My Most Unforgettable Memory.

446
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,083
The jury will

447
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,250
give a mark

448
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,751
on each bouquet,

449
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,375
from shape, model, balance,

450
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,751
color matching, skill and handwork,

451
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,501
based on the originality

452
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,209
and usability.

453
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,250
Everybody, here we are

454
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,209
at the exciting moment.

455
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,250
Let’s enjoy

456
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,584
the beautiful floriculture world

457
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,584
the competitors have created.

458
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,334
Please.

459
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,501
Mr. Bo, you did a very good job.

460
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:23,751
Thank you.

461
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:24,667
Your bouquet

462
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:25,918
isn’t colorful.

463
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,125
But I find it more concise

464
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:29,000
and mind-blowing.

465
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:29,834
Thank you.

466
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,167
It’s really unique!

467
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,584
The colors you see

468
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,375
are the true colors.

469
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,417
Since you can only see

470
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,209
three colors as

471
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,375
black, white and grey,

472
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,250
why don’t you use them

473
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,167
to make a bouquet?

474
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,542
Mr. Bo’s bouquet

475
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,709
is skillfully made.

476
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,999
It has excellent visual balance, figure

477
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:11,918
and lingering charm.

478
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:14,250
And it’s creative.

479
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:15,876
However,

480
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,250
in terms of colors,

481
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:21,417
he only used black, white and grey.

482
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,125
Regarding this,

483
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,334
I have a different opinion.

484
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:25,792
There are more ways

485
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:26,626
to express the visual appeal

486
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,999
than a colorful bouquet.

487
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:29,918
Black, white and grey

488
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,250
also give a strong visual impact.

489
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,667
Mr. Bo’s bouquet

490
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,751
proved that.

491
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,667
But yesterday afternoon,

492
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Mr. Bo picked colorful flowers

493
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,584
in the flower shed.

494
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:44,209
Did you adopt the manufacturing process

495
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,834
for immortal flowers?

496
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,834
Ms. Simpson and I think

497
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,042
he might have violated

498
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:56,667
the competition rules.

499
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:29,334
Everybody.

500
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,042
Since I was born,

501
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,000
I’ve been an introverted

502
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:39,584
and serious guy.

503
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:42,959
I’m reserved and dull.

504
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,000
Never do I share my private life

505
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,918
to anyone else.

506
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,834
But the floriculture is an exception.

507
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,918
Only when I make bouquets

508
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:55,918
can I express my true feelings

509
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:57,667
without restraint.

510
00:24:58,999 --> 00:24:59,876
So, today,

511
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,459
I want to share you

512
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,209
my most unforgettable memory

513
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,459
with my bouquet.

514
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:11,834
That was a big fire

515
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,792
twenty years ago.

516
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:15,417
The fire

517
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,584
nearly ruined everything of mine.

518
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,709
Since then,

519
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,334
my childhood was filled with

520
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:26,959
a lot of dull and miserable memories

521
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,999
though it should have been colorful.

522
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,167
That’s why

523
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,250
I used the process of immortal flowers

524
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,918
to make the bouquet.

525
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,584
Make the flowers lose their natural color

526
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,751
and become the color of my memory

527
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:48,792
in the mind,

528
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:51,626
so that they will

529
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:54,918
be remained for long,

530
00:25:58,334 --> 00:25:59,876
just like my memory.

531
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:07,584
I never forget it for twenty years.

532
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:14,999
I create the bouquet

533
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,709
based on the black and white firework

534
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:20,792
in the night sky.

535
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,334
It looks beautiful,

536
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:27,751
but it makes people

537
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:28,626
feel painful and lonely.

538
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,167
That’s my most unforgettable memory.

539
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,584
You didn’t know that, either?

540
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:29,876
I didn’t.

541
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,042
I don’t know much about floriculture.

542
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,959
But from his bouquet,

543
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,709
I could feel his pain.

544
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,334
He’s a real master.

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,334
Competitors of this year

546
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,792
are excellent.

547
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:03,626
After a long and heated discussion,

548
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:05,501
the jury finally

549
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:07,751
reached to an agreement.

550
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:10,626
Well, who will win

551
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,417
the champion trophy?

552
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,501
Let me announce the result.

553
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,751
The winner

554
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,584
goes to Mr. Jack Stone

555
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:27,999
from the UK.

556
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,209
Maybe,

557
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:55,918
some of you are surprised.

558
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,834
But we’re sorry to say that

559
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,417
the competition has a rule that

560
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,459
all competing bouquets

561
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,417
must be made with fresh flowers.

562
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,375
Mr. Bo’s bouquet

563
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,125
has violated the rule.

564
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:10,417
Even though,

565
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,250
his bouquet still moved

566
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,042
most people at present, including me.

567
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:17,209
So, after the discussion,

568
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,125
the jury decide to award Mr. Bo

569
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,292
with the Special Award.

570
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:51,959
Besides,

571
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,999
as the Chinese florist

572
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:56,042
who did the best

573
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,751
in this competition,

574
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,292
our special sponsor,

575
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:01,667
Aoteng Group,

576
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:03,709
will award Mr. Bo

577
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,334
with the flower orders for exhibitions

578
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,792
of the next three years.

579
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:08,626
Let’s welcome Mr. Zhang.

580
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:28,999
Congratulations on your excellent performance

581
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:29,918
in today’s final.

582
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,000
That was amazing!

583
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,792
This contract belongs to you.

584
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,959
I bring it to you.

585
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,459
And I have signed it.

586
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:38,999
Hope you will make greater achievements

587
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,999
in the future.

588
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:45,334
Thank you.

589
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,417
Thank you, the jury.

590
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:55,876
Thank you, the audience.

591
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,209
Three, two, one.

592
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:28,417
Okay.

593
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,959
Bo Hai has mental problems indeed.

594
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:35,918
A nurse at the psychology department says

595
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,042
he suffers from

596
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,542
nervousness, agrypnia and dreaminess.

597
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:40,834
It will bring no influence on his life

598
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,417
through the psychotherapy.

599
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,334
The mental problem is junk.

600
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:48,626
I thought it would be

601
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:50,667
a deadly weapon to kick Bo Hai out.

602
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:55,083
Unexpectedly, we helped him!

603
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,792
I begin to appreciate him.

604
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,626
Mr. Mo. We’ve been

605
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,999
fooling around by him.

606
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,167
He can’t be a good opponent

607
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:14,834
unless he makes me truly appreciate him.

608
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,626
If he were a fragile enemy,

609
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,042
he would be

610
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:21,918
wasting my time.

611
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,250
This acquisition project

612
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,667
took the longest time

613
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,584
since I worked.

614
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,918
But Bo Hai and FlowerPlus

615
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,209
deserve that.

616
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:34,501
I just fear

617
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,167
you will also lose,

618
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:38,417
though you haven’t ever lost before.

619
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,209
Then our DREAM

620
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:44,959
will be totally humiliated.

621
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,375
Only the cleverest cat

622
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,334
lets the rat run away again and again.

623
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,250
Only when the cat gets bored,

624
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,751
it will bite the rat’s neck immediately.

625
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,125
That’s the fun for hunting.

626
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:03,542
I really expect that.

627
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:06,584
Mr. Bo.

628
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:06,999
Excuse me. Excuse me.

629
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:07,584
Make way.

630
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,042
Excuse me. Excuse me.

631
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:08,584
Where did you get

632
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:09,417
this inspiration?

633
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:09,834
Mr. Bo.

634
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:10,375
Could you give

635
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,334
an acceptance speech?

636
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,083
Who do you want to thank most?

637
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:12,792
Excuse me. Excuse me.

638
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:13,501
Make way. Make way.

639
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:14,459
Could you tell us how you feel?

640
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:14,876
Could you tell us

641
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:15,375
your rank in the international industry?

642
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:15,792
Sorry.

643
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:16,250
Excuse me. Excuse me.

644
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,459
Mr. Bo, say something.

645
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:19,125
Say something, Mr. Bo.

646
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,292
Say something, Mr. Bo.

647
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:20,834
Wait a minute.

648
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,626
Sorry. Sorry.

649
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:22,125
Mr. Bo.

650
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:22,709
Please answer the questions.

651
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,709
Sorry, he can’t take the interview now.

652
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:25,918
I’m the spokeswoman of FlowerPlus.

653
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:27,501
If you have questions,

654
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:28,834
I’m glad to

655
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,167
cooperate with you.

656
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,834
Boss, I saw nothing!

657
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,417
It’s not what you think it is!

658
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:35,667
I think nothing of it.

659
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,626
Ask Zhang to drive her home.

660
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:40,709
Okay.

661
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:58,751
Thread it like this?

662
00:34:59,125 --> 00:34:59,792
Pineapple knit is nice.

663
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:00,709
Isn’t it?

664
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:01,083
It looks nice.

665
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,501
And the color is good.

666
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,542
So it is.

667
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:06,667
I think so.

668
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:14,999
Look!

669
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,792
What a nice car!

670
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:16,167
Yeah.

671
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,167
Who?

672
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:21,292
A limo!

673
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,626
Qi!

674
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:27,626
Qi!

675
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,042
Mom!

676
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:28,375
Qi!

677
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,250
Aren’t you at work?

678
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,292
And you are…

679
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:33,000
Hello, aunt.

680
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,334
I’m Mr. Bo’s driver.

681
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:35,751
Last night, Ling Lingqi

682
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,042
was working overtime with Mr. Bo.

683
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:38,667
He asked me to drive her home.

684
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,167
Working with Mr. Bo?

685
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:42,417
I got it wrong.

686
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:43,918
I thought she worked with you.

687
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,125
You drove her back.

688
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:46,626
Thank you for that. Thank you.

689
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:47,626
Thank you.

690
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:48,876
See you. Bye-bye.

691
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:52,709
She came back in Mr. Bo’s limo!

692
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,918
See you, aunt.

693
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:56,626
You don’t take me home now?

694
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:04,834
Wait! I have something to ask you.

695
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,125
Are you my real mother?

696
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,042
If I weren’t,

697
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,375
why would I bother

698
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,792
about your business?

699
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,501
Sit still.

700
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,167
Tell me the truth.

701
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,250
What did you do with Bo Hai

702
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:16,292
last night?

703
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:17,999
Worked.

704
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:19,292
Nonsense.

705
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,167
Then why didn’t you answer the phone

706
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,209
when your dad called you?

707
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,167
The battery was dead.

708
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:29,417
You made sense.

709
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,292
How many people worked last night?

710
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,459
What did you do?

711
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:38,417
Yes, worked.

712
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:41,459
I think

713
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,459
working overtime like you

714
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,792
is just a trap.

715
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:46,959
At first,

716
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:49,417
you do something serious

717
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:50,375
and talk about work.

718
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,959
Then you will slowly get to the point.

719
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:56,999
You’ll have a romantic moment.

720
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:01,375
Qi.

721
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:04,334
Were you just working,

722
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,626
instead of anything else?

723
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,417
What… what the hell!

724
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,542
If I were Bo Hai,

725
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,125
I don’t think

726
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,250
I would have a crush on you.

727
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:39,083
Boss, was the idea of immortal flowers

728
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,709
really from Ling Lingqi?

729
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:44,667
Well, she was good!

730
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:46,000
No wonder you spared no effort

731
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,834
to train her.

732
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,417
Yeah. I didn’t expect her

733
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:51,876
to come up with

734
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,167
such a great trick.

735
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:55,876
Ling Lingqi

736
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:57,709
is just like a flower,

737
00:37:58,334 --> 00:37:59,542
ready to blossom.

738
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:00,667
I saw her

739
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,918
blossoming many times.

740
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,792
But when she

741
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:05,459
really blossoms,

742
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,375
she will still bring me

743
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,626
surprise and movement.

744
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,709
What a romantic

745
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,501
metaphor!

746
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,042
You’re too dramatic?

747
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,584
Aren’t you dramatic, too?

748
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,918
Well, I’ll leave you alone.

749
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,083
I think you should get cured

750
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:26,876
as soon as possible.

751
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:28,209
The competition is finished.

752
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,667
Why don’t you see a doctor as soon as possible?

753
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:30,501
But…

754
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,501
My eyes are okay.

755
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,125
Okay? So fast?

756
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,751
If I remember it correctly,

757
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,292
this is the shortest time

758
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,292
it takes to recover.

759
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:44,000
Wait.

760
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,542
You managed to recover sooner

761
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,250
in recent times.

762
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,042
And there were no such changes

763
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,667
until you met Ling Lingqi.

764
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,000
A coincidence, I guess.

765
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,167
She’s not a doctor.

766
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,417
Why isn’t she a doctor?

767
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,083
She majored in medicine.

768
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:05,542
Veterinary medicine.

769
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,375
I laughed at her.

770
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,918
When she came for the interview,

771
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,000
I said a vet for a floriculture company?

772
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,667
That was hilarious.

773
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,000
But she kind of

774
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,542
gives play to her knowledge

775
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,626
on you.

776
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:20,834
Get out!

777
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,083
What are you doing, boss?

778
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:24,876
You’re too impulsive.

779
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:26,667
I mean,

780
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,167
in vets’ eyes,

781
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:29,876
you are nearly the same

782
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:30,501
as animals.

783
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,959
The competition is over.

784
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:56,167
What we have achieved

785
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,417
can be satisfactory.

786
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:58,792
Next,

787
00:39:58,792 --> 00:39:59,959
all departments shall

788
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:00,999
focus on work

789
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,792
and business again.

790
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:02,918
Hope you can

791
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,792
work harder

792
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,417
to turn the result of this competition

793
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,417
into the competitive edge.

794
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:09,999
Besides,

795
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,083
I’m going to

796
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:13,959
award an employee.

797
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,501
In this competition,

798
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:17,918
my assistant Ling Lingqi

799
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,250
gave me

800
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,709
a very useful suggestion.

801
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,042
Some of my inspiration

802
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,459
came from her.

803
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,125
From now on,

804
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:28,417
Ling Lingqi will work in the Design Department

805
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:31,125
as an official florist.

806
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:35,334
Mr. Bo, normally,

807
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:36,626
a new recruit

808
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,000
can’t be a florist

809
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,667
without a six-month internship.

810
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,584
What’s more, Ling Lingqi

811
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:43,292
was hired as a salesperson.

812
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,042
So, I don’t think…

813
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:46,999
I don’t agree, either.

814
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:48,709
It’s against the rule.

815
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,042
In our company’s history,

816
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:50,999
no one has been

817
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:52,125
specially promoted like that.

818
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:53,417
She’s specially promoted

819
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,999
just because she made

820
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:57,125
the greatest achievement

821
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,000
no one else has done.

822
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,501
That’s settled, then.

823
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,292
Dismiss.

824
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,584
What’s wrong with Bo Hai?

825
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,083
We all opposed.

826
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,250
But he insisted

827
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,626
and totally disrespected us.

828
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,417
We didn’t all oppose.

829
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,792
Since Bo Hai established the company,

830
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:27,584
he has been fair and strict.

831
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,083
But he specially promoted Ling Lingqi.

832
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,334
What will employees think of him?

833
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,667
Those gossipy guys

834
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,584
will make up romantic rumors.

835
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:35,334
What should we do?

836
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,792
Isn’t that good to have

837
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,834
romantic rumors for a cold man?

838
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,792
Anyway, the title of Chomper

839
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:41,918
isn’t good as well.

840
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,918
Chen Mo, which side are you on?

841
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,667
On your side, of course.

842
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:48,626
The new green tea flavor.

843
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:50,542
Have one and calm down.

844
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:54,417
Are you nuts?

845
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:56,834
In two months,

846
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,334
she’s promoted from the sales trainee

847
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:01,876
to a florist.

848
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,792
Just like taking a rocket.

849
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:04,959
That’s so fast!

850
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:05,999
Yeah.

851
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:08,250
Is Ling Lingqi really that skillful?

852
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:09,626
I don’t believe that.

853
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:10,751
Me neither.

854
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:11,834
Mr. Bo

855
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,042
must have lost his mind.

856
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,167
What the hell are you talking about?

857
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,792
She’s my good friend.

858
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,459
She has real power!
