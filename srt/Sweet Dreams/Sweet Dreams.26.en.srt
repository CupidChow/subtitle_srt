Hello.

52
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:43,918
What can I do for you?

53
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:44,542
Hello.

54
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:45,999
I heard something went wrong

55
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,876
with your dream bracelets.

56
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:49,959
So I want to know

57
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,250
what happened exactly?

58
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:53,999
The specific condition of our dream bracelets

59
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:54,999
can only be provided

60
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,709
for users.

61
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,167
Yes, I am a user.

62
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,292
May I have your name please?

63
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,125
My surname is Chen. I am Chen Mo.

= Chen Mo - User Info =

65
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,626
But according to our information,

66
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,918
Chen Mo is a male.

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,834
I was joking.

68
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,834
My name is Ling Lingqi, Ling Lingqi.

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,125
Please check.

70
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:23,709
Miss Ling,

71
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,292
please show your ID card.

72
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,918
We need to check the information.

73
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,292
ID card?

74
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,375
I forget to bring it.

75
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:38,501
Please

76
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:40,334
make an exception for me.

77
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,042
I will get it and

78
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,042
show it to you next time.

79
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,209
Sorry.

80
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,000
If we cannot check your identification,

81
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,167
we cannot tell you the use information

If you have any questions,

84
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,083
please email us.

85

89
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,501
Okay, thanks.

90
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,626
Bo Hai.

91
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,250
What?

92
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,000
Actually I…

93
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:44,667
What’s wrong?

94
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,000
I got sand in my eye.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,999
I’m going back to work.

96
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,959
Stop. I’m exhausted.

97
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,000
Let me have some water.

98
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:08,999
No water for you.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Give me your cellphone.

100
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:10,999
Why?

101
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,083
Someone complains that

102
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,042
you secretly shot a beauty intern.

103
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,167
The impact is very bad.

104
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:15,375
I need to check your phone.

105
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,501
Rumor. Totally a rumor.

106
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,459
Check it.

107
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,167
Check whatever you want.

108
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:20,876
If you can

109
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:21,709
find anything,

110
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,792
I’ll change my surname to yours.

111
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,292
What?

112
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,167
A cute face like this,

113
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,000
lack of selfie would be a crime.

114
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,792
Secretary Chen.

115
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,125
This document needs your signature.

116
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:48,999
Go.

117
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:57,417
Pen?

118
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,834
Yes, pen.

119
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:08,417
Well,

120
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,292
here is another one.

121
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,792
Another one?

122
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:26,959
Secretary…

123
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,000
Another one again?

124
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,292
No.

125
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,459
Nothing, right?

126
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,959
I wronged you.

127
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,834
A good moral quality like mine.

128
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,334
But I suggest

129
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,751
you should be careful

130
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,292
and avoid unnecessary misunderstanding.

131
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,000
Got it?

132
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,000
What did I do

133
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,876
to cause unnecessary misunderstanding?

134
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:20,083
What happened? Staring blankly alone.

135
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:23,876
Mo Nan.

136
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,542
I decided to come clean to Bo Hai.

137
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,000
You know if you tell him the truth,

138
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,999
he won’t forgive you.

139
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,042
Still going to tell him?

140
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,792
Because I just realized

141
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,125
all I thought about was,

142
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:41,999
if I told him,

143
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:43,250
whether I’d be forgiven,

144
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,999
or get hurt.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,542
But now I know that

146
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:51,042
if I continue to conceal this,

147
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,083
the only one that’ll get hurt will be Bo Hai.

148
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,999
If I choose to lie,

149
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:00,000
maybe this kind of life

150
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,959
will continue to work for a while.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,751
But if one day

152
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,083
the truth comes out,

153
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:08,999
the hurt Bo Hai gets

154
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:10,792
will be much worse than

155
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,792
I tell him the truth now.

156
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,918
So I won’t lie anymore.

157
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,792
More importantly,

158
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,125
I don’t want to lie to the one I like.

159
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,250
There is no magic medicine for love.

160
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:52,375
Disparage not

161
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,167
the faith thou dost not know.

162
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,542
Lest, to thy peril,

163
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,709
thou aby it dear.

164
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,459
Hand over the medicine.

165
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,125
Come and get it yourself.

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,125
Lysander, go!

167
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,876
You worked so hard to get it.

168
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,375
Why did you destroy it?

169
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,626
I took it because

170
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,792
I wanted to destroy it.

171
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,999
Love looks not with the eyes,

172
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,083
but with the mind.

173
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,209
And therefore is winged Cupid

174
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,501
painted blind.

175
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,709
Even is Love said to be a child,

176
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:55,667
because in choice

177
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,584
he is so oft

178
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,042
beguiled.

179
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,584
If a mere bottle of potion

180
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,209
can control love,

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,125
this must be the biggest

182
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,459
and funniest lie in the world.

183
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,209
Deception…

184
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:18,417
Deception

185
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,834
may not be his intention.

186
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,667
What if he has regretted it?

187
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,417
For the sake of Cupid,

188
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,167
could you forgive

189
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,417
this poor man?

190
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,209
Deception is deception.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,918
A lie

192
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,375
will not be truth, no matter how pretty

193
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:31,792
it looks.

194
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,250
People who lie

195
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,375
will never be forgiven.

196
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,501
Deception and betrayal

197
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:51,667
are the most hateful kinds of sins

198
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,959
that can be imagined.

199
00:10:58,999 --> 00:10:59,792
Betrayal

200
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,417
means disrupting the order

201
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,792
and entering the unknown.

202
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,626
And the most terrifying betrayal

203
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,459
comes from

204
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,334
the closest people around you.

205
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,501
The unprepared deception

206
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,876
will make you

207
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,667
fall into hell.

208
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:44,375
Bo Hai, wait.

209
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,209
I need to talk to you.

210
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,125
What’s wrong?

211
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:50,417
Come here.

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,751
You can talk now.

213
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,751
The thing I’m going to tell

214
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,292
might piss you off.

215
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:01,459
That serious?

216
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:03,375
But,

217
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,501
let me remind you first.

218
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,167
I did it

219
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,042
all by myself.

220
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:06,999
So don’t blame

221
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,417
others, please.

222
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,167
What exactly did

223
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,375
you do to me?

224
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:18,918
I’ve been…

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,626
Mr. Bo.

226
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:24,042
Mr. Bo,

227
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:24,876
we have an

228
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:25,417
important scene

229
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,501
that needs your review.

230
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:28,250
We’ll talk later.

231
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,292
Why did she interrupt me?

232
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,918
Does she know it?

233
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,459
So close.

234
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,501
Really close.

235
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:08,751
Due to an unknown error,

236
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,834
many batches of dream bracelets

237
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,042
produced by our company

238
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,999
have incurred the same frequency
and dream entering phenomenon.

239
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:16,375
The reason

240
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,000
you have been dreaming of Ling Lingqi

241
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,250
is this,

242
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:20,876
dream bracelet.

243
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:22,417
Ling Lingqi

244
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,999
not only deliberately conceals the truth,

245
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,125
but also uses your dreams

246
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,000
to approach you

247
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,042
and gain your favor.

248
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:27,751
She is a

249
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:29,042
complete liar.

250
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,542
Ling Lingqi doesn’t

251
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:31,876
look like this.

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,542
Is there any

253
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,792
misunderstanding in it?

254
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,167
What misunderstanding?

255
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,250
The evidence here

256
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,459
is clear.

257
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,417
It’s your fault.

258
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:41,417
It was you

259
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,292
who got this crap.

260
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,000
How can you blame me?

261
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:44,667
Who would have expected

262
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,042
such a bizarre thing?

263
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,584
Alright. I see.

264
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,250
Bo Hai,

265
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,250
you must fire Ling Lingqi immediately.

266
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,042
She can lie to you today

267
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,000
because of this matter.

268
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,167
In the future,

269
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,501
she will

270
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:58,792
lie to everyone.

271
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,542
It’s between me and her.

272
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,167
You two get out of this.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,542
You are done talking with Bo Hai?

274
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:29,626
Then…

275
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:31,334
I’m afraid Bo Hai

276
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:32,626
doesn’t want to see you now.

277
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,292
What do you mean?

278
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:42,501
Dream bracelet and entering dreams
at the same frequency.

279
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,959
Ling Lingqi,

280
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,292
you must be familiar with

281
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,459
these words.

282
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,209
You dirty

283
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:48,918
secrets.

284
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,292
Bo Hai knows them all.

285
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,375
If I tell him myself,

286
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,375
it would be a confession.

287
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:25,250
Bai Hai might

288
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,000
show me some sympathy.

289
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,042
Zhou Xinyan

290
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:35,083
has to place me in this passive position.

291
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,792
Bo Hai must be hunting me now.

292
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,740
= Employee’s Card =

293
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,250
Why are you hiding here?

294
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,417
Is it because you have done something wrong

295
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,250
and you can’t face me?

296
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,459
Bo Hai.

297
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:30,959
Where are we going?

298
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,250
Come with me.

299
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,334
Do you know why

300
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,459
I brought you here?

301
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,959
I’m so sorry.

302
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,125
I won’t do it again.

303
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,501
Tell me.

304
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,959
What did you do wrong?

305
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,876
I should not enter your dreams

306
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:40,501
by the dream bracelet.

307
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,125
I shouldn’t fake a Chen Mo

308
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,751
and meet the guy from Sweet Dream Technology.

309
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:49,167
And?

310
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:50,834
And

311
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,000
I shouldn’t enter your dreams

312
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,709
and beat you.

313
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,459
I hung you up and beat you.

314
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,167
After that, I took advantage of you.

315
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,792
And I kissed you.

316
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:06,792
That’s enough.

317
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:08,876
Then, how do you think

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,334
I should punish you?

319
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:14,999
As long as you can forgive me,

320
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,000
you can punish me however you want.

321
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,209
But if you want me to quit loving you,

322
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,709
that’s not possible.

323
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,292
Listen to this.

324
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:31,792
From now on,

325
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:33,834
don’t drink in front of

326
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:34,501
other men.

327
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,792
When you see a good-looking man,

328
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,626
you are not allowed to have a crush.

329
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,626
I never do that.

330
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,751
And the most important one.

331
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,792
From now on,

332
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:55,459
don’t conceal anything from me.

333
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:56,876
Do you understand?

334
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:01,584
Fine,

335
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:02,959
for the sake

336
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,250
of your love for me,

337
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:05,918
I’m gonna generously

338
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:07,250
forgive you.

339
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,334
You’re not mad?

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,167
You are playing with me?

341
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,667
Let me show you something good.

342
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,626
Watch this before you go.

343
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:27,083
Come.

344
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,751
Look. This.

345
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,167
Epiphyllum.

346
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,000
This is the first time I’ve seen one.

347
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:43,542
They say things “flower briefly as epiphyllum”.

348
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,000
It’s not exaggerated at all.

349
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:48,334
It begins to wither slowly

350
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,709
within an hour or two

351
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,959
after blooming.

352
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:53,667
It’s a pity

353
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,209
to miss it.

354
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,292
Almost as soon as it blooms,

355
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,959
it starts to wither slowly.

356
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,292
Such a beautiful flower

357
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,083
has an ephemeral life.

358
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,000
However,

359
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,042
we can remember

360
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,375
its most beautiful moment.

361
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,501
In this way ephemeral

362
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,834
becomes eternity.

363
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:31,876
I feel cold.

364
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,292

Lili,

413
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:54,626
did you see Mo Nan?

414
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:56,334
No.

415
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,417
Right,

416
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,999
I saw him

417
00:24:59,083 --> 00:24:59,918
go outside.

418
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,501
Did he go home already?

419
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,834
OK, I see.

420
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:15,042
Why not answering?

421
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:22,834
Where is he?

422
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:31,375
Mo Nan.

423
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:33,959
Where did you go?

424
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,459
Why didn’t you answer your cellphone?

425
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:36,999
Do you know how worried I was?

426
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,083
Don’t leave me, OK?

427
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,792
Why aren’t I

428
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,250
in your heart?

429
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,209
You know what?

430
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:30,209
For you,

431
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,167
I can do anything. I mean it.

432
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,125
But it doesn’t change anything.

433
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,417
The person you want is not me.

434
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:45,167
No matter what I do, it doesn’t matter.

435
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,626
Why?

436
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,083
Why

437
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,709
aren’t I in your heart?

438
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,999
Who said I don’t love you?

439
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,167
The one in my heart

440
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:15,375
is you.

441
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:23,667
Mo Nan?

442
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:25,876
Mo Nan?

443
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,209
Why so drunk?

444
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:19,751
Let’s get your hands wiped.

445
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,834
Seriously?

446
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,250
You have to tell me

447
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:47,584
this important thing

448
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,542
when you’re so drunk.

449
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:45,626
You are awake?

450
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:47,959
Baoni?

451
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:50,167
Good timing. Breakfast is ready.

452
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:57,584
Why are you here?

453
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,999
I came to visit you last night and

454
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,584
found that you were drunk,

455
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:04,209
so I stayed to take care of you.

456
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,083
Thanks.

457
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,542
You are welcome.

458
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:22,083
Oh,

459
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,375
do you remember

460
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:28,375
you talked a lot to me

461
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:30,167
last night?

462
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,584
What did I say?

463
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,999
I am joking. Nothing.

464
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:17,667
What is going on?

465
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,751
Hello. Mr. Zhu?

466
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,834
- I am coming. - What is going on?

467
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:21,792
You come down together?

468
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,709
No, yesterday, he… I…

469
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:29,167
It’s not like what you think.

470
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,292
Eat your fried bread stick.

471
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,250
Tell me what happened!

472
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:38,542
So,

473
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,959
Mo Nan has a secret crush on you but

474
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,417
he dare not to tell you.

475
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:45,417
Maybe because

476
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,209
he cares that there are so many people

477
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,709
chasing me,

478
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,417
which is understandable.

479
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,751
Actually I also have a good news

480
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,792
to tell you.

481
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:06,250
You were in desperation

482
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,250
a few days ago,

483
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,999
now it’s a reversion?

484
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:10,918
Did he tell you his feelings?

485
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:12,959
No,

486
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:14,667
but he hugged me.

487
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,542
I think it’s the same.

488
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:18,167
No,

489
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,918
he should tell you in person.

490
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,167
Anyway,

491
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,042
only one-step-distance between Bo Hai

492
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,834
and me.

493
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,584
Qi,

494
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,250
Mr. Bo will direct the floriculture
in person today,

495
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,209
why don’t you go take a seat?

496
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:37,542
I forgot it!

497
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,876
I am going.

498
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,125
Look at you.

499
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,709
Floriculture is not only
about enjoying the beauty,

500
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,250
but also a way to express

501
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,209
people’s feelings.

502
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:48,834
To understand language of flowers

503
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,125
will help a florist

504
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,250
better know the emotions of

505
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,501
the clients.

506
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,083
Today…

507
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:00,584
Today I will

508
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,501
choose

509
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:03,999
a person randomly

510
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,542
for a test.

511
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,250
Ling Lingqi,

512
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,792
come.

513
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,417
Come here.

514
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:26,918
Mr. Bo, feel free to test me.

515
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:28,667
OK.

516
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,083
Green rose?

517
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:47,626
The language of green rose is

518
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,751
I am fond of you only.

519
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:53,959
Right.

520
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:07,584
This one, red cabbage-rose?

521
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,751
You don’t know?

522
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,417
Anyone knows?

523
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,083
Who says I don’t know!

524
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,918
The language of red cabbage-rose is

525
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,709
I only want to be with you.

526
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,250
How brute is he!

527
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,292
I finally know him today.

528
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:12,959
Xinyan,

529
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,834
calm down.

530
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,709
You can’t control love.

531
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:18,042
It is decided by destiny.

532
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,334
I don’t understand it.

533
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:22,083
Ling Lingqi lied to Bo Hai.

534
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,292
But he’s not angry

535
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:24,709
but closer to her.

536
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,584
That stupid bracelet makes

537
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:27,999
Bo Hai lose his mind.

538
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,501
I will find the truth.

539
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:30,999
Zhou Xinyan!

540
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,042
Don’t cheat yourself!

541
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:34,250
We have followed Bo Hai

542
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,459
for so many years,

543
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,459
when did you see him

544
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,125
this happy?

545
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,876
You say you like him,

546
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:41,459
right?

547
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:42,999
Then you can’t interrupt him

548
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,584
pursuing his happiness.

549
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:45,876
If you are not able to

550
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,083
understand it,

551
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:49,000
you don’t deserve his love.

552
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:58,167
Now every one

553
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:00,292
choose one painting

554
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,375
and make

555
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,292
a bouquet

556
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:03,959
matching the emotions of the paintings.

557
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:05,501
Here we go.

558
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:43,999
Good choice.

559
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,667
This is Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh.

560
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,167
This is it.

561
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:08,918
Get more of this

562
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,584
for decoration.

563
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:14,542
Get more.

564
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,042
This.

565
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:19,542
This.

566
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:23,417
And this.

567
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,501
Mr. Bo, Mr. Bo,

568
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,334
I can’t hold the bouquet.

569
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,417
Could you teach me?

570
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:38,292
If you can’t hold it,

571
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,834
practice more.

572
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:42,959
Get more

573
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:44,375
of this.

574
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:51,626
Why is Mr. Bo

575
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:52,834
so partial?

576
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:56,417
Make your bouquet.

577
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:03,000
Mo Nan,

578
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:04,667
when

579
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,959
choosing a lover,

580
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,542
what is more important,

581
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:11,000
conditions or feelings?

582
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,125
Both.

583
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,501
How come?

584
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,709
Of course, feelings are more important.

585
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,000
Some people

586
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:27,999
may look perfect

587
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:29,250
and not reachable,

588
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,167
but actually they are not.

589
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,083
Just like me.

590
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:36,626
Do I have large double-fold eyelids?

591
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:38,667
Yes.

592
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:40,417
It’s not natural.

593
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:44,999
Is my waist

594
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:49,292
thin?

595
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:50,292
Yes.

596
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,125
It’s wrapped.

597
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,417
So

598
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,125
you can’t

599
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,584
focus on

600
00:38:58,709 --> 00:38:59,751
the superficial conditions.

601
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,876
You need to follow your feelings

602
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,167
bravely

603
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,959
and pursue true love.

604
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,417
No worries, Baoni.

605
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,167
Whether your eyelids

606
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,292
are natural,

607
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:15,542
whether your waist is wrapped,

608
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:17,709
I’m your bestie,

609
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:19,999
and you are the perfect in my eyes.

610
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:24,918
Why can’t you understand?

611
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:30,834
In fact,

612
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:32,626
I’ve been concealing

613
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,250
an unmentionable shortcoming and

614
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:36,626
I haven’t told anyone.

615
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:40,542
Only if you trust me,

616
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:41,709
I would like to be the listener.

617
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:45,292
I have barbiers.

618
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,792
What?

619
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,417
I have barbiers.

620
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:00,959
Well, Baoni,

621
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,792
barbiers is

622
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,125
not a big deal.

623
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,292
Don’t worry about it.

624
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,860
= Ji Bin =

625
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,209
A client. I gotta go.

626
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:44,959
I’ll wait for the next.

627
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,417
What happened to Xinyan?

628
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:13,083
Hello.

629
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:15,918
Mr. Mo,

630
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,125
I heard from the headquarters that

631
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:19,999
you are giving up the FlowerPlus acquisition,

632
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:20,584
are you?

633
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:21,459
Yes,

634
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:24,083
I will go back to headquarters later.

635
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:25,918
As to the finishing work,

636
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,209
they will send professionals to

637
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:28,125
help you.

638
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,334
We have worked so hard for

639
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:34,083
the FlowerPlus project.

640
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,834
Why are you giving up now?

641
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:39,751
