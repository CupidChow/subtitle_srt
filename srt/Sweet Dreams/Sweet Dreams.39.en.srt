51
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:53,709
With that kind of money,

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,834
the company’s cash flow

53
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,042
could be in trouble.

54
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,250
Once we’re indicted,

55
00:01:59,042 --> 00:01:59,876
there’s a good chance

56
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,626
we’ll lose.

57
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,000
We’re not happy

58
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,250
with what you’ve done.

59
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,083
On behalf of all the directors,

60
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,167
we strongly question

61
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,834
the current state

62
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:09,250
of the company’s operations.

63
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,918
At next Monday’s meeting,

64
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,542
the board will discuss your impeachment.

65
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,334
We’re replacing the chairman.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,501
Is it pretty?

67
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:07,876
My mother taught me this.

68
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,209
She made the world’s

69
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,667
most beautiful bouquet.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,042
I miss Mom.

71
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,375
Ever since Mom left,

72
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,125
I’ve been making flowers

73
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,792
when I miss her.

74
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,751
When I do it,

75
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:30,792
it’s like

76
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,375
my mother’s beside me.

77
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,083
That’s why FlowerPlus was founded.

78
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,542
It’s not just a company,

79
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,167
but also carries my memory

80
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,459
of my mother.

81
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,501
All these years,

82
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:57,626
it’s all I have.

83
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,417
Are you really willing to give it up?

84
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:05,792
In my heart,

85
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,584
this is the love of my mother.

86
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,125
It turns out that FlowerPlus

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,501
means so much to Bo Hai.

88
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:29,542
My flowers!

89
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,042
My flowers!

90
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,250
Bo Hai.

91
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,626
Bo Hai! Bo Hai!

92
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:04,626
Bo Hai pretends

93
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,959
it doesn’t matter.

94
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,667
But in fact,

95
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,292
he can’t afford to lose the company.

96
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:30,959
Mr. Mo, Miss Ling is here.

97
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,375
I accept your deal.

98
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:41,834
I see.

99
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:45,834
But I have one condition.

100
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,999
I need one more day.

101
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:53,125
Deal.

102
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,042
I’ve been waiting all this time anyway.

103
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,834
One more day won’t harm.

104
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:23,876
It’s such a beautiful day.

105
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:26,083
Let’s go and have fun.

106
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,626
Sorry, everyone.

107
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,292
I just got word that

108
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,250
Mr. Bo had a last-minute thing,

109
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,292
and our meeting’s been cancelled.

110
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,918
He got us here early in the morning

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,042
but he didn’t show up.

112
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,626
Is there something wrong again?

113
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:26,292
Chen Mo.

114
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,292
Where the hell is Bo Hai?

115
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,459
He went to the amusement park

116
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:38,751
with Ling Lingqi.

117
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,209
Going out?

118
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,167
Keep your voice down.

119
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,918
It’s not good for this kind of thing to get out.

120
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,083
How can he have fun

121
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,375
at this point?

122
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,792
What is

123
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,083
Ling Lingqi thinking?

124
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,334
It’s all about luck.

125
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,959
It doesn’t matter where he goes.

126
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,000
Luck

127
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,542
calls for a good attitude.

128
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,292
How can he take this as a joke?

129
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,876
Maybe he’s just desperate.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,459
He has nothing else to do.

131
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,501
I do admire

132
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:03,999
his style.

133
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,209
Shut up.

134
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:08,667
Where are you going?

135
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:16,292
Why did you call me here?

136
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:17,375
Going to the supermarket?

137
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:18,959
I want a normal day

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,959
with you.

139
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,334
I didn’t even go to the office.

140
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,083
Chen Mo, Zhou Xinyan,

141
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,292
they have a lot of things...

142
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,501
Things are gonna work out

143
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,792
at work anyway.

144
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:28,792
Because you have

145
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,792
a very lucky girlfriend.

146
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:31,584
Lucky how?

147
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,042
I can win another one when I buy a drink.

148
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:40,501
What?

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,834
Pinky-swear.

150
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:44,751
No talking about work.

151
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,792
Stamp.

152
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:46,626
Go.

153
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,292
When you first met me,

154
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,250
did you ever think that

155
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,459
one day you’d fall in love with me?

156
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:20,125
No.

157
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,584
Can’t you just say something nice?

158
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,250
I thought

159
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:31,375
I was

160
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,667
never gonna get love again,

161
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,459
let alone met you.

162
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,542
I love you.

163
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,999
Do you think

164
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,667
I fell in love with you

165
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,083
because God blinked his eyes?

166
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:45,375
So you fell in love with me

167
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:46,417
by accident?

168
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,000
Meeting you was the most

169
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,292
amazing surprise of my life.

170
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,292
Qi.

171
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:58,375
I really should get back to the office.

172
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,083
They’ve

173
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,292
been waiting for me all day,

174
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,292
okay?

175
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,417
Look. See?

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,918
You’re not happy.

177
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,125
Didn’t you just say you are my lucky star?

178
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,042
With you here,

179
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,501
I’m sure I’ll pull through.

180
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:16,709
Go on.

181
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,167
I’ll catch a bus later.

182
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:18,792
Okay.

183
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:19,167
Send me WeChat messages

184
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,999
when you get home.

185
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,250
I’m gonna go.

186
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:23,584
Bye-bye.

187
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,709
Bo Hai.

188
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:45,000
Goodbye, Bo Hai.

189
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,292
What’s wrong with you today?

190
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,792
You make it sound like we’ll never meet again.

191
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:57,584
And crying?

192
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,834
Go. I’ll see you in your dream.

193
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:02,709
See you in my dream.

194
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:03,959
Be good.

Does the physical pain

231
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,209
relieve the pain in your heart?

232
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,584
I hope it does.

233
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,709
But it doesn’t.

234
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,042
You know,

235
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,626
one loves another,

236
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,083
and wants her to be happy,

237
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,334
but why is she

238
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,167
getting more and more miserable?

239
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,209
Is this love

240
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:08,125
too selfish

241
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,459
and cruel for her?

242
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,375
Letting Ling Lingqi leave Bo Hai
as soon as possible,

243
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,626
perhaps will cause Ling Lingqi pain for a while.

244
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,375
But in the long run,

245
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,125
it’s definitely a good thing.

246
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:22,167
And

247
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,250
one day, she will

248
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,334
understand you.

249
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,667
If only time could

250
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:02,709
stand still in this moment,

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,876
and we could

252
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,000
stay in this dream.

253
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:08,709
Wouldn’t that be nice?

254
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,209
Why didn’t you say anything?

255
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,709
Here, here, here. Look at this…

256
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:25,959
What’s going on?

257
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,083
Let’s break up.

258
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:31,459
There are things

259
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,584
I can’t say to you in daylight.

260
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,667
I can only talk to you here.

261
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,000
Why?

262
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,584
Because I don’t love you anymore.

263
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,626
How could that be possible?

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,667
Qi.

265
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,042
We’ve been through

266
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,000
so much together,

267
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,000
and we’re finally together.

268
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,834
We’re just getting started.

269
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,417
There’s no reason for you to give up.

270
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,334
Because love

271
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,876
isn’t what you think it is.

272
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,292
What on earth are you talking about?

273
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,417
There are some things you don’t need to know.

274
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,209
Thank you

275
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,083
for being in my

276
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:29,959
19-year-old life.

277
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:35,999
Thank you for giving me some impression

278
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,334
of the beautiful youth.

279
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:46,959
I’m leaving.

280
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,083
Be well.

281
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:04,083
Qi.

282
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,834
Qi.

283
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:12,709
Qi.

284
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:15,459
Qi!

285
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,792
Qi! Qi!

286
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,000
Who’s knocking so loudly?

287
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:55,584
Bo Hai?

288
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,042
Aunt, where is Qi?

289
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,042
She left early this morning.

290
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:02,667
I made some wontons.

291
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,125
Would you like some?

292
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:11,292
Qi!

293
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,209
Mr. Bo.

294
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:14,334
Mr. Bo.

295
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:16,459
Early this morning,

296
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:17,751
Ling Lingqi called me

297
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,626
to say she was quitting.

298
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:20,999
But I told her

299
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,501
I needed your permission.

300
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,542
She said…

301
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:27,000
She said whether you approve or not,

302
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,334
she’s adamant about leaving.

303
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,417
Qi called me, too,

304
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:33,959
and asked me

305
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,083
to help her pack.

306
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,209
And then she said

307
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,626
she wouldn’t come back.

308
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,417
I’ve broken up with Bo Hai.

309
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:11,918
I hope you’ll

310
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,000
keep your promise.

311
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:14,292
Don’t worry.

312
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:16,334
I’ll do

313
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:17,626
what I promised.

314
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,167
I still have a little bit of credibility.

315
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,584
But let me remind you,

316
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,083
since you and Bo Hai

317
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,334
have broken up,

318
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,250
this is the last time

319
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,125
you help him.

320
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,792
Fine.

321
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,000
I’ll try to forget him.

322
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,501
A deal is a deal.

323
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,334
You got what you paid for.

324
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:53,876
Don’t act like

325
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,292
you’re going to die.

326
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,667
Why on earth would you do that?

327
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:05,667
I thought you knew.

328
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,042
Even I have broken up with Bo Hai,

329
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,501
you still won’t get

330
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,542
what you want.

331
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,709
Even if I can’t have it,

332
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:20,709
I won’t let

333
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,334
my enemies have it.

334
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,918
After all, Bo Hai’s

335
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,125
whole family have my father’s blood

336
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,626
on their hands.

337
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,709
You know what?

338
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:33,959
I will also give him a taste

339
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,999
of losing his beloved ones.

340
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:41,667
You’re crazy.

341
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:45,250
Yes, I am.

342
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,417
I’m driven crazy by hate.

343
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,250
I’m driven crazy by love.

344
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:52,584
Qi, believe me,

345
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:53,834
no matter how I change,

346
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,209
to you, I’ve never…

347
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,292
I broke up with Bo Hai,

348
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:00,999
but I would never

349
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,209
be with someone like you.

350
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:17,751
Good news! Good news!

351
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:18,834
Good news! Good news!

352
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,709
I just got a call from legal personnel.

353
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:23,042
After a concerted effort by our clients,

354
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,501
they offered that

355
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,626
in view of the fact that

356
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:27,000
the strike belonged to the force majeure,

357
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,167
they waived

358
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,125
the breach of contract.

359
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:32,626
That’s great!

360
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,209
Yes!

361
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:34,501
Does that mean

362
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,667
we don’t have to pay for it?

363
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:36,959
The clients gave up on the claim already,

364
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:37,999
what do we have to pay for?

365
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:40,542
I have good news, too.

366
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:42,250
Now that the matter

367
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:42,999
has been resolved,

368
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,000
all the directors have agreed that

369
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:44,959
we will not be

370
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:45,792
held responsible.

371
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,626
The board will remain as it is.

372
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:49,042
Bo Hai will continue to be

373
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:49,876
our chairman,

374
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,000
with full authority to manage the company.

375
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:55,626
The clients and the board

376
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,709
are so understanding

377
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:57,459
and thoughtful.

378
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,417
I figured as much.

379
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,167
I knew

380
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:00,417
we’re gonna be OK.

381
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,042
Yeah.

382
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:06,626
Bo Hai.

383
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,250
I’ve got two pieces of good news.

384
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,751
Which one do you want to hear first?

385
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:27,751
Have a drink with me.

386
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:51,667
In fact, Ling Lingqi

387
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:52,834
may just

388
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,083
need a little time.

389
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:57,417
You know what?

390
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,125
I had long since given up

391
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,584
the idea of being with her.

392
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,000
Forcing her

393
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,167
to be with someone she doesn’t love

394
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,125
isn’t love.

395
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,709
It’s possession.

396
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,459
It’s torture.

397
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:13,918
I just want to be able to

398
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,167
look at her from a distance

399
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,250
and watch over her

400
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:20,959
silently.

401
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:27,000
What did you mean

402
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,250
by that?

403
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,334
In the face of love,

404
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,667
I am her guardian knight.

405
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,125
But in the face of hatred,

406
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,459
I am a desperate devil.

407
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,167
I cannot let her

408
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,459
know my true intentions

409
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:48,626
so that I can successfully

410
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:50,792
crush Bo Hai and protect Qi.

411
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,292
To avenge my father.

412
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,626
Sometimes,

413
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,751
I can’t even tell

414
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:11,042
which is the real me,

415
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,834
the knight or the devil?

416
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:15,334
So you choose to

417
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,918
numb yourself with alcohol?

418
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,959
Alcohol is a good thing.

419
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:22,709
It can give a person

420
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:23,959
a temporary relief.

421
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:03,209
How dare you!

422
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,125
How dare you go after Qi!

423
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,250
You can’t even

424
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,209
protect your own woman,

425
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:09,375
are you still a man?

426
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,751
Come at me if you can!

427
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:15,959
It will be your turn soon.

428
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,501
You think you can get

429
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,876
what you want this way?

430
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:21,042
I already have.

431
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,292
I’m gonna make you pay

432
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,501
for what you did to Qi.

433
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:30,375
I’ll wait.

434
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,167
Qi.

435
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,083
You came back so early.

436
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,375
Although your boyfriend is the CEO,

437
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,375
you cannot act like this.

438
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:48,959
Skip work?

439
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,417
Qi?

440
00:26:58,626 --> 00:26:59,501
I quit.

441
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,667
What’s wrong?

442
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:04,709
Trouble with Bo Hai?

443
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,375
We broke up.

444
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,125
I don’t believe you.

445
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:15,542
Fine.

446
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,459
Be grumpy if you like.

447
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:19,042
And then when you’re not angry,

448
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,083
you will call Bo Hai willingly.

449
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,167
If you won’t,

450
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:24,501
I can do it for you, OK?

451
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:25,417
Mom,

452
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:28,125
I’m serious.

453
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,167
Me, too.

454
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:31,375
I’ll have Bo Hai

455
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,918
come over for dinner tonight.

456
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,918
I’ll make wontons for him.

457
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,834
And I’m gonna have your dad buy a chicken.

458
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,792
You young people, for you,

459
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:51,584
having a relationship

460
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:52,918
is like playing a game.

461
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,626
Today you break up,

462
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:55,167
and tomorrow

463
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,000
you are as sweet as honey.

464
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,125
Don’t think I don’t know

465
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,125
that you are

466
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,292
just acting like the TV show.

467
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,751
When I was 19,

468
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,584
I had a long

469
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,918
and beautiful dream.

470
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,250
In it,

471
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,876
I fell in love with Bo Hai.

472
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:18,959
Because I love him,

473
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,125
I become a better person,

474
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:25,083
and I finally found love.

475
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:27,542
This dream

476
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,083
is sweet

477
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,501
like a fairy tale.

478
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,042
But dreams

479
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,792
do wake up one day.

480
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:06,876
Are you alright?

481
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Just a little scratch.

482
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,751
Ji Bin told me about it.

483
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:18,000
Nice work this time.

484
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,167
It’s just a little wound of my skin.

485
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:23,876
Bo Hai’s injuries

486
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:27,792
are fatal.

487
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:34,959
Bo Hai has lost

488
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,626
what’s most important to him.

489
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,125
Next,

490
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,876
we’ll wait for good news.

491
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:20,250
Why would Ling Lingqi

492
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,375
break up with the boss

493
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,250
after all this time?

494
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,000
I don’t understand.

495
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:31,709
Look at Bo Hai now,

496
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,375
is he gonna kill himself?

497
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,250
Shouldn’t we

498
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,542
go comfort him?

499
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,626
With a mouth like yours,

500
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:39,834
it’s a good thing you don’t say anything,

501
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:40,959
because if you do,

502
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,250
maybe Bo Hai will

503
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,375
kill himself.

504
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:44,709
So, what do we do?

505
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:46,918
I hate

506
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:48,292
these CEOs.

507
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:49,459
Once they are lovelorn,

508
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:50,334
they either disconsolately

509
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:51,417
look at the busy traffic,

510
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:52,999
or drink alone.

511
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:57,501
Should I… Should I

512
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:59,000
get the boss a drink?

513
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,209
Go ahead.

514
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:12,959
Qi.

515
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:21,626
Why did you quit?

516
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,834
Why did you break up with Bo Hai?

517
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:24,709
Why did you

518
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,042
keep everything from me?

519
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,751
You don’t have to tell me.

520
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:38,167
Just moments ago,

521
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,417
Bo Hai’s crisis was

522
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:41,584
suddenly resolved.

523
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,459
I can guess that

524
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:50,834
all of this

525
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:53,751
is the work of Mo Nan.

526
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,250
Did Mo Nan threaten you

527
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,250
to break up with Bo Hai?

528
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,459
He’s horrible.

529
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:28,751
Baoni.

530
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:31,375
Forget about him.

531
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,292
The more you fantasize about him,

532
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,834
the more upset you’ll be.

533
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:43,501
Qi.

534
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,292
Actually, I can tell.

535
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,209
Mo Nan just got carried away.

536
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,167
He’s really not a bad guy.

537
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:52,918
Baoni.

538
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,542
I know you’ll look down on me

539
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:56,751
and laugh at me.

540
00:32:59,209 --> 00:32:59,792
But

541
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,918
I really want to help him.

542
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,584
I don’t know what to do

543
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:08,000
to wake him up.

544
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,584
Baoni, you can wake up

545
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:12,584
a sleeping man,

546
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:13,751
but can you wake up

547
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:14,876
a man who pretends to be asleep?

548
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:35,459
Baoni.

549
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:55,918
A good companion for a broken heart.

550
00:33:57,751 --> 00:33:58,375
Knock it off.

551
00:33:58,834 --> 00:33:59,667
It’s been a day.

552
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:00,918
Time to get back to work.

553
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:02,918
What?

554
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,292
Back to work already?

555
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:07,292
What’s going on?

556
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,209
According to the overall

557
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,417
time plan,

558
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,459
we will push forward

559
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:17,751
the construction of the sales channel next week.

560
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:18,999
Immortal Flowers’ feedback so far

561
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,459
have been so good that

562
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,918
we’ve been approached

563
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,250
by 13 companies.

564
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:24,542
I’m going to visit

565
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:25,459
five of them next week,

566
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:26,417
and I’m going to take a closer look…

567
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,250
I can’t listen to this anymore.

568
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:29,876
How can you listen to this

569
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,250
at a time like this?

570
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:32,542
Is any of this more important

571
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,999
than your lifelong happiness?

572
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:37,542
Don’t stop me.

573
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,542
If you don’t fix your relationship
with Ling Lingqi now,

574
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:43,375
when will you do it?

575
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:44,876
Are you really that stupid?

576
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,042
What I’m doing now

577
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,375
is fixing it.

578
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,459
Signing agents and developing sales,

579
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:51,709
that’s called fixing?

580
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:53,709
Women need to be coaxed,

581
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,792
you know?

582
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:58,542
I don’t know about other women,

583
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,083
but I know Qi.

584
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:02,459
Mo Nan threatened Qi

585
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:03,751
with the company to leave me.

586
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,584
Then I’m gonna prove to her

587
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,751
that I can take down an opponent,

588
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,209
and that’s how I’m gonna fix this.

589
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:14,292
Go on.

590
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:18,751
If nothing goes wrong,

591
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,083
all five agencies

592
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,250
will sign up.

593
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:40,375
Lu Baoni is here again.

594
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:44,417
Tell her I’m not here.

595
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:45,542
I already did.

596
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:46,459
But she said

597
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:47,501
she had to see you today.

598
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,250
She’s downstairs waiting right now.

599
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:50,709
Whatever.

600
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,501
She’ll leave when she gets tired.

601
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,167
But the temperature has dropped.

602
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,584
It’s rather cold outside today.

603
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:41,667
Mo Nan.

604
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,626
I knew you’d come down.

605
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,542
I don’t want this to get ugly.

606
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,459
Just go.

607
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:54,918
I’m not here to get things ugly.

608
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,626
I just want to ask you.

609
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:58,999
Why are you doing this?

610
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,375
From the moment

611
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,542
I knew who you really are,

612
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:09,292
it became clear to me that

613
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:10,918
all the machinations

614
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,626
you play in business

615
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,209
are beneath contempt.

616
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,501
But I brainwashed myself

617
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:19,667
over and over again

618
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:21,792
that these are your tasks.

619
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,918
It’s just your job.

620
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:25,999
You’re still our best friend,

621
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,375
and you’re still the Mo Nan who would

622
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,876
do anything for our friendship.

623
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:30,918
So now you know

624
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,876
your best friend is

625
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,417
a fantasy.

626
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,209
How could you be so mean?

627
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,709
You forced Qi to break up with Bo Hai.

628
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,292
And then what?

629
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,167
Then what do you want to do?

630
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,501
When will you

631
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,709
be satisfied?

632
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:48,667
At least now!

633
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,459
I’m not satisfied!

634
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,042
Mo Nan, Mo Nan, Mo Nan.

635
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:58,876
Mo Nan.

636
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:00,250
Mo Nan.

637
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:02,334
You’re lying to us, aren’t you?

638
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,375
That’s not who you are at all.

639
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:05,709
Tell me

640
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,334
what I have to do

641
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:08,751
to save you?

642
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,667
You should save yourself,

643
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:13,501
not me.

644
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,167
You’re the one who’s always fantasizing about me,

645
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,167
and afraid to face the truth.

646
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:22,125
Right.

647
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,417
I am.

648
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,209
Do you know why?

649
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,876
Because I love you.

650
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:28,709
I love you!

651
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,959
So you’re stupid!

652
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,584
You’re the one being stupid.

653
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:40,250
You’re the one who’s wrong, not me.

654
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,918
You misread me,

655
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,083
and fall for the wrong person.

656
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:47,999
Lu Baoni.

657
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,667
I told you before.

658
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:50,999
You must forget me.

659
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,709
If hatred can make you forget,

660
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:57,751
then I hope

661
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,459
you hate my guts.

662
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:06,792
By the way.

663
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,667
From now on,

664
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:14,999
I don’t want to see you again.

665
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,667
Okay, I promise.

666
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,751
From now on,

667
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,751
I will forget you.

668
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:55,292
I, Mo Nan,

669
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,709
will never fall in love

670
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:00,250
with Lu Baoni, whenever it is.

671
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:01,209
You know what?

672
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,542
For you, I can do anything.

673
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:04,250
I mean it.

674
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:07,542
Don’t look down on my bag.

675
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,125
Last week

676
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:11,042
I got it in a small shop with 70% off.

677
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:12,417
I’ll give it to you.

678
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,834
Did I do something wrong?

679
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,000
Seems not.

680
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,918
I can’t have Qi and Baoni

681
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,626
have hope for me.

682
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,125
So I have to be

683
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:22,501
ruthless with them.

684
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:25,751
I didn’t do anything wrong,

685
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,000
but why

686
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,459
do I feel so bad?

687
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,167
Because you’re lying,

688
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,042
and you’re going through

689
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:45,709
a man-to-devil transformation.

690
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:48,959
Maybe one day

691
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:50,167
you’ll turn into

692
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:51,626
a devil like William.

693
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,417
By then, maybe you won’t

694
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:56,459
be sad or hurt.
