51
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry?

52
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,250
Is this the start of

53
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,667
another lie?

54
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,292
No, Qi.

55
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,042
Let me explain. Bo Hai...

56
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,292
Stay off me!

57
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,751
You make me sick!

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,542
I even helped

59
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:01,918
such a man like you!

60
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:02,876
I never hated myself

61
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,417
like I do now!

62
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,209
Don’t let me see you again!

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,501
I’ll hire someone

64
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,667
to teach him a lesson!

65
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,667
He took our money, but framed us up.

66
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,250
How disloyal he is!

67
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:40,083
Could you come up with

68
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,876
some feasible ideas?

69
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,125
I know.

70
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,375
But I just don’t want to let him go.

71
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,584
Or shall we

72
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:50,501
ask the media

73
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,959
to release some positive news

74
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:52,959
to bring down

75
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,792
the negative news?

76
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,167
The scandal about Bo Hai

77
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,083
has been overwhelming.

78
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,125
How can we bring it down?

79
00:03:58,709 --> 00:03:58,959
If something goes wrong,

80
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,667
more people will assault us.

81
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,083
What do we do then?

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,667
Or shall we

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,501
release a letter of

84
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,626
public apology?

85
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,375
At least, we admit our mistake.

86
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,918
If only the letter could help!

87
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,459
Seems like

88
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,042
they’re going to destroy us!

89
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,542
Come on. You always say no.

90
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,667
What can we do then?

91
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:16,834
Await our doom?

92
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,584
I don’t know, either.

93
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:39,876
If I were you,

94
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:42,417
I would jump from this height

95
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,334
and end everything.

96
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,250
I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

97
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,125
I don’t have such a plan.

98
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:51,918
Fine, then.

99
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:57,167
I can’t use up my luck in one day.

100
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,083
I’ll leave some surprise for the future.

101
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,209
I’ve been curious about

102
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,626
the man behind Mo Nan,

103
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,834
who has so many resources

104
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,999
and insists on destroying me.

105
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,042
Today,

106
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,375
I finally know.

107
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:21,751
Not too many people

108
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,459
are qualified to be my rivals.

109
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,083
To you,

110
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,792
I’ve paid most attention.

111
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,626
Why me?

112
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,250
Why must you

113
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,584
destroy me?

114
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,792
Business is like a battlefield

115
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,834
where we win or lose.

116
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:43,709
When you lose,

117
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,250
admit it.

118
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:47,834
If you fight stubbornly,

119
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:50,209
you will have your own company

120
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,167
destroyed with you.

121
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:56,542
I have a request.

122
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,959
After you acquire FlowerPlus,

123
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,250
please be nice to my employees.

124
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,584
Do you know why you lose?

125
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,167
You’re a businessman.

126
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,626
But you abandon yourself to emotion.

127
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,834
This is my only request.

128
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,501
I don’t think you understand what’s going on.

129
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:22,918
You’re not qualified

130
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,459
to bargain with me.

131
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,959
The equity transfer agreement

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,292
is on your table.

133
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,667
My patience will be worn out

134
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,959
by tomorrow noon.

135
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:33,542
Oh,

136
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,209
would you like to make a bet with me?

137
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,167
Guess.

138
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,999
Will I be nice to your employees?

139
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:10,959
Sorry.

140
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,417

You know what?

144
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,584
Today is my son’s death anniversary.

145
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,584
For twenty years, every year on this day,

146
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,584
I feel very sad.

147
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:01,959
My wife died

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,709
when she gave birth

149
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,667
to my son.

150
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:15,626
From then on, my son and I

151
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,125
depended on each other for survival.

152
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,375
I promised my wife that

153
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,375
I would take good care of

154
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,667
our son.

155
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,459
Unexpectedly,

156
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,083
when my son was five,

157
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,792
he had acute leukemia.

158
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,626
The doctor said he could be cured.

159
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,375
He could have the bone marrow transplant

160
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:47,918
which costs a great deal of money.

161
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,542
But I was very poor at that time.

162
00:08:57,918 --> 00:08:59,167
I borrowed money from everyone.

163
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,626
Around me,

164
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,918
only two guys

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,292
were able to help me.

166
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,417
But they turned me down.

167
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:18,250
I begged them.

168
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,459
Knelt to them.

169
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,250
Kowtowed to them.

170
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,709
But they still didn’t lend me any money.

171
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,000
I had no choice,

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,375
but to watch my son

173
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,125
die in my arms

174
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,667
when he was only five.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,042

Look what you’ve done.

272
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,918
You didn’t answer the phone or text back.

All right, Qi. Don’t be sad.

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,125
and work hard together,

347
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:58,083
everything will be all right.

348
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,491
♪ Sorry ♪

349
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:01,290
Unfortunately,

350
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,083
I’ve lost all the courage

351
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,167
to make everything all right.

352
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,851
♪ Use the lifelong love ♪

353
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,491
♪ To make you smile for a while ♪

354
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:18,697

355
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,000
A flower always

356
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,167
blossoms beautifully.

357
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,167
But who knows

358
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,417
there’s great sadness

359
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,417
behind its beauty.

360
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,417
Because blossoming is

361
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:38,542
also a signal

362
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,209
for its death.

363
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,334
It has used up

364
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:44,709
all its strength

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,834
to bring an end to the beauty.

366
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:55,542
Here come the cars.

367
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,375
Here come the cars!

368
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,792
Back off. Back off.

369
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:02,626
Back off. Back off.

370
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:03,125
Make way.

371
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:04,209
Back off.

372
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,375
Back off. Back off.

373
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:08,125
Cooperate with us.

374
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:22,584
Yes. Yes. Yes.

375
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,042
I have no comment to make now.

376
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,209
But once there’s an explanation,

377
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,083
= Marketing Director =
we will make it public

378
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:27,209
= Marketing Director =

379
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:27,740
= Marketing Director =
in no time.

380
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,083
Xinyan, bad news!

381
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:30,918
What? What happened?

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,999
I can’t find Bo Hai.

383
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:32,876
I called his landline.

384
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,209
And I called his cellphone. He didn’t answer.

385
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,125
Nor did he text back.

386
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,375
All right. I gotta go.

387
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,209
What’s going on?

388
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,083
No idea.

389
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,792
Mr. Liu, I’ll have Secretary Chen

390
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:42,751
show you the way.

391
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:44,834
Secretary Chen, here comes Mr. Liu.

392
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:46,667
Secretary Chen.

393
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:48,292
Tell all employees

394
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,584
to stop their work.

395
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,000
They mustn’t use the company computers.

396
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:52,542
Check company properties

397
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,626
and relevant documents.

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,083
Okay. I see.

399
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:02,918
William, how dare you!

400
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:04,626
I don’t care

401
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:06,167
if you’re a president or chairman.

402
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:06,876
But you have no right to act wildly

403
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,292
in someone else’s company.

404
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,876
Director Zhou, do you mean

405
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,709
I can do whatever I want

406
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,459
as long as I own this company?

407
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:19,999
Have a look.

408
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,709
This is the transfer contract

409
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,918
Mr. Bo signed.

410
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:28,167
Bo Hai

411
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,375
has sold me

412
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,626
all his stocks.

413
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,000
From now on,

414
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,083
I’m the largest shareholder of

415
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,209
this company.

416
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,999
Director Zhou, tell me.

417
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:40,959
Do I have the right now?

418
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:42,792
Is Mr. Bo just abandoning us

419
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:43,584
like this?

420
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:44,375
I don’t know.

421
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:45,375
He just sold his stocks.

422
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,209
But what do we do?

423
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,250
Yeah. How could he do that?

424
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,292
No way!

425
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,042
FlowerPlus is Bo Hai’s lifetime career.

426
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,083
He can’t have sold it.

427
00:23:58,834 --> 00:23:59,667
Yeah.

428
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:02,584
Without Ling Lingqi’s help,

429
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:03,501
he wouldn’t have made up his mind

430
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:04,918
so fast.

431
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:05,751
I don’t believe it.

432
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:07,709
I’m going to find him now.

433
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:10,918
You should be glad.

434
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,792
Bo Hai has

435
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,417
made a wise decision.

436
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,209
If he fights stubbornly,

437
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,250
every one of you

438
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:19,959
will be screwed

439
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,250
just like him.

440
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:23,876
Oh,

441
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:25,999
I should be most grateful

442
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,167
to Ling Lingqi.

443
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,501
She helped most

444
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:32,459
to reveal Bo Hai’s true colors.

445
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:34,083
Tell her.

446
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:36,542
If she comes back,

447
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,876
she’ll be promoted right away.

448
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:42,751
What should we do?

449
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:43,667
Yeah. What should we do?

450
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:49,542
No way!

451
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,876
Bo Hai wouldn’t have

452
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:51,876
abandoned his company!

453
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,209
There’s a written contract.

454
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:55,542
We all see it.

455
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:56,709
And Secretary Chen said

456
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:57,375
no one managed

457
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,834
to contact Bo Hai.

458
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,999
Qi, where are you going?

459
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:03,999
I’m going to find Bo Hai!

460
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,709
I won’t believe

461
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:06,459
he abandoned FlowerPlus

462
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:07,667
unless he admits it to me.

463
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,501
Bo Hai.

464
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,000
Where are you?

465
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:32,834
= I’m Bo Hai. =

466
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:35,999
= I admit that =

467
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,542
= I’m colorblind. =

468
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,334
= I did hire a substitute =

469
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:48,125
= to cheat the public and our clients. =

470
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,250
= Those facts =

471
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:54,876
= are personal problems. =

472
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,000
= Nothing to do with FlowerPlus. =

473
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,125
= I’d like to =

474
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,709

= Besides, =

= I’ve sold =

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,083
= all my stocks. =

478
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,209
= From now on, =

479
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,375
= FlowerPlus and I are in =

480
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,417
= no legal relationship. =

481
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:21,959
Ask someone

482
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,626
to clear out such rubbish.

483
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:24,334
Okay.

484
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:35,626
You didn’t tell me

485
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,125
you would come to FlowerPlus today.

486
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,000
I want you to take more rest.

487
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:46,250
But I’ve been

488
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,501
taking care of this project.

489
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,209
We don’t need to

490
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,334
argue over that.

491
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,940
= Chairman of the Board Bo Hai =

492
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,209
I helped you to deal with

493
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,125
those hard nuts in FlowerPlus.

494
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:02,667
And I’ll throw the rubbish

495
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:05,042
for you.

496
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,417
Oh,

497
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,792
I haven’t heard from Ji Bin for days.

498
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,083
Has he contacted you?

499
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,000
What’s wrong?

500
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,000
He always stays with you, doesn’t he?

501
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,209
You lost your own man?

502
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,000
Look what a situation we’re in!

503
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,709
I have no appetite.

504
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:53,209
I think

505
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:55,000
Bo Hai made up his mind long ago.

506
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,250
Yeah.

507
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,167
He was calm yesterday,

508
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,375
because he had decided

509
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:00,709
to sacrifice himself.

510
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,918
What sacrifice?

511
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,667
He went away,

512
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:05,876
leaving us to DREAM!

513
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,292
Does he think

514
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:09,834
we’ll be all right?

515
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:10,751
Yeah.

516
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,250
At least, he should have

517
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,792
discussed with us.

518
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,292
We promised to share weal and woe.

519
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,209
Why does he take all the blame

520
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,959
when we’re in trouble?

521
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,334
Yes. You’re right.

522
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:23,501
He doesn’t take us

523
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:24,250
as his friends.

524
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,125
Where are you going? To the office?

525
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,292
Hell no!

526
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:34,876
I’m going back home for some sleep.

527
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:36,292
I’ll go with you.

528
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:39,417
I heard

529
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,125
their daughter Ling Lingqi was great.

530
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,459
She managed to

531
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,417
have a handsome and rich boyfriend.

532
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,334
What good luck!

533
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:49,209
But he turned out to be a liar!

534
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,626
I’ll see how he...

535
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,375
Don’t. Don’t go!

536
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,000
How humiliating!

537
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,542
Li Lijun!

538
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:58,999
If you have anything to gossip,

539
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,250
say it in front of us!

540
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:01,834
Don’t talk nonsense here!

541
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:03,584
I never tolerate

542
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:04,667
any dishonest guys.

543
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:05,626
I know.

544
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,042
Bo Hai will never

545
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,459
lie to anyone.

546
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:09,709
So, you two!

547
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:10,417
Stop talking nonsense

548
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:11,751
with her.

549
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,999
Who is talking nonsense?

550
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,250
Who?

551
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,125
Bo Hai admitted it

552
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,209
on TV!

553
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,584
They saw it!

554
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:19,999
Why you say that I’m talking nonsense?

555
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:20,459
Yeah.

556
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,000
You never tolerate

557
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,417
any dishonest guys?

558
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:24,501
I think you tolerate

559
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:25,834
bad guys!

560
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,542
Fine! Fine!

561
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:30,042
You! And you two!

562
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,709
You three! Listen carefully!

563
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:32,876
What’s wrong with us?

564
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,501
From now on,

565
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:34,792
never dream to buy anything on credit

566
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:36,250
in my shop!

567
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,876
All right. Why don’t you leave?

568
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:38,834
Go! Go! Go!

569
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,209
Go! Let’s go dancing!

570
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,375
- Let’s go dancing. - Go!

571
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,250
All right. Don’t be angry.

572
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,834
Don’t bother ourselves arguing with them.

573
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:47,792
Okay?

574
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,834
I’m raising the prices right away.

575
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:50,876
I’ll make them

576
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,042
pay a big price!

577
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,000
I’m not angry with them.

578
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,709
I just feel sorry for Qi and Bo Hai.

579
00:32:58,876 --> 00:32:59,501
All right. All right.

580
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,125
I know you feel sad.

581
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:05,834
Don’t get angry.

582
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:19,709
You’re back?

583
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:20,250
Oh, you’re back.

584
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,000
Wash your hands and have dinner.

585
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,959
Hairy crab and braised prawns.

586
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:35,999
Qi.

587
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,626
Don’t trust the news!

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,751
Bo Hai must have been framed up.

589
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:42,709
Yeah, Qi.

590
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:43,751
Look at Bo Hai.

591
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,626
He looks handsome and honest.

592
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:46,959
He must be a good guy.

593
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,918
Qi.

594
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:49,834
There’s an old saying.

595
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:50,626
It says

596
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,417
you must learn to swim

597
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,876
before you want to save a drowning man.

598
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,751
If you want to help Bo Hai,

599
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,292
you should take care of yourself first.

600
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,626
You must have something to eat.

601
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,083
Yeah. You must eat to keep yourself alive.

602
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,000
Qi!

603
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,375
You must have dinner!

604
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,667
Here it goes again.

605
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:38,834
Bo Hai.

606
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:41,542
Where on earth are you?

607
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,292
Why did you abandon FlowerPlus?

608
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:47,792
Why did you

609
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,459
deliberately make others misunderstand you?

610
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:52,792
Why did you hide

611
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,334
instead of seeing me?

612
00:34:57,918 --> 00:34:59,375
Bo Hai, do you know?

613
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:02,667
I’m so desperate!

614
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,876
That’s what life is always like.

615
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:14,918
The hope in your eyes

616
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:18,375
will get you into

617
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,167
deeper despair.

618
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,000
I’m going to sleep. Keep an eye on him.

619
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,626
Don’t worry. I’ll watch. Go ahead.

620
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,083
You can’t keep one man

621
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,042
with so many of you?

622
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,501
How useless you are!

623
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:56,959
Why don’t you go after him?

624
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,334
Don’t go!

625
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,125
Let him be.

626
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:03,250
Forget it.

627
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:05,167
Let him go.

628
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:15,709
Boss.

629
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,125
The game has been on for long.

630
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,542
It’s time to show the cards.

631
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,020
= Ji Bin =

632
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:41,375
Hello? Ji Bin.

633
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,542
Where are you?

634
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:11,959
Who the hell are you?

635
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,918
Who am I?

636
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,709
Didn’t Ji Bin tell you?

637
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:21,918
You’re Liu Yingjie.

638
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:23,209
The financial manager in Yunhe Flower Shop

639
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,209
twenty years ago.

640
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,918
What’s your relationship

641
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,250
with my dad and Lu Yunqing?

642
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:35,959
You can’t do everything

643
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:37,292
just to help me

644
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:38,959
take revenge.

645
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,709
Do you remember what I said

646
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:42,999
about my son?

647
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:44,999
If you were me,

648
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,751
how would you deal with the bastards

649
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,250
who refused to help my son?

650
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,375
Could that...

651
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,083
Yes.

652
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,292
The ones

653
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:01,751
who got my son dead

654
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,709
were Yin Changhe and Lu Yunqing.

655
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:17,501
I knew exactly how much

656
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:21,501
Yunhe Flower Shop had.

657
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,999
But they lied that they had no money.

658
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,292
It’s been twenty years.

659
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:32,417
Every time I close my eyes,

660
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:37,584
I can see their

661
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,834
indifferent and heartless faces.

662
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,250
And...

663
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:53,584
And...

664
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,000
My five-year-old son.

665
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,125
Before he died,

666
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,959
he took my hand

667
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:21,167
and said again and again.

668
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,459
He... He...

669
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,459
He didn’t want to die.

670
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:34,999
So,

671
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:38,000
you started

672
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,292
your revenge plan?

673
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:49,999
Exactly.

674
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:53,125
Twenty years ago,

675
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,834
I masterminded

676
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,709
the bad flower incident.

677
00:40:59,167 --> 00:40:59,918
Unexpectedly,

678
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,083
in only a few days,

679
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,792
Yunhe Flower Shop was badly discredited.

680
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,459
But I was too young

681
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,375
and I wasn’t careful enough.

682
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:19,709
Lu Yunqing had something on me.

683
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:23,000
She met Yin Changhe in the shop

684
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,709
for a secret discussion,

685
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,292
trying to tell on me.

686
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:41,584
Mom!

687
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:47,709

Mom!

689
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:52,834
