Zhang was hemmed about this,

I believe he’s hiding something.

Hello, Mr. Jin.

59
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:25,417
There is someone here in the 5th floor,

60
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,375
sneaking around.

61
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,083
He’s in white coat.

62
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:29,709
I don’t know.

63
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,292
You gotta stop him.

64
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:51,000
This is Bo Hai’s medical history.

65
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:56,542
Well done.

66
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,542
Pho… photo-rejuvenation?

67
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:09,334
That’s why Bo Hai’s skin is so good.

68
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,250
This is your little secret

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,918

Professional? Cute?

72
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,334
Awesome?

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,834
Should you give me

74
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:22,780
a little reward?

Sure. You cost for photo-rejuvenation this year,

00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,876
is on me.

80
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:32,042
I’m a born beauty,

81
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,999
do I need that?

82
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,125
I’ve figured it out,

83
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,751
too pretty is not a good thing.

84
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:36,751
Not fair to others.

85
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:37,792
Seriously,

86
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:39,876
Su Cheng just called me,

87
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,292
scolding me for an hour.

88
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,792
I gotta go to Changzhou now.

89
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,834
I’ll go back and pack.

90
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:46,292
You’re not going.

91
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:48,459
Why?

92
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,209
I’ll take Ling Lingqi.

93
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,250
But you used to take me.

94
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,083
I did,

95
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,584
but I think you’re too tired recently

96
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:57,792
so I’ll take someone else.

97
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,209
I’m not tired at all.

98
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:00,250
Yes, you are.

99
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:01,417
No, I’m not.

100
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,167
Yes, you are.

101
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,209
No, I’m not.

102
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,834
You are.

103
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:07,250
Okay, I am.

104
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,000
Have a good rest.

105
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:17,626
What?

106
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:19,709
Chomper is taking you for a business trip?

107
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,751
Only you?

108
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:24,375
He’s started

109
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,375
a VIP torment for Qi.

110
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,000
Based on my experience,

111
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,584
if a male superior takes only

112
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,167
a female subordinate for business trip,

113
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,834
there must be something bad will happen.

114
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,667
Seems Chomper

115
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,999
is ready to risk everything,

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,459
sacrificing himself to torture me?

117
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,999
You can’t say, I’m telling you.

118
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,209
It’s hard to judge his heart from his face.

119
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:58,918
Right in time,

120
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,125
I got a good stuff for you.

121
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,667
What is it?

122
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,042
Body Guard. Better than nothing.

123
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,792
You really want me to

124
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,626
go on a business trip with you?

125
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:29,626
I’m not here to discuss with you.

126
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:30,918
I’m here to notify you.

127
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:33,584
Oh,

128
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,334
I forgot to bring my purse,

129
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,584
my ID card is in it,

130
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,667
so I can’t get on the train.

131
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,626
Or you can ask Secretary Chen

132
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:39,626
to go with you.

133
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,334
You brought your brain?

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,501
Get in the car.

135
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,083
Bo Hai is taking Ling Lingqi on a business trip?

136
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,292
She’s just an assistant who does chores!

137
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:03,334
She’s not qualified for

138
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,751
a business trip with the CEO!

139
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:06,000
Qualified or not,

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,834
it’s up to

141
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,417
our boss.

142
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:12,751
Bo Hai has never

143
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,626
taken me alone on a trip before.

144
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,167
That’s because

145
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,501
he really can’t take you.

146
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:25,918
I can see through

147
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,834
Bo Hai better than an X-ray.

148
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,417
He’s not that kind of person.

149
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:30,792
I think he never

150
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,417
takes Ling Lingqi as a girl.

151
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,292
But,

152
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:35,999
we can’t say that

153
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:36,751
there is no possibility

154
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,375
he has feelings for Ling Lingqi.

155
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,167
No, my analysis is not accurate.

156
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:43,834
He’s not yet figured out

157
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,292
what is love about! Xinyan!

158
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,751
Top domestic

159
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:07,999
floriculture company!

160
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,751
Just some low-end

161
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:10,876
garbage!

162
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:13,959
Don’t pick it up!

163
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,209
I gave your flowers

164
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:20,751
to the one I like

165
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:21,918
for many times,

166
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,459
but he never accepted it.

167
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:24,959
You tell me,

168
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:26,584
if it isn’t your problem then what?

169
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,167
Not our problem.

170
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,792
It’s you he rejected.

171
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,918
Say it again?

172
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,626
Miss Su, don’t worry.

173
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,459
The purpose I’m here is

174
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:37,959
to communicate with you about this

175
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:38,918
and trust me,

176
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,292
we’ll make you

177
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,417
a satisfying bouquet.

178
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,459
Mr. Bo,

179
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,751
you better keep your promise.

180
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:49,042
Certainly,

181
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:50,792
I’ll assure you

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,999
with my personal reputation.

183
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,501
I’ll be expecting your new work.

184
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:57,999
Hope your capability

185
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:58,751
deserves

186
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,167
your brand reputation.

187
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:06,667
She’s so bad-tempered,

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,125
why you’re still coaxing her?

189
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,501
Because her father

190
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,167
is a long-term partner

191
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,626
of our company.

192
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,709
Wow, big client. Untouchable.

193
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:16,584
Because I

194
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,209
never reject a client.

195
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:18,834
If the client

196
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,000
has anything unsatisfied,

197
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:20,626
it must be our problem

198
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,792
that we haven’t done our best.

199
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:24,918
But she got such a bad temper.

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,876
We sell flowers,

201
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,125
not boyfriends.

202
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,501
What?

203
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,959
Do we have to help her pick up a guy?

204
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,083
Take it, you do it yourself.

205
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,000
I know

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,250
why you take me here!

207
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:41,459
You want me to be tortured

208
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,250
by her, do you?

209
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:46,250
Yeah, so what?

210
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:49,334
How’s a grown man

211
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,918
got such a narrow mind?

212
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,167
To Westin, sir.

213
00:08:58,542 --> 00:08:59,501
To Lotus Business first,

214
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:00,220
then drop him up.

215
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:02,167
Don’t you get it,

216
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,292
I’m your boss, okay?

217
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,209
Westin first.

218
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:05,584
So what?

219
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:07,751
You don’t want

220
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:08,584
this month’s bonus, do you?

221
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:09,959
Sir, Westin.

222
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,209
Fire me if you have guts.

223
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,834
To Lotus Business, sir.

224
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,876
I pay double fare, Westin!

225
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,083
Okay, stop, two of you.

226
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,792
To Lotus Business first, it’s on my way.

227
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,667
Bag, my bag!

228
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:16,626
Recently,

229
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,834
many single women have been attacked by perverts

230
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,083
in this city.

231
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,000
The police would like to remind

232
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,083
all female audiences

233
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,959
to be extra careful.

234
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,459
We also hope that the masses

235
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:25,375
can actively provide

236
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,042
information on these criminals.

237
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,292
Help! Help! Pervert!

238
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,459
Stop spraying, it’s me!

239
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,042
Chomper.

240
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,459
You’re so shameless.

241
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,209
How could you do

242
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,083
something so disgusting!

243
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,209
You lust for my beauty!

244
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,250
He ran away, you idiot!

245
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,667
Who ran away?

246
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,209
Mr. Bo, I’m sorry.

247
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,083
I’m really sorry, Mr. Bo.

248
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:24,542
I’m sorry, Mr. Bo.

249
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,000
Don’t touch me! You Just wait and see!

250
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,501
2.5, young man.

251
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,542
Give me money first.

252
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:04,375
Hey,

253
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,999
why you don’t pay for it?

254
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:22,918
Pay for it!

255
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:37,584
Pick it up.

256
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,626
Everyone is responsible
for protecting the environment,

257
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,250
don’t you know it?

258
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,209
Mo Nan,

259
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,375
you’re awesome!

260
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:56,417
Cool!

261
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,834
Uncle, here’s the money.

262
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:02,876
Thank goodness you’re here in time,

263
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,042
or this …

264
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,792
Just a hooligan.

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,959
Uncle, if anything like this happens,

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,667
call me.

267
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:08,584
Okay.

268
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:10,959
I’ll close this.

269
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,542
I’ll go back then.

270
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,501
- OK. Bye. - You go on.

271
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,083
He’s cool.

272
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,167
Based on the information I collected,

273
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,626
Bo Hai has been

274
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,584
acting strangely recently.

275
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,751
I don’t believe he went to the hospital

276
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,667
just for some photo-rejuvenation.

277
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:41,501
What’s your plan?

278
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:44,834
I calculated the time,

279
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,751
and found something interesting.

280
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,250
During those days,

281
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,000
Bo Hai suddenly

282
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,125
transferred the sales trainee Ling Lingqi

283
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,667
to work for him

284
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,542
as an assistant.

285
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,375
I don’t know it’s a coincidence or not.

286
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,167
You mean…

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,709
You suspect Ling Lingqi

288
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,042
knows Bo Hai’s secret?

289
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,792
Ling Lingqi is just a small potato.

290
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:11,459
She won’t know that much.

291
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,918
But it wouldn’t hurt to arrange someone

292
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,876
to investigate her.

293
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,542
The man Shi Ji met

294
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,292
in that shop

295
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,000
is Ling Lingqi’s father.

296
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,000
I’ll take care of Ling Lingqi.

297
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:23,876
You don’t have to get involved.

298
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,083
Right, I almost forget,

299
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,999
Mr. Mo is close to Ling Lingqi.

300
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,250
You’ve been living here

301
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,459
recently, right?

302
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:43,209
Do I need to report to you

303
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:44,292
my whereabouts?

304
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,375
I’m just concerned about you,

305
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,292
Mr. Mo.

306
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:53,959
You better are.

307
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,459
Then about Ling Lingqi,

308
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,334
I’ll leave her to you.

309
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,250
He said 9:30 a.m.,

310
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:42,792
it’s 10:00 now. Where is he?

311
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:00,709
Hello?

312
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,000
Hi Mr. Bo, where are you?

313
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,125
I’m heading back.

314
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:06,292
I was attacked

315
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,250
by a female pervert

316
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,417
last night,

317
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,709
now I need to see the doctor.

318
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:17,042
You’re heading back? Back to where?

319
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:18,918
What… What about me?

320
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,000
You? Of course you stay here

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,459
to serve Miss Su.

322
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,334
I’ve spoken with Miss Su.

323
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,167
From now on,

324
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,584
you are a florist

325
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,584
representing our company.

326
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,209
I’m telling you,

327
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:35,792
don’t you think I’m gone

328
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,125
so you can loaf on the job.

329
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,918
I’ve promised Miss Su,

330
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:39,542
you will make her

331
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:41,292
satisfied.

332
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,834
If you dare irritate

333
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,083
my big client,

334
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:45,584
I’ll sue your dad

335
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:46,792
as we agreed

336
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,417
in the contract.

337
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,876
You know what I’m capable of.

338
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,000
Bo Hai,

339
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:55,959
you planned this beforehand,

340
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,042
didn’ you?

341
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,375
You’re

342
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,959
so contemptible!

343
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:02,584
How could you

344
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,125
hide away from me,

345
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,380
you contemptible scum!

346
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,700
= Bo Hai =

347
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,042
You narrow-minded badass!

348
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,083
You’re a grownup!

349
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,417
My cellphone.

350
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,667
That’s why you didn’t take me.

351
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,584
Turns out you planned a special show.

352
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:34,959
But isn’t it too cruel

353
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,792
to treat

354
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,375
a little girl like this?

355
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,042
Of course, she’s cruel to you too.

356
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:42,918
I…

357
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:47,999
It must be an exciting fight last night!

358
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:49,334
What?

359
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,209
You want it too?

360
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:52,209
Nah…

361
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:54,584
You often bully her,

362
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,334
no wonder she took you as a pervert.

363
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:58,626
I didn’t know

364
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,250
you’re such a despicable person.

365
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,334
You’re despicable.

366
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,292
I mean,

367
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,167
do you have other intentions

368
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,250
to Ling Lingqi?

369
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,667
Have a guess.

370
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,584
Did you develop a feeling

371
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:14,834
for Ling Lingqi?

372
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:15,584
A feeling!

373
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,542
At first,

374
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,042
I insisted on having Mr. Bo

375
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,667
design it for me,

376
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,334
but he continuously recommended you.

377
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,083
He said you’re very talented

378
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,667
in flower art.

379
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,709
But I don’t see it.

380
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,083
I like to keep a low profile.

381
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,083
- OK, enough. - And I…

382
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:07,626
Stop bragging yourself.

383
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:08,584
Go do your work.

384
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:53,667
Not bad.

385
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:55,751
Help.

386
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:58,125
Awesome, am I?

387
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,125
That’s me, all right?

388
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,709
Can you tell them?

389
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,375
I thought it was me.

390
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:06,501
I…

391
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,000
Knocked you down.

392
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,501
This is your talent?

393
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,125
It’s not even

394
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,375
worthy of the trashcan.

395
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:44,501
If you

396
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,459
dare irrigate my big client,

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,959
I’ll sue your dad

398
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,209
as we agreed

399
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,918
in the contract.

400
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,667
I suddenly got inspired!

401
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,042
Xi, go borrow

402
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,876
two big trashcans!

403
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,667
Miss Ling’s inspiration

404
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,918
got no room to place.

405
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,918
Yeah, my idea this time

406
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:19,876
is definitely great!

407
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,042
I think if we want to make a bouquet

408
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,501
to make him happy,

409
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:24,292
shouldn’t we

410
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:25,542
think in his shoes?

411
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:31,542
Makes sense.

412
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,584
So I want to check on his file.

413
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,667
Only after I know him,

414
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,042
I can please him.

415
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,740
= Shop =

416
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:47,167
Last time,

417
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:48,375
thanks to Mo Nan,

418
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:50,375
my popsicles were saved.

419
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,792
This kid is nice.

420
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:54,959
You think he’s nice?

421
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:56,459
I don’t think so.

422
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,250
We can’t let him stay.

423
00:21:58,792 --> 00:21:59,459
I’m taking back the balcony.

424
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:02,125
Why?

425
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,584
He just helped me.

426
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,542
Now you want him to move?

427
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,834
You return evil for good.

428
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:07,999
It’s not good.

429
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:09,584
Ling Guoliang,

430
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:11,792
you know nothing.

431
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,209
You’re brainwashed by him,

432
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:14,292
you realized that?

433
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,834
He’s about to steal Qi away,

434
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,042
and you’re still talking for him?

435
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:17,667
But…

436
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,417
He’s living there,

437
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:20,167
what reason you have

438
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,167
to kick him out?

439
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,501
That room is mine.

440
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:25,083
If I want to stop renting,

441
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,250
there are always excuses.

442
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,667
The best tactic against a loser

443
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:30,542
like him is,

444
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:32,999
raise the rent.

445
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:36,542
Profiteer.

446
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:39,584
What did you say?

447
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,167
Say it again. Say it again.

448
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:47,834
Me?

449
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:48,083
Go.

450
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:48,834
You go. You go.

451
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,083
You go, go, go.

452
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:50,584
Useless.

453
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:13,999
Uncle, aunt.

454
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,959
Mo Nan, well… this…

455
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,042
That…

456
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,459
About this room,

457
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,167
I’ve discussed with your aunt

458
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,334
about next month’s rent.

459
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:27,999
Mo Nan.

460
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,334
Nothing.

461
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,083
We just come upstairs to check

462
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:34,459
how you’re doing here.

463
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,250
It’s quite nice.

464
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,542
Thank you, uncle, aunt.

465
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:43,792
You can leave.

466
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,334
Mo Nan, when you live here,

467
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:00,083
if you got electricity

468
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:00,876
or water leak,

469
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,250
or anything

470
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:03,709
like that,

471
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,959
you can tell your uncle,

472
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,000
he’ll get it solved.

473
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,417
Yeah, you can tell me.

474
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,792
Anything.

475
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,292
Right.

476
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,250
Since we live together,

477
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,626
we’re like a family, right?

478
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,125
Thank you, uncle, aunt.

479
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:18,834
You got anything else to say?

480
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:20,584
No?

481
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:22,959
We got nothing.

482
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:23,834
Really?

483
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,584
Nothing.

484
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:25,584
No.

485
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:26,250
Bye.

486
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:27,667
That’s it.

487
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:35,584
Wasn’t the leak fixed already?

488
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,334
Wait a moment.

489
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,334
What were you doing?

490
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:51,375
The pretty young man

491
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:52,959
came out of Mo Nan’s room,

492
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:53,918
you noticed him?

493
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:54,751
What about him?

494
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,375
He’s rich!

495
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,250
Why are you sighing?

496
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,751
Your daughter is single!

497
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,000
You must be alert.

498
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:05,501
Wait.

499
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:07,834
Wasn’t Bo Hai the son-in-law

500
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,000
of your heart?

501
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:13,834
Yes, he is.

502
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,417
But, why can’t I

503
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,584
have other options?

504
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:21,709
You’re in too much of a rush.

505
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:33,584
Please.

506
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,167
Aunt, this is…

507
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,209
Eat.

508
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,334
I made it for you.

509
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,083
All right.

510
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:48,999
Mo Nan,

511
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:50,167
you know,

512
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,918
your parents are not around.

513
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,999
It’s hard for you to work alone.

514
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:57,000
So

515
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,292
if you’d like something to eat,

516
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,459
just tell me,

517
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:00,751
I’ll make it for you.

518
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,542
Don’t eat those

519
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:04,459
instant noodles,

520
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,667
or takeout.

521
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,459
Not safe and not clean.

522
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,501
Mo Nan,

523
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,042
the pretty face we saw,

524
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,792
who is he?

525
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:20,459
He’s my friend.

526
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,417
Let me be straight.

527
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,876
I’m quite interested

528
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:31,876
in that guy.

529
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,876
I’d like to order a bouquet

530
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,250
to my husband.

531
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:52,709
We used to be very poor.

532
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,501
On my birthday,

533
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,334
he would pick up

534
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,959
a kapok on the roadside

535
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,459
for me as a gift.

536
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,584
At that time I always thought,

537
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,709
when I could receive flowers

538
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:05,417
like other girls.

539
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,792
Later as his business got better,

540
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,209
he finally bought a bouquet,

541
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,000
but it was not for me.

542
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:17,042
It’s his birthday tomorrow,

543
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,334
can you help me
= Relief Flower Shop =

544
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:19,626
return a bouquet to him,
= Relief Flower Shop =

545
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,751
along with the

546
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,584
signed divorce agreement?

547
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,709
I heard you dissed Mr. Relief florist

548
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:26,918
in front of Ling Lingqi?

549
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,626
Why?

550
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:29,709
You praised him

551
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:30,751
in front of Yi

552
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:31,751
days ago.

553
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:33,542
Did I?

554
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:34,417
Yeah.

555
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,667
Can you continue your acting, dude!

556
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:38,876
At least

557
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,042
keep it consistent.

558
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:45,292
You’re not

559
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,417
jealous of yourself

560
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,083
in front of Ling Lingqi, are you?

561
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,792
You’re bored.

562
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,209
Mr. Dong

563
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,709
has a girlfriend?

564
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:13,209
Yeah.

565
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,334
So what?

566
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:16,999
He has a girlfriend or not

567
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,125
has nothing to do with

568
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:19,918
whether I love him or not.

569
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:24,042
Since he got a girlfriend,

570
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,459
if he falls in love with someone else,

571
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,417
that’s betrayal.

572
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,125
That’s a secular concept!

573
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:37,250
I believe as long as I’m sincere,

574
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:39,250
he will definitely be touched.

575
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:41,792
This is true love.

576
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,250
She got no morals.

577
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:50,459
I got a headache.

578
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,792
My workload is too heavy today,

579
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:53,334
my brain

580
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,542
stops working.

581
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,999
It’s getting dark anyway,

582
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,083
how about we continue tomorrow?

583
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:01,709
Miss Ling,

584
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,334
don’t try my patience any further.

585
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:05,959
Tomorrow,

586
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:06,709
if you’re not able to

587
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:08,501
make the bouquet to get Mr. Dong pleased,

588
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:10,959
I’ll complain you to your company

589
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,751
and have Mr. Bo fire you.

590
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,209
If you really can

591
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,250
make Chomper fire me,

592
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,959
I thank you and your whole family.

593
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:22,375
Ok, I’ll leave then. Thanks.

594
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:40,834
This is the first time I’ve seen someone

595
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:41,375
talking so lightly about

596
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,209
stealing another one’s boyfriend.

597
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:44,751
He got a girlfriend,

598
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:45,501
of course he won’t be touched

599
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:46,584
by my flowers.

600
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:50,876
What if I did it great

601
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:52,709
and he really moves for that?

602
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:57,501
No.

603
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:58,501
Ling Lingqi,

604
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,834
you have principles!

605
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,125
Don’t ever think about it.

606
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:02,709
This is a trap.

607
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,584
An impossible mission.

608
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:07,959
Why me?

609
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:16,125
Chomper.

610
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:41,000
Stop!

611
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:43,042
Stop running!

612
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,542
Stop!

613
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:47,167
Move!

614
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:51,999
Stop!

615
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,584
Stop!

616
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:54,542
Stop!

617
00:30:59,334 --> 00:30:59,751
Where is he?

618
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,125
You, saw Zhan Zhao?

619
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:05,501
No, no.

620
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:06,000
No.

621
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,042
Little bastard.

622
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,709
Waiter, did you see Zhan Zhao?

623
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,876
Zhan Zhao?

624
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:21,626
He’s…

625
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:29,792
Running that way.

626
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:30,542
Let’s go!

627
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:49,375
Thanks.

628
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:38,542
What do you want?

629
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,042
I hold a deep grudge against you!

630
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,083
If I hand you over to your other enemies,

631
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,751
how could I be at ease?

632
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:53,959
I’ll torture you personally,

633
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:57,959
so I can vent the hated from deep my heart.

634
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,542
What?

635
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:15,834
What are you doing?

636
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,876
As I pick chrysanthemums
beneath the eastern fence,

637
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,834
my eyes fall leisurely on the Southern Mountain.

638
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:23,751
No.

639
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:30,751
Don’t!

640
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,417
Oops, I missed.

641
00:34:58,999 --> 00:34:59,834
Don’t panic.

642
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,501
Let me aim again.

643
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:10,999
No.

644
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,375
No!

645
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,709
I’m dead anyway,

646
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
how about a quick one?

647
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,834
Ling Lingqi,

648
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,999
I admire you for your boldness.

649
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,626
You’re here early today.

650
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:23,000
Miss Su, I can’t make the bouquet

651
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:23,918
you want.

652
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,876
Two days have I been waiting for,

653
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,834
now you tell me you can’t do it?

654
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:33,125
Not just me,

655
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:34,918
even if you hire a deity,

656
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:36,375
he won’t be able to do it, either.

657
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,876
It’s true that flowers are
the messenger of feelings,

658
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,999
but it delivers

659
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,000
love and good things,

660
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,626
not being used to steal another person’s love.

661
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:44,542
What do you mean?

662
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:45,792
This is how the best florist

663
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,000
in FlowerPlus can do?

664
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,459
Chomper…

665
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,167
Bo Hai lied to you,

666
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,751
I’m no florist.

667
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:54,501
I’m just an assistant

668
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:56,209
doing chores

669
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,250
in the company.

670
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:01,999
Although I’m not a

671
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:03,250
professional florist,

672
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,209
I have principles.

673
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:06,542
My flowers

674
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:07,459
can’t be used to steal

675
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,626
another person’s boyfriend.

676
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:11,042
What are you saying?

677
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,667
Keep your mouth clean.

678
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,417
Anyway, I’ve ruined the business

679
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,918
and offended you.

680
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,125
Although,

681
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,584
I can’t agree on your moral standards,

682
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:24,375
I sympathize with you.

683
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,542
I made a bouquet for you.

684
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,000
Ling Lingqi,

685
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,375
are you not afraid

686
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,709
I tell on you to Bo Hai?

687
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:39,999
Do as you please.

688
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:46,667
Ling Lingqi, just wait!

689
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,542
I’ll discredit your company,

690
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,334
and make it go bankrupt!

691
00:37:59,584 --> 00:37:59,999
Miss Su.

692
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:00,918
Bo Hai!

693
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:02,999
You asked an assistant

694
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:04,209
to play florist?

695
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,125
And she’s offensive to me!

696
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,292
I’m telling you!

697
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:08,959
If this is how you handle business,

698
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,000
I’m not done with you!

699
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:22,501
Having Ling Lingqi

700
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,375
work for that spoiled Miss Su?

701
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,459
You can easily guess

702
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,542
what interesting thing happened.

703
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,083
But Bo Hai has always valued his clients,

704
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:32,334
especially

705
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:33,709
Su Cheng’s dad,

706
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,334
how could he send Ling Lingqi,

707
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:36,834
this troublemaker to do this job?

708
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:39,709
He’s careless?

709
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:40,834
Bo Hai would never make

710
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,000
such a stupid mistake.

711
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:43,751
You mean he did it on purpose?

712
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,250
Qi, Qi.

713
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,626
Are you tired from the trip?

714
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,542
Go have some rest.

715
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:11,584
Go sleep.

716
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,083
Is she sick?

717
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:22,751
Dad,

718
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:23,834
Mom.

719
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,167
I’m sorry.

720
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:29,709
Sorry?

721
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,876
What are you talking about?

722
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,542
Sorry for what?

723
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:35,083
Isn’t it all about

724
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,626
your job?

725
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,209
I can’t take it anymore!

726
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,542
If I keep working for him,

727
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:40,792
I’ll get endocrine disorders.

728
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,999
Qi, don’t say nonsense.

729
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,334
Worst case scenario, get another job.

730
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:45,626
It’s not that simple.

731
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:46,999
If I lose my job, my

732
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,083
dad’s shop

733
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,000
will be gone too.

734
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:52,083
Wh… What?

735
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:53,959
I ruined one of

736
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:54,501
the company’s orders.

737
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,542
Chomper said,

738
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,125
he’ll sue my dad

739
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,375
for selling counterfeits.

740
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,167
I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

741
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:18,300
= Clearance Sale =

742
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,000
Looks like my little shop

743
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,125
can’t be saved.

744
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,292
Clearance Sale?

745
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:32,417
Hurry up!

746
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,334
Don’t push!

747
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,918
What’s wrong with you!

748
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:38,876
Hello, Lijuan?

749
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:39,834
Hurry up!

750
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,584
Ling’s shop

751
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,083
is having a clearance sale!

752
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:43,918
Hurry up!

753
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,417
Before it’s too late.

754
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:46,417
Come on! See you later!

755
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:58,999
I’m kind of experienced

756
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,584
in this battlefield.

757
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,334
I wasn’t favoured by chances when I’m young,

758
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:08,876
then encounter business setbacks when I’m old.

759
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,000
