Qi,

52
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,167
I can’t take this no more.

53
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,626
They are bullying you like this.

54
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,334
Are you going to take it?

55
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,417
No.

56
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,167
We are going to fight back.

57
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:49,918
Fight back!

58
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,709
With fist or words?

59
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:52,584
It doesn’t matter.

60
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:52,999
There are only three of us.

61
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:53,709
Can we really beat

62
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:54,792
tens of them?

63
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,459
Then what shall we do?

64
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,999
The last time I copied textbook

65
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,918
was on primary school.

66
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:35,626
Why do we have to

67
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,250
be so cowardly?

68
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,334
It is a strategy, just a strategy.

69
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:42,834
I am the target

70
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:43,918
of the company now.

71
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,501
I don’t have enough evidence

72
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,334
to prove my innocence.

73
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,501
Offending them all

74
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,167
will only backfire on me.

75
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,000
I believe God will

76
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,125
prove my innocence

77
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,751
when the truth is unveiled.

78
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,626
You have such great confidence

79
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,375
in God.

80
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,459
The company will found

81
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,501
a crisis response group right away

82
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,125
and I will be the group leader.

83
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,125
The managers of PR, sales, shop management,

84
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,626
finance and GM office

85
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:22,959
will all attend this group

86
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,918
until the impacts of the crisis
are thoroughly eliminated.

87
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,459
The PR Department

88
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,626
must compile the standard response to the media

89
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,542
and contact some key media

90
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,167
within one hour.

91
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:31,959
At three o’clock this afternoon,

92
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,626
we will hold the first press conference.

93
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:34,042
OK.

94
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,959
The Sales Department

95
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,209
needs to explain

96
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,792
to the suppliers on the media response

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and visit a few

98
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,250
key partners.

99
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,167
FlowerPlus We Media needs to post an article

100
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,999
to notify the users of our solution

101
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,959
so as to maintain the users’ trust in us.

102
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:48,999
Let’s go.

103

Do you feel very satisfied

104
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,459
to see me this way?

105
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,542
Am I so easily satisfied?

106
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:21,918
Your personal pains

107
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,751
are just nominal

108
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:24,999
compared with the losses of our company.

109
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,083

110
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,584
good for nothing!

to give these two girls
two additional days of leave.

Brave and righteous deeds

120
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,626
surely deserve our encouragement.

121
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,334

122
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,751

solve this problem?

solve this problem?

Boss,

133
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,292
I think you have gone too far today.

134
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:24,417
You don’t have to

135
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:25,626
hide it away from Ling Lingqi.

136
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:26,792
Just tell her the truth.

137
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:27,959
You don’t have to keep her so upset.

138
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,375
I have no confidence in her

139
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,250
acting skills.

140
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,292
You have gone too far in your acting

141
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,125
and you complain about her acting skills?

142
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,292
It is a full acting on my part.

143
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,834
It is full acting on your part,

144
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,751
but she has to

145
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:39,792
suffer from it.

146
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,542
I will treat her well.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,584
It sounds so scary.

148
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,375
No more nonsense!

149
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,417
Have you finished

150
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,125
what I told you to do?

151
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:51,834
I talked to him about it

152
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,334
and he asked me to wait for one to two more days.

153
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:55,375
Ask them to hurry up.

154

Wait a minute.

155
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:57,626
Ask a repairman to come here.

156
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,501
OK.

157
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,876

158
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:13,501
Really?

159
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,250
Great!

160
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,709
Yes.

161

162

I have no idea.

Who is so talented?

164
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,999
I don’t know.

165
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:37,709
Director Sisi,

166
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,250
the copier is repaired.

167
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:40,292
Do you still expect me

168
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,876
to scribble out a manual copy?

169
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,375
God never pushes me to the corner.

170
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:53,209
Although everybody is

171
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,542
blinded by Chomper

172
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,667
and couldn’t distinguish right from wrong,

173
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:56,918
there are still sober-minded and

174
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,834
good people.

175
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,209
Who is it on earth?

176
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,417
Yes, a real hero

177
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,751
is always hesitant to disclose his identity.

178
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,501
There is no need to know the truth.

179
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,626
It is enough to know

180
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,584
there are always good people in the world.

181
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:16,542
Why are you still here?

182
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,083
Peter has left.

183
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:19,999
He won’t come back to the hotel tonight.

184
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,792
Also, Peter

185
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,918
won’t meet you.

186
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,626
It is no use waiting here any longer.

187
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:26,876
Please kindly

188
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,209
tell Peter.

189
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,417
He may refuse to meet us.

190
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,083
But we will keep waiting here

191
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:32,209
until he gives us a chance

192
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,417
to apologize.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,918
Qi, what is wrong with you?

194
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,083
You have been down

195
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,876
these days.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,792
What’s up?

197
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,584
So tired from work.

198
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,250
Listen, dear.

199
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:01,792
If you have no rest time now,

200
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,083
you will fall ill

201
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,709
sooner or later.

202
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,375
Take some actions.

203
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,459
Qi, you dad bought

204
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,417
some walnuts today.

205
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,334
I have reserved some for you

206
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,334
because you love it.

207
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,834
Yes, yes, give them to me.

208
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:13,417
I help you shell them.

209
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:17,292
Qi,

210
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,375
You haven’t talked about

211
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,584
working overnight

212
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,083
with your handsome leader

213
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,167
these days.

214
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:26,918
Overwork anymore?

215
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:27,876
If he overworks again,

216
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,375
I can’t help killing him.

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,417
Why?

218
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,501
I just want to killhim.

219
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,626
Come on, listen,

220
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,792
walnuts are best for your intelligence.

221
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,626
Hurry up and eat more walnuts

222
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,751
to improve your intelligence

223
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:41,959
for work

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,209
and love.

225
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:50,918
Mom.

226
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:52,709
Do you think a walnut cracked by a door

227
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,834
can improve my intelligence?

228
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,209
But…

229
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,209
No more hesitation!

230
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:00,250
Just play it as required.

231
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,626
We have contacted the police.

232
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,375
But no progress so far.

233
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,083
Boss.

234
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,542
It is too late today.

235
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,209
Let’s go back for a sleep.

236
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,375
Wait.

237
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,459
Didn’t you hear what he said that

238
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,918
Peter wouldn’t come back today?

239
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:24,751
Wait.

240
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,460
= Tea =

241
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:13,542
Zhan Zhao!

242
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:14,876
There is no escape for you,

243
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,918
thief!

244
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,918
Zhan Zhao,

245
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:34,959
give me the Chrysanthemum Book

246
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,042
you have stolen.

247
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,584
Bai Yutang, don’t defame me.

248
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,334
I have never seen anything like

249
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:40,584
Chrysanthemum Book.

250
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,334
What’s in your front pocket

251
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,209
then?

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,292
Don’t argue anymore!

253
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:55,292
Bai Yutang, you…

254
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,375
Me? Me what?

255
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:57,876
The evidences are so clear

256
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,250
that you can’t argue no more.

257
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,250
Bros, beat him.

258
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,709
Stop.

259
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,417
Don’t beat my face.

260
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,375
Bo Hai,

261
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,459
just enjoy the feeling

262
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:18,918
of being wronged today.

263
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,125
It is really nice to hear

264
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,501
the pitiful screams.

265
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:24,501
Bai,

266
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:25,959
we seem to have beaten the wrong person.

267
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:32,250
The book in Zhan Zhao’s pocket

268
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:33,375
is Three Hundred Tang Poems.

269
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,700
= Three Hundred Tang Poems =

270
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,542
I am wronged.

271
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,292
You didn’t steal

272
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,542
Chrysanthemum Book.

273
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,083
It’s a waste of feelings that I have always

274
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,876
taken you as the murderer.

275
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:19,417
Beat him.

276
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,542
No, why do you still want to beat me?

277
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:26,083
Anyway,

278
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,209
we aren’t good guys.

279
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:27,959
Doing something despicable

280
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,334
fits in with our nature.

281
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,000
Go to hell. Go to hell.

282
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:53,709
Just go to hell.

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,375
Does it feel good to be wronged?

284
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,709
No.

285
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:06,584
Hero, show mercy on me!

286
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,417
Mercy?

287
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,792
You deserve a good beating

288
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,459
because of your stark lies and brazen murders.

289
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,292
Keep this lesson in mind.

290
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,042
Wait.

291
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:22,959
It’s you who have committed brazen murders.

292
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,375
What a good dream!

293
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,542
Qi, have you got up?

294
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:52,667
It’s time to go to work.

295
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,334
Go to work!

296
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,209
Bo Hai, Bo Hai,

297
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,083
Peter is coming!

298
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:47,292
Peter!

299
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:49,792
I know you

300
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,292
must have been very disappointed

301
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,876
with me and FlowerPlus for it.

302
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:53,751
I am very sorry.

303
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:54,334
Mr. Bo,

304
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,626
I don’t need your apology.

305
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,000
I just feel sorry

306
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,334
for my blind trust.

307
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,626
I will improve

308
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,792
my ability to judge my partner.

309
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:04,584
I know.

310
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:05,209
We’ll

311
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,626
find a solution for it asap

312
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,042
and try to cover your losses.

313
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,250
I’ll talk to the lawyer

314
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,375
about AiFan’s losses today.

315
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,751
I hope the court will teach you

316
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,501
the appalling cost

317
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,042
of deception.

318
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:33,167
Xinyan,

319
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:34,250
don’t go there

320
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,083
and make him feel worse.

321
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,584
Just leave him alone to calm down.

322
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,667
I have an idea.

323
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:57,792
Come on.

324
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:01,667
It has started.

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,834
Boss, it is unfair.

326
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:03,334
You started

327
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:03,959
before I was ready!

328
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,667
You are not skillful enough.

329
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,709
Practice more.

330
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:07,042
Let’s do it again.

331
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:09,751
If Peter

332
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:10,834
really charge us

333
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:11,876
and ask for compensations,

334
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:12,459
what will be the impacts

335
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,417
on our company?

336
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,542
First of all, the senior management

337
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:17,459
will spend a lot of energies

338
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,334
during the period of response

339
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:19,751
and our businesses will certainly be affected.

340
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,375
Secondly, if we lose the suit,

341
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:21,999
the compensation

342
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,000
must be enormous

343
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,334
and it is asked to paid

344
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:24,959
in cash.

345
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,584
It will be a fatal blow

346
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,417
to our cash flow.

347
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,083
The last impact is even worse

348
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,167
because the media will

349
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,292
report on us negatively for at least 2 months,

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,209
and our corporate image

351
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:36,501
will certainly be spoiled up.

352
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,042
Right.

353
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:38,918
Who will cooperate

354
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,250
with a company

355
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,209
that leaks client’s secrets?

356
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,459
Because of DREAM,

357
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,125
our stock price has been on the decline.

358
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,167
If AiFan and FlowerPlus

359
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,584
really resort to the court,

360
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,042
our stock price will

361
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,334
have a couple of limit downs.

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,375
Wen Guangqi

363
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,417
won’t stop

364
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,876
before we are busted up!

365
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,083
Xinyan,

366
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:00,918
if we allow everybody

367
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:01,417
to know

368
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,626
Wen Guangqi is

369
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:03,999
behind all these things,

370
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:04,876
will we

371
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,042
be exempted from all liabilities?

372
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,542
Wen Guangqi is also

373
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:09,959
our staff.

374
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:10,918
The company has to be liable

375
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,584
for its employee’s secret leaking behavior.

376
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,667
In that case,

377
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:15,334
it is meaningless

378
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,709
to hold him responsible for it.

379
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:19,999
Not necessarily.

380
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,042
It is good for our PR work.

381
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,542
The media will certainly

382
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:25,667
prefer a headline

383
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,999
that claims a bad employee’s
being a hidden traitor

384
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,083
and taking advantage of his position

385
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,584
to bring a lawsuit to the company.

386
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,959
The public is always sympathetic to the weak,

387
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,375
particularly the kindhearted ones.

388
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:35,751
It must be

389
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:36,417
a good plus

390
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,667
to our brand value.

391
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,584
Xinyan, you are a real professional.

392
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,334
Yi, it is lunch time,

393
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,083
let’s go out for lunch.

394
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,375
Go, let’s go.

395
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,334
We are leaving for lunch first.

396
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:49,876
OK.

397
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,500
= Little Pals =

398
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,580
= Little Pals =
Let’s have lunch together.

399
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,060
Crisis PR

400
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,020
keeps me busy.

401
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,000
I still have the enrollment archives
of 3 employees

402
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,334
to input.

403
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,959
Qi, will you have lunch?

404
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,083
There is a Thai restaurant

405
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,375
downstairs.

406
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,083
Let’s go and have a try, OK?

407
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:32,792
What a good person you are!

408
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,000
I am a considerate person

409
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,709
who cares for girls. Let’s go.

410
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,417
OK.

411
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:44,334
Ling Lingqi,

412
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,042
Director Zhou asks you to go to the warehouse.

413
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:48,792
Got it.

414
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:49,834
No problem, do it now.

415
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,501
I will wait for you here.

416
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,959
Let me carry your bag for you. You can go.

417
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,209
OK, sorry for that.

418
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,125
Want to enjoy Thai cuisines?

419
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:00,250
Just enjoy the Dark Cuisine in the warehouse.

420
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:14,626
Director Zhou.

421
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:17,792
I have something to talk to you.

422
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:19,542
Is there anything so secret

423
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:20,709
that we have to talk about it here?

424
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:21,792
Because what you have done

425
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,125
is despicable,

426
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:24,876
and I am going to talk about

427
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,417
a despicable deal with you.

428
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:27,125
I am not the one

429
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,125
who did it.

430
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,083
I don’t want to have your excuse.

431
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,000
Ling Lingqi,

432
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,292
you have nobody else behind you

433
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,626
except Wen Guangqi.

434
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,125
If you publicly acknowledge

435
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,751
what you have done

436
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,042
before the media

437
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,876
and disclose Wen Guangqi

438
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,250
as the person behind you,

439
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,792
I will persuade Bo Hai

440
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:43,999
to forgive

441
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,209
your secret leaking behavior.

442
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,459
Why do I have to acknowledge

443
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:47,667
something I haven’t done?

444
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,375
Why are you still so stubborn now?

445
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:50,792
It is your last chance.

446
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,876
I hope you can think about carefully

447
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,083
and don’t waste it again.

448
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,083
I won’t agree

449
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,167
whatever return it is.

450
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,501
Ling Lingqi, do you know

451
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:58,292
your behaviors

452
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,667
influenced the company greatly?

453
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,042
Peter is going to file a suit against FlowerPlus

454
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:02,876
and FlowerPlus is facing

455
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:03,542
staggering compensations

456
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:04,709
and the hostility of DREAM.

457
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,876
I am very sorry

458
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,125
for our company’s situations now.

459
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:07,999
But

460
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:08,999
it really has nothing

461
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:09,751
to do with me.

462
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,125
Ling Lingqi,

463
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,167
we really have no way out.

464
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,626
I beg you.

465
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:20,999
Whether

466
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,792
you have done it or not,

467
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:23,626
you may save the company

468
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,751
if you stand out

469
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:26,417
and charge Wen Guangqi.

470
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:29,709
I also want to save our company.

471
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:31,209
But I can’t

472
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:32,250
save our company

473
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,042
by telling a tie.

474
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:35,292
Sorry.

475
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:42,042
Forget it.

476
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:42,792
Forget what I said

477
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:43,918
today.

478
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:45,584
Since you are here,

479
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:46,709
go and clean up.

480
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:08,792
Director Zhou!

481
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,417
Director Zhou!

482
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,000
Director Zhou, what are you doing?

483
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,167
Nothing special.

484
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,250
So long as you stand out

485
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,334
and charge Wen Guangqi,

486
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:17,584
I will let you out.

487
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,000
Whatever you do to force me,

488
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,584
I won’t do as you wish.

489
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,209
Wen Guangqi is a despicable person,

490
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,876
so are you!

491
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,834
Think about it carefully inside,

492
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,709
and let’s see

493
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:30,459
who gives up first.

494
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,667
Zhou Xinyan, open the door!

495
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,667
Open the door!

496
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:36,250
Zhou Xinyan!

497
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,250
Open the door!

498
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:45,667
Open the door!

499
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,501
Yi,

500
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:02,459
do you know

501
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:03,375
where Ling Lingqi is?

502
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,375
Maybe she has gone to the washroom?

503
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,334
I am not sure.

504
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,209
What a silly girl!

505
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,375
Open the door.

506
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,542
Somebody!

507
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,417
Baoni,

508
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,125

where are you?

510

Fan Chen just heard about

511
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,000
what had happened to AiFan Household

512
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,792
and called for complaint.

513
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:36,876
I must go

514
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:38,209
and talk to him about it.

515
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:39,667
OK, I will ask Zhang

516
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,417
to prepare a car for you.

517
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,042
No, I will drive myself.

= Applied Colors for Floral Arts =

519
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:16,501
Yi,

520
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:18,542
do you know

521
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:24,542
where Ling Lingqi is on earth?

522
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:34,125
Where are you going?

523
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:35,834
We are going to visit Fan Chen!

524
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,792
Visit Fan Chen?

525
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,250
Well, carry the financial statement

526
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:41,417
of the previous quarter with you.

527
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,999
The data of the previous quarter are very good.

528
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:44,999
I will print them out for you.

529
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,125
Wait for me here.

530
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,209
There are a lot of files.

531
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:48,792
So it may take a while.

532
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:49,542
No, wait.

533
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:51,020
= File Bag =
I have had them prepared.

534
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:53,375
Let’s go.

535
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,918
Well, I will go with you.

536
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:58,209
I want to change my clothes.

537
00:26:58,209 --> 00:26:59,980
Go to my office and wait for me!

538
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,501
We go to your office

539
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:02,667
and wait for you to change your clothes?

540
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:03,792
Are you nuts?

541
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,626
I think

542
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,501
you are a little strange today!

543
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:11,292
No.

544
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:14,751
Go.

545
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:16,459
What is the sound?

546
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:32,042
It’s… It’s the broadcast.

547
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,626
The broadcast over there!

548
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:36,209
Help!

549
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:37,042
It seems somebody

550
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:37,792
is calling for help.

551
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,292
It sounds like Ling Lingqi.

552
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,375
No, it’s the broadcast.

553
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:35,250
Qi.

554
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:38,751
You are too silly.

555
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:40,667
You should have disclosed me.

556
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,209
I am not silly at all.

557
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:44,834
It is enough

558
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:45,751
for me to suffer from it.

559
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:46,292
If I had disclosed you,

560
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,125
both of us would have had to suffer.

561
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:50,417
But if you had disclosed me,

562
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,584
they wouldn’t have all

563
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:52,918
blamed you

564
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,000
alone.

565
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:57,584
Anyway,

566
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,417
I am already used to

567
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:00,751
be bullied by Chomper.

568
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,334
His little tricks

569
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:03,876
no longer

570
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:04,959
work on me well.

571
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,125
Look at your face.

572
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,751
It is dirty all over.

573
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:10,834
’Stop smiling.

574
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,667
It looks worse than crying.

575
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,125
Your idea?

576
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:44,667
I believe

577
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:45,834
Ling Lingqi will stand out

578
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,292
and charge Wen Guangqi

579
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,167
only in this way.

580
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:50,501
You are one of the

581
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:51,751
founders of the company

582
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,900
and director of the Marketing Department.

583
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,626
= Chairman of the Board CB=
And you use such a

584
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,834
= Chairman of the Board CB=
despicable means.

585
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,620
= Chairman of the Board CB=

586
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,209
If others can

587
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:57,918
frame us up in a mean way,

588
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,334
we have no reason to behave ourselves.

589
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:01,000
It is a time

590
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,417
of life and death.

591
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:03,417
We don’t have to subject ourselves

592
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,501
to any restriction.

593
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:05,709
Your behaviors

594
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,501
have constituted the crime of illegal detention.

595
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:08,375
Got it?

596
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,000
I know it is my fault.

597
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,250
I will explain to Ling Lingqi later.

598
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:16,751
If Wen Guangqi

599
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:17,709
hadn’t forced us to the corner,

600
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:18,834
I wouldn’t have been at a loss,

601
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,626
nor would I have used such means.

602
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:25,000
Bo Hai,

603
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:27,999
do you feel sorry

604
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,292
for Ling Lingqi?

605
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:30,999
Keep your hands off

606
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,250
this business in the future.

607
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,667
OK, it is my fault

608
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,060
and so I have suffered from it.

609
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,500
Bo Hai, we have been coworkers

610
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,940
for so many years.

611
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,125
Although you are always strict with your staff,

612
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,751
it is the first time that

613
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,584
you are so serious with me!

614
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:51,667
Xinyan.

615
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:04,292
Xinyan.

616
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:06,626
I know

617
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:07,417
you did it for good wishes.

618
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:08,667
But detention is illegal

619
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,292
and you shouldn’t challenge the law.

620
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,000
You are my most reliable aide

621
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,125
and my most trustworthy partner.

622
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,334
The company is facing a time

623
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:22,542
of life and death now.

624
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,459
If you are at a loss,

625
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,542
so will I be very soon.

626
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,959
I appreciate your good wishes.

627
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:32,125
But you shouldn’t

628
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,334
do something wrong
on the excuse of such good wishes.

629
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:38,083
It is my fault.

630
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,420
I will apologize to Ling Lingqi.

631
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:47,417
Sorry, I…

632
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:48,209
I just arrived

633
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,209
and I have heard nothing.

634
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,834
Do you like any lollypop, durian flavor?

635
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:05,667
Whether it is a big or small shop,

636
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,083
you need to work hard first,

637
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,292
and then you need to know how to work hard.

638
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,125
Many a mickle makes a muckle,

639
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,584
and a penny saved is a penny earned.

640
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,501
Without small steps…

641
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,751
Read in silence.

642
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:20,709
Don’t read it out.

643
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,083
I am watching TV.

644
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,708
I have nobody to choose

645
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:26,280
except you.

646
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:27,828
Just marry you for convenience’s sake.

647
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:33,709
Qi is back.

648
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:40,880
You’d better give me a punch

649
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,211
so that I lose my memory

650
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,400
and everything will be settled.

651
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:47,417
Two people. It seems Mo Nan is also here.

652
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:49,626
Mo Nan?

653
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:52,709
Mo Nan!

654
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:56,334
Open the door!

655
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,584
What’s up, Mom? What are you doing?

656
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,584
Is it a general cleaning for you two?

657
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,042
Good evening, uncle and aunt!

658
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:19,167
Mo Nan, what a coincidence!

659
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,959
Come in and sit for a while.

660
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:25,584
It is too late.

661
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,042
But thank you anyway.

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,167
Good night, uncle and aunt.

663
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:30,584
OK, good night.

664
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:31,667
Bye.

665
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:32,584
Good-bye, uncle and aunt.

666
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:33,709
Good-bye.

667
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:40,792
I remember

668
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,667
I have told you many times

669
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,042
that keep you distant

670
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,250
with Mo Nan.

671
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,584
We are just friends.

672
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:50,125
Don’t make a fuss about it.

673
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,083
OK, I believe you.

674
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,417
You are just friends

675
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:54,959
and you have no special feeling towards him.

676
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,125
But are you sure

677
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,959
he has no special feeling towards you?

678
00:33:59,083 --> 00:33:59,542
Qi,

679
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,083
what your mom said is right.

680
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,167
See, we

681
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,209
have such a big house

682
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,584
and your dad has the shop

683
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,667
which is a big business.

684
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,250
It will be a great fortune for Mo Nan

685
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:12,918
if he can marry you.

686
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:14,417
Don’t feel too

687
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:15,959
good about yourself.

688
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:17,751
He is my friend.

689
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:18,501
Don’t doubt about

690
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:19,792
other people’s good faith.

691
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,083
Don’t blame your parents.

692
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,125
Whatever we say,

693
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:22,959
it is all for your good.

694
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:23,751
Yes!

695
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,167
He is my friend.

696
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,626
Can you take back your doubts?

697
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,417
So what?

698
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:29,334
I am your mother,

699
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,667
and you should follow what I say.

700
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,626
Forget it. Don’t resort to physical conflict.

701
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,334
You used this

702
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,999
despicable way against me.

703
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:49,918
Should I do the

704
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:50,542
same and

705
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,209
destroy you?

706
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,167
A person like her

707
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,167
should leave

708
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:58,250
the company now.

709
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:01,250
The copier is out of order.

710
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:02,792
Take this and write it 20 times.

711
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,459
Because recently, there was

712
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:05,792
a confidential leak.

713
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:06,876
I believe it is necessary

714
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,334
to issue Personnel Regulations again

715
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,292
to rectify the company’s discipline.

716
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:13,626
If you publicly acknowledge

717
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:14,292
what you have done

718
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,501
before the media

719
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,334
and disclose Wen Guangqi

720
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:18,667
as the person behind you,

721
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,209
I will persuade Bo Hai

722
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:22,584
to forgive

723
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:23,751
your secret leaking behavior.

724
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,125
Is my mother justified

725
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,542
to wrong me?

726
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:04,250
Hurry.

727
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:05,167
Come here!

728
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:08,125
Stand here!

729
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,250
Why?

730
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,000
What did I say? Nothing!

731
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:13,584
OK,

732
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:15,250
I prove

733
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:16,999
you really said nothing.

734
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:20,792
Our little girl

735
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,542
has been increasingly weak these days.

736
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:24,918
She wasn’t like this before.

737
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,375
It is understandable.

738
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,000
She has great work pressures,

739
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:29,918
so she feels sad.

740
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,542
Just control your babbling.

741
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,334
She is just an assistant.

742
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,209
What pressures does she have?

743
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,042
Frankly,

744
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,167
it must have something to do with Bo Hai.

745
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:40,167
Kind of love affairs.

746
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,626
I agree with you.

747
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,167
Qi’s emotions

748
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:45,792
have fluctuated

749
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:46,709
substantially and unpredictably

750
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:47,792
these two days.

751
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,792
Uncle, Ling Lingqi and I

752
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:13,709
are just friends indeed.

753
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,459
I don’t care about it.

754
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:19,334
How have Qi been getting along

755
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,584
in the company these days?

756
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,542
Very good.

757
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:29,250
Very good?

758
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:31,375
Really?

759
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:36,209
You are lying!

760
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,459
You didn’t look at me when you were speaking.

761
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:45,209
I am your landlord.

762
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:46,292
Got it?

763
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,751
Your boss is your superior

764
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:51,209
in the company in the daytime.

765
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,751
When you are back here in the nighttime,

766
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:54,834
I am your superior.

767
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:56,876
Listen,

768
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,209
if you dare tell a lie to me,

769
00:37:58,626 --> 00:37:59,999
I won’t show mercy on you.

770
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,125
I can drive you out

771
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,501
onto the street right now. Do you believe it?

772
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:04,375
Tell me!

773
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:08,083
I…

774
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,083
Uncle.

775
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,751
Things aren’t that serious.

776
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,709
Not serious?

777
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,751
It is trade secret infringement!

778
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:29,083
I have been studying on this issue

779
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,209
in the past two years!

780
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,042
Listen,

781
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,334
your client can file a civil lawsuit

782
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,459
against you!

783
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,209
Do your colleagues

784
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:37,959
hate her

785
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,167
very much now?

786
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:42,501
No.

787
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,167
She kept silent

788
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,000
on such a big issue

789
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,542
when she was back home.

790
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,375
I wonder how she has managed

791
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,542
to survive these days.

792
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:56,751
Breakfast's ready!

793
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:58,751
Breakfast's ready!

794
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,334
Shoes of a limited version, Dad!

795
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:14,292
Like it?

796
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,042
I bought it for you.

797
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,250
What a big liar!

798
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,250
Do you think he will buy for you?

799
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,792
I forced him

800
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,542
to buy it for you. Like it?

801
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:24,918
Yes.

802
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:26,792
I had planned

803
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,042
to give the shoes to you

804
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,125
as your birthday gift.

805
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,292
But your mother said

806
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:32,083
Qi had performed well these days

807
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:33,751
both at work and home,

808
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,125
so we decided to give them to you

809
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,042
as your reward earlier.

810
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:39,542
Let’s go and eat.

811
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,667
Cry with joy?

812
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:49,751
Dad, Mom,

813
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,250
have you known it all?

814
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,792
- Yes. - No.

815
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,209
Sorry.

816
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,167
I have been good for nothing since my childhood.

817
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:09,542
I am impulsive and stubborn

818
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:11,000
and sometimes even silly.

819
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:13,375
I had attended the exam for 3 times
before I entered FlowerPlus.

820
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:15,042
And the dream lover
I had a secret crush on for 4 years

821
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:16,834
turns out to be a jerk.

822
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,626
The assistant to president

823
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:20,459
is actually just

824
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,209
an errand girl.

825
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,125
And I was even mistaken as a hidden traitor.

826
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:30,999
I, I…

827
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,417
I am really good for nothing.

828
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,542
OK, dear.

829
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:37,167
Forget it.

830
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:40,000
Qi,

831
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,999
we don’t know

832
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,667
what happened to you in the company.

833
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,292
But we know

834
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,292
our child well.

835
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:50,250
Although you have many weaknesses,

836
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,667
you are

837
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,250
the kindest girl.
