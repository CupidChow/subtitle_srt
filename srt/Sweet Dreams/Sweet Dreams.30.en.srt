51

But everyone in the company knows

52
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,292
I like Mo Nan.

53
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:46,876
I can’t do that casually.

54
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,209
What if...

55
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,626
What if Mo Nan knows...

56
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,626
No, I can’t do that.

57
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:50,167
But...

58
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,209
Mo Nan is back to his hometown.

59
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:53,751
How will he know?

60
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:54,501
Besides,

61
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,042
he’s a rational man

62
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,709
and he’s always helpful.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,834
If he knows

64
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,167
it concerns the happiness of four guys,

65
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,375
he will certainly help.

66
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:10,792
Baoni.

67
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:17,667
Give you an inch,

68
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,918
and you will take a yard.

69
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,792
But we’re still besties.

70
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,459
That’s what besties do.

71
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:29,042
How will you thank me?

72
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,000
I’ll buy you crawfishes

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,167
for a few meals.

74
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:32,584
Go.

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,375
OK. Go.

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:53,459
Hello, Secretary Chen.

77
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:02,959
What’s going on?

78
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:05,250
Cut this.

79
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:06,751
Super gossip!

80
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,125
I just saw Secretary Chen and Lu Baoni

81
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,709
downstairs our company.

82
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,083
What’s the gossip?

83
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:12,626
Yeah.

84
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:15,292
They were

85
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,626
holding hands.

86
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,292
Didn’t Baoni say

87
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,834
she liked Mo Nan?

88
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

89
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:28,209
Secretary Chen doesn’t look like

90
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,459
he will be in a relationship.

91
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,167
But...

92
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,459
I did see them!

93
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:33,918
I took photos.

94
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,709
Show me.

95
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:37,542
Look!

96
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,626
It’s true!

97
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,584
Right?

98
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,375
I think

99
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:45,792
Secretary Chen is too lonely.

100
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,000
And Baoni...

101
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,834
She always changes her boyfriend.

102
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,334
It’s not weird

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,792
if they’re in a relationship.

104
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,834
What are you looking at?

105
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,501
Nothing. Nothing.

106
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,250
Show me.

107
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,918
Don’t!

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,584
Director Zhou.

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,709
We just care about

110
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,584
Secretary Chen’s love life.

111
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,334
Yes. Yes.

112
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:12,501
They two

113
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:13,626
don’t make a perfect match.

114
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,459
They hurt my eyes!

115
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:15,417
Yes. Yes.

116
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,292
Why do you always

117
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,125
gossip in the office?

118
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,250
Can you focus on your work?

119
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,584
No bonus for this month.

120
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:23,584
Don’t, Director…

121
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:27,667
Do you smell it?

122
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,876
The smell of jealousy!

123
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,250
Director Zhou...

124
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,375
Jealous of Baoni?

125
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,792
You’re in trouble!

126
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,584
First victory!

127
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:02,709
Hello.

128

129
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:04,667
Excuse me.

130
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,042
Do you know this address?

131
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:08,834
You want to see Uncle Zhou?

132
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,292
He’s playing chess up there.

133
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:14,792
Thank you.

134
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,125
Go up there this way.

135
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,667
Thank you.

136
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:17,375
You’re welcome.

137
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:23,083
Be careful!

138
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,626

I’ll capture it, too.

Excuse me.

143

Who is Uncle Zhou?

144
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,584
I am. What do you want?

145
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,125
Hello.

146
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,000
May I ask you something

147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,292
about Yunhe Flower Shop?

148
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,667
I’m Yin Changhe’s son.

149
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:03,626

like your father.

151
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,417
But it’s been twenty years.

152
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,876
I don’t even remember

153
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,918
what he looks like.

154
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,375
Over the past twenty years,

155
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:16,751
you and your mom

156
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:19,334
must have lived a hard life.

However hard it is,

158
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,375
we’ve gone through it.

159
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:26,999
But my mother and I

160
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,250
have some confusion.

161
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,083
Uncle Zhou, did my father

162
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,209
die from the accident?

163
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,292

00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:16,459
Lu Yunqing

179
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,834
and your dad Yin Changhe,

180
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,709
seemed to

181
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:20,918
disagree with each other

182
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,876
on business philosophy.

183
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:24,167
They quarreled

184
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:25,542
in front of employees

185
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,083
and even fought.

186
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,542
We were wondering

187
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,834
how the company business could continue

188
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,709
in this way.

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,626
Right?

190
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,876
Well, soon after that,

191
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,626
what we feared came true.

192
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,167
First, a scandal came that

193
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,918
we sold bad flowers at high prices.

194
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,417
Then,

195
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,167
the company was burnt in a fire.

196
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,375
And your dad...

197
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,417
But...

198
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,501
Later,

199
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,167
the fire was characterized as an accident.

200
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,167
Old employees like us

201
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,667
knew it clearly.

202
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,292
We put a question mark over that.

203
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,999
The fire

204
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,250
must have something to do

205
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,584
with Lu Yunqing.

206
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:12,876
That was a big company.

207
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,209
How was it suddenly burnt?

208
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,375
And she was missing then.

209
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,083
So far, no one knows

210
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,125
where she is.

211
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:24,667
But...

212
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,417
If the truth…

213
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,250
If the truth can’t be revealed,

214
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,542
your father will not have peace

215
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:36,959
in the heaven.

216
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:53,876
Zhou Xinyan passes this Cafe

217
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:54,751
every day.

218
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,667
She joins the line

219
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,042
to buy some bread for breakfast.

220
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,542
When she comes,

221
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,167
I’ll give you a sign

222
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,584
and you shall take an action immediately.

223
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:02,292
Copy!

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,375
If you can

225
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,542
be with Zhou Xinyan

226
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,334
and I can be with Bo Hai

227
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:08,375
depends on

228
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:09,626
what you get today.

229
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:11,918
Come on!

230
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:12,751
Come on!

231
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,042
Bye-bye.

232
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,083
Director Zhou.

233
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:16,876
Bye-bye.

234
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,876
Hello? Qi.

235
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,501
Zhou Xinyan has left the company.

236
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,584
Okay. I see.

237
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,250
Counting down for two minutes.

238
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,542
Two minutes left.

239
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:55,417
Bao... Baoni.

240
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,834
You’re helping me!

241
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:01,542
Fine, I’ll stop

242
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:02,792
pretending to be cool.

243
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,501
Let’s do it!

244
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:20,999
Who fears!

245
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,834
Weird.

246
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,709
Could you be more intense?

247
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,918
She doesn’t see you.

248
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,792
More intense?

249
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:57,334
Whatever!

250
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,250
Zhenqi?

251
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,459
Xin… Xinyan?

252
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,292
Abort! Abort!

253
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,626
Too late, I think.

254
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:34,751
Nice pose.

255
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,959
We’re going to vote for

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,334
the best couple.

257
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,792
You’ll win it

258
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,292
with this photo.

259
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:42,999
Seems like

260
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,375
I should show Bo Hai this photo,

261
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:45,459
so that he can see

262
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:47,125
what you’re doing with Ling Lingqi.

263
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:48,792
Xin... Xinyan.

264
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,459
There must be some misunderstanding.

265
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,709
What misunderstanding?

266
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:54,042
I think you misunderstand me.

267
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:55,375
Do you think I’m so stupid

268
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,334
that I believe

269
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,167
such a naughty trick you’re using?

270
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,667
I’ll try a wiser trick,

271
00:11:58,709 --> 00:11:59,292
okay?

272
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:00,999
Chen Mo, have some self-esteem,

273
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,083
will you?

274
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,042
Self-esteem? For you,

275
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,584
I don’t care about that.

276
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:06,292
For love,

277
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,834
I don’t even care about my pride.

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,459
Bravo!

279
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:15,334
Xinyan.

280
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,250
I can sense it.

281
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:20,417
You must be

282
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,792
having some feelings

283
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:23,792
for me, too.

284
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:25,000
Aren’t you?

285
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:35,459
Don’t flatter yourself.

286
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:38,083
Then why are you shy?

287
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,042
I’m not shy!

288
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,250
You don’t dare to look into my eyes.

289
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,667
I...

290
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,292
Chen Mo, I’m telling you.

291
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,167
However hard you try,

292
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,501
you’ll never have a chance

293
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,125
to be with me.

294
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:55,667
Xinyan.

295
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,125
How merciless you are!

296
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,000
Secretary Chen, time to knock off.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why are you back?

298
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:00,709
Are you feeling unwell?

299
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,125
Let me get you some water.

300
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:08,501
Heart attack?

301
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:09,626
I’ll call the ambulance.

302
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:11,125
What heart attack?

303
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,459
You have the heart attack!

304
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,042
I’m heart-broken. Understand?

305
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,209
Heart-broken?

306
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,417
When I’m sick,

307
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,584
I can go see a doctor.

308
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,834
But when I’m heart-broken...

309
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,501
There’s a way, too.

310
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,834
As a saying goes,

311
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,167
drink when you’re heart-broken.

312
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:41,876
It’s no big deal.

313
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,751
Cheers.

314
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:50,209
Cheers.

315
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:57,999
Qi.

316
00:14:58,876 --> 00:14:59,876
I’ve been loving Zhou Xinyan

317
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,209
with my true heart.

318
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,209
To chase her,

319
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,125
I even abandon my pride.

320
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:05,751
Why doesn’t she even

321
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:06,751
show sympathy for me?

322
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,125
Sympathy is different from love.

323
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
In love,

324
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,459
we never do charity.

325
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:17,542
Sometimes, we must be merciless.

326
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,042
She isn’t merciless!

327
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,292
She’s cheating herself.

328
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,626
Well, the man who likes me...

329
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,042
He is

330
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,709
not that bad.

331
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,250
But I can’t accept him.

332
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,667
Zhou Xinyan.

333
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:37,918
And Bo Hai.

334
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,083
They’re stubborn with themselves.

335
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,501
I just don’t know

336
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,417
what they’re worried about.

337
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:44,999
Time passes by,

338
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,584
no matter we’re happy or not.

339
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,584
Why do they choose to be unhappy?

340
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:49,667
Why don’t we just

341
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:50,667
enjoy ourselves?

342
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,459
They two

343
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,209
behave like idiots.

344
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,000
Zhou Xinyan is a big idiot!

345
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,501
I’m just too stubborn.

346
00:15:58,876 --> 00:15:59,542
Look at me.

347
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,167
I’m handsome,

348
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,459
cool,

349
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:04,626
and talented,

350
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,209
do I need to bother about girls?

351
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,250
Girls always

352
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,250
chase me.

353
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:10,959
When I was at school,

354
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:12,918
I was known

355
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:15,209
as a super cool guy.

356
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,334
When school was over,

357
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,667
girls from the school next door

358
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,375
came to see me in groups.

359
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,918
They could only see me.

360
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,667
They didn’t even dare to

361
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,667
try being my girlfriend.

362
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:31,751
At every festival,

363
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,542
I received a lot of love letters and gifts.

364
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,167
I didn’t even care.

365
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,792
A girl named Zhenzhen

366
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,999
chased me for eight years.

367
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,125
She even

368
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,918
called me last night.

369
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,250
Not to mention

370
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,459
those girls in our company.

371
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:50,626
They always make eyes

372
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,542
and wink at me

373
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,125
in the office.

374
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:56,959
Cheers.

375
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:02,250
Hi.

376
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:05,584
Hi, sweety.

377
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,250
See?

378
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:11,334
That’s my charm.

379
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,334
Modern girls are too straightforward.

380
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,083
I don’t like that.

381
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,834
Do you remember

382
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,000
when I was on a business trip?

383
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:20,667
Two women

384
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,501
made me so tired.

385
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,959
They talked with me in turn

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,918
about the proposal.

387
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,876
Later, I realized that

388
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:29,709
they weren’t

389
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,250
interested in the proposal!

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,167
They were interested in me!

391
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,167
Yes. Yes.

392
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,000
When a man is drunk,

393
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,626
he always thinks of many women.

394
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,125
Qi.

395
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,334
You may not believe it.

396
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:46,334
But I’m telling you

397
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:47,334
right now!

398
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,667
If

399
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:51,876
I chase Zhou Xinyan

400
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,792
with my full strength,

401
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:57,375
I will make her surrender!

402
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,667
But when a woman is drunk,

403
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,667
she only thinks of one man.

404
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,167
The man

405
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,250
who has hurt her most.

406
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:11,918
Bo Hai.

407
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,042
Bo Hai.

408
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:16,751
Chen Mo.

409
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:19,792
I want to order something to eat.

410
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:21,999
Waiter!

411
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,083
Cheers.

412
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:48,918
What a coincidence!

413
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,209
Why are you here, too?

414
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,584
We’re fated to meet.

415
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,667
We’re both heart-broken.

416
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:58,751
Cheers again.

417
00:18:58,918 --> 00:18:59,459
Okay?

418
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:00,083
Come.

419
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:01,751
To our shaky love.

420
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,042
Shaky love!

421
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:09,792
I feel so dizzy!

422
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:11,417
Go on!

423
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,417
Oh, dear.

424
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,751
You’re so weak!

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,042
Sir, we’re closing.

426
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,000
Closing? I made a block booking.

427
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:22,792
Wait a moment.

428
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:23,125
I think

429
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,667
you should be a couple. No kidding.

430
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:26,959
You should be a couple.

431
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,918
Ma’am. Ma’am.

432
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,125
You should be a couple.

433
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,459
No kidding.

434
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,918
Just be a couple.

435
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,584
Ma’am. Ma’am.

436
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:48,501
Hello? Sir.

437
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,959
We have three customers

438
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:50,792
who get drunk.

439
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:51,876
I found your number

440
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,751
in a ma’am’s call log.

441
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:54,959
Please come

442
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:55,959
and take them away.

443
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:07,709
Chen Mo!

444
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,292
Xinyan?

445
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:33,083
Boss!

446
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:34,459
You still recognize me?

447
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:35,876
Xinyan’s bag.

448
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,375
Pay the bill and go.

449
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:42,375
Let’s go, Xinyan.

450
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:49,834
Be careful.

451
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,542
Don’t bother. Just go.

452
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:14,626
I’ll send her back.

453
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:15,709
Send her back home.

454
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:16,042
Okay.

455
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:19,083
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

456
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,292
I want to throw up.

457
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,083
Are you alright?

458
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,083
Sir, stop! Stop!

459
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:30,959
Keep the change.

460
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:31,876
Thank you.

461
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:36,292
Xinyan.

462
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:39,250
Get off!

463
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:40,334
No!

464
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:41,751
Get off!

465
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:42,459
No!

466
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,459
You’re home! Get off!

467
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,209
No! No!

468
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:49,042
- Don’t pull it! Get off! Hurry! - No!

469
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,375
No!

470
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,501
Get off! Get off!

471
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,209
No.

472
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,834
Don’t send me home.

473
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:55,167
Why?

474
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,959
My parents will break my leg!

475
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,125
I’m not going home.

476
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:01,250
Stop!

477
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:01,999
Stop!

478
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:04,542
Uncle. Uncle.

479
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:05,918
Don’t pull me!

480
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,834
Uncle. Uncle.

481
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,584
Get back in.

482
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:14,501
Be careful!

483
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:17,334
Are you alright?

484
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:18,584
You’re not good at drinking.

485
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,959
Why did you drink so much?

486
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:22,792
I’m not drunk.

487
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:23,709
I have the tissue.

488
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:25,667
Wipe your mouth.

489
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,918
I know you like me.

490
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,542
Someone else likes me, too.

491
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:38,042
Unfortunately,

492
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,667
I care for no one else,

493
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,459
except Bo Hai.

494
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:52,834
If someone says

495
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,792
he loves you forever,

496
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,834
he’s lying to you.

497
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,292
Some guys say

498
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,209
they want to chase me.

499
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:04,501
But you know what?

500
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,959
As time goes by,

501
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,167
they disappear.

502
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,292
But I’m still here.

503
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,334
Only you.

504
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:24,375
Xinyan.

505
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:25,999
Do you remember the first time

506
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,209
we met?

507
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,125
I went for the interview.

508
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,334
You received me

509
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:31,876
under the eave of our office building.

510
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:34,626
You told me that was a small company.

511
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:36,167
Except you and the boss,

512
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:37,626
I was the only employee,

513
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:38,209
though you weren’t sure

514
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,167
if I would join you.

515
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,584
I thought

516
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,501
you were such a lovely girl.

517
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,999
You were smiling at me.

518
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,667
Your eyes

519
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,959
made my heart melt.

520
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,584
In fact, I didn’t join the company

521
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:58,792
for Bo Hai

522
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,334
or anything else.

523
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:02,751
I did it for you.

524
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,918
But later,

525
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,876
I realized that you wouldn’t like me.

526
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,209
You cared for nothing, but Bo Hai.

527
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,334
I had to

528
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,834
keep my love for you

529
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:25,459
deep in my heart.

530
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,042
Do you feel cold? Put it on.

531
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,334
Later,

532
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:42,999
when I saw what you did,

533
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,584
I reflected on myself.

534
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:46,125
Did I

535
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,834
make a right choice?

536
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,959
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

537
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,999
If you did,

538
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:57,083
maybe I wouldn’t have

539
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,542
lost myself for Bo Hai.

540
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,125
Idiot!

541
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,042
Xinyan.

542
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:11,918
Are you serious?

543
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,042
Xinyan.

544
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,334
When love comes,

545
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,125
no one can stop it.

546
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:10,999
You mean,

547
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,999
your father’s partner,

548
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,542
Lu Yunqing,

549
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:15,501
got him dead?

550
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:18,834
But Lu Yunqing

551
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,501
has been missing

552
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,834
since the fire twenty years ago.

553
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:25,542
There are a lot of ways to take revenge.

554
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:29,584
What do you mean?

555
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:35,000
Lu Yunqing disappeared

556
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,626
twenty years ago.

557
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,250
But she has a son,

558
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,250
Bo Hai.

559
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,667
When Yunhe Flower Shop was burnt,

560
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,209
there was a great deficit

561
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,999
in the company’s accounts.

562
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,709
The company was bankrupted then.

563
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,167
I think

564
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,083
Bo Hai used that money

565
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,792
to establish FlowerPlus.

566
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,292
Over the past twenty years,

567
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:21,459
Bo Hai didn’t dare to

568
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:23,000
recognize Lu Yunqing,

569
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,083
and he also contacted many reporters

570
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,000
to try every method

571
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,501
to whitewash her reputation.

572
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,501
Like mother, like son.

573
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,667
Bo Hai, from now on,

574
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:41,999
I’m not going to escape reality.

575
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:44,959
I will take back

576
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,000
whatever belongs to me.

577
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,459
Wine really helps a lot!

578
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:00,000
He said

579
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,334
he suffered mental trauma.

580
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:03,375
But a veterinarian like me

581
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,459
cured him!

582
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,125
My head hurts!

583
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:15,999
My head hurts!

584
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:23,292
You’re up?

585
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:25,792
I don’t think

586
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,542
you mind me drinking your juice.

587
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:42,125
Shouldn’t you

588
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:43,999
officially admit

589
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,083
our relationship?

590
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,375
That was too casual last night.

591
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,751
What do you mean?

592
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:55,501
Well…

593
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:57,709
Since we’re in a relationship,

594
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,042
shouldn’t the man

595
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,209
be more active?

596
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,250
I mean, sweet talks.

597
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:03,709
Even if you were never in a relationship,

598
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:04,375
you should have watched

599
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,459
romantic affairs

600
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:07,083
in TV shows.

601
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:09,667
You mean

602
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,626
we’re in a relationship?

603
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,626
Last night...

604
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,584
Are you going to deny?

605
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,459
What’s wrong with you?

606
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:38,751
Last night, we...

607
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:40,417
Do I really need to remind you?

608
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:41,167
Well...

609
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:41,999
I think

610
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,375
you and my pillow were in a relationship

611
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,209
last night.

612
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:27,751
I’m leaving, then.

613
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:28,125
Wait a sec.

614
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,709
Remember to wash my pillow.

615
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:06,709
Sorry. Sorry.

616
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:07,417
I didn’t see you.

617
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:08,209
I didn’t hurt you, huh?

618
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,125
It’s okay. It’s okay.

619
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:10,751
Good.

620
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:13,459
Hi.

621
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:14,999
Morning.

622
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:15,999
What a coincidence!

623
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:17,250
Morning.

624
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,501
What’s going on?

625
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,918
Who is she?

626
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:41,459
Looks like

627
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,250
Director Zhou.

628
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,709
Honey.

629
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,334
We’re doing nothing wrong.

630
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,501
Why do we behave so sneakily?

631
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,999
I have to adapt myself to it.

632
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:13,959
Just keep it secret for now.

633
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,709
Are you regretting?

634
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,792
I sweated my guts out last night.

635
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,083
You can’t just abandon me

636
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,792
as you wish.

637
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,209
I didn’t know

638
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,918
the real you

639
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:28,083
until last night.

640
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,000
Be quiet! Listen carefully!

641
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,999
This is love at first sight.

642
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:41,918
Don’t worry.

643
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:43,667
You’re mine.

644
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:44,918
I’ll take care of you.

645
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:54,000
We...

646
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,083
We are just passing by.

647
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:57,042
Passing by.

648
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,000
Me, too.

649
00:34:59,167 --> 00:34:59,876
Go. Go. Go.

650
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,751
I am passing by, too.

651
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:07,918
Just passing by.

652
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:27,417
Xinyan.

653
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I don’t think

654
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,542
we can keep it secret.

655
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,459
Come on, dudes.

656
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:40,083
Attention.

657
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:42,083
Afternoon tea for the whole week

658
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:44,209
will be on Director Zhou and me.

659
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:45,459
Don’t stand on ceremony.

660
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,209
Make yourselves at home.

661
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:48,125
Secretary Chen.

662
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,876
I knew Director Zhou and you

663
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,709
were fated to be together.

664
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:53,918
You two make a perfect couple!

665
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,209
Secretary Chen.

666
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,751
Don’t try to buy us over

667
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:57,667
with simple afternoon tea.

668
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,167
We want big dinners!

669
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:00,417
Yes.

670
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,542
Big dinners!

671
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,584
Only juice. Whatever!

672
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:05,626
Do you think we make money

673
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:06,501
by doing nothing?

674
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:07,751
Jesus!

675
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,167
You haven’t married him yet.

676
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,792
But you’re already saving money for him.

677
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,626
No kidding.

678
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:13,250
Secretary Chen, I think

679
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:14,834
you’re going to

680
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:15,999
lose your economic independence.

681
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,083
So what?

682
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,083
That’s fine.

683
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:18,792
I always want to

684
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,292
share my money with my girl.

685
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:23,834
Director Zhou.

686
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:25,250
When are you going to

687
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,459
marry him?

688
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,542
Asset investigation, credit investigation

689
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:34,834
and reputation investigation.

690
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,792
I’ve done none.

691
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,250
How can I marry him?

692
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:38,459
Come on.

693
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:39,792
Come and investigate on me.

694
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,667
I’ll give you whatever information you want.

695
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:42,876
Or

696
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,334
you can even torture me.

697
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:47,167
Secretary Chen.

698
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,250
You’re not trying to get married.

699
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,083
You’re obviously selling yourself.

700
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,959
What are you talking about?

701
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,167
How annoying!

702
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,667
He blushes!

703
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,250
He’s shy!

704
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,250
You!

705
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,667
Why aren’t you so efficient

706
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,167
when you work?

707
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,501
I don’t always show off.

708
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,042
But when I do, I surprise you.

709
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:11,209
You know what?

710
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,709
Take good care of Xinyan.

711
00:37:12,918 --> 00:37:13,999
Or I won’t let you go.

712
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,083
Am I such a love rat

713
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,000
in your eyes?

714
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:17,876
I’m exactly

715
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,626
a caring boy!

716
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:20,876
But look at you!

717
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,584
You look exactly like a love rat.

718
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,584
What the hell do you mean?

719
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,542
Look.

720
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,667
Xinyan and I are in a relationship.

721
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:31,417
Right?

722
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,083
Shouldn’t you

723
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,501
keep your promise

724
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,542
and be with Ling Lingqi?

725
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:44,626
All right.

726
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:46,584
I’ll let it go.

727
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:47,999
Let it go.

728
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,542
Bo Hai, last night,

729
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,709
Chen Mo and I talked with each other

730
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,876
and knew our true feelings.

731
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:04,083
So, we...

732
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:04,584
Stop.

733
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:07,334
I’m not interested in your gossip.

734
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,000
Who is going to tell you the gossip?

735
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,959
I just want to share with you

736
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,501
our feelings.

737
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:13,626
Here.

738
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,918
This is for you.

739
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,834
Hope you will live

740
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:19,167
a sweet life.

741
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:20,250
Thank you.

742
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,542
But don’t bother to share with me.

743
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:23,792
It’s been years

744
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:25,167
before you’re finally in a relationship.

745
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:26,083
You don’t have

746
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,626
too much successful experience.

747
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:28,959
Don’t try to fool me.

748
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,792
Experience of failure is also experience.

749
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:32,959
It took us

750
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,083
so many years

751
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:34,959
to be in a relationship.

752
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:36,083
So, we’re worried

753
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,792
to see you

754
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,209
making the same mistake.

755
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,292
Bo Hai, sometimes,

756
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,751
a man feels bad

757
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:45,751
because he is

758
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,250
far too stubborn.

759
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,417
Look at me.

760
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,709
I’ve let go of

761
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:51,876
the burden in my heart.

762
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,125
So, I’ve found my true love.

763
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,542
I hope you can also

764
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,999
drop the burden in your heart

765
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,000
and find your cup of tea.

766
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,375
Thank you for the advice.

767
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,876
But people are different.

768
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,542
Your experience

769
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,000
may not work for me.

770
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:13,999
Terrific!

771
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:16,959
You hug the wrong guy.

772
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,375
I have a girlfriend now!

773
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,250
I’m telling you!

774
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:22,417
You had a bet with Bo Hai,

775
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,459
didn’t you?

776
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,000
It’s your show time.

777
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:25,876
Okay.

778
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:27,999
Wait a minute.

779
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,959
Could it be an own goal?

780
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,792
Why are you still suspecting me?

781
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,999
I’m just trying to

782
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,709
be serious.

783
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,042
Go ask our colleagues.

784
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,292
Throughout the office,

785
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,417
everyone knows Xinyan and I are a couple.

786
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:40,792
Really?

787
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:41,292
I’ll be his witness.

788
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:42,292
I read about the news

789
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:43,375
on the intranet.

790
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:43,876
Look!

791
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,125
All right. Come on!

792
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:00,334
Sorry!

793
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:08,000
Congratulations

794
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,209
on Zhou Xinyan and Chen Mo.

795
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,125
Unexpectedly, a famous florist

796
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,292
like you

797
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,000
lose to

798
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,167
a new employee like me.

799
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:17,751
I’ll keep it secret for you.

800
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,501
You just have good luck.

801
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,167
But I win, anyway.

802
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:22,209
Don’t you surrender?

803
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:23,999
I majored in veterinary medicine.

804
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:24,709
But I still managed to

805
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,000
correct Zhou Xinyan

806
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,709
and make her Chen Mo’s girlfriend.

807
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:29,751
Do you want me

808
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:30,959
to cure you, too?

809
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:32,417
Ling Lingqi.

810
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:33,918
There are so many guys

811
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:34,959
in this world.

812
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,083
Can’t you just

813
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,834
find another one

814
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:38,542
who is easier to get on with?

815
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,125
Why must you haunt me?

816
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,542
Aren’t you stupid?

817
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:42,834
I am!

818
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:44,083
Love is always

819
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,334
a stupid thing.

820
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,584
Sometimes,

821
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:48,042
loving someone

822
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:48,918
feels better than

823
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:49,999
being a smart guy.

824
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:52,542
Besides,

825
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,292
when I like you,

826
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,000
I have become

827
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,334
a better self.

828
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:00,918
What about you?

829
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,417
Why don’t you try

830
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,083
making yourself

831
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,334
an easy-going man?

832
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,250
Bo Hai, as long as

833
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,751
we give each other a chance,

834
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,125
and try hard on it,

835
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,959
no difficulty will stop us.
