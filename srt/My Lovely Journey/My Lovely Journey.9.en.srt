Well, I did have it.

6
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,233
I lost it.

7
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,500
I lost it in Pohang.

8
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:56,233
I could've found it again.

9
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,067
But, I left it there.

Oh, shouldn't you be going?

12

Isn't your manager waiting for you?

13
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:17,333
I like being with you.

14
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,267
When I'm with you, my heart...

15
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,133
But, not for me.

16
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,867
It wasn't like that for me.

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,533
I realized it thanks to someone
I met while traveling.

18
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,200
They said that when you're
with someone you truly love,

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,833
even poverty or hardship

20
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,933
turns into something fun and joyful.

a meal because you can't afford it...

What do you mean?

25
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:43,567
You know, Si Wan.

26
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,200
Whenever I was with you,

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,500
I always felt so small.

28
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,900
Intimidated...

29
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,133

Yeo Reum, I...

39
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,200
I think I finally understand.

40
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,567
I've always felt anxious,

41
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,667
but never when I was with you.

42
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,533

It's difficult to explain.

I came across this ridiculous contract.

113
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:48,633

There was a business card from a company
called Ohkoo Entertainment in here.

128

Oh, yes. That's my business card.

129
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,233
Among my mother's belongings,

130
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,667
there was even a contract
requesting a trip from your company.

131
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,667
I need to understand what this means.

132
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,233
I hate waiting,

133
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,300
and I can't stand secrets.

134
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,700
Just tell me what it is.

135
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,867

Hey.

137
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,036
I really can't tell you that.

138
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:19,067
What?

139
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:23,333
Because I made a promise
to Chairwoman Sung Yi Hwa.

140
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,233
Even though she's passed,

141
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,133
I believe promises should be kept.

142
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,267
The chairwoman entrusted me with a request,

143
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,400
and she didn't want

144
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,167
anyone else to know the details.

145
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,867
That's right.

146
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:51,367
Then, is this part of the request too?

147
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,867
Seems like you won't say a word after all.

148
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,267
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,133
Then... would you consider

150
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:19,233
my request as well?

151
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:22,367
Request?

152
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,300
I want you to find out what this key is for.

153
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,367
That's my request.

154
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,467
Well...

155
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:36,100
We're not some errand service.

156
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,033
That's...

157
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,100
Do you have any idea what this is?

158
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,100
I can only guess.

159
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,667
You want to find out what it is?

160
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:04,667
The chairwoman said the wallet
has what she wanted to do.

161
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Maybe the reason behind those travels

162
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,467
might be in there.

163
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:15,933
Is it because she wanted you
to take on the 'too easy' trip for her?

164
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,833
She wanted to complete all ten
Seongjeon Am Temple pilgrimages,

165
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,500
and I want to help her finish that.

166
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,767
I see.

167
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,800
I'll go find out, Mr. O.

168
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Uh, wait...

169
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,333
Drive carefully,

170
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,900
and start filming the Jinju segment first.

171
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,200

173
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,333
Understood.

174
00:13:56,667 --> 00:14:00,367
Ah, he seems unusually excited.

175
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,333
It's a bit distracting.

176
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,567
She packed us lunch.

177
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:11,500
Since you're leaving without
eating, you can eat on the way.

178
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,267
Isn't this company amazing?

179
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:17,067
Well, it's a bit hard to call it a perk
provided by Ohkoo Entertainment.

180
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,267

181
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,400

Alright, alright.

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
We'll get going.

- Yes.

194
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,000
Trip? What trip?

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,967
He's going to work, to work.

196
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,700

200
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:07,600

Take a shot here.

216
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,600
Is the schedule too tight?

217
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,333
This place is bigger than expected,

218
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,200
so it'll take a while longer.

219
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,467
I came here for the Day Trip
shoot, so I know this place.

You want to do broadcasting again, right?

221
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,567
I heard from Mr. O.

222
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,033
You got a promise from Chairwoman Sung Yi Hwa

223
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,233
that after the trip, you'd get to do
the Day Trip program again, right?

224
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,633
Just a sweet little daydream, I guess.

225
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:37,067
Was it really a sweet dream?

226
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,767
Lately, I've been confused about that too.

227
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,400
How can you be certain
it's sweet without tasting it?

228
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,067
Isn't that just an illusion?

229
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,133

The confidence that getting it
would bring happiness,

236
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,333

00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:59,867
If the chairwoman came here alone from Seoul,

298
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,833
she would always climb there too.

299
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,533

and went to a good place?

305
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,067
She had a son

306
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:10,300
from her first marriage.

307
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,600
The whole family opposed that marriage,

308
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,700
then they separated
a few years later, and she remarried.

The daughter who now runs the company

310
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,067
was born during that second marriage.

311
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:26,967
Then, what happened to her son

312
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,433
and her first husband?

313
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:33,700
Well, I don't know about that.

314
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,867
They separated leaving the son behind.

315
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,467
He's grown up now,

316
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,667
so he's probably doing well somewhere.

317
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:44,233
I only know what my mother told me...

318
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,133

complete all ten trips today,

321
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:23,700
you'll reach a wonderful place.

322
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:28,133

325
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,833
you'd still manage the group's core, right?

00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,333
<i>But,</i>

366
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,533
<i>this is my choice.</i>

367
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,200
<i>Wasn't the bond between</i>

368
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,567
<i>you and me severed long ago?</i>

369
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,333
I thought you resembled my mother
a lot in her younger days.

370
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,533
When I first saw you that day.

371
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:48,033
The Chairwoman Sung I met

372
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:50,600
was truly impressive.

373
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,067
She was an admirable person.

374
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,667
She successfully managed the family business

375
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,900
of a sonless household.

376
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,267
Still,

377
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,233
what she wanted most...

378
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,200
Thank you.

379
00:35:40,267 --> 00:35:43,900
<i>What is the happiness I truly desire?</i>

380
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,867
<i>What does success mean to me?</i>

381
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:57,967
<i>Were you happy, Chairwoman?</i>

382
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,333
<i>Do you think you succeed?</i>

383
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,033
<i>I want to quit.</i>

384
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,967
<i>I'll quit.</i>

385
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,867
<i>Dad,</i>

386
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,033
<i>come pick me up.</i>

387
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,567
<i>Come pick me up.</i>

388
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:24,467
<i>Listen to me carefully, Kang Yeo Reum.</i>

389
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:28,100
<i>Nothing comes easy in this world.</i>

390
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,967
<i>Everything's tough and challenging.</i>

391
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,867
<i>If you're not good at something,</i>

392
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:35,367
<i>keep doing it until you excel.</i>

393
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:39,433
<i>I told you not to return to Hwado, right?</i>

394
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,600
<i>You</i>

395
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,667
<i>can't come back to Hwado until you succeed.</i>

396
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,633
<i>If you return like this,</i>

397
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,667
<i>you'll never leave Hwado again.</i>

398
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,200
<i>That night</i>

399
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,400
<i>was my most painful night.</i>

400
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:17,167
<i>The despair of having nowhere to go.</i>

401
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:21,633
<i>The terror of standing alone in a dead end.</i>

402
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:26,500
<i>I hated Dad so much at that time.</i>

403
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:46,267
<i>But, I also know.</i>

404
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,900
<i>That night,</i>

405
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,600
<i>Dad stood at the Hwado pier,</i>

406
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,233
<i>getting soaked in the rain all night.</i>

407
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,700
<i>Even when I got back on the bus
and arrived in Seoul.</i>

408
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,667
<i>Hey,</i>

409
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,433
<i>good job.</i>

410
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,733
<i>He was standing</i>

411
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:30,300
<i>in the cold morning wind,</i>

412
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:35,100
<i>holding onto a heavy heart.</i>

413
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:54,333
<i>If I hadn't</i>

414
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:58,200
<i>left the island and come to Seoul,</i>

415
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,733
<i>if I had stopped Si Wan...</i>

416
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:07,233
<i>If I had tried harder,</i>

417
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,667
<i>would I be happy now?</i>

418
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,933
<i>What about you, Chairwoman?</i>

419
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,267
<i>Now, I'm going to find out</i>

420
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:33,300
<i>what true happiness is for me,</i>

421
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,533
<i>and what success really means.</i>

422
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:53,100
<i>♫ Even now, this clueless night still excites me ♫</i>

423
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,967
<i>♫ The breeze softly lingers, if I get tipsy ♫</i>

424
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:02,500
<i>♫ I'll just be happy, doing what I want ♫</i>

425
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,967
<i>♫ If you feel the same way ♫</i>

426
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:08,833
<i>♫ It would be better ♫</i>

427
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:12,467
Kang Yeo Reum, you're excited today, huh?

428
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:15,867
Ah, I'm just about to get excited.

429
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,700
Autumn,

430
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,033
Summer is leaving.

431
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:30,600
People shouldn't change too suddenly.

432
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,733
I didn't change. This must be my true self.

433
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:36,367
Yeah, it does feel more natural.

434
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,633
It was natural, right?

435
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:41,300
By the way,

436
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,867
the other night in the alley,

437
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:49,333
I saw you with someone. Who was that?

438
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,800
Si Wan?

439
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,833
Ah, yeah.

440
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,100
I think that's right.

441
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,100
He said he just dropped by
while he was in the area.

442
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,000
Oh.

443
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,700
Are you two seeing each other again?

444
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,433
Why do you ask?

445
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,967
I don't know if you realize this,

446
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:26,452
but you're more direct than you seem.

447
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:27,567
Would it be wrong if we are?

448
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:28,600
Yes.

449
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,200
Huh?

450
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:38,633
Because you need to see me.

451
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,133
Yeon Seok.

452
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,267
Yeon Seok,

453
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,500
are you confessing to me now?

454
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,333
Do you really need to confirm it
like that? You already know.

455
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,167
Mom, I didn't know you had this side.

456
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:23,067
You're better at judging people than I am.

457
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,867
Kang Yeo Reum.

458
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:29,767
She's kinda cute, Mom.

459
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:42,067
<i>I'm currently walking through
the bamboo forest path at Namgaram Park.</i>

460
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:48,933
[Substitute Travel Request Board]

461
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:06,433
Manager Hyun.

462
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:08,767
Does that help lose weight?

463
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:12,700
Yoga is a discipline.

464
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:15,333
Oh my.

465
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,333
Ah, Ms. Yoo.

466
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,800
Namaste.

467
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,200
Namaste.

468
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,567
Yeo Reum.

469
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:00,600
Oh, what's that?

470
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,267
No one's watching.

471
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,767
Everyone's here.

472
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:08,667
Hello.

473
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,133
Hi, Mr. Lee?

474
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,400
Why are you doing this?

475
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,633
Huh, why?

476
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:15,733
Why did you come?

477
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:18,500
Ugh, Mr. O.

478
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,233
Why's your company's service so bad?

479
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:22,367
You should at least offer something to drink...

480
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:23,733
What?

481
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:25,600
Want some cold water?

482
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,233
With extra salt?

483
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,833
Ugh, no.

484
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,500
What brings you here?

485
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,267
Ah, well...

486
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:35,667
Ms. Kang Yeo Reum.

487
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,833
Your substitute travel agency
has been doing well lately, right?

488
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,533
There've been lots of articles,

489
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:42,100
and your YouTube views are good too.

490
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,467
So, why did you

491
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:45,733
come here?

492
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,767
Jeez.

493
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:52,300
- With our Yeo Reum...
- Our Yeo Reum?

494
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,833
Our Yeo Reum?

495
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,067
No, just...

496
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,667
Is this okay?

497
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,400
Seems okay.

498
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,400
We've known each other for ages.

499
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,367
Let's do a show together

500
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,333
with Yeo Reum, Mr. O.

501
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,867
A show?

502
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,200
Not some lousy program in the evening show.

503
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,533
We'll launch a standalone travel show

504
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,500
with Kang Yeo Reum as the host.

505
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,233
A standalone travel show?

506
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,833
Yeah.

507
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:42,833
To...

508
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,767
- Summer!
- Summer!

509
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,100
Wait, why are you excluding Ohkoo Entertainment?

510
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,333
Ohkoo Entertainment is Summer and Summer
is Ohkoo Entertainment! What's the difference?

511
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,600
Oh right, that makes sense.

512
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,700
Oh, my.

513
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,400
The snacks are great, the drinks are tasty...
I'm really in a good mood.

514
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,033
Ms. Yang, please sit down too.

515
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,067
Today deserves proper celebration.

516
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,367
Yes, that's right.

517
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:06,933
I'll happily pay for all the snacks.

518
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:09,133
Oh please, have a seat.

519
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,300
As an investor of Ohkoo Entertainment...

520
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,367
Alright, here. Have a drink.

521
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:16,428
Oh, thank you. Oh my.

522
00:47:17,076 --> 00:47:18,867
Here you go.

523
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:20,367
But actually,

524
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,067
I'm not an investor.

525
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:24,300
I'm your scary creditor.

526
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,033
Oh my, how terrifying.

527
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,500
This feels like someone else's problem.

528
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,667
If Ohkoo Entertainment succeeds,
there's no worry about losing money,

529
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,833
so of course it's good for me too, right?

530
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,267
Our Ohkoo Entertainment

531
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:38,433
won't go down easily!

532
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:40,033
Of course not!

533
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,767
Yeo Reum, congratulations.

534
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:46,133
Thank you, Ms. Yang.

535
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,433
Cheers!

536
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,800
The little kid who was this small
now has your own show.

537
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,667
You are grown up.

538
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:56,800
Mr. Lee,

539
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,767
why are you so quiet today?

540
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:00,800
- Huh?
- Yeah.

541
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Mr. Lee, you should say something too.

542
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,833
Oh, please.

543
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:10,500
It's refreshing and delicious.

544
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,767
What's that?

545
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:14,633
You never stop talking normally...

546
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:31,967
Oh, Mr. O.

547
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:34,000
What? Why?

548
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:39,467
Oh dear, oh dear.

549
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:42,400
What? Are you crying again?

550
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,133
Lately, why do I

551
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:48,233
tear up even when something good happens?

552
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:50,233
Andropause. Definitely andropause.

553
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,400
Hey,

554
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,433
I'd understand if it were
adolescence, but andropause?

555
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:56,967
Even acting like this feels like andropause.

556
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,433
Puberty?

557
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:00,833
Oh my, no wonder.

558
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,700
You've been disobedient.

559
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,267
When was I ever disobedient?

560
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,733
Now, to Ohkoo Entertainment!

561
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:10,533
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

562
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,300
Ah, nice.

563
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,100
Have you sobered up a bit?

564
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,333
I don't want to sober up today.

565
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,467
Uh-oh.

566
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:25,133
This girl's making a dangerous statement.

567
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:26,200
Yeon Seok,

568
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,100
could you pinch me hard?

569
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,533
I still can't believe it.

570
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:35,300
Why verify something so good?

571
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,367
Dream or reality... does it matter?

572
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,233
Just enjoy it.

573
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:42,367
Is that so?

574
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:48,033
Wow, Kang Yeo Reum will be swamped now.

575
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:51,567
Oh please, one show won't
make that much difference.

576
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:54,133
I'm not a top star yet.

577
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:56,567
Congratulations

578
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:59,433
to Kang Yeo Reum, soon-to-be star broadcaster.

579
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:02,033

580
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,367
Just a moment.

582
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,233
I'll buy something to sober up.

583
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:13,867
Okay.

584
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,233
Yes, Si Wan.

585
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:47,067
The person who's going to be a top star

586
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:49,500
is on the phone with a top star for this long?

587
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,100
What's this feeling?

588
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,767
Lee Yeon Seok, feeling inadequate?

589
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:19,567
Or anxious?

590
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,867
Why does alcohol taste so bland lately?

591
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,200
Cheers!

592
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,633
As expected, the snack is cup ramyeon.

593
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,833
What kind of sad combo is this?

594
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,000
Ramyeon with soju mix?

595
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,533
Then, should I go

596
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:56,367
get high-quality champagne

597
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,467
and a cheese platter?

598
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,033
You could,

599
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:04,200
but I'm not really in the mood for that today.

600
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,200
Champagne every day gets boring.

601
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,700
Really? Alright.

602
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,333
Then today, let's go fresh

603
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,133
with soju and beer!

604
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,233
Stop drinking.

605
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:50,300
You're not even good at it...

606
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,033
Ms. Yoo,

607
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:01,933
you are good at drinking,

608
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,633
so you don't know what
being drunk feels like, huh?

609
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:09,133
Why wouldn't someone who's a good drinker
know what it feels like to be drunk?

610
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:13,800
Alcohol you drink when you're in a good mood

611
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,400
feels completely different.

612
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:22,100
It feels like being rejuvenated.

613
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,200
Jeez.

614
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,700
Thank you.

615
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:28,933
What did you say?

616
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:33,100
For being at Ohkoo Entertainment,

617
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,067
for not

618
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,400
abandoning me.

619
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,333
Oh, come on...

620
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,667
Did Ohkoo Entertainment buy
some building or something?

621
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,867
Yeo Reum just got in charge of
one show. It's such an overreaction.

622
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:48,400
It's not just one show.

623
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,600
I was thinking I might have to
shut the company down this time,

624
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,633
but I've reflected.

625
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:03,133
Looking at Yeo Reum,

626
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,967
I remembered when I first met her

627
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,300
a long time ago.

628
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,700
<i>See, I told you, that's the lighthouse.</i>

629
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,133
<i>As long as you find the lighthouse,
you won't get lost.</i>

630
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,767
Back then, I thought

631
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:28,933
I had lost my way.

632
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,967
But, I'd just forgotten the lighthouse.

633
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:37,800
I mean, the one that was supposed to guide me.

634
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,767
That's not right.

635
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:50,867
Yeah, that's not right.

636
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:53,267
You are our lighthouse,

637
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:58,533
you are Ohkoo Entertainment's
lighthouse, O Sang Sik.

638
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,200
If that lighthouse goes out,

639
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,133
what are we supposed to do?

640
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,100
Don't you dare cry again.

641
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,800
I won't.
