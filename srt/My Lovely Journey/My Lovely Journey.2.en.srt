00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,233
Tell me who it is.

548
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:14,833
Jeez.

549
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,400
You bourgeois brats.

550
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,367
Look at these youngsters wasting money on alcohol.

551
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:26,367
Why make money if it's not for something fun?

552
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,800
Drink it all.

553
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,733
I'm treating today.

554
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:30,833
Nice.

555
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,000
Cheers.

556
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,633
Who've you been hanging with lately?

557
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,467
It's been ages since our group met up.

558
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:40,400
Yeah, what do you do these days?

559
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,967
Eat, sleep, and take care of the basics...

560
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,267
Life's the same, so why ask about it?

561
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,600
I heard you're getting into movies.

562
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,267
Who's the actress?

563
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,300
Yang Hye Ji? Lee Joo Seo?

564
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,067
Hey, I've been liking that actress lately...

565
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,367
Choi Da Rae.

566
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:58,733
Ah, Yeon Seok, he still made it big, huh?

567
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,167
Hey, you know what?

568
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:03,733
Lately, even the background in my dreams
is the trading room's market board.

569
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:05,867
I'm jealous, Yeon Seok.

570
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:07,633
<i>What's to be jealous of?</i>

571
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:08,700
Hey.

572
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,767
You still cut off contact with your parents?

573
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,567
I didn't cut them off...

574
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:14,300
I became independent, man.

575
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,900
You punk,

576
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,200
you can't do anything without
Daddy and Mommy, right?

577
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,533
Hey, got any good sources?

578
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:26,700
Hey, there's something called With C.

579
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,544
[Mr. O Sang Sik]

580
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,333
Perfect timing.

581
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,200
Good, good, good.

582
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,667
Let's go.

583
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,433
Ah, just leave her be.

584
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,133
Why is that?

585
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:12,633
Come on.

586
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:15,267
Why? Do you think...

587
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,167
Do you think I'm doing this
because I wanted to ride this car?

588
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,633
Ugh, seriously.

589
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,333
I could go in my own car, but...

590
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,933
My...

591
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:23,467
My heart's pounding right now,

592
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:26,133
so I don't think I can drive.

593
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:27,433
I mean, Yeo Reum.

594
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:29,467
Just let her be and watch.

595
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:33,333
She just followed whatever
the agency told her to do,

596
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,533
got older, and ended up
with nothing to show for it,

597
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:37,433
with nothing she knows how to do.

598
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,867
And you're saying it's your fault?

599
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,667
So?

600
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,833
For the first time ever,
she's going somewhere on her own will.

601
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:48,433
It's Kang Yeo Reum's first trip
as a travel reporter.

602
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,733
Do you really think

603
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,367
Dad needs to follow her?

604
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,767
First trip...

605
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,833
Well, maybe if there's a handsome guy
involved, it'd be different,

606
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,233
but otherwise, it'll just be boring.

607
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,933
Super boring.

608
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:06,567
- Boring?
- I'll go.

609
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,167
Super boring?

610
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,833
You...

611
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:11,867
Mister?

612
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:13,800
Get out for a sec.

613
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,400
Uh, no...

614
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:20,133
How do you open this?

615
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,133
[Jangteo Restaurant]
I'm not sure if my memory is correct.

616
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:27,433
But, I vaguely remember picking seeds

617
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:31,433
from the soapberry on the way to Muryangsa Temple,

618
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:34,300
then pricking and drying them
to make a prayer bead bracelet.

619
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,400
That knot.

620
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,000
People in our village used to make those often.

621
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,667
Muryangsa Temple.

622
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,200
Go take a look.

623
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
The path there is nice for walking.

624
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,167
Yes, I'll go and come back.

625
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,933
Uh, wait a moment. Hold on, hold on.

626
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,000
This, this.

627
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:58,767
Thank you.

628
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:01,233
Why are you using formal speech
when we're the same age?

629
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,733
Save my number.

630
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,933
I mean, if something happens
like yesterday, contact me.

631
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:15,700
Since I'm nearby, I'll be faster
than those love-filled people.

632
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,833
Yes, I'll do that.

633
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,900
Ah, I'll find a photo of the tree and send it.

634
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,467
After visiting Muryangsa Temple,
come to the convenience store.

635
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:39,800
Since I know Buyeo very well.

636
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:44,733
Yeah, I will.

637
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,767
Thank you.

638
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:49,567
I'll be back.

639
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,867
Come back safely.

640
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,500
Bye.

641
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,300
Jeez.

642
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,367
What are you doing?

643
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:02,800
I'm doing this because
I'm worried she might be in danger.

644
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,600
Because she might go
looking for another restaurant.

645
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, dear.

646
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,400
For five years, whenever I went down
to the countryside for filming,

647
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,433
there was always this big tree in the village.

648
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:41,533
I looked at those unusually
thick and large trees, and I thought,

649
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:44,100
during all the long years people came under them,

650
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,867
sharing their secrets

651
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:48,267
and making wishes, I wondered

652
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,367
if the tree had absorbed those stories,

653
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,733
growing bigger and stronger in the process.

654
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,933
Oh dear.

655
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:05,500
Kate.

656
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,933
Was that prayer bead tree like that too?

657
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:11,333
After listening to someone's
desperate stories for years,

658
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,233
would it have grown enormously by now?

659
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,633
Kate.

660
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:54,633
This is Muryangsa Forest Trail.

661
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,733
Not far from here,

662
00:47:56,733 --> 00:48:00,133
there's an old soapberry tree
known as the prayer bead tree.

663
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:01,567
This bracelet

664
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:05,900
might have been made from
the fruit of that tree, right?

665
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,733
So,

666
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:11,167
I'm heading there now.

667
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:22,433
I wish I could capture the breeze
blowing through this forest,

668
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,367
but it's so disappointing.

669
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,267
Well, I'll continue on.

670
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,400
<i>The heart to share food with a stranger,</i>

671
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,433
<i>guide them,</i>

672
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,600
<i>offer them a meal,</i>

673
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,100
<i>and let them rest.</i>

674
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,600
<i>Where does it come from?</i>

675
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,867
<i>Is that really okay, madam?</i>

676
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,067
<i>It was only one day,</i>

677
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:10,100
<i>but I feel like I'm a different person
than I was yesterday.</i>

678
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:28,167
<i>To me who was nothing.</i>

679
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:31,300
<i>To me who knew nothing.</i>

680
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,300
<i>To me who was just wandering alone,</i>

681
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,900
<i>kindness has come.</i>

682
00:49:39,867 --> 00:49:44,800
<i>Though I'm not a star center or main character.</i>

683
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,300
Oh, right.

684
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,067
Kate, can you see?

685
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:41,333
That tree right there is the prayer bead tree.

686
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,800
Let me get closer and take a photo.

687
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:53,733
Huh? Someone's here.

688
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:57,267
Is that person also here
to see the tree, just like us?

689
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:25,100
Kate?

690
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:29,700
Is this a dream?

691
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,433
Kate.

692
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:35,600
When did you come here?

693
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,567
Why are you taking photos without permission?

694
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,267
Delete them!

695
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:46,933
Oh, Kate.

696
00:51:46,933 --> 00:51:48,167
Wait.

697
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:49,767
Hold on.

698
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,500
Kate.

699
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,767
Just a moment.

700
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:58,000
Should we talk...

701
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,367
You punk.

702
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,833
Is that all you're capable of?

703
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,733
Everyone was so worried.

704
00:52:57,733 --> 00:52:59,067
You suddenly disappear like that,

705
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,667
and hang up the phone...

706
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,967
Do you know how much people must have worried?

707
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:05,967
You told me to go.

708
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:07,900
What?

709
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,933
No, I told you to go home.

710
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:12,167
When did I say that?

711
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:15,000
You said I had no future in broadcasting.

712
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,900
You told me to figure it out on my own,

713
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,700
whether I go back home or work part-time, right?

714
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,400
It's bitter.

715
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,267
It's black coffee.

716
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:28,733
That's because

717
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:32,867
you just couldn't see anything
but what's right in front of you.

718
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:37,633
Hey, is life over
if it's not in front of the camera?

719
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:41,300
Is life meaningless if it's not broadcasting?

720
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,400
I've lived only for that.
What else could have meaning then?

721
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,800
What?

722
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,733
Why is it meaningless? Why?

723
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:50,633
Just because something didn't go well,
you think life has no meaning?

724
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,600
Those two always looks...

725
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,233
Mr. Lee.

726
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:04,167
Here it is.

727
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:09,600
Don't they look like

728
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,633
an angry dad yelling at his runaway daughter?

729
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:14,067
Oh, yes.

730
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:16,533
That's exactly it.

731
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:17,824
What's exactly like that?

732
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:18,900
Pardon?

733
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,167
'Dad, I hate you!'

734
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,667
He looks like the dad
who would panic if his kid said that.

735
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:25,467
Oh, yes. That's exactly it.

736
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,633
Why do you keep saying that?

737
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,600
How did you end up here like this?

738
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,700
I really liked your short film,

739
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,700
and when I sent a follow request,
you followed me back,

740
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,933
and I was really, really happy about that.

741
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:43,867
Does my voice sound familiar?

742
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,500
Pardon?

743
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,100
Never mind.

744
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:53,100
I think you need to train yourself
to completely understand

745
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,467
the subjects within the frames you shoot.

746
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:58,033
Oh, yes.

747
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:01,533
Those frames, subjects.

748
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:03,133
Yeah.

749
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,000
Don't post stuff like this. It was really bad.

750
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,833
Oh, you saw it?

751
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:17,200
I know everything

752
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,033
you did last night.

753
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,533
Are there no good restaurants?

754
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,660
<i>Alright, then.</i>

755
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,500
<i>Keep the phone right there</i>

756
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,167
<i>until the owner comes to claim it, understood?</i>

757
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,333
Wow,

758
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,533
he's a genius.

759
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:45,067
Kang Yeo Reum.

760
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:48,700
Have you been working
with this kind of mindset all along?

761
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,000
What's the big deal about some broadcast?

762
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,333
If it's not that, does life have no meaning, man?

763
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,533
Then, where should I find meaning?

764
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:57,567
What should I do?

765
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:00,367
Should I open a shopping mall like Yu Ri?

766
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,800
Or go to school late like Ji Woo? Huh?

767
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,900
What?

768
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,267
After our group disbanded,

769
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:09,800
everyone found their own path early on.

770
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,867
Only I stayed here,

771
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:15,167
persisting to try something,
only to end up abandoned like this.

772
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,267
Abandoned?

773
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:18,933
Abandoned?

774
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,000
Wow.

775
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,133
You, seriously...

776
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,300
Hey, man.

777
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,967
Are you saying people are objects?

778
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,333
Who's abandoning whom, huh?

779
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,500
Sit down, sit down,

780
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,100
sit down.

781
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:47,467
Yeah,

782
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:51,467
that's why I'm telling you to quit, alright?

783
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:52,500
Huh?

784
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,667
Why are you putting the meaning
of your life in something like that?

785
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,200
Hey, if it doesn't work out,

786
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,800
just spit it out and turn away...

787
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,300
Spit and walk away. That's all.

788
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,533
Where should I turn?

789
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:08,700
Where do I turn?

790
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,467
Where's there to turn?

791
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:13,933
I don't even have a place to turn,

792
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:16,367
let alone a place to go back to right now.

793
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,533
Nowhere to go.

794
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:36,200
If you think like that, you...

795
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:39,967
Quit everything, you punk.

796
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,133
Hey,

797
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:46,567
a boxer

798
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:48,333
gets hit a few times

799
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,333
in the ring,

800
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,267
and

801
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,267
if he falls,

802
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:56,900
does that mean

803
00:57:57,733 --> 00:57:59,400
his life is over?

804
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,000
Does life end

805
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,667
outside the ring?

806
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,433
You just lost this round.

807
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:21,667
You break your fists over losing a few games?

808
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:29,567
You get knocked down,

809
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:30,667
you get broken...

810
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,533
<i>The show sponsorship was our chairman's idea.</i>

811
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:36,133
<i>But, I disagreed.</i>

812
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:38,900
<i>Even without the strength to die,</i>

813
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,700
it's still a game.

814
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,833
Just play the next game.

815
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,100
In the next game,

816
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,900
you can win.

817
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,000
<i>I feel like</i>

818
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,867
<i>I've always lived like a boxer
fighting her last match in life.</i>

819
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,200
<i>After losing in the game,</i>

820
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,467
<i>I felt like a player who would never return.</i>

821
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:08,300
<i>I was so overwhelmed, holding onto
the spot I was hit, crying,</i>

822
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,033
<i>that I forgot about the people</i>

823
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:13,133
<i>cheering for me outside the ring.</i>

824
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,367
<i>The game of our lives will continue,</i>

825
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:20,467
<i>and as long as there are people rooting for me,</i>

826
00:59:20,467 --> 00:59:23,267
<i>I'll step back into the ring.</i>

827
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,300
<i>As long as I don't throw
the white towel of surrender,</i>

828
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,967
<i>the game will not end.</i>

829
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:10,133
How about partnering with me?

830
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:11,367
Partnering?

831
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:13,667
A travel agency specializing in substitute travel.

832
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,400
A travel agency?

833
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,967
By the way, who is he?

834
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:20,500
Mr. Lee will be

835
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,733
in charge of editing the footage you shot.

836
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:28,200
It's a commissioned project,
so we should send them well-shot footage.

837
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,633
Travel videos are better with natural sounds.

838
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:34,067
It's called a windshield.

839
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:36,333
Thank you so much, Yeon Seok Oppa.

840
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,167
Oppa?

841
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,667
Is it okay if I call you Oppa?

842
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,300
Yes.

843
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:44,333
Right.

844
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,467
This is what travel is.

845
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:49,400
Buyeo was

846
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,467
so beautiful,

847
01:00:51,467 --> 01:00:54,033
and so warm.

848
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:57,833
You've come back as the gutsy person you were.

849
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,433
Why did you come here?

850
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:00,633
- For an interview...
- For an interview?

851
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:04,267
I heard your show got canceled. What interview!

852
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:06,000
No, it's not like that.

853
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,200
What are you scheming?

854
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,367
Butting into other people's wounds...

855
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,667
Well done, Kang Yeo Reum.

856
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,567
The truth was simple.

857
01:01:15,567 --> 01:01:17,367
It's her.

858
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:20,467
Who gave this to you?
