00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,467
He just worked and lived like a madman.

553
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:25,667
Who knew that was desperation?

554
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,700
Why call it desperation?

555
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,333
Huh?

556
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,667
Maybe he has been waiting.

557
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,200
He found the waiting so hard

558
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,167
that he probably tried to distract
himself with something.

559
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,967
He must have been

560
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,633
waiting desperately.

561
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:02,933
What's this?

562
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,567
Not mine.

563
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,433
Give it to Ms. Yoo.

564
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:35,700
Doctor.

565
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,400
I'm

566
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,867
heading toward my final destination,

567
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,367
towards the sea of stories of those

568
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:49,400
who have deeply missed someone.

569
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,100
<i>The sun hasn't risen yet.</i>

570
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:05,867
Yes.

571
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:10,267
Doctor.

572
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:13,233
You're ready, right?

573
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,733
<i>Just like how it's the coldest before spring</i>

574
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,433
<i>and the darkest before the sun rises,</i>

575
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,433
<i>the sun will eventually rise,</i>

576
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:44,567
<i>piercing through the darkness.</i>

577
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,433
<i>So Doctor,</i>

578
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:57,367
<i>I'll sincerely pray that
you'll be able to see this sea</i>

579
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:01,000
<i>with that person.</i>

580
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,267
So, this is how patients feel in bed.

581
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:30,900
I wasn't a good doctor.

582
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,067
Should've laid down like this sometimes.

583
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:41,000
A bit creepy, don't you think?

584
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,367
Oh, you little...

585
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:45,633
This is far enough, Sang Sik.

586
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,933
Okay, see you later. Don't worry.

587
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,967
Thanks, Sang Sik.

588
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:02,333
Say that later, punk.

589
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,033
The sun's rising, Doctor.

590
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:31,400
We are lucky, aren't we?

591
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,067
The hotel front desk said that
if the weather isn't good,

592
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:37,233
the clouds might make it hard to see the sunrise.

593
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,900
Ms. Haruko.

594
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:17,500
Haruko.

595
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,067
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

596
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,833
<i>by some miracle,</i>

597
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:27,633
<i>Yeo Reum found you, right?</i>

598
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:32,300
I wanted to say...

599
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,533
thank you.

600
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:38,767
<i>Because of you,</i>

601
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:40,667
<i>my twenties</i>

602
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:43,467
<i>shined brightly.</i>

603
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,033
Every moment with you

604
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,733
was dazzlingly

605
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:58,700
happy.

606
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,767
<i>In about two hours,</i>

607
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:18,400
<i>I'll be lying in a slightly cold place.</i>

608
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,700
<i>I might not have...</i>

609
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:27,600
much time left.

610
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,200
I'm sorry.

611
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,267
I'm sorry.

612
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:57,733
<i>The promise to travel to Hokkaido together...</i>

613
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,733
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't keep it.</i>

614
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,733
I really wanted

615
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,533
to watch the beautiful sunrise

616
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:15,033
there with you.

617
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:52,367
It's over! He called!

618
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,567
Yes, Mr. O. How did it go?

619
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,600
Why? What is he saying?

620
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,800
Ah.

621
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,400
Alright, yes.

622
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:08,600
What? What did they say? It didn't go well?

623
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:12,067
Ms. Yoo,

624
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:14,233
he said he enjoyed the porridge you made.

625
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:15,633
What?

626
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:18,367
He says to wait as he's treating everyone.

627
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,633
Unbelievable. What's he saying now?

628
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:26,333
Is this a company dinner?

629
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:51,500
<i>'If the people you love aren't where you are,'</i>

630
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,400
<i>'then even the universe wouldn't mean much.'</i>

631
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,400
<i>Dr. Young Hoon's surgery was successful.</i>

632
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:10,967
They say Dr. Young Hoon's

633
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:14,433
surgery went well.

634
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:17,333
He's fine.

635
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,667
Thank you.

636
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,767
Thank you.

637
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:36,467
<i>I miss you, Yeo Reum. Come back quickly.</i>

638
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,467
Let's not hesitate anymore.

639
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,067
Huh?

640
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,400
Shall we go to the hospital to pick up Mr. O?

641
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:57,200
I'll start the engine.

642
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:00,567
Let's go.

643
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,233
<i>Maybe travel exists for returning.</i>

644
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:26,600
<i>To where your loved one lives.</i>

645
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,500
<i>Otherwise,</i>

646
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,067
<i>travel itself would have little meaning.</i>

647
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:37,300
<i>If we ever part ways,</i>

648
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,467
<i>let's meet right here.</i>

649
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:41,633
<i>On my birthday,</i>

650
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,800
<i>when the morning sun rises,</i>

651
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,400
<i>right at this spot.</i>

652
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,233
<i>♫ The wind carried to me ♫</i>

653
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:08,333
<i>♫ The memories of the past ♫</i>

654
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:17,967
<i>♫ The words I could never say ♫</i>

655
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:27,867
<i>♫ I can't sleep tonight either ♫</i>

656
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:36,700
<i>♫ When I reach the end of the road ♫</i>

657
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:46,833
<i>♫ The seasonal sensations I felt with you ♫</i>

658
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:51,667
<i>♫ When today passes ♫</i>

659
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:55,333
<i>♫ When the long night passes ♫</i>

660
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:02,367
<i>♫ Will we meet again ♫</i>

661
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:08,200
<i>♫ I won't miss it ♫</i>

662
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,133
<i>♫ Those moments with you ♫</i>

663
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:18,267
<i>♫ In memories of seasonal feelings ♫</i>

664
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:25,867
<i>♫ I won't forget you ♫</i>

665
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:29,800
<i>♫ Remember ♫</i>

666

01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:26,100
<i>♫ If I see you again ♫</i>

671
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:30,033
<i>♫ If we meet again ♫</i>

<i>♫ Remember ♫</i>
