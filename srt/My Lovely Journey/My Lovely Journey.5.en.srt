There's a reason I can't tell you.

There are so many 'whos' around this person,

Regular dogs use pee pads.

417

Yes, he probably does.

It's flower wine.

After filming here, he really loved
a glass of this flower wine.

507

really me?

528
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:23,200
Then who else could it be?

529
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,400
Well,

530
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,100
you didn't like having your photo taken...

531
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:35,300
Did you ever really like it?

532
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,933
That's the last place

After we lost our daughter,

537

we never took a trip together even once.

538
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,067
That was our final trip as a couple

during our marriage.

540
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,133
It wasn't really a trip, though.

You followed him to the filming location,

working as the manager.

it gets to the client properly.

588
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,767
I mean, when she acts like that,

589
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:20,400
without even blinking,
it's like she's someone else.

590

It's like two souls are switching in and out.

591
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,500
She's not even surprised by the lawsuit.

592
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,700
Quickly ask her what she did.

593
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,900
Just leave her for now.

594
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,933
What do you mean leave her?

595
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,433
We need to know something to prepare.

Anyway, he said he won't leave it alone.
