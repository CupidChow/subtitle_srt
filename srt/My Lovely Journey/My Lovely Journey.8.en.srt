00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:42,967
We can hear you, Ms. Yoo.

21
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,800
Just speak normally.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,100
I'm doing this because I'm happy, okay?

23
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,000

That joke's outdated.

You can't hide your excitement, Ms. Yoo.

32
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,900
Why hide happiness?

33
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,567

I mean

76
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,933
you're cutting out everyone else's shots

77
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:30,400
but only putting Yeo Reum's scenes like this.

78
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,033
I can see your bias in the editing.

79
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,933
Well, Yeo Reum

80
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,400

I can dance too, you know.

84
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:49,200
Maybe it's the difference between
an amateur and a professional.

85
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,400
But, being honest isn't a bad thing.

86
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,100
Why hold back when you like someone?

87
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Mr. Know-It-All, any idea why?

88
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,133
Right.

Huh?

98
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,767

99
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,667

100
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,200
Relax.

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,167
Why did they call us though?

102
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,433
Must have some reason.

103
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,100

It may have seemed like
a small, insignificant show,

113
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,467

It's not that I'm refusing,

117
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,067
You're quite impatient.

118
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,000
I know from the report that my daughter managed to

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
get rid of that show.

120
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:42,700
I was born into wealth,

lived as a wealthy person,

122
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
and became even wealthier.

123
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,200
The more successful and wealthier you become,

124
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,833
the more advantages you have.

125
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,967
I can get whatever I want.

126
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:02,100
If I don't like seeing someone sitting
in a more comfortable chair than me,

127
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,033
I can make them sit in that chair,

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,400
Do you want to be successful like me?

133
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,633
Yes, I do.

being rich,

it starts when you have more things you want to do

138
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,033
than things you want to have.

139

149
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,800
and the fact that you met me to your grave.

150
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm not wealthy,

151
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,200
but I have more things I want to do

152
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,067
than things I want to have, Ms. Chairwoman.

153
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:56,800
Could you compensate me
with something other than that?

154
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,933
Wow.

155
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
Wow.

156
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,767
I've been on edge all day, and now
I'm so drained that I feel hungry.

157
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:35,533
We should've eaten something
at that hotel earlier, right?

158
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,367
By the way, how did you

159
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,367

Wow, Kang Yeo Reum

165
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,500
has really grown up.

166
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,633
Now, you know how to make deals

167
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,800
and your confidence is through the roof...

168
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,133
I need to

169
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,933
succeed, too.

170
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,767
Ah, of course, you absolutely should.

171
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,367
Alright, let's go up, have dinner, and head home.

172
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,433
Oh, once I get there,

173
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,433
everyone will be curious about who the client is,

174
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,900
so they'll probably bombard us with questions.

175
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,467
You know the deal with confidentiality, right?

176
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,867
Right.

177
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,967
I know.

00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,567
Just tell them I'm taking about ten days off.

00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,300
I'll pack and leave immediately.

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,967
Has her confidence grown?

188
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,833
Or has her greed grown?

193
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,133
The final chance.

195
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,467
Of course.

196
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,367
Oh, the show?

197
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,733
I'm preparing it.

198
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:22,067
Oh, Mom, today some chairwoman...

199
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,533
Never mind.

200
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:31,300
My 'Day Trip' show might return.

201
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,967
Yeah, I'm telling you.

202
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:40,667
You'll soon be able to see
your daughter on TV again.

203
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,500
Well,

204
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,233
can you make sure to tell Dad too?

205
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes.

206
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,033
It'll work out.

207
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:22,900
It's a fresh start, Kang Yeo Reum.

208
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,967
You rejected it?

209
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,800
That's how it went.

210
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,833
If they're even sending a driver and a car,

211
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,033
the deal must be huge, way bigger than usual.

212
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:42,067
What kind of conditions don't match
that you'd throw away such an opportunity?

213
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,933
It's not just about missing the chance.

214
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,133
The numbers didn't add up...

215
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,033
And also...

216
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,467
It was too risky.

217
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:55,467
It was too dangerous.

218
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,867
Why are you laughing?

219
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:58,900
No.

220
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,333
Eat well, Mr. O.

221
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,800
Isn't this situation funny?

222
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,633
Oh, what was that?

223
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,100
Scratching the back of your head.

224
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,333
Mr. O, you always scratch your head
when you lie. It's a habit.

225
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,400
What? No.

226
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,100
Is that so?

227
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,200
He kept scratching his head
when promising my raise last year.

228
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,700
When did I ever do that?

229
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,767
You're doing it right now.

230
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Oh, really?

231
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,400
No, this is...

232
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,667
It's just chronic dermatitis.

233
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,300
My skin gets dry in autumn.

234
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,967
Very parched.

235
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,133
Look at the sweat on your nose.

236
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:42,533
Your 'truth spring' activates when lying, right?

237
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,900
Here.

Above your nostrils.

239
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,067
Ms. Yoo,

240
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,600
what's wrong with you?

241
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,067
Why misinterpret the sincerity of someone
who just wants to live without shame?

242
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,500
So, the request today

243
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,967
turned out to be a bust, that's all.

244
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,633
Wow, kimchi jjigae with pork.

245
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,800
Yeah, wow.

246
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,167
You've got something going on, huh?

247
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,367
What's with this vibe you're giving me?

248
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,933
You don't trust me right now, is that it?

249
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,767
Oh, it's delicious.

250
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,500
Why's this food so good?

251
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,833
That's not it.

252
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,800
It's not that I don't trust you,
it's just... It's driving me crazy.

253
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,467
Explain it then.

254
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,667
Listen to me again.

255
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,433
Look, I went to the hotel.

256
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,267

- Got it.

Look at the sweat on your nose.

259
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,367
I went to the hotel.

260
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,200
But, it felt like a mansion.

261
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
There were so many books.

262
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
When I thought 'Why so many books?'
and pulled the chair...

263
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,233
- Did you wait long?
- Not at all.

264
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,067
Let's order food.

265
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,333
How should I put it?

266
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,833
Your screenplay... It touches on
primal human instincts but...

267
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,433
Fails to show raw desires strongly enough.

268
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:22,500
That script has that ink smell, you know?

269
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,133
That really bothers me.

270
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,133
It shouldn't be that way.

271
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,300
People want honesty, but...

272
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,967
Do you think people would be moved
by a piece of writing that reeks of someone

273
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:33,333
trying too hard to show off what they've learned?

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
You...

275
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,767
lack depth.

276
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:42,900
That's your fundamental flaw.

277
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,967
Listen, movies should...

278
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,900
So?

279
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
So, it's boring? That's your verdict?

280
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:55,300
Don't oversimplify what I said.

281
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,633
If I must be blunt,

282
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,433
my script sucks.

283
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,333
It got rejected.

284
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,433
That's what you meant, right?

285
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

286
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,300

287
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,433
Not my entire life trajectory.

288
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,333
My life is my own.

289
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,233
I'll draw my own conclusions.

Ah.

296
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,567
So you're here to say that my script is crap

297
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,367
and I should just be the one
cleaning up after your movie?

298

00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,000
Ah, you're talking weird.

301
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200

Unbelievable.

How did we end up meeting like this?

325
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:32,400
Dividing the world into things
that make sense and things that don't

326
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,633
is overly binary thinking.

327
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,267
Most things in human society

328
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:39,100
only seem like they don't make sense.

329
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,667
I once ran into my aunt at the Gold Coast lookout

330
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,333
in Australia,

331
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,933
and she was on a group tour with her ladies' club.

00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:48,967

any secrets from you, honestly?

Exactly. She couldn't talk about it either.

353

00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:49,700
Where's Mr. Lee today?

370
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,733
He's on vacation.

371
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,400
I heard he's going to

372
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,100
his grandmother's house
in Jinju to clear his head.

373
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,167
What? Jinju?

374
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,900
I have a rough idea, but I won't confirm it.

375
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,800
Because confidentiality is a promise.

376
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,433
Alright.

377
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:25,700
The car with the chauffeur
and the hotel they stayed

378
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:29,833
when making the request...

379
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,700
Anyway, the destination being that village

380
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,533
means it's from a well-established family
that everyone in Jinju knows.

381
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,267
But, the trip they requested is really simple.

382
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:42,367
<i>My grandmother used to say that if you
climb the Seongjeon Am Temple ten times,</i>

383
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,067
<i>you'll achieve enlightenment.</i>

384
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
<i>Maybe it was thanks to that,</i>

385
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,900
<i>but she lived her life as a rich lady,
enjoying wealth, and even when she passed,</i>

386
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,700
<i>she left without hardship and peacefully.</i>

387
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:04,033
<i>It's the greed of a rich old person
wanting to enjoy luxury</i>

388
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,967
<i>both in life and after death.</i>

389
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,900
<i>Since I became like this,</i>

390
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,567
<i>I couldn't even complete the ten climbs.</i>

391
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:23,367
<i>It's been three years since I last went.</i>

392
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,900
<i>You just need to go there.</i>

393
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:34,667
Simple request, but odd part is...

394
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:38,500
Why choose our agency? That's the question.

395
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,333
They could've hired anyone with money.

396
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,100
Well,

397
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,633
there are two possibilities in that case.

398
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:50,000
Either the person who can get
anything with money is not trustworthy,

399
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,900
or there's a reason why
it has to be you, Yeo Reum.

400
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,333
A reason why it has to be me?

401
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,900
This train feels magical.

402
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,533
Everything tastes better on trains. Even rocks!

403
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,233
Why is that?

404
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,767
Should I make a movie with something like this?

405
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:22,133
A train journey with kids who are picky eaters.

406
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,267
How is it? Good, right?

407
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,600
Thank you.

408
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,500
Enjoy your meal.

409
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:51,333
- Wow...
- Alright, let's dig in.

410
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,467
It's cold noodles with beef pancake?

411
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:56,967
Yeah, I've heard somewhere that this place
is famous for its gibang culture,

412
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,500
and the cold noodles that were originally eaten

413
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,333
in the north for hangover have been passed down

414
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,800
and adapted to the local flavors
of the southern region...

415
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,333
My grandmother used to make
soy sauce-based milmyeon.

416
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,233
Give it a try.

417
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:13,233
Jinju cold noodles are different
from other regional cold noodles

418
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,600
because they use a seafood broth.

419
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,400
What's this?

420
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,433
Where'd you get all this knowledge?

421
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,533
My previous job was travel reporting.

422
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,167
Oh, that's right.

423
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,000
Actually, Yeon Seok...

424
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,633
After this trip, the show...

425
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,300
No, it's nothing.

426
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,733
Here.

427
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,700
- Got the shot?
- Yes.

428
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,733
I'll enjoy it.

429
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:52,033
I'll enjoy it.

430
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,300
[Si Wan]

431
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,833
[Si Wan]

432
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,400
- Eat up.
- Okay.

433
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
The noodles will get soggy.

434
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,267
Here.

435
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,967
Let's part ways here.

436
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,567
Alright.

437
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,833
Feeling sad?

438
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,200
Of course I am.

439
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,233
'What meets must part, what parts must meet.'

440
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:48,333
Meet then part, part then meet again.

441
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,200
Isn't that life and travel?

442
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:56,600
Is this why he said my script was no good?

443
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Huh?

444
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,267
No, forget it.

445
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:02,433
Anyway, we're in the same county.

446
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,867
Call me anytime you need.

447
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:07,333
I will.

448
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,167
- I'll go.
- Okay.

449
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,900
Time to go.

450
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,300
Yes.

451
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,333
You take the bus here,

452
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:28,533
and I'll go to the bus stop over there...

453
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,867
I'm off.

454
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,200
<i>But being honest isn't a bad thing.</i>

455
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,933
<i>Why hold back when you like someone?</i>

456
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:51,300
<i>Mr. Know-It-All,</i>

457
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,467
<i>any idea why?</i>

458
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,533
Yeo Reum!

459
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,167
Yes?

460
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,300
I'm...

461
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm thinking of writing a romance.

462
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,600
A romance?

463
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,467
Or maybe

464
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:22,900
a rom-com screenplay.

465
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,000
That'd be great.

466
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,608
You could write anything well.

467
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:29,336
Why?

468
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:32,176
Because if it's you,

469
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:36,167
you wouldn't write
without knowing what you're doing.

470
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,333
Yeah, I should write with knowledge.

471
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,633
From now on, I'll try to learn more.

472
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,767
How about,

473
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,200
after I finish the script,

474
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,133
you play the lead role?

475
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,133
Really? I'd love that.

476
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:59,233
I'll do my best.

477
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,867
Yeah.

478
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,767
Enjoy your meal.

479
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,833
Two boxes to go, please.

480
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,800
Understood.

481
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,633
She's subtly oblivious.

482
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:18,000
<i>Really? I'd love that.</i>

483
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,067
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

484
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,067
Did I complicate simple things?

485
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Does she prefer direct approaches?

486
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:33,567
[Mr. O Sang Sik]

487
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,167
Huh?

488
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,400
Yes.

489
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,800
<i>Ah, Director...</i>

490
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,467
Are you with our Yeo Reum now?

491
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:48,767
Well, I'm not with 'our Yeo Reum' now, Father.

492
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,467
Got it. Bye.

493
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,300
'Father', really?

494
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,400
What?

495
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,933
No wonder the daughter's clueless.

496
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,800
Wow.

497
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,633
Is this it?

498
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:27,733
They said it's over there.

499
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,467
One, two...

500
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,633
Found it.

501
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:44,900
<i>The traditional house,
where my grandmother lived, is still there.</i>

502
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,300
<i>Once a year,</i>

503
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,700
<i>I go there to relax for days.</i>

504
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,933
<i>Since there's someone managing it,</i>

505
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:58,000
<i>it's not bad to stay anytime.</i>

506
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,767
<i>It doesn't matter which room you use.</i>

507
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:12,300
<i>It looks exactly like a period drama set.</i>

508
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,833
The old houses remain perfectly preserved.

509
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,767
No residents?

510
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:20,700
<i>Yes, I'm here alone.</i>

511
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,067
Not scared?

512
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,467
I'm fine.

513
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,967
It's right in the village center,

514
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,833
and the caretaker lives next door.

515
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:31,567
<i>If you're scared, just call someone.</i>

516
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:37,000
This isn't a haunted house. Nothing to fear.

517
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,067
You seem excited.

518
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:43,633
Yes, I'm thrilled right now.

519
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,000
I might return to broadcasting,

520
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,467
maybe even star in movies.

521
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,067
Movies?

522
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,533
Never mind.

523
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:55,433
But, Mr. O.

524
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,300
I don't understand something.

525
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,767
What?

526
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,900
<i>I don't know how harsh the trip to the temple</i>

527
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
<i>the chairwoman mentioned really is.</i>

528
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,233
But still,

529
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:09,633
I don't get why she asked me to take on the job.

530
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,100
Going up to the temple
isn't exactly a difficult task.

531
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,367
Well...

532
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,333
<i>Maybe it's the kind of reason
that's only possible because it's you.</i>

533
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,688
<i>Perhaps you're just the only one
who doesn't know it.</i>

534
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:23,367
Huh?

535
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,667
For now, just see the trip through to the end.

536
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:30,600
Once you do, you'll understand the reason.

537
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,167
I know a few rich people,

538
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,600
and the truly wealthy

539
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,733
don't waste money.

540
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,500
If I were born into a family like this,
people would probably call me

541
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:10,467
'young lady'

542
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:12,167
or 'lady of the house,'

543
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,267
right?

544
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:18,967
Must be nice.

545
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,167
Huh?

546
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,533
Oh, hello.

547
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:33,400
I saw lights on, and figured you arrived.

548
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,300
I got word from Seoul that someone's coming.

549
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,733
Ah, yes.

550
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,900

00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,800
you two should

731
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,067
eat together now.

732
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:34,133
That's not what I meant.

733
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,900
Ms. Yang, seriously...

734
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:40,267
If you know him so well,

735
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,400
why not go for him?

736
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,167
Come on, let's drink.

737
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:48,133
Down it.

738
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:49,733
Yum.

739
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:53,300
Wow, eggs!

740
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,567
Yum.

741
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:03,400
Something wrong?

742
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,633
Hey,

743
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:16,267
Ms. Yoo Ha Na.

744
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,567
What?

745
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:20,200
Why?

746
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,200
Uh...

747
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,300
Eat some side dishes, too.

748
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,433
What does it matter
whether I eat the side dishes or not?

749
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,200
Do you want me to cook some ramyeon

750
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,500
if you're not feeling like eating?

751
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,300
Want to eat ramyeon?

752
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,633
You like egg ramyeon, right?

753
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:50,400
With bloated noodles.

754
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,167
<i>Why's he suddenly being so sweet?</i>

755
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:57,067
You like soggy ramyeon, too?

756
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:58,667
Yeah.

757
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:01,833
Even al dente noodles

758
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,500
get soggy in your stomach.

759
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:15,233
It's good.

760
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,633
Yeo Reum...

761
00:58:46,867 --> 00:58:49,433
I think I finally understand.

762
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,800
I was always anxious.

763
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,933
But never when I was with you.

764
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,733
I want you back.

765
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:33,267
<i>♫ Like a rain-soaked petal ♫</i>

766
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:38,867
<i>♫ That faded away powerlessly ♫</i>

767
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:48,367
<i>♫ The beautiful smile
that once bloomed beautifully ♫</i>

768
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:52,833
<i>♫ Is no longer here anymore ♫</i>

769
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,100
Si Wan, thank you

770
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,267
for being there for me and being so kind.

771
00:59:57,267 --> 00:59:59,133
What is this feeling?

772
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:00,767
Is it feeling pathetic?

773
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,967
Or is it anxiety?

774
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,367
I think it's fine for us to try it ourselves now.

775
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:09,633
A travel story from Kang Yeo Reum,
who's truly passionate about traveling.

776
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:12,000
Are you two seeing each other again?

777
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,667
Would it be wrong if we are?

778
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:14,700
No!

779
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,767
Yeon Seok,

780
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:18,333
are you confessing to me now?

781
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,800
Yeo Reum's leaving!

782
01:00:28,067 --> 01:00:30,633
Why did you meet the Chairwoman?

783
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:32,400
I can't tell you.

784
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,167
Need bribe money to talk?

785
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:37,667
If...

786
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,367
If I had held onto Si Wan,

787
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:43,200
would I be happy now?

788
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,000
That night

789
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,967
was my most painful night.
