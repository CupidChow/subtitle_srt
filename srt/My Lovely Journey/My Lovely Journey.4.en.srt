Chichi is doing well, right?]

187
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,600
Oh, no.

188
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,630
Hey,

189
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,100
what are you doing eating all of that?

190
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,700
You already have so many good things.

191
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,100
As for those two,

192
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,300
only I and Ms. Yoo know they're dating,

193
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,900
but for Yeo Reum, well, it's a first love.

194
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,400
It's a love that's already over.

195
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,500
Even if it's over for Si Wan,

196
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,630
maybe it's not over for Yeo Reum.

197
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,570
Yeo Reum is

198
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,630
just sincere about everything.

199
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,070
She never does things half-heartedly.

200
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,570
Yeo Reum can't just start easily

201
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,330
and end easily like that.

202
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,400
The other side is already over,

203
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,030
but this side isn't finished yet,

204
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,200
so that doesn't mean they're dating, right?

205
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
Both of them

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,370
have been close

207
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,470
since their trainee days.

208
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,070
Well, their agencies may have changed,

209
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,170
but neither of them

210
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,630
is completely over

211
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,870
nor completely unfinished.

212
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,730
Just when she's about to forget him,

213
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,630
he reaches out again.

214
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,730
It's not exactly over, but
if it's not not over either...

215
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,830
then it's over.

216
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,200
Yum.

217
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,830
Tastes good.

218
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,100
How could

219
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,430
someone's feelings be that clear-cut?

220
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,270
Is a person a cucumber?

221
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,900
A person is an animal,

222
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
and a cucumber is a plant, right?

223
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,430
Since you just compared
the human heart to a cucumber,

224
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,770
I think it's more accurate to say,

225
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,400
'Is the human heart a cucumber?'

226
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,570
There's this strange vagueness

227
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,600
in the way

228
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,730

Seriously,

what are you, Mr. Lee?

232
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,100
One thing's for sure, I'm
definitely not a cucumber.

233
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,370
Ugh, you...

234
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,970
How sophisticated.

235
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,170

236
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,100

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,770
Stop nitpicking.

370
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,730
That's what youth is.

371
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,400
It means, 'Old folks like you should step aside.'

372
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,430
'We have our own language.'

373
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,770
Who are you calling old?

374
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,170
Does being young mean everything?

375
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,700
What's wrong?

376
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,370
I'm still young, you know. Full of youth.

377
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,900
The way you're freaking out,

378
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,400
something is definitely up.

379
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,870
We're still young,

380
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,900
and have a bright future ahead.

381
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,530
But why!

382
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,000
Wait, why does that sound familiar...

383
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,800
[Rest Area]

384
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,600
What about Yeo Reum?

385
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,230
She's not eating?

386
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,630
How could she have an appetite right now?

387
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,570
Why?

388
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,170
Do you...

389
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,530
know something?

390
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,330
About Yeo Reum and Cha Si Wan?

391
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,930
You knew too?

392
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,370
I thought only the Mr. O
and Ms. Yoo knew about that.

393
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,970
I'm...

394
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,530
You must've forgotten I'm Yeo Reum's manager.

395
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,100
Ah.

396
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,470
Professional, truly pro.

397
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,430
As expected, you really are the 'Wise Wind'.

398
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,330
Genie.

399
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,830
Aren't you gonna poop?

400
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,600
Genie.

401
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,530
Shall we go poo-poo?

402
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,730
Oh, yes, good boy.

403
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's go poo.

404
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,370
Poo.

405
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,500
Hey,

406
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,630
that thing costs less than your food bowl,

407
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,000
and is way cheaper than your cushion!

408
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,030
That's my only...

409
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,130
Give it back.

410
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,530
Ah, just take a dump.

411
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,300
Take a dump.

412
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,900
Huh?

413
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,270
Wow.

414
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,470
Welcome.

415
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,270
Thank you for coming all this way.

416
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,000
We have all the essentials provided,

417
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,630
but if you need anything else,

418
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,970
please contact the front desk.

419
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,630
This place must be crazy expensive, right?

420
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,170
Yeah, looks like it.

421
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,030
These are all private villas.
How much is the daily rental fee?

422
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,470
You already paid in full

423
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,000
when you made the reservation.

424
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Who did?

425
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,230
Ms. Kang Yeo Reum did.

426
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,830
What?

427
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,600
This...

428
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,230
Ah.

429
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,730
Wow.

430
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,770
This place is amazing.

431
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,800
Why would someone book all this under my name?

432
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,530
Genie's owner really values security, you know.

433
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,370
Such a mysterious person.

434
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,000
If they're this wealthy,

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,870
they could just travel themselves.

436
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,170
Exactly.

437
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,700
It's getting more mysterious.

438
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,430
There must be some clue.

439
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,000
Genie, look at this. Look at this, Genie.

440
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Genie.

441
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,230
Get it.

442
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,100
Hey, water retriever.

443
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,370
Aren't you the breed that goes crazy for water?

444
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,970
Try again, Genie.

445
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,300
Alright, Genie.

446
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,930
Go.

447
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,230
I can't.

448
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,930
<i>Who are you, Genie?</i>

449
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,670
<i>Who on earth is your owner?</i>

450
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,900
They rented all three

451
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,870
pool villas?

452
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,400
<i>Yes.</i>

453
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,130
So Yeon Seok oppa and Ba Ram
are staying together today

454
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,300
and heading back to Seoul tomorrow.

455
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,100
That's why Manager Hyun was so excited.

456
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,470
<i>He even took leave tomorrow.</i>

457
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,100
Well...

458
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,370
Yeo Reum.

459
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,430
<i>Did you see the article?</i>

460
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,730
<i>Are you okay?</i>

461
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,770
I'm fine, of course.

462
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,130
What does that have to do with me now?

463
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,900
<i>Well, good for them.</i>

464
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,770
Si Wan oppa and Eun Chae look good together.

465
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,870
Alright.

466
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,100
Just take care of yourself until you come back.

467
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,800
Okay.

468
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,370
Jeez.

469
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,530
She keeps saying she's okay at every turn.

470
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,200
Anyway...

471
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,800
So in the end, it was just the young folks

472
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,930
who drove all the way down to Pohang?

473
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,230
Yeah.

474
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,600
You should've come with them, Ms. Yoo.

475
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,300
No, thank you.

476
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm not a fan of the sea.

477
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,530
You don't like the ocean?

478
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,700
Not a fan of salty winds.

479
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,030
They're bad for your skin.

480
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,500
Seriously, Ms. Yoo, you
should've become an actress.

481
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,600
But somehow you ended up
with a guy like this as your CEO...

482
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
It's not too late even now.

483
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,670
If I were meant to become an actress,
I would've left Ohkoo Entertainment ages ago.

484
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,530
You've been acting strange all day.

485
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,130
Don't you feel any guilt?

486
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,630
You crushed a promising actress
into becoming an office worker.

487
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,200
What did I do?

488
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,770
Did I tell her to do that?

489
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,200
Did I forcibly stop her from acting?

490
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,270
Isn't it a CEO's job

491
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,230
to nurture talented actors?

492
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,930
Why are you meddling in
someone else's company business?

493
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,200
Then why are you,

494
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,500
at your age, still riding

495
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,700
a motorcycle

496
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,630
like it's not dangerous?

497
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,100
That... that punk...

498
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,900
That...

499
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Who is that punk?

500
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,630
Mr. O.

501
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,030
It's someone else's private life.

502
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,970
You are crossing the line today.

503
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,370
I'm heading out.

504
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,700
You two go ahead.

505
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,670
We're still friends, but we're strangers now.

506
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,870
It's been over for me long ago, but you...

507
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,200
You're being too clingy.

508
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,070
Ah, I'm so embarrassed. This is really annoying.

509
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,500
Huh?

510
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,730
Hey,

511
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,770
are you doing this on purpose to avoid pooping?

512
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,030
Oh, come on,

513
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,430
you've gotta eat something to poop.

514
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,300
Do you know how long I've waited
for you to poop all day today?

515
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,400
Really not going to eat?

516
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,470
Huh?

517
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,030
Why aren't you eating? Huh?

518
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,430
Oh, you're full, huh?

519
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,630
If I were you, I wouldn't want anything more.

520
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,830
Living in a house like this
with luxury meals and snacks...

521
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,400
Ah, Genie.

522
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,130
Really not going to eat?

523
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,900
Let's eat.

524
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,100
That ring!

525
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,530
<i>Come out, Yeo Reum.</i>

526
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,670
<i>Let's walk by the sea.</i>

527
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,370
<i>Okay.</i>

528
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,630
[He's a guest at our house.
Chichi is doing well, right?]

529
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,730
Now he's not even answering.

530
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,640
Whatever.

531
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,170
Ah, whatever.

532
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,870
Eat it or don't.

533
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,470
I'm leaving!

534
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,930
Want a drink?

535
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,000
Here it is.

536
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,030
You haven't really eaten anything proper today.

537
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,930
Genie neither.

538
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,330
Maybe it's because it's all unfamiliar.

539
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,330
Not eating anything at all.

540
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,930
You've been waiting all day
for Genie to poop, right?

541
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,970
What's the matter?

542
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,570
How did you know?

543
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,930
You've been holding Genie's waste bag
all day without letting go.

544
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,230
If I didn't notice that, I'd be a fool.

545
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,330
Rich person, Genie,

546
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,200
Pohang, substitute travel.

547
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,900
What do these four have in common?

548
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,070
Genie's owner is weird, huh?

549
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,170
Like an unsolvable math problem,
I'm going crazy wanting the answer.

550
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,500
A rich person who can't come to Pohang

551
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,830
and sends Genie instead?

552
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,570
Huh? That's simple.

553
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,330

a retriever this size passing by?

736
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,700
Genie!

737
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,230
Have you seen a golden retriever about this size?

738
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,430
Ah, what do I do?

739
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,370
Genie!

740
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,130
I'm sorry.

741
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,100
Have you seen this kind of retriever?

742
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,170
- No.
- I don't think I saw one.

743
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,130
Oh, really?

744
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,530
Have you seen a retriever that looks like this?

745
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,230
Haven't seen it.

746
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,970
Ah, seriously, where did he go?

747
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,530
Genie.

748
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,270
Mr. Lee.

749
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,670
Check where Mr. Lee is now!

750
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,030
Quickly!

751
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,300
Why?

752
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,730
She said she lost Genie.

753
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,230
- What?
- Wait a second.

754
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,830
I'll contact Ba Ram now.

755
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,370
Check it, hurry!

756
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,830
Just don't speed.

757
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,370
How can she find him alone?

758
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,470
You're a cooler guy the more I see you.

759
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,200
Then, what about you?

760
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,270
Why are you so laid-back, huh?

761
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,970
No, I'm not.

762
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:19,300
I'm just trying to believe in warm humanity.

763
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,770
Yes.

764
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,730
That's right.

765
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,770
Where are you?

766
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,130
Yes, I'm coming now.

767
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,200
Genie!

768
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,100
You, really!

769
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,770
What are you doing here?

770
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,830
Were you trying to give me a heart attack?

771
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,100
Why did you suddenly run here? Why?

772
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,830
Ah, seriously.

773
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,270
Ugh, look at you now.

774
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,470
Oh my.

775
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,070
Dry yourself up.

776
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,600
Thank you.

777
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,200
Well, on TV you just kept smiling brightly.

778
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,530
The dog's so composed,
but why is the owner like that...

779
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,830
This little guy really found the sweet spot here.

780
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,770
Just sat down and wouldn't budge.

781
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,600
So, what else could I do?

782
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,400
I was about to call the police,
but then I saw his leash...

783
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,370
Oh, Yeo Reum.

784
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,870
Yeah, okay, got it.

785
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:54,070
Ah, just in case?

786
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,970
Anyway, at the travel site, Genie's guardian is

787
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,670
you, Yeo Reum.

788
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,730
Yeah, right.

789
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,330
Was it Yeo Reum?

790
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,770
Turn the car around.

791
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,870
Let's eat another bowl of udon
we left unfinished at the rest stop.

792
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,900
Huh?

793
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,170
<i>Genie!</i>

794
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,770
<i>Keep it safe.</i>

795
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,630
Someone said

796
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,470
there might be contact info on the collar,

797
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,230
so I just called that number.

798
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,030
Wow, it's raining hard,
and the owner hasn't shown up.

799
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,170
I thought someone abandoned him.

800
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
Thank you.

801
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,300
Oh, stop crying now.

802
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,970
It's fine since you found him.

803
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,300
But why is he so stubbornly staying in this spot?

804
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,900
Looks like he thinks this is
his place, sitting there confidently,

805
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,770
stretching his neck to look at
the other side of the street.

806
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,170
Can I order food?

807
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,330
Ah, yes, welcome.

808
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,900
Thank you.

809
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,530
Yes, please sit over here.

810
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:07,400
Wait a moment.

811
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,870
The rain stopped, so I should get going now.

812
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,570
- Alright.
- Thank you.

813
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,230
- Come again.
- Yes.

814
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,500
Let's go.

815
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,800
Come on, why is he like this again?

816
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,830
I said let's go.

817
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,530
We're leaving now, okay?

818
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,130
Genie.

819
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,700
Genie.

820
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,670
Genie, what's wrong?

821
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,670
Huh? Are you feeling unwell?

822
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,770
What should I do?

823
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,830
Genie, Genie.

824
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,000
Genie.

825
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,130
Let's hospitalize him for today

826
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,070
and monitor his condition.

827
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,770
Since he's an elderly dog,

828
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,530
his condition could suddenly worsen overnight.

829
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,630
We need to observe his progress.

830
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,870
I have to notify your owner, right?

831
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,130
This happened because I failed
to look after you properly.

832
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,070
How should I explain this?

833
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,530
Genie.

834
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,370
I'm sorry.

835
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,070
I was distracted by other things.

836
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,930
I'm such an idiot.

837
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,700
He can't even say he's in pain...

838
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,730
Your owner wanted me to show you
this street no matter what.

839
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,830
What's this?

840
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,770
No way.

00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,530
<i>Genie, I said let's go.</i>

844
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,070
<i>Why won't you move? Huh?</i>

845
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,170
<i>I said let's go.</i>

846
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:00,300
Was it because of this?

847
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,170
Did you see this?

848
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,270
So, this was it.

849
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,730
This was the reason

850
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,430
why Genie refused to go.

851
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,970
You punk.

852
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,030
Hey.

853
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,030
Hey.

854
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,570
Just leave.

855
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,470
If you come closer, I'll kill you.

856
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:44,470
If I feared death, would I
have come here? You idiot.

857
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,630
How perfect is this place?

858
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,030
The sea, the wind,

859
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,770

00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,070

What is he even thinking?

Did you steal Genie?

00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,830
We might get sued over this.

What did you say to make
the client threaten with legal action?

876
