95

96
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,050

108
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,717
Without even knowing the story,

109
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:39,217
I wondered if it would be
okay to just ask like that.

110
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,950
Right.

111
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,917
Okay.

112
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,150

00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:25,417
You're back, huh?

116
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,683
That country girl from Hwado,

117
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:30,150
who was away for a bit, is back.

118
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,783
The fearless spirit!

119
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,483
I'm tired of hearing that all the time.

120
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:38,250
Ah, about that... when will you tell me?

121
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,017
Why did you cast the clueless country girl
who came on a school trip

122
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,383
to Seoul from the countryside?

123
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:51,117

124
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:54,883

125
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,783

126

127
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,150

128
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,217
Hey, I'll go.

129
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:18,650
Oh, that... your phone.

130
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,917
Never mind.

131
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,550
I'll go.

132
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,350
Let's go!

133
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,650
Let's just do one more thing before leaving.

134
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,883
What else?

135
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,417
- Wait a second...
- Don't.

136
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,117
Hey, Driver Lee!

137
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,783
Travel is about experiencing
with all five senses, right?

138
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,283
Sound matters too.

139
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:57,750
If you film without a mic,
ambient noise ruins the audio.

140
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,717
In TV editing, you can remove
noise and add music later,

141
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:05,083
but travel videos need authentic nature sounds.

142
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:10,283
Clip this on like, and...

143
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,483
use it this way.

144
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,083
It's simple.

145
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,617
And this is called a windshield.

146
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,017
It's useful when the weather is bad.

147
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:24,583
Wow, that's amazing.

148
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,317
Don't say that.

149
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,717
It's fascinating, though.

150
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,583
Feels like I became an expert overnight.

151
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,517

152
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,850
Really thank you, Yeon Seok oppa.

153
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:37,950
Oppa?

154
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,650
Can I call you oppa?

155
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,317
Yeah.

156
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,683
Can't keep calling you 'mister,' right?

157
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,650
What's up with that punk?

158
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,583
Why's he staring like that?

159
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,517
How dare he...

160
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,750
Why is he looking at her that way?

161
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,317
I want to show this off.

162
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,150
Mr. O!

163
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,450
Mr. O!

164
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,183
- Why does he have to do this?
- Look at this.

165
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,483
Look at this.

166
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,250
Oppa...

167
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:20,083
If you have something to say, just say it.

168
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:23,417
Hmph.

169
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,134
You seem excited today, huh?

170
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,158
Me?

171
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,214
You're humming.

172
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,283
You are like, 'Me?' and stuff.

173
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,417
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, la la la.

174
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:33,817
I actually get hyped when driving.

175
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,650
You didn't say a word

176
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,950
or crack a smile the whole ride here with me,

177
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,083
so what nonsense is that?

178
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,517
Spending time with you

179
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,017
brings some excitement, too.

'Spending time with you

181
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,150
Geez, you're really hyped.

182
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,383
No wonder you just went along

183
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,150
when I said we should go together.

184
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,450
I've been thinking, Mr. O.

185
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,617
Hmph.

186
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,717
What thought?

187
