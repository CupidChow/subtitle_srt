00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,367
offered a sponsorship, right?

185
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, wow,

186
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,867
you were quick

187
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,233
to grab that, huh?

188
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,200
Well...

189
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Anyway, the show needs good chemistry.

190
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,933
You, me, and Yeo Reum

191
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,467
worked together before, right?

192
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:58,400
Ah, so I know exactly what you are.

193
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,967
Of course, business should be done

194
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,000
with people you know, right?

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,033
Yeah.

196
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,200
I mean, I know very well

197
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,367
how crafty you can be.

198
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,000
He's so sloppy that even that's an exaggeration.

199
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,933
- Song Sang Hoon.
- Yes.

200
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,100
If you mess up again,

201
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,667
I won't let it slide.

202
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,667
Ugh, 'mess up'? What nonsense...

203
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,567
- You want to return to TV with Yeo Reum?
- Yes.

204
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,967
Now that you've got a solid sponsor,

205
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:35,067
there's a condition.

206
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,233
A condition?

207
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:40,533
I want to place

208
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,067
my own people too.

209
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,933
Your people?

210
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,400
Not Summer,

211
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,067
but Ohkoo Entertainment's revival.

212
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:01,167
Producer Song has his shady sides,

213
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,100
but anyway, there aren't

214
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,567
many people with that much
experience in travel shows,

215
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:10,133
and it's convenient to have someone you know...

216
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,300
True.

217
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,033
That guy is annoying,

218
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,433
but for this show,

219
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,633
she'll just be hosting in the studio.

220
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:19,533
So, she won't have to struggle out there.

221
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,567
What matters is making the show successful.

222
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,967
And to be fair, PD Song's judgment
isn't entirely wrong.

223
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,900
You understand, Yeo Reum?

224
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Of course.

225
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,533
As a safety measure,

226
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:39,133
we've made some arrangements.

227
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,000
Yum, delicious!

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,500
How did you even think of that?

229
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,167
Oh, right.

230
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,167
This worked out perfectly for you.

231
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,333
Exactly.

232
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,800
So, you're really becoming Yeo Reum's
exclusive cinematographer?

233
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,833
Yeah, cinematographer.

234
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,233
Assistant

235
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:06,267
camera team member.

236
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,333
Anyway, you'll be with Yeo Reum, right?

237
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,967
Exactly, that's what matters.

238
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:13,267
Let's just call it being her bodyguard.

239
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,300
Now, I feel much more at ease.

240
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeo Reum is too soft,
so even if Producer Song acts up,

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
she'll probably just go along with it.

242
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,500
Yeo Reum isn't that soft and timid
Kang Yeo Reum she used to be anymore.

243
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,300
Well, while doing substitute travel,

244
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,167
it wasn't the first time Kang Yeo Reum's
guts and boldness made our hearts skip a beat.

245
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,500
So, we're not doing substitute travel anymore?

246
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,300
Why would we?

247
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,767
This is our chance to grow
steadily through broadcasting.

248
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,633
Feels bittersweet.

249
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,567
It was fun and rewarding in its own way.

250
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,900
Great.

251
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Could you lift the chest a little higher?

252
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
Okay.

253
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,800
Once more.

254
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,900
Right.

255
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,567
Oh! Are you okay?

256
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,100
- Ugh, ma'am...
- Get up carefully.

257
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,200
Is this right? Ugh, this is tough.

258
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,167
It's fine, please get up again.

259
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,540
Oh, Yu Ri.

260
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,967
Got the clothes. Thanks.

261
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,500
<i>The size is a bit small, right?</i>

262
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,933
Yeah.

263
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,267
<i>Yeah, the size doesn't fit,</i>

264
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:01,700
<i>so I've been on a stormy diet
while drinking shakes.</i>

265
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,433
It still doesn't feel real.

266
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,500
<i>Even pinching myself every morning,</i>

267
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,667
it just doesn't seem real, you know?

268
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,400
<i>Kang Yeo Reum, you must have
pinched yourself a lot, huh?</i>

269
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,233
Yeah.

270
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,967
Yeah, it hurts a lot...

271
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,800
It hurt...

272
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:21,367
Oh, it feels weird.

273
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:23,733
Your parents must be so happy.

274
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,867
Haven't you told them yet?

275
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,633
<i>No, not yet.</i>

276
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,900
I'll tell them when
the first recording is scheduled.

277
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,833
<i>You should tell them soon. They'll be thrilled.</i>

278
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,800
By the way, Yu Ri...

279
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,433
<i>Yeah?</i>

280
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm doing well, right?

281
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,167
<i>Of course.</i>

282
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,500
This is the right thing to do, right?

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,667

Ugh.

Ah, that's what being a star is,

Are you okay?

00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,333
But, what should I say?

316
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,867
Could you step back before you speak?

317
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,767
During this critical moment,

318
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:33,467
Mr. Lee, what should we do about Yeo Reum?

319
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,967
This posture is

320
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,967
giving off a wrong vibe.

321
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,000
The phone's vibrating.

322
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,233
Argh, this is driving me crazy.

323
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,500
Hello?

324
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,333
Have you eaten?

325
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,367
You're worrying about my meal
even in this situation?

326
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,200
Of course, girl.

327
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,633
We're all just trying to make a living here.

328
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,133
Yeon Seok said not to come

329
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,967

330
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,267
That...

331
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:34,300
Eun Chae's fans swarmed the office, right?

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,733
Well...

333
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
They didn't exactly storm in.

334
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,833
Why?

335
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,167
If they did swarm in, would you be scared?

336
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,267
Don't worry.

337
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,233
At our Ohkoo Entertainment,

338
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,333
we have your fan club.

339
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,667

340
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,267
No need to be scared.

341
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,300
But...

342
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,667
Yeo Reum.

343
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:10,200
Producer Song

344
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,633
called earlier...

345
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,633
Seems like I'm always the one

346
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,533
who can't see the way forward...

347
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:51,433
The station wants to temporarily hold off

348
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,800
on the program launch.

349
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,067
It's not like they want to scrap it,

350
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:58,067
but they just want to put it on hold for a bit.

351
00:20:58,067 --> 00:20:59,567
Because of the bad public opinion,

352
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:04,200
they just want us to lay low for a while.

353
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,933
It's because of the articles

354
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,367
about Eun Chae and Si Wan, right?

355
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,067
I'm...

356
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,833
really...

357
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,867
Why does everything go wrong for me?

358
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,633
That has nothing to do with me, right?

359
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,267
Oh, it's...

360
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:33,733
How much longer do I have to endure this?

361
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:52,833
You've been asking me

362
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,767
for 15 years

363
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,900
why I cast you,

364
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,133
why I picked you up

365
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,400
from that small island town.

366
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:15,133
You were the one

367
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,167
who showed me

368
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:22,667
how to find my way.

369
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
<i>Look there.</i>

370
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,633
<i>That's the lighthouse over there.</i>

371
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:30,133
<i>As long as you find the lighthouse,
you won't get lost.</i>

372
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:31,433
<i>That's right.</i>

373
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,500
<i>But,</i>

374
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,633
<i>what if you can't find the lighthouse?</i>

375
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,367
<i>In Hwado,</i>

376
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,633
<i>if there's a path, the way will open up.</i>

377
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:44,767
<i>Huh?</i>

378
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:47,133
<i>When the tide goes out, a path appears.</i>

379
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,633
<i>The path you can't see at high tide</i>

380
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,500
<i>always shows itself at low tide.</i>

381
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,933
<i>So, all you have to do is wait</i>

382
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,200
<i>until the water recedes.</i>

383
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,167
Even though that little one

384
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:13,133
got lost,

385
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:16,933
she wasn't scared at all, she was so brave.

386
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,800
Well.

387
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,767
With her, she could become a lighthouse.

388
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:27,533
Among all those who wander

389
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:31,700
like moths to a flame just to become a star,

390
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,467
she could

391
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:39,333
actually be a lighthouse.

392
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,533
That's why

393
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,467
I found you.

394
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,367
For this endless voyage,

395
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:56,567
I need a lighthouse.

396
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,767
Then...

397
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,700
what should I

398
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,533
do now?

399
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
There is

400
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,033
a path, right?

401
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,067
You said it yourself.

402
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,767
You said in Hwado,

403
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:29,067
as long as there's a path, the way opens, right?

404
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,900
You said the path that's hidden at high tide

405
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,067
always becomes visible at low tide,

406
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,567
right?

407
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,433
You just have to wait

408
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,967
until the water recedes.

409
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:00,867
Every flower

410
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,500
blooms in its own season, right?

411
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:07,600
You wait

412
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,933
until your season comes.

413
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,767
Work hard,

414
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,567
passionately.

415
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,133
It's not

416
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,600
over yet.

417
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,900
If it's Hwado,

418
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,867
would the path be visible?

419
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,800
[Eun Chae]

420
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,967
<i>Was I too obvious?</i>

421
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,233
<i>Stop teasing me.</i>

422
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,600
<i>I memorized it all in one try.</i>

423
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,567
Yeo Reum.

424
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,967
You've received many good gifts,

425
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,567
but here.

426
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,200
Wow.

427
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,867
It's Yeo Reum's dried squid.

428
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,667
Do you still like these?

429
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,700
My dad sun-dried these on the island.

430
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,567
Even if I liked it, I couldn't buy it.

431
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,867
These aren't even for sale.

432
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,333
I heard you called Mr. O, too.

433
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,600
He told me to go see you.

434
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,233
Oh.

435
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:37,033
I called you so many times,
but you never answered.

436
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:40,333
We're not on friendly terms over the phone, right?

437
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,000
The article was released by Mr. Gu...

438
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,833
Don't get the wrong idea, Yeo Reum.

439
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,767
I know.

440
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,400
I heard.

441
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,900
Oh.

442
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,300
You're running a travel agency now, right?

443
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,033
Substitute travel.

444
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,267
Yes, I do.

445
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:17,300
Must be fun.

446
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,667
I watched all your YouTube videos.

447
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,967
You must've been bored.

448
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,567
Tch.

449
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,267
I saw Senior Lee Jeong Woo's interview.

450
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:32,364
He said you do travel substitution services.

451
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:36,567
Right.

452
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:39,467
It might seem trivial to you, but...

453
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,267
I...

454
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,567
wanted to request it too.

455
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,133
Do it for me, Yeo Reum.

456
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,567
Travel in my place.

457
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,600
Huh?

458
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,967
What do you mean?

459
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,267
Well,

460
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,067
remember the alleys

461
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,567
we used to go shopping in when we were trainees?

462
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,467
I want to go there,

463
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,800
and the tteokbokki place
near Seo Yeon's, remember?

464
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,567
I really want to go there.

465
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,767
Can you do a Seoul trip on my behalf?

466
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,233
I just want to go

467
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:21,967
wherever I want without worrying

468
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,167
about anyone watching.

469
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,467
Please.

470
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,300
Thank you.

471
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,900
- Hey.
- Get down quickly.

472
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,200
Hey.

473
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,500
Wait a minute.

474
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,633
Thank you.

475
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:44,267
Why did you bring me here?

476
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:46,133
I asked for substitute travel.

477
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:50,667
If I could come here myself, why would I ask you?

478
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,867
I don't take clients like you.

479
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:56,367
If someone recognizes me like this,

480
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:59,367
I'll be really uncomfortable.

481
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,200
Stop complaining. Follow me.

482
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,900
Hey, where are you... No!

483
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,233
I said this isn't okay.

484
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,800
Where are we going? What's happening?

485
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
How far are we going?

486
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,767
Huh? Hey! Yu Ri!

487
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh, Yeo Reum.

488
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,467
Yu Ri?

489
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,067
You came early.

490
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,567
Hey, Yu Ri.

491
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,833
- Ta-da!
- Oh my, who's this?

492
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:26,200
It's star Go Eun Chae
who destroyed our girl group!

493
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,367
Hey, what did I...

494
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,267
But, you can't deny it.

495
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:32,533
You followed Mr. Gu and double-crossed us...

496
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,133
Han Yu Ri!

497
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,867
What? Why?

498
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,500
I was better at dancing.

499
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,967
<i>♪ Even now, this clueless night still excites me ♪</i>

500
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,600
Are you guys still fighting?

501
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,933
Back then and even now.

502
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:49,300
Ugh, your casual fashion's
been terrible from the start...

503
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,867
Hey, the key

504
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:53,233
to stylish fashion is harmony.

505
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:55,500
Just wearing luxury logos head-to-toe

506
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,700
doesn't mean you've mastered style.

507
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,033
Why are you showing off?

508
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,400
I'm a costume expert,

509
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,796
so it's not showing off.

510
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,433
It's actually impressive.

511
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:08,067
Then come on,

512
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,067
help me pick some clothes.

513
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,067
Since we're here, wanna look around?

514
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,667
Oh, she wants to go shopping like old times.

515
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,900
And she also wants to eat some street foods, too.

516
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,533
- Eun Chae.
- Yeah?

517
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,300
You're paying, right?

518
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,200
Hey, why'd you call her over?

519
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,267
Of course, you should pay!

520
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,467
Hey! Hey!

521
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:32,133
Fine, my treat.

522
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,567
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

523
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,333

553
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,800
<i>You're from some rural island, right?</i>

554
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,833
<i>I'll definitely succeed here.</i>

555
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,700
<i>Let's take all of this.</i>

556
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,133
I remember.

557
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,533
Amazing Go Eun Chae.

558
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,033
You finally made it.

559
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,400
You said you wanted to have it all,

560
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
had such huge ambitions.

561
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,867
But did I really have it?

562
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,200
Isn't it strange?

563
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,533
Why did everyone push us to 'succeed'?

564
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,667
What do you mean?

565
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,633
We kept saying we'd succeed,

566
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:22,533
but never defined what that meant.

567
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:27,933
I'd try something, thinking
'maybe this is it', but it wasn't.

568
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,800
Try something else, but still not it.

569
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,933
Is buying a Han River view penthouse success?

570
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,533
Or

571
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:44,967
owning a supercar?

572
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,633
I said I would succeed,

573
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,467
but I didn't know what it truly was.

574
00:34:56,467 --> 00:35:00,500
I didn't even know what it was,

575
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:06,100
and I just kept thinking, 'I have to
succeed, I have to succeed.'

576
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,000
I lived like that,

577
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:12,033
always anxious.

578
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,600
Nervous if she had more than me,

579
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,200
worried about what rumors might spread...

580
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:25,533
I didn't even really know what success was,

581
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:29,333
but I was just constantly uneasy.

582
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:34,300
That's why I clung to Si Wan,

583
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,300
but I still felt insecure.

584
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:42,933
What if he left me?

585
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:50,800
What if

586
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,933
everyone abandoned me?

587
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,400
Why do you think like that?

588
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,500
I miss those days so much.

589
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,367
The nights we stayed up chatting,

590
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,167
saving my allowance

591
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,233
to go shopping,

592
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:17,633
and the jajang ramyeon we ate together at night.

593
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,800
I missed all of that,

<i>Before I could even fill
in that blank, luck came along,</i>

598
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,533

600
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,833
<i>Kang Yeo Reum?</i>

Starting soon, please come out.

602
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:42,467
Why do I have to dress

603
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:45,867
like I'm going to a film festival?

604
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:47,367
I don't even have the right clothes...

605
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,167
Yeah, that's perfect.

606
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,833
That's enough.

607
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,500
Come over here.

608
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,000
When I edited this,

609
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,767
there's so much in the deleted footage.

610
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,633
That's you in Pyeongchang in the middle of winter.

611
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,067
That's probably from Dadaepo.

612
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,467
And that's

613
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:37,300
from last year's trip to Seocheon.

614
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,867
You remember everything, Yeon Seok.

615
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:44,900
Of course I do.

616
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,633
While editing Day Trip,

617
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:48,667
I had so much fun.

618
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:56,667
People think they have to hide
their expressions and live that way, you know.

619
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,900
Maybe that's why they travel.

620
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,233
Because somewhere other than here,

621
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,200
they can endure life with their own expressions.

622
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,733
But look at this, Yeo Reum.

623
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,733
No matter where you are,

624
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:13,033
you endure with your own expression.

625
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,267
Whether in front of the camera

626
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:18,000
or in deleted footage that will eventually be cut,

627
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,733
you're just Kang Yeo Reum.

628
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:24,367
On the road or off it,

629
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:26,300
you're always the same.

630
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:30,400
That's why

631
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,767
I really like those clips.

00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,933
that's a true traveler.

635
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,400

Yes.

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,267
someone posted photos of them
shopping in Dongdaemun,

656

so it all calmed down!

657

one month before the broadcast,

666
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:45,233
as written in the script,
the two teams will go on their trips,

667
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:48,533
and the hosts just need to
comment according to the script.

668
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:54,000
Our Yeo Reum won't have any difficulties at all.

669
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,567
Then, there's nothing we need to prepare, right?

670
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,100
Yeah, nothing.

671
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,267
All Yeo Reum has to do is

672
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:01,433
be well taken care of,

673
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:04,300

Just like a flower...

and everyone still has their own tasks.

What is Mr. O talking about?

694
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:36,367

730
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:31,267
