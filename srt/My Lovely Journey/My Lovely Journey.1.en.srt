accepting and drinking it like that?

something she can't drink?

and cuts in a meaningful way.

and fled, right?

544
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,167
- You...
- No, it's...

545
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,867
And if you look at the next screen...

546
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,067
What are you doing right now?

547
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,067
Whistleblowing?

548
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:48,633
Hey.

549
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:51,367
Do you want to quit your job?

550
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,900
Maybe?

551
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,067
In my judgment, it's the limit
of Mr. Song's hearing.

552
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:01,700
PD Ddong Ddang Hoon showed quite an understanding

553
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,433
even of the pronunciation of 'Ddong Ddang Hoon'.

554
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:06,400
What is he even saying?

555
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,067
Isn't he completely nuts?

556
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,656
Bingo.

557
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:16,433
You! Hey.

558
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,767
She's tight-lipped,

559
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:23,367
so she's never spilled any details

560
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,800
about what happened on set.

561
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,900

- No, Director.

563

564

Excuse me for a moment.

565

That guy is such a lunatic. Hey!

00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,167
Seriously,

567
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,333
aren't you ashamed of making excuses,

568
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,233
blaming it on being young,

569
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:52,400
while still getting called a producer?

570
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,400
No matter how long you've
worked, show some respect

571
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,600
to the people you've worked with.

572
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,167

Doing this to a PD from the station, huh?

Do you think you'll be able
to enter the station again?

578
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,367
You're such a thug,

Mr. O, I'm sorry.

00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,167
- Nice.
- Relax.

00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,000
You little fly, you fly.

583
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You scum!

584
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,400
There's a fly here, seriously.

585
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,233
Why?

586
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,067
Wow.

587
00:31:56,067 --> 00:32:00,333
He's doing that now, fully prepared to
never work in this field again, right?

588
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,167
Wow, seriously...

589
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,767
How can he dare raise his fist

590
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,700
in front of the producer!

591
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,933
Wow, the world's gone soft!

592
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,133
Hey, you write an incident report,

593
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,467
step back from the project.

594
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:16,033
And take a break from directing for a while.

595
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,067
Pardon?

596
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,167
No, Director!

597
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,767

598
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,100
Oh, I left my visitor's pass.

599
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,600
Is there still a fly around?

600
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,900
I got them all.

601
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,633
Put some sincerity into it.

Goodbye.

603
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,967
Well...

604
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,867
The head of the marketing department

605
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,900
is the chairman's daughter.

606
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,633
Ugh, actually she's been wanting

607
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:05,533
to leave this show for a while.

608
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,367
It's not your fault.

609
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,033
It's not your mistake.

610
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:13,633
She wanted to leave, but
she never actually did, right?

611
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,067
If your heart is in it, your body will follow.

612
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:17,267
It's just that it happens to be now.

613
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:21,533
Is there ever really an end to something?

614
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,500
- Right?
- Yes.

615
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,467
But, it shouldn't be now, right?

616
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:27,633
That's right.

617
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,067
That's the only show she's on.

618
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,067
- You just focus on driving.
- Okay.

619
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,567
Ba Ram, please pull the car over.

620
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:37,800
Alright.

621
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
What?

622
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,633
Why?

623
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,600
I just want to walk for a bit.

624
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,067
Hello.

625
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,500
What brings you here?

626
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,200
I'd like to see the head of marketing.

627
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,433
Do you have an appointment?

628
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,267
No.

629
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,633
So, you've said everything you needed to, right?

630
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:19,467
Yes.

631
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:24,067
I'd appreciate it if you'd
reconsider just once more.

632
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,367
Does it lack color saturation?

633
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:27,433
Pardon?

634
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,433
The match between

635
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,433
that bag and shoes

636
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:32,633
with that outfit isn't great.

637
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:36,767
Fashion is a strategy, and beauty is a message.

638
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,933
Your skin has warm undertones,

639
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,967
but isn't that lip color a bit off?

00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:45,267
Our Plumping Tint No. 3 Tulip Me

641
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:47,633
would be a much better fit.

642
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,733
Were you really an idol before?

643
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:53,600

649
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,500

650

But, I disagreed.

651
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,000
- But...
- And,

652
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,333
