1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,770
   

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,270
   

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,630
   

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,980
   

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,220
   

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:29,040


7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
   

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,010
   

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,900
 - She gave it to us just now. 
 - That's not it. 

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,800
Are you serious?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,080
Don't flip the meat here. I'll do it.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,560
 If she was alive, would she be about that age? 

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,450
Hye Ri, I mean.

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,920
My younger sister, Hye Ri.

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,360
You know...

16
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,150
family members with adult missing persons

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,450
often get ignored even though they report them.

18
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,310
Because they're adults,

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,080
they get reported as runaways at times.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,040
But you know...

21
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,630
even if they're adults, they might not have run away.

22
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,770
They could have been kidnapped

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,320
or gotten into an accident.

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,810
But if there's no clear indication,

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,560
they first assume they ran away.

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,530
Do you know how that feels for the people left behind?

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,370
You fret in torment,

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,570
a little every day.

29
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,160
It becomes agonizing.

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,940
So my heart...

31
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,460
broods so much that it's agonizing.

32
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,240
I fear...

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,460
that she might be dead.

34
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,410
 Welcome. 

35
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,960
 What? "Dead"? 

36
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,340
 What are you saying? 

37
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,220
 I'm not drunk. 

38
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,610
   

39
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,610
   

40
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,080
 Hey, Ju Eun Ho. 

41
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,030
Hye...

42
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,200
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh!

43
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,870
- Hi. 
 - What?

44
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,220
What? What are you doing here?

45
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,420
I'm here for the triple-broadcast integration campaign meeting.

46
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,500
That campaign? Our team planned that.

47
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,240
Sunbae, is Ju Eun Ho there?

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,060
She's an announcer from our Group 28.

49
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,630
No, it's just you so far.

50
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,040
Hey, you're going to Culture and Education, right? This way.

51
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,470
Okay.

52
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,360
 You're not Hye Ri. You're Eun Ho. 

53
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,770
 Why did you kiss me? 

54
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,010
 An announcer who has my exact face... 

55
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,560
 I keep thinking of Ju Hye Ri. 

56
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,460
 Are you happier now? 

57
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,030
 Doctor. 

58
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,660
 Isn't it strange? 

59
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,870
 Now that I'm in love, everything looks shiny. 

60
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,240
Are you awake?

61
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,620
Where is...

62
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,290
The nurse's office.

63
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,050
Why am I here?

64
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,470
- Do you not know? 
 - No.

65
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,910
I definitely went home last night.

66
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,950
And now I'm here.

67
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,150
You saw me earlier.

68
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,630
No way. I don't even remember coming to work.

69
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,970
Then you ran away.

70
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,100
No way!

71
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,200
Why would I run away from you, Ju Yeon?

72
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,320
Then you went to the restroom and broke a mirror.

73
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,900
Who did? I did?

74
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,210
Then you passed out.

75
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,660
Who did? I did?

76
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,940
But why?

77
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,500
I don't know. Don't you recall?

78
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
No, I don't.

79
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,220
I see that losing your memory

80
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,730
is quite convenient.

81
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,690
Then...

82
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,790
will I get arrested now?

83
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,430
The mirror cost 302,000 won (226 USD).

84
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,920
Are restroom mirrors that expensive?

85
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,950
That's what I asked.

86
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,710
One above-the-sink mirror costs 50,000 won, and 100,000 won with installation.

87
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,170
But there are two sinks. They need to custom order matching mirrors.

88
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,940
The total is 302,000 won.

89
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,720
Then why did I...

90
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,720
break the mirror?

91
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,610
I don't know.

92
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,010
Why didn't you ask yourself in the broken mirror?

93
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,220
I paid for it.

94
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,400
I'll repay you

95
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,790
tomorrow.

96
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,120
But...

97
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,350
why did you do it?

98
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,820
Why did you run away when you saw me?

99
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,550
I told you I want to know, too.

100
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,420
Are you hurt?

101
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,890
It's about time you asked. Are you a "T"?

102
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,980
What's a "T"?

103
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,670
In MBTI (Myers–Briggs Type Indicator), a "T" (Thinking)!

104
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,270
Are you a "T"? You're a "T"?

105
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,930
Why can't you empathize?

106
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,410
How can I empathize with someone who broke a restroom mirror for no reason?

107
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,760
Well...

108
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,620
 I've never seen happiness with my own eyes... 

109
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,640
Are you really not hurt anywhere?

110
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,310
 however, if I could see it, 

111
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,880
 if I could touch it, 

112
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,170
 maybe it feels like this. 

113
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,470
Ju Yeon.

114
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,860
Yes?

115
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,140
I think I wrecked my knee.

116
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,220
I don't think so.

117
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,680
The restroom mirror is wrecked.

118
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,960
 - What? 
 - Doctor, now that I'm in love, everything looks shiny. 

119
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,000
I've never seen happiness with my own eyes;

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,900
however, if I could see it,

121
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,890
- if I could touch it— 
 - No.

122
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,420
Before that, you broke a mirror.

123
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,500
Yes, Doctor. Why did I do that? I don't understand.

124
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,010
Do you remember breaking it?

125
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,170
For example, what were you feeling?

126
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,910
No, I don't remember anything like that.

127
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,800
Then, Hye Ri...

128
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Yes, Doctor. I'm Hye Ri.

129
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,150
Yes, Hye Ri.

130
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:59,300
As I said, we must first figure out the connection between Eun Ho and Hye Ri.

131
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
But, Doctor.

132
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,400
Yes, go ahead.

133
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,500
After we figure it out,

134
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,070
what happens after that?

135
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,110
These symptoms will improve.

136
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,930
"These symptoms will improve"?

137
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,300
Then...

138
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,600
what happens to me, Ju Hye Ri?

139
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,800
- As for that... 
 - Do I disappear?

140
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,500
Do I go away?

141
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,100
It might be hard to understand for the present Hye Ri,

142
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,300
but Hye Ri and Eun Ho are the same person.

143
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,200
So when your symptoms improve, you will be one again.

144
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,060
You will be both Hye Ri and Eun Ho.

145
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,700
No, Doctor. I'm Hye Ri.

146
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,900
I'm not Eun Ho; I'm Hye Ri.

147
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,000
No matter how much I think about it, I've always been Hye Ri.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,090
When I open my eyes, I've always been Hye Ri.

149
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,520
I see Eun Ho only when I close my eyes.

150
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,920
Eun Ho has existed only in my dreams.

151
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,030
But I don't even have those dreams anymore.

152
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,230
Now...

153
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,890
I dream about myself.

154
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,900
My days aren't boring anymore.

155
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,800
I look forward to the next day.

156
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,160
Not Eun Ho from my dreams,

157
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,500
but who I am in the present,

158
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm curious about what tomorrow will bring.

159
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,530
I have hope

160
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,890
because...

161
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm in love.

162
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,000
Doctor, I'm happy now.

163
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,300
But you want me to abandon myself when I'm happy?

164
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,220
No.

165
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,990
I don't want to abandon Hye Ri.

166
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,700
At least, in the present, I'm much happier

167
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,190
than Eun Ho from my dreams.

168
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,140
I'm so, so much happier than anyone else.

169
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,100
I'm happy. I'm happy, because I'm Ju Hye Ri.

170
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,900
I'm happy. I said I'm happy, so happy; I can't even explain.

171
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,800
So, so, so happy.

172
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm happy, happy, happier than anyone else.

173
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,080
I said I'm happy. I'm happy.

174
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,560
Happy, happy, happy.

175
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,860
I'm happy. Happy, happy, I'm happy.

176
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,560
I'm so happy.

177
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,100
I can't let Ju Eun Ho take this body.

178
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,100
   

179
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,070
   

180
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,710
   

181
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,870
   

182
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,630
   

183
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey.

184
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,600
Why aren't you picking up your phone? Kim Mi Yeon called multiple times.

185
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
I lost it.

186
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,000
- If you lost your phone– 
 - I'll go get a new one today.

187
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,740
Are you going to the workshop or not?

188
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,030
"Workshop"? I haven't heard of it.

189
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,090
I'm telling you now. It's Saturday. Will you go?

190
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,780
What? I'm not going. It's Saturday.

191
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,890
Also, you...

192
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,280
Hey.

193
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,070
Why are you looking at me like that? You're ruining my mood.

194
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,340
You were at Media N Seoul a few days ago, right? I think I saw you.

195
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,130
What are you talking about? I'm a PPS announcer.

196
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,540
Don't just say no. You've done this before.

197
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,830
- You saw me and said you didn't– 
 - I really don't know or I wouldn't say that.

198
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,800
Are you sick?

199
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,300
Yes. I'm sick.

200
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,620
Because of this company, world, and unfair system

201
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,780
that doesn't recognize a talent like me, I'm very sick!

202
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,480
So you're not going, right? Bye.

203
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Great work!

204
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
- Announcer Ju Eun Ho, you aren't going to the workshop, right? 
 - No, I'm not going.

205
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,200
Then, Sunbae, let's get your lines before we leave.

206
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,500
I'll do it there.

207
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,620
No, I'm not going to work there. I'm going to drink.

208
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,870
You got drunk and had to write an incident report.

209
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,800
Do you still want to drink there?

210
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,100
It's a workshop. What's a workshop? It's a bonding session.

211
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,330
You're the only person who works there. So let's split up the lines then go.

212
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,660
- Could you get the script from the writer? 
 - Yes.

213
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,310
It's okay, it's okay.

214
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,000
Mi Yeon. I'll do it there. Bye.

215
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,710
Sunbae!

216
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,650
That little... Geez!

217
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,830
Excuse me.

218
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,090
Does Jung Hyun Oh split our lines?

219
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,330
It's always been that way.

220
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,800
You know how fussy he gets.

221
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,400
He throws a fit if he has too many lines or if he has too few.

222
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,300
So we air our show only after checking everything in the script with him.

223
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,380
So by chance, if you think your lines are few, don't look for me.

224
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Look for that guy...

225
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,540
My bruised ego.

226
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,390
Here you go. You can use it right away.

227
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,450
Thank you.

228
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,240
   

229
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,250
   

230
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,730
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

231
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,580
That's the end of today's news. Thank you for watching.

232
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,020
Great work. Thank you. Thank you.

233
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,290
   

234
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,470
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

235
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,170
Sunbae!

236
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,870
Hey, Baek Hye Yeon.

237
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,070
How many times have I asked you out to dinner?

238
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,100
Are you finally gracing us with your presence?

239
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,200
I don't know about that.

240
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,900
Baek Hye Yeon, it's time for you to be a main announcer.

241
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,400
Don't you think?

242
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,900
That sounds good to me.

243
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Maybe it's because you're from a rich family.

244
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,000
You have such a straightforward personality.

245
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,280
Regardless of her family wealth, she was born with a frank personality.

246
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,760
What about you, Kang Ju Yeon?

247
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,790
Are you doing okay with the news?

248
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,870
Yes, it's doable.

249
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,400
Even though you're a replacement, you're so good.

250
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,160
So I've been wanting to buy you dinner.

251
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,760
He's good, right?

252
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,550
Exactly.

253
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,800
I said you could permanently be 8 o'clock news anchor. Why did you turn it down?

254
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,500
I don't think I have the capacity or experience to take that on.

255
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Well, that's something you can continue to consider.

256
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,940
Baek Hye Yeon.

257
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,180
Are you seeing anyone?

258
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,780
No, not yet.

259
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,500
Why not? I'm sure many people are pursuing you.

260
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,900
Why aren't you hooking up?

261
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,870
We all rot when we die!

262
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,700
- Enjoy yourself when you're young. 
 - That's enough.

263
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,200
Press Director.

264
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,400
What did you say, Scoundrel?

265
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,860
   

266
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,100
Wow, is he out of his mind?

267
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,130
For real? Why bring you two out and start cussing?

268
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,500
And why did he throw water on you?

269
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,630
I know. I'm really fine.

270
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,820
Ju Yeon, are you okay?

271
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,180
Yes, I'm fine.

272
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,500
Sunbae, I'm really sorry. Because of me...

273
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,260
Hye Yeon, why are you sorry?

274
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,110
What did that crazy guy say to you?

275
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,810
Wh-What did he say?

276
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,570
I'm so furious I can't even remember.

277
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,220
I'm really fine, Department Head.

278
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,390
He's like that. He's infamous for it!

279
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,280
But, Sunbae, all due to me...

280
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
- It's okay. 
 - Wait.

281
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,790
- Don't we need to report this? 
 - I really don't care! Really!

282
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,560
Hye Yeon, how many times has this happened to you?

283
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,510
Gosh, come on, chill out, Department Head.

284
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,690
Sunbae, I'm sorry.

285
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,130
Hye Yeon.

286
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,630
Go!

287
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,940
Don't think about me!

288
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,260
Hye Yeon, are you sure you're okay?

289
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,530
I'm fine! Bye!

290
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,080
Darn it.

291
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,700
Is it good?

292
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,030
Yes, it's good.

293
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,680
The name of the udon is so funny.

294
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,540
"Tight Tight, Chewy Chewy Udon."

295
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,320
Wow. They even have "Sticky Sticky Conch."

296
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,900
Let's try that next time.

297
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
Sure.

298
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,970
Ju Yeon, didn't you eat already?

299
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,270
Are you just sitting here for me?

300
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,500
It makes me happy just to see you eat.

301
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,170
I don't think so. You look like you're in a bad mood.

302
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,500
Me?

303
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,700
No, I'm not angry.

304
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,980
No?

305
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,320
Your eyes look angry. They're fired up.

306
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,380
Do my eyes look different when I'm angry?

307
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,770
Yes, they do.

308
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,330
When you get angry, your eyes

309
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,630
are so calm

310
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,200
and gently twisted.

311
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,840
What?

312
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,370
So why are you angry, Ju Yeon?

313
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,240
Did something happen?

314
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,760
Is your mother sick?

315
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,130
Did someone cry in front of you?

316
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,100
Well...

317
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,630
I mean...

318
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,200
 Hey, this is Yoon Jong Hyun. 

319
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,420
 No, I just heard this morning. 

320
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,930
 He's sick! 

321
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,820
How could he be sick suddenly?

322
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,800
He just has to drive.

323
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
I had to drive myself.

324
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm the newsroom press director.

325
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
 How could I drive my own car? 

326
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,260
Then attendants told me to park my car.

327
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,940
How dare they?

328
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,750
I'll tell the facilities department to fire them all!

329
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,070
 Darn it. What? 

330
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,280
 So many fools are acting up these days. 

331
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,900
My company doesn't own the parking lot.

332
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,700
I know. That's why.

333
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,190
Really?

334
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Got it. See you later.

335
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,760
What? Ring my amount.

336
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,450
 ­  

337
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,330
What is this?

338
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,650
Why do you stare at me like that?

339
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,190
Hurry up! Ring this up.

340
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,100
What the...

341
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,260
 Why are you screaming? 

342
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,000
Poke what? I didn't poke you.

343
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,100
I just handed you the parking validation ticket.

344
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,200
Is that so?

345
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,920
No, he poked her chest with the parking validation ticket. Like this.

346
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,210
I know. I didn't even have pockets.

347
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,650
I held it out, and you didn't take it! I gave it to you so you could take it!

348
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,030
You should have just handed it to me. Why poke my chest?

349
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,200
I feel so violated.

350
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,900
Poking her chest is clearly sexual harassment.

351
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,800
What? She didn't take my ticket! How was I supposed to hand it to her?

352
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,200
Tie it to a string? Put it in a pigeon's mouth?

353
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,100
You could have just handed it to her. Just like this.

354
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,400
I just don't remember! I...

355
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,780
- didn't poke her! 
 - Criminals always say they don't remember.

356
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,500
What? "Criminal"?

357
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,440
Hey, who are you to make me into a criminal?

358
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,350
She's saying it's possible.

359
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,840
If she didn't give consent, and you made her feel violated or sexually humiliated,

360
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,110
that constitutes sexual harassment.

361
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,700
- Are you serious? 
 - And I'm sorry, but we are not Media N Seoul.

362
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,570
You might run the newsroom over there, but you're just an ahjussi passing by here.

363
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,150
Please speak formally to us.

364
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,360
- What did you say, Bastard? 
 - That word, "Bastard,"

365
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,110
refers to the offspring of an animal.

366
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,280
So save it for your children.

367
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,680
What!

368
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,310
I didn't do it!

369
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,290
So dirty,

370
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,270
terribly loud.

371
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,920
 I'm sorry. 

372
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,020
 I was wrong. 

373
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,000
 I said, "I'm sorry"! 

374
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,730
Excuse me.

375
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,460
Yes?

376
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,290
I have a question.

377
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,750
Did Press Director Yoon Jong Hyun truly sexually harass you?

378
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,110
He poked my chest with a parking validation ticket, twice.

379
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,440
It was so degrading.

380
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,800
Wow, why did he do that?

381
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,320
What?

382
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,760
Isn't he usually like that?

383
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,500
That guy never messes with people who might talk later.

384
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,700
I see. Does he harass only people who keep their mouths shut?

385
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
Yes.

386
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,600
- Because in this field– 
 - Whistle blowing is worse than sexual harassment?

387
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,540
What?

388
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,300
You seem to know something. You're too smart.

389
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,790
Well, these are just basics.

390
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,130
But no matter how careful those people are,

391
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,850
their true colors come out someday.

392
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,540
But...  I have one more question.

393
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,370
Anything.

394
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,260
- Are you dating Kang Ju Yeon? 
 - Oh...

395
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,560
How did you know?

396
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Wow!

397
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,240
Must be nice.

398
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,040
Right. It is nice.

399
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,060
It's so nice.

400
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,360
Then can I ask one last question before I go?

401
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,290
- Go ahead. 
 - When are you off work?

402
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,110
There's a place I know.

403
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,000
Their conch is the stickiest.

404
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,100
I can't tell if it's gum or conch.

405
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,880
Wow, this conch is crazy. So sticky! 
    

406
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,140
I've been craving it since the last time I was here.

407
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,570
It tastes perfect.

408
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,180
It's like a piece of gum, right?

409
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,360
Sunbae, over here!

410
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,510
Over here!

411
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,300
Here, here!

412
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,530
  ­ 

413
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,930
How come you two are together?

414
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,590
I asked Hye Ri out on a date.

415
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,180
She seems an intriguing person.

416
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,890
Sunbae, do you want anything to eat?

417
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,420
No, I'm fine.

418
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,780
Sunbae, did you hear?

419
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,110
Yoon Jong Hyun apologized to Hye Ri.

420
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,900
He said he would do anything she asked.

421
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,600
So Hye Ri asked him to make her look younger.

422
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,870
- What? 
 - He said he'd do anything if I didn't tell the police.

423
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,280
I kept thinking of you telling me I look old.

424
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,310
So I asked him to make me look younger, and he sighed.

425
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,760
That made me feel worse.

426
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,750
So how...

427
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,770
Oh, hello.

428
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,140
Yes.

429
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,770
I'll be right there.

430
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,220
Okay.

431
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,410
Sorry. I have to go.

432
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,680
I have to head out. I'm sorry.

433
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,820
- What? 
 - Where?

434
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
He's like that.

435
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,700
Don't worry about it.

436
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,020
Excuse me.

437
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,630
Hye Ri.

438
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,780
Yes?

439
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,430
Could you...

440
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,020
Could you go somewhere with me?

441
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,930
Where?

442
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,270
 Where did you— 

443
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,510
 Give me back my wallet! 

444
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,830
 "Give me back my wallet," I said! 

445
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,210
 Give it to me! 

446
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,060
- Give it! Give it! 
 - I'll find it for you!

447
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,430
I said to give it!

448
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,780
Give it to me! My wallet!

449
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,450
 My wallet... 

450
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,520
 - Give me back my wallet! 
 - Ahjumma, stop! 

451
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,070
 - Okay, okay. 
 - You arrived. 

452
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,230
 My wallet! 

453
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,090
 Se Yeon, you arrived. 

454
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,750
 Mom. 

455
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,520
 It's Ju Yeon. 

456
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,030
 Ju Yeon... 

457
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,570
 It's Ju Yeon. 

458
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,550
 You can go. I'll stay. 

459
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,110
 Okay. 

460
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,160
Ju Yeon.

461
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,970
Want to come here?

462
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,200
Come over here, my Se Yeon.

463
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,070
Can I come in?

464
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,220
Hye Ri.

465
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:53,430
- Who... 
 - Hello. I'm Ju Yeon's...

466
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,790
girlfriend.

467
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,190
You look like a cute rabbit.

468
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,270
I've never heard that before.

469
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,670
When did you get a girlfriend, Se Yeon?

470
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,900
Ahjumma, can I hold your hand?

471
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,400
You're already holding it.

472
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,310
Your hands are so thin.

473
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,140
Are you eating?

474
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,560
You're so thin.

475
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,550
I... can't really swallow.

476
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,090
But Koreans live on rice.

477
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,790
Ahjumma, you need to make sure to eat.

478
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:41,560
Then will I become pretty like you?

479
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,180
No.

480
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,740
You'll stay alive.

481
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,090
Staying alive is a good thing, Ahjumma.

482
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,170
Is it?

483
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,380
Of course.

484
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,590
It's a really, really good thing.

485
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,810
So be thankful

486
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,150
that you're alive

487
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,440
and that Ju Yeon is alive.

488
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,200
Does my Ju Yeon

489
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,200
treat you well?

490
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,040
Yes.

491
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,230
Ju Yeon is so warmhearted,

492
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,170
as warm as your hands.

493
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,180
Is that so?

494
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,950
It's a good thing to be warm because that means...

495
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,540
That means you're alive?

496
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,100
That's right.

497
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,360
You're smart.

498
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,600
 I thought life was so boring. 

499
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,730
 But in my tedious days, 

500
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,860
 you arrived, Hye Ri. 

501
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,730
Is that why you fell for me?

502
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,160
Thank you for the ring.

503
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,430
I think it's so pretty.

504
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,490
I didn't give it to you, though.

505
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,030
Your mom did. That's why I'm even more thankful.

506
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,600
Did you push back my hair since I look so pretty right now?

507
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,700
No. I thought you might have a hard time seeing.

508
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,460
Wow.

509
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,400
The sky is so clear tonight.

510
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,350
Yes.

511
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,150
It's clear.

512
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,230
   

513
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,950
   

514
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,110
 What does that mean? 

515
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,820
   

516
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,500
   

517
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,750
Everyone's here, right? Let's leave now! Yes?

518
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,600
- I thought she wasn't coming. 
 - What?

519
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,030
I said, "I thought she wasn't coming."

520
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,160
But she did.

521
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,270
Right. I ended up coming.

522
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm so sorry.

523
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,550
No need to be sorry.

524
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,610
   
   

525
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,000
 There are many lines after this news item. 

526
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,630
This is the main item of the day.

527
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,340
But, Deputy, if you take this one, you already–

528
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,640
In my opinion, I think I should do it

529
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,440
because you said the line is long.

530
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,200
I'm good at memorizing. I should do it, no?

531
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,690
   

532
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,060
Let's keep going.

533
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,300
I'll do it up to here.

534
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,300
From here to here...

535
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,200
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - Shouldn't I take over from here?

536
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,510
Why are you in this car? I thought you were in the other car.

537
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,850
I just wanted to lie down. I didn't realize it was this car.

538
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,330
Excuse me, where are we going?

539
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,870
I just came along without even knowing that.

540
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,550
I'm so busy. There's so much on my mind.

541
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,980
This is...

542
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,970
   

543
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,810
Up to here.

544
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,420
 Wow! 

545
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,530
 It's so pretty here. 

546
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,590
We should go for a walk later.

547
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,770
We can get footage if we see anything.

548
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,880
Sounds good.

549
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,120
A walk at night? No way.

550
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,690
Hello.

551
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,170
Why can't we take a walk at night?

552
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,430
So many people have died in the forest at night.

553
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,440
No way.

554
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,040
Why would they die on a walk?

555
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,410
Are there animals?

556
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,800
No.

557
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,650
The forest is so dense that they get lost and die.

558
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,240
- "Lost"? 
 - Lose the way.

559
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,540
The way.

560
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,770
 Why would we get lost? The map apps work so well these days. That's nonsense. 

561
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,250
 You're just trying to scare us. 

562
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,290
 You won't get a phone signal in there. 

563
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,040
 So if you get lost, you're in trouble. 

564
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,100
You'll wander all night and freeze to death.

565
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,580
In this weather? It's so warm these days.

566
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,730
 The woods are cold, even in summer. 

567
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,870
 How will you survive the cold night? 

568
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,120
 I'm sure some people still go in. 

569
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,400
 That's for sure. 

570
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,900
 Too many ignored my warning and went in. 

571
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:41,100
Then they never return from that forest.

572
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,800
Did that...

573
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
happen to many people?

574
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,750
Well, one or two people.

575
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,800
College students, especially.

576
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,440
When they get drunk and go in there, they can't come out.

577
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,110
The woods are just like the ocean.

578
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,640
If you go in the middle of the night, you can never leave.

579
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,250
If you're going in, go now.

580
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,770
Darn it.

581
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,740
After hearing that, I can't go even in the day.

582
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,790
So good!

583
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,350
Drink! Drink! Alcohol is going down!

584
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,290
Chug, chug, chug!

585
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,540
I finished it.

586
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,000
Unnie, you're leaving already?

587
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,270
I think we're done discussing work. It's finished, right?

588
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,870
We have one more item.

589
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,480
But Su Jeong hasn't finished it yet.

590
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,960
That's nothing. I'll head out.

591
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,980
U-Unnie!

592
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,710
Travel safe!

593
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,320
 Come on! Hurry! Drink it up! 

594
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,040
 Mi Yeon is here! 

595
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,580
 Do it again. 

596
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,740
 - Hurry! 
 - Do it again! 

597
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,920
   

598
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,010
 A graduation trip? 

599
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,220
 You have to go. 

600
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,810
 You should definitely go. 

601
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,180
 Go on the graduation trip. 

602
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,360
 You have no friends because you don't go to things like that. 

603
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,330
 I don't want to go. 

604
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,840
 I really don't. 

605
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,730
 But I really don't want to go, Unnie. 

606
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,380
 What do I even do there? 

607
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,840
 I don't want to. 

608
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,880
 Can I just stay home? 

609
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,770
 Unnie. 

610
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,480
 I'm not going. 

611
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,370
 I don't need friends! 

612
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,860
 Unnie. 

613
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,130
 I'm not going. 

614
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,060
 All I need is you, Unnie. 

615
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,770
 The daily temperature range is wide this spring. 

616
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,990
 Your immunity might get weaker. 

617
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:58,500
 There's been an increase in patients visiting hospitals with the flu. 

618
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,890
But there have been issues of hygiene at some hospitals.

619
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,260
The repeated problem of hospital hygiene,

620
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,700
"Issue-In" is reporting on it now.

621
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,400
VCR start.

622
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,120
   

623
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,990
   

624
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,860
 Three, two, one... 
   

625
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,100
 Cue. 

626
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,950
 "A child who can't take a step forward," 

627
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,690
"a child who can't have a spoonful of food,"

628
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,370
"if her older sister doesn't say to go outside,"

629
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,790
"or if she doesn't tell her to eat,"

630
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:46,050
"14-year-old Chae Hyeon stays home all day"

631
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,400
"and does not eat anything."

632
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,660
"Since her older sister left home, Chae Hyeon has not eaten anything until now."

633
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:01,160
"She is currently in the hospital for extreme malnutrition."

634
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,750
 Chae Hyeon, who lost her parents young, 

635
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:08,010
 depended on her sister as if she was her mother. 

636
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,070
 When her sister, six years older than her, went to school, 

637
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,900
 Chae Hyeon was like a puppy, waiting for her sister all day. 

638
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,940
 This is how she spent her time. 

639
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,260
 Only when her sister came home, 
   

640
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,760
 that's when Chae Hyeon would eat anything. That was her day. 

641
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,780
 To Chae Hyeon, with a mental health disability, her sister was her everything. 

642
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,820
After the VCR, it's Ju Eun Ho's line, right?

643
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,660
 Yes, Announcer Ju Eun Ho can pick it up. 

644
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,850
Producer.

645
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,340
What?

646
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,100
Did you hear that? After the VCR...

647
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,630
What?

648
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,050
What's wrong with Ju Eun Ho?

649
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,070
Announcer Ju Eun Ho, what's wrong?

650
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,640
 What's going on? 

651
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,660
 Who else does she have? All she has is her sister. 

652
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,430
 She would always follow her around. 

653
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,670
 Her sister thought it was annoying. 

654
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,010
 She ran away in the middle of the night with a boy. 

655
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,500
 That's why she stopped eating. 

656
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,400
 - She eats only if her sister is around.  
 - Hey.

657
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,800
 My goodness. Oh, no... 

658
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:41,270
 Sadly, the older sister always found Chae Hyeon bothersome. 

659
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,700
 - Unnie. 
 - I'm busy. Let's talk later. 

660
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,600
 - Unnie. 
 - Hey. 

661
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,500
 Can you just stay still? Be quiet and wait. 

662
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,680
 All I need is you, Unnie. 

663
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,760
 Ju Hye Ri! 

664
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,040
What?

665
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,100
Ju Eun Ho.

666
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,370
 I like you, Unnie. 

667
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,740
 I like only you. 

668
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,370
 I'm good at waiting. 

669
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,370
 Hey. 

670
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,330
 Wait over there. 

671
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,290
Mi Yeon, how many more minutes in the VCR?

672
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,200
"VCR"? How many more minutes in the VCR?

673
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,800
- Eight minutes. 
 - Call an ambulance.

674
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,300
When the VCR is done, give me the lines. I'll figure it out.

675
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,890
 No, Sunbae. You have so many lines after the VCR. 

676
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,710
If you do it alone, it'll look odd.

677
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,330
What about the finish?

678
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:41,520
You can figure out the lines, but you two need to finish together.

679
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,670
Call the ambulance right now.

680
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,820
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

681
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,810
I'll do the lines.

682
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,800
Then I'll see how she's doing and hand her the mic.

683
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,060
 Mi Yeon, turn off our mics. 

684
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,160
Turn off their mics, please.

685
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,330
Hey.

686
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,960
Ju Eun Ho?

687
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,680
Eun Ho...

688
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,960
Look at me.

689
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,860
Look at me.

690
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,430
 Who did this to Chae Hyeon? 

691
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,450
 Was it her sister? 

692
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,200
It... it wasn't me.

693
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,010
Right.

694
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,720
It wasn't you.

695
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,080
It wasn't you, Eun Ho.

696
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,600
 Even today, Chae Hyeon is still waiting for her sister in her dreams. 

697
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,150
 She dreams of her sister coming to save her. 

698
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:08,580
No... no...

699
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,730
It's okay.

700
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,620
It's okay.

701
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,600
I'm here.

702
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,570
You're fine.

703
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,390
It's okay.

704
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,850
You can do it, right?

705
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,420
Let's get up.

706
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,040
Sit.

707
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,660
I'll take the line right after the VCR.

708
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:34,570
Announcer Ju Eun Ho, take it from the next section. From "At 'Issue-In,' we are..."

709
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,560
 Really? Is she okay? 

710
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,770
Eun Ho, are you really okay?

711
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,290
 Yes. 

712
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,280
Here.

713
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:01,090
At "Issue-In," we are looking for Chae Hyeon's sister.

714
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,360
 Her name is Kim So Hyeon, and she is currently 20 years old. 

715
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,980
 Her round eyes and face are so pretty. 

716
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,040
 That's all the news we have today. 

717
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,060
 Have a good day. 

718
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:19,600
Please, please, please...

719
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,440
Thank goodness.

720
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,470
Yes, yes. She got better.

721
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:28,830
Yes.

722
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,610
I'm sorry.

723
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:53,620
- Chan Woo, do it fast. 
 - Got it.

724
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,400
Are you done?

725
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,200
- Yes, they're off, Deputy. 
 - Good work.

726
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,580
Good work.

727
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,830
Eun Ho, are you okay? Are you sick?

728
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,190
Do you need to go to the hospital? Should I call an ambulance?

729
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,610
Are you really okay?

730
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,110
Hey, how can she answer all those questions at once?

731
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,280
We're headed out. See you after the holiday.

732
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,020
What? Answer me before you go.

733
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,710
Call me.

734
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,210
- Sunbae. 
  - Hello. 

735
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,860
Hey.

736
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,570
Let go.

737
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,950
You can go now.

738
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,560
Should I go?

739
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,400
What should I do, Ju Eun Ho? Should I get out?

740
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,740
 Doctor. 

741
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,660
 I've never seen happiness with my own eyes; 

742
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:52,140
 however, if I could see it, 

743
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,690
 if I could touch it, 

744
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,700
 maybe it feels like this. 

745
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,720
Eun Ho.

746
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,060
Look at me.

747
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:25,050


748
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:41,080
♫  Those dazzling moments and shining dreams  ♫

749
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:47,420
♫  The warmth of that day and your breath  ♫

750
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:53,870
♫  I won't forget when you smiled at me  ♫

751
01:05:53,870 --> 01:06:00,520
♫  All those moments are so precious  ♫

752
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:06,740
♫  Your voice drifts farther away  ♫

753
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:13,480
♫  Even if it feels far, please don't let me go  ♫

754
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:20,930
♫  Our times are not over  ♫

755
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:26,240
♫  Remember, I'm waiting for you every day  ♫

756
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,750
♫  I love you, I love you  ♫

757
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:39,030
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

758
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:45,600
♫  I love you, I love you  ♫

759
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:51,850
♫  I love you so much, every moment  ♫

760
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:58,170
♫  The sad air, your cold tone  ♫

761
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:04,910
♫  I miss you and your smile  ♫

762
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:08,840
♫  Our times are not over  ♫

763
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,700
   

764
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:24,230
♫  I love you, I love you  ♫

765
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:30,530
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

766
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:36,940
♫  I love you, I love you  ♫

767
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:43,440
♫  I love you so much, every moment  ♫

768
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:09,330
♫  I love you  ♫
