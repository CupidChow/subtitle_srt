1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,740
   

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,290
   

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,660
   

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,010
   

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,220
   

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,970


7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,050
   

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,080
   

9
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:20,070
   

10
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,900
   

11
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,790
   

12
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,780
   

13
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,330
Hey.

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,940
You missed work without notifying us.

15
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,550
This is unacceptable. Are you Generation MZ (flexible work) or something?

16
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,460
Hey. I'm MZ, too.

17
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,100
But actions like this insult our generation.

18
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,250
 The supervisor is a good person so he lets it go. If it were me? 

19
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,740
 I'd scold you. 

20
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,010
 Back in my day, you wouldn't dream of being absent without notice. 

21
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,530
 You didn't even call. 

22
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm sorry. I mean it.

23
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,470
Okay.

24
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,980
You're unusually easy to deal with.

25
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,250
Go to the administrative office and get the revised parking instructions.

26
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,650
Okay. I will go without complaining.

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,310
Hye Ri.

28
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,450
Hello, Kang Ju Yeon.

29
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,270
That was my older sister.

30
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,710
But you said you were an only child.

31
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,240
I thought... I mean...

32
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,340
It turns out I had an older sister.

33
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
What?

34
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,810
It's a complicated story.

35
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,690
Anyway, that's how it is. It's basically the same thing.

36
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,530
What do you mean by "that's how it is"?

37
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,500
And what's "basically the same thing"?

38
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,270
That's...

39
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,840
very hard to explain.

40
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,240
- Also— 
 - Let me go first. I have a question, too.

41
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,300
Why were you outside my place?

42
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,040
Oh, I just...

43
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,100
really missed you.

44
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,930
Why?

45
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,390
N-Nothing.

46
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,590
You're wearing the ring.

47
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,490
What are you doing today, Kang Ju Yeon?

48
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,840
Today, I...

49
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,200
   

50
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,990
   

51
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,080
   

52
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,510
   

53
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,460
   

54
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,290
   

55
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,670
All right, you all know the goal of this competition is bonding.

56
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,360
It's not a professional dodgeball match.

57
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,950
We are not fighting to the death.

58
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,650
People have to come to work tomorrow. What does that mean?

59
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,210
Please do not hit each other in the face.

60
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,930
You cannot throw the ball above someone's neck.

61
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,240
- Got that, everyone? 
 -  Yes. 

62
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,540
- Got that, everyone? 
  - Yes! 

63
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,800
Then we will get started!

64
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,220
 Sunbae, when I was little, 

65
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,130
 children always threw balls at me in dodgeball and such. 

66
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,240
 - Why? 
 - Because I'm pretty. 

67
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,260
 Why would they do that when you're pretty? 

68
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,540
 Because I was annoying on top of being pretty. 

69
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,630
 How? Like this. 

70
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,200
 It was starting then... 

71
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,550
 that I became good at dodgeball. 

72
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,350
♫  Let's run together in clear sunshine  ♫

73
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,390
♫  By an endlessly-wide ocean  ♫

74
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,560
♫  Let's run together until the end  ♫

75
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,700
♫  When you feel frustrated, close your eyes and recall  ♫

76
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,670
♫  Remember the promise we made  ♫

77
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,860
♫  Think further, dream higher  ♫

78
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,700
♫  A new challenge begins now  ♫

79
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,300
♫  If we are together, we can fly higher  ♫

80
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,560
♫  Be strong; shout out loud; you can do it  ♫

81
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,630
♫  We will hold each other's hand tightly  ♫

82
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,740
♫  Let's step forward together  ♫

83
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,430
♫  This best moment, that's you  ♫

84
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,430
Hey! I said don't hit her in the face!

85
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,780
Sunbae, don't you feel bad for me?

86
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,700
- Are you okay? 
 - No.

87
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
It hurts so much.

88
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,790
But you know what hurts even more?

89
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,060
What?

90
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,620
That I can't compete in partner dodgeball with you.

91
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,490
I really wanted to be partners with you.

92
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,390
I've been bribing the dodgeball team leader for a month.

93
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,390
But now that this happened, I can't play partner dodgeball.

94
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,290
This is so annoying.

95
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,000
Baek Hye Yeon, you can't play partner dodgeball, right?

96
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,090
No. I can't!

97
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,380
We're short one person.

98
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,670
Go find someone.

99
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,180
What?

100
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,770
This is already so unfair. You want me to go find someone?

101
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,830
I don't want to...

102
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,120
Hye Ri, what are you doing here?

103
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,080
I brought some snacks sponsored by the parking office.

104
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
- Wow, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

105
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,610
Have some.

106
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,430
- Thank you. 
 - Hye Ri!

107
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,670
Hye Ri, you can play.

108
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,950
What? Where?

109
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,120
Partner dodgeball.

110
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,330
Right, Sunbae's partner is Hye Ri anyway. I can understand.

111
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,180
♪ I can sit comfortably with my bleeding nose ♪

112
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,610
What are you...

113
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,910
Everyone, this is partner dodgeball!

114
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,380
- We hit the female players, got it? 
  - Yes! 

115
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,150
Hye Ri, do you even know how to play partner dodgeball?

116
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,680
I do, but...

117
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,550
Don't worry. I'll try to get out as soon as possible.

118
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,180
That's a good idea. Let's just die quickly. Can you do that?

119
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,730
Dying is probably easier than we think.

120
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,830
Okay, let's begin!

121
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,340
She's playing too hard, considering how she acted like she wouldn't play.

122
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:49,350
Wow. She's playing hard, but Kang Ju Yeon looks like he will die soon from the balls.

123
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,160
Never mind dying.

124
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,530
He will be lucky not to go to the hospital.

125
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,580
What? I seem to be good at this, right?

126
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,960
What? Am I not dead yet?

127
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,910
Hye Ri, you said you wanted to die early.

128
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,830
 I did. But now that I'm good at it, I'm getting greedy. 

129
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,190
I don't... think you should... feel that way.

130
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,070
That's what... I think.

131
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,780
 We did it! 

132
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,410
I knew you'd be good.

133
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,230
You're so good, especially your plan to be out at the start.

134
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,300
I tried my best, but...

135
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,660
Not you. Hye Ri, how come you're so good at dodgeball?

136
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,510
Were you bullied as a child?

137
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,250
I don't know. As an adult, maybe, but no.

138
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,780
Maybe I was. Maybe I wasn't.

139
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,080
You're so good at it, so good at it.

140
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,150
I think this was Hye Ri's match.

141
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,120
Hey, Kang Ju Yeon, are you okay?

142
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,490
Do you need to go to the hospital?

143
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,280
You might have fractured your bones. I really think so.

144
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,700
What are you saying?

145
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,880
If he got a fracture, he couldn't sit like this.

146
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,980
Sunbae, so...

147
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,890
- why are you so bad at dodgeball? 
 - Omo?

148
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,530
Baek Hye Yeon,

149
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,090
he did a really good job.

150
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,900
He did. He was basically Danpei! (Japanese anime character who plays dodgeball)

151
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,300
No.

152
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,590
Dodgeball isn't just about getting hit.

153
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,060
She's right. It's about receiving, throwing, shooting the ball, and hitting someone...

154
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,420
To take them out.

155
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,510
Sunbaenim Kang Ju Yeon.

156
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,830
What? What do you want?

157
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,430
They want you for male dodgeball.

158
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,840
Good luck.

159
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,130
Practice dodging.

160
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,860
Are you okay?

161
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,620
- Of course, I am. 
 - Fighting!

162
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,930
Let's go!

163
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,440
♫  If we are together, we can fly higher  ♫

164
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,360
He could have played well like that earlier.

165
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,050
So good!

166
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,530
Did you say your name was Baek Hye Yeon?

167
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,770
Hye Yeon, how do you and Kang Ju Yeon...

168
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,260
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,800
- It's okay. 
 - Are you okay?

170
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,650
You're bleeding.

171
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,350
Oh, you're right.

172
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,450
I can't believe it needed stitches.

173
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,350
Didn't it hurt? I heard you got scratched by a nail.

174
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,690
No, I didn't even realize it tore the skin.

175
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,090
It could have been really bad.

176
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,840
What is this, Kang Ju Yeon?

177
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,670
Oh, this...

178
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,030
It was next to you when you passed out last time.

179
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,110
I kept it. Take it.

180
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,050
Were you able to...

181
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,540
turn it on?

182
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,260
It is yours, right?

183
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,100
No. It's my sister's.

184
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,540
I don't remember why I had her phone that day.

185
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,370
You had your sister's phone on you.

186
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,380
But why don't you remember?

187
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,690
I know.

188
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,150
It seems I'm not sure about many things.

189
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,590
Then, Hye Ri,

190
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,990
I wanted to get in touch with you so I called the administrative office.

191
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,820
But they said your employee record—

192
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,300
I don't have that.

193
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,210
How can you not?

194
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,100
I don't know. I must not be registered yet.

195
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,610
Maybe it was omitted.

196
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,680
I see.

197
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,050
So it was omitted.

198
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,710
Kang Ju Yeon.

199
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,500
You accept things very quickly.

200
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,370
That's because...

201
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,380
it's coming from you, Hye Ri.

202
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,980
You also seem a very curious person.

203
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,480
That's because...

204
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,370
you make me curious, Hye Ri.

205
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,060
   

206
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,350
Good morning!

207
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,760
 It's not that he didn't get it. 

208
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,360
 He gave up the 9 o'clock news for you! 

209
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,630
 - Wh-What? 
 - That punk met the Press Director privately 

210
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,090
 and traded your 12 o'clock spot for his 9 o'clock! 

211
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,060
 Please have Announcer Jung Hyun Oh audition, Press Director. 

212
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,500
 You know how good he is. 

213
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,920
 Hey. 

214
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,200
 Yes, Press Director. 

215
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,730
 You two are so desperate for each other, but just keep it between you two. 

216
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,270
 Stop trying to pull me into it. 

217
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,980
 You know, Jung Hyun Oh could ask me for a favor. Fine. 

218
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,210
 I would grant his request. Why? Because he's a star. 

219
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,850
 But... 

220
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,880
 how dare someone like you? 

221
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,130
 Get out. 

222
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,530
So?

223
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,070
I'll drop out of the 12 o'clock news, starting today.

224
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,160
And?

225
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,630
So put Jung Hyun Oh back on the 9 o'clock news.

226
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,330
If the 9 o'clock anchor seat was something

227
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,430
I could plug in and out as I wished,

228
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,730
then plug back in and out again,

229
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,130
none of this would have ever happened, Eun Ho.

230
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,600
Sunbae, you could go to the Press Director and appeal it.

231
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,970
I'm saying I'll quit.

232
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,970
The decision has already been made. If your change of heart

233
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,350
could make the Press Director change the hire,

234
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,420
I would have never bowed down to that jerk in the first place.

235
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,230
You did already?

236
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,760
I did. I tried everything.

237
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,990
Nothing worked.

238
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,510
You know what I'm hoping for now?

239
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,400
- What? 
 - That Jeon Jae Yong messes up the news.

240
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,390
That's a given.

241
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,790
He's not good. He was so bad as a reporter that he got demoted.

242
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,080
No, no, no.

243
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,320
I hope he does so badly, beyond my wildest imagination,

244
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,180
that Soh Chin Guk clings to my leg and says, "I'm sorry, Team Leader Kim."

245
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,850
"Give me Jung Hyun Oh. Please!"

246
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,790
I'll make him beg, Eun Ho.

247
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,730
Yes, Sunbae. Make that dream come true.

248
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,550
If you need me for anything, I can do—

249
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,610
No, no, no. I don't need you, Eun Ho.

250
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,340
Right. But if you need me in the future...

251
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,130
Please exit my office now, Eun Ho.

252
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
   

253
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,530
   

254
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,820
Welcome.

255
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Aigoo, hello. 
    

256
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,190
As for me, I'm about to be the face of the PPS 9 o'clock news,

257
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,030
Anchor Jeon Jae Yong. 
    

258
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,800
Sure. Would you like to order?

259
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,390
What?

260
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,100
Yes. Order, I should order.

261
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,900
Then I'll have...

262
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,370
a large size etoupe (taupe) chocolate cheesecake ppucino.

263
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,080
Hey.

264
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,280
Will he do the 9 o'clock news with that diction?

265
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,150
What does Soh Chin Guk see in Jeon Jae Yong?

266
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,920
It's because he's a reporter.

267
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,690
I told you. They take care of their own.

268
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,500
A large size etoupe chocolate java chip cheesecake frappucino.

269
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,240
One, just one cup of coffee.

270
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,470
Hyun Oh just looks like a massive fool.

271
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,370
What is Jung Hyun Oh up to now, anyway?

272
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,110
   

273
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,660
Aigoo. Hey, Hyun Oh, you're here.

274
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,780
Hey, smile.

275
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,290
Dude, smiling is good for you. Smile!

276
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,600
Team Leader, do you think I can smile in this situation?

277
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,470
The higher-ups suddenly

278
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,570
asked me why you use a big office when you don't even do the 9 o'clock news.

279
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,800
They said you need to vacate immediately.

280
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,290
They said it made no sense a deputy has a big office anyway,

281
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,570
that it's a "waste of space and time."

282
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,970
When the country is struggling, saving a little space where we can is patriotism.

283
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,790
Sure, sure.

284
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,610
Don't sigh, Hyun Oh.

285
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,510
Everything is screwed. What's the use of sighing?

286
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,220
Smile!

287
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,290
Smile like me. You know, for me,

288
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,700
smiling makes me feel better about everything.

289
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,210
My guts feel like internal rot, yet I feel alive on the outside.

290
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,090
Plus, isn't it nice?

291
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:03,250
How long has it been since you worked in a bustling office with other people?

292
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,490
Also,

293
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,830
this is a really nice seat.

294
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,100
It's so nice that we kept it empty this whole time.

295
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,900
I see. It's such a nice seat that you kept it empty?

296
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,130
Of course. Look.

297
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,780
It's close to the night duty room over there, and look,

298
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,170
it's very close to your ex-girlfriend's seat. 
    

299
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,080
Team Leader.

300
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,380
I'm sorry, but can you stop and leave?

301
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,250
Sure.

302
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,900
Hey, Man, smile. Smile.

303
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,590
The higher-ups suddenly asked me why you use a big office

304
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,140
when you don't even do the 9 o'clock news,

305
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,300
that it's a "waste of space and time."

306
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,720
Hello, Viewers. This is the PPS Friday 12 o'clock news.

307
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,870
We will start with news of corruption in the industrial...

308
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,080
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

309
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,900
Why? What's up?

310
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,490
Why were you crying in the office last time?

311
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,910
Because Hyun Oh didn't make the news?

312
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,500
When did you see that?

313
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,230
I'm always watching you from somewhere.

314
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,740
Ji On.

315
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,230
Could you repeat after me?

316
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,450
What?

317
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,100
Noona. Sunbae.

318
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,720
If you don't like those two words, maybe just "Hey, you. Over here."

319
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,870
Are you okay now?

320
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,910
I thought you didn't want to talk to me anymore.

321
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,640
Why are you speaking again?

322
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,290
I'm quite used to the loneliness without you.

323
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,270
Because I'm totally over you now.

324
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,600
You're just a person to me now, like the rest of humanity.

325
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,420
I can have a conversation with you now.

326
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,240
Yes, that's good news.

327
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,270
But now that I think of it, couldn't you go on a date with me at least once?

328
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,940
Gosh, you said you're over me. What date?

329
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,730
Just person to person, human to human.

330
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,870
No, thanks.

331
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,390
We kissed so let's call it even.

332
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,420
Does that make it even?

333
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,020
We will start with news of corruption in the industrial sector.

334
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,810
"In the Transportation Survey, the corruption issue of a corporation surfaced."

335
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:40,150
Team Leader. I went to Media N Seoul to say I wouldn't do it.

336
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,630
I know.

337
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,180
But you had a good reason at the time.

338
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,700
You were the anointed 9 o'clock anchor.

339
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,310
How do I put this? We were able to…

340
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,760
say no to them in a casual, inoffensive way.

341
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,420
But what about you now?

342
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,940
You're just someone who barely does the morning daily program.

343
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,580
Is that right?

344
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,670
That's right.

345
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,280
Currently, you're the least busy person in our office.

346
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,100
- No. Ju Eun Ho must be less busy. 
 - No, no, no.

347
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,300
 Hey! You're the least busy. 

348
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,000
That's impossible.

349
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,060
Don't worry about it.

350
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,340
You two are almost the same. I recommended you both.

351
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,160
So get to Media N Seoul by 1 p.m. tomorrow.

352
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Team Leader, tomorrow is Saturday. It's the weekend.

353
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,790
I know. Since when do you get weekends off?

354
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:45,460
Take Eun Ho to Media N Seoul by 1 p.m. and do the tri-broadcast integration campaign. Okay?

355
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,130
Okay.

356
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,650
Hey, Hyun Oh.

357
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,220
Do you like to fish by chance?

358
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,620
Me?

359
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,000
Did someone say I like to fish?

360
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,400
- Don't you like fishing? 
 - No, I don't.

361
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,600
Wow! Even better.

362
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,400
There's a new program, "Did I Fish You or the Fish?"

363
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,820
I said I don't like to fish. What's he saying?

364
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,100
Can you choose what you want to work on in broadcasting?

365
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,550
- If you go over there— 
 - I'm not doing it. I'm not.

366
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,140
These spoiled brats.

367
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,950
Should I just do it myself?

368
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,880
I really want to do this.

369
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,570
It's an overnight shoot too.

370
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,600
There could even be four-day trips…

371
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,120
   

372
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,200
   

373
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,560
Hello.

374
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,860
Hello.

375
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,470
Hello.

376
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,530
   

377
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,630
   

378
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,290
Hello.

379
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,870
Hello.

380
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,760
We've met before, haven't we?

381
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,590
That's because you are famous, Sunbaenim.

382
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,360
No. What's your name?

383
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,270
I'm Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul.

384
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,840
I see. Nice to meet you.

385
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,750
Looking forward to working with you.

386
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,120
Yes.

387
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,130
Have you all met each other? Let me go over the plan.

388
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,410
Announcer Jung Hyun Oh, you can stand here in the center.

389
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,500
Announcer Kim Ha Yeon, you can stand next to him.

390
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,690
Hello, I'm Ju Eun Ho. I'm sorry for the delay.

391
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,510
Announcer Ju Eun Ho, here.

392
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,950
You can stand over there.

393
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,080
Great work, everybody!

394
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,610
Thank you!

395
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,420
Hello.

396
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,930
I'm Announcer Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul.

397
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,670
I didn't get to say hello earlier.

398
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,970
Hello, I'm Ju Eun Ho from PPS.

399
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,080
Yes. Nice to meet you.

400
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,640
Nice to meet you.

401
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,350
 Does it hurt? 

402
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,590
 I heard you got scratched by a nail. 

403
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,000
E-Exc...

404
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,370
E-Excuse me.

405
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,820
Aren't you leaving?

406
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,880
All right then.

407
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,640
 I have no siblings. 

408
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,870
 I guess you can say I'm an only child. 

409
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,090
 That was my older sister. 

410
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:36,080
 I'm finding contact information of a parking office employee. 

411
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,260
Could you maybe give her my contact information?

412
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,600
 We looked into it, but… 

413
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,670
 Kim Min Yeong is the only employee at our parking office. 

414
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,640
- Pardon? 
  - We have no record of anyone named Ju Hye Ri. 

415
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,880
 I don't know. I must not be registered yet. 

416
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,210
 Maybe it was omitted. 

417
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,460
 Do you have a phone? 

418
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,840
 Unfortunately, I get no joy out of the selfishness of civilization. 

419
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,940
 This was on the floor next to her. 

420
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,200
   

421
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,550
 To Sejongdong, Seoul, please. 

422
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,680
 Stop that. 

423
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,030
 I don't want to. 

424
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,430
 Are you okay? 

425
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,680
 It's karma. 

426
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,700
   

427
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,580
   

428
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,740
Hye Ri.

429
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,060
Hello, Ju Eun Ho.

430
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,400
Is it normal for the older sister to respond

431
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,480
when someone calls her younger sister's name?

432
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,870
 I'm sorry. 

433
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,930
Can I ask…

434
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,810
what is it you're sorry about?

435
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,220
For working at the parking office when you're a PPS announcer?

436
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,130
For approaching me, acting like someone named Ju Hye Ri?

437
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,970
For seeing Announcer Jung Hyun Oh at the same time?

438
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,250
For two-timing like that,

439
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,100
telling me you're 28 years old, an only child,

440
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,550
and you can't remember anything?

441
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,820
Are you sorry for all of that?

442
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,080
How can you lie so shamelessly

443
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,540
with a face that looks so honest?

444
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,460
How was that even possible?

445
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,750
I think…

446
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,270
I meant all of those things,

447
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,340
though I don't remember.

448
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,920
You don't remember again?

449
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,490
I…

450
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,690
Well, I…

451
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,800
I suffer from…

452
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,240
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

453
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,890
What?

454
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,500
Also known as multiple personalities.

455
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,160
What kind of lie is that?

456
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,020
It's true.

457
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,790
How else could I act so well?

458
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,600
I have only recently found out about this.

459
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,100
I just… thought I had some memory loss.

460
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,990
I went to the doctor and was told I have Dissociative Identity Disorder…

461
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,970
So…

462
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,450
do you not remember meeting me?

463
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,230
No.

464
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,590
Then whom did I meet?

465
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,740
I…

466
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,850
Well, I…

467
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,140
I have been seeing Ju Hye Ri until a few days ago.

468
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,580
She and I… how can I put this?

469
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,070
We talked.

470
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,690
We laughed.

471
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,410
We ate together like that.

472
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,900
And before that?

473
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,530
I took her back to my place. My mom—

474
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,730
She met my mom.

475
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,350
Because Hye Ri…

476
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,900
- approached me first— 
 - She must have liked you, Kang Ju Yeon.

477
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,620
Who did?

478
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,460
You?

479
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,500
Or Hye Ri?

480
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,320
Hye Ri.

481
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,420
Who is that?

482
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,770
Is that you?

483
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,550
No, it's not me…

484
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,420
Excuse me.

485
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,530
What do you mean?

486
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,030
It was hard for me to accept as well,

487
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,810
but I think…

488
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,720
it must be even harder for you.

489
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,360
Then does Hye Ri not exist anymore?

490
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,100
Can I see her tomorrow?

491
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,290
If you have multiple personalities, your other personality could appear anytime, right?

492
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,770
I don't know, either. I'm sorry.

493
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,510
No…

494
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,900
don't be sorry.

495
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,380
It'll be all right if Hye Ri shows up.

496
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,450
Hye Ri…

497
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,160
- doesn't exist. 
 - No.

498
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,300
She does.

499
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,480
She exists. I saw her.

500
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,520
We held hands.

501
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,880
We talked.

502
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,900
Just the day before yesterday…

503
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,470
So…

504
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,440
if I hadn't come to see you like this,

505
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,470
would this just go away?

506
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,690
I'll just…

507
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,040
I'll just pretend that I don't know.

508
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,110
I thought you were two-timing us. I really did.

509
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,060
But you said it's not like that.

510
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,100
You're saying Hye Ri really liked me.

511
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,400
Then…

512
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,490
I'll pretend I don't know.

513
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,730
I'll pretend I never came here and let it go. Then…

514
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,070
can I see Hye Ri again?

515
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,900
Please answer me.

516
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,170
Can I see her again?

517
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,770
You are the same person.

518
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,860
You can answer me, right?

519
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,200
- I'm sorry. I don't… 
 - No.

520
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,190
Stop apologizing.

521
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,920
I just…

522
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,090
want Ju Hye Ri back so—

523
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,210
I'm really sorry I hurt you.

524
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,750
I really just…

525
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,150
want Hye Ri to come back.

526
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,340
Because…

527
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,030
I haven't heard any of this.

528
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,220
I…

529
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,470
I'm so sorry, Kang Ju Yeon.

530
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,040
I'm so sorry.

531
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,570
Hye Ri…

532
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,290
hates calling someone by the full name.

533
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,730
Hyun Oh.

534
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,380
What? Someone doesn't want cream?

535
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,280
Too late, already in. Sugar? Too late.

536
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,560
All stirred.

537
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,110
That's not it, Man.

538
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,990
I have good news.

539
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,710
I just came from the Team Leaders' meeting.

540
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,010
The public opinion within the company is not great.

541
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,620
I mean about Jeon Jae Yong.

542
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,760
Everyone wonders why Press Director Soh picked him.

543
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,530
They wonder if auditions were conducted properly.

544
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:45,040
Press Director Soh actually auditioned only Jeon Jae Yong.

545
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,090
It's fishy, isn't it?

546
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,100
He hasn't proven himself at all.

547
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,860
- So? 
 - What do you mean?

548
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,910
Everyone is waiting for tonight.

549
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,610
If he messes up tonight, people will take him down.

550
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,150
I'm seeing some movement from the union, too.

551
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,760
   

552
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,170
Team Leader, it's starting.

553
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,880
 Oh, really? 

554
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,840
 Let's see… 

555
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,860
 Let's see how bad you are. 

556
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,080
There's no way. He is going to explode.

557
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,520
Hello, Viewers.

558
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,060
This is PPS 9 o'clock news, Monday, May 13.

559
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,420
Voices are calling for the reform of free international business trips,

560
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,770
a custom that provoked Choi Min Yeong's resignation,

561
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,820
 former chairman of the Financial Supervisory Service. 

562
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,150
 PPS investigative press reports on the reality of external trips 

563
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,830
 with assemblymen supported by audited organizations. 

564
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:05,010
 Hiring fraud targeting young people seeking jobs is rising. 

565
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,620
 After earning the victim's trust by providing hiring information, 

566
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,130
 they're demanding fees for brokering the job. 

567
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,740
 The scammers' strategies are becoming more sophisticated. 

568
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,530
 - Reporter Kim Eun Jeong is on the story.  
 - Darn it.

569
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,120
Oh my gosh!

570
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:33,600
   

571
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,430
 Not everything happens just because you work at it. 

572
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,950
 Sometimes, you need luck. 

573
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,110
 I hope today is your lucky day. 

574
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,150
 See you tomorrow. 

575
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,130
 This is the live 6 o'clock radio, "Every Morning with Ju Eun Ho." 

576
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,960
 I'm Announcer Ju Eun Ho. 

577
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,490
 Good work. 

578
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,480
 Good work. 

579
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,750
Good work. Thank you. Thank you.

580
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,290
 - Did you see Jeon Jae Yong? Daebak. 
 - I know. 

581
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,250
 - Wow! Did you see the internet? 
 - Yes. 

582
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,940
 - Of course.
 - It's crazy. 

583
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,900
 - I was shocked. 
 - I know. 

584
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,320
   

585
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,330
   

586
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,210
   

587
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:44,050
   

588
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,310
 Everyone, listen up. 

589
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,170
 Who wants this? 

590
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,230
 It's news. 

591
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,750
 Me! 

592
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,520
 Me, Sunbae! Me! 

593
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,680
 It's at 4 a.m. in the morning. 

594
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,450
 Aigoo, you dirty scumbags. 

595
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,370
 Fine, fine. I'll make a newbie do it, 

596
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,340
 as always. 

597
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,140
 I'll do it, Sunbae. 

598
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,890
 I'll do it. 

599
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,220
 Not you. You're on "Midnight Search." 

600
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,400
 If you do this after that, you won't get a wink of sleep. 

601
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,040
 You volunteered for "Midnight Search" when no one else did. 

602
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,840
 It's okay, Sunbaenim. 

603
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,810
 It's news. 

604
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,150
 I'll do a good job. 

605
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,530
 What? You're being dispatched to the newsroom? 

606
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,760
 Yes. 

607
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,490
 Hey. Why would you do that? 

608
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,310
 If you keep up with your current workload, you could get the 9 o'clock news. 

609
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,640
 Why would you go there? 

610
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,790
 Hey, it's rough over there, territorial too. 

611
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,940
 I'll have stuff to learn, reporting and all. 

612
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,140
 Exactly. Why do you have to be a reporter? 

613
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,840
 Just sit in the studio and get the scripts. 

614
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,070
 Until when? 

615
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,150
 All your life! 

616
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,450
 Also, if you do that, 

617
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,150
 you'll have to sit it out at police stations and get no sleep. 

618
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,520
 I heard Soh Chin Guk will be the press director. 

619
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,770
 Wow! He's totally… seriously… 

620
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,930
 Hey. 

621
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,640
 What? 

622
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:51,510
 Like you said, I'll be sitting at a desk one day, 

623
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,640
 reading articles that reporters found staying up all night at the police station. 

624
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,010
 That's right. Just do that your whole life. 

625
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,070
 But… 

626
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:07,250
 I want to know how things came to me before I report them, 

627
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,640
 how many tough challenges they endured to get to me. 

628
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,300
 I want to know that before I read them. 

629
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,620
 That's what being a real anchor is. 

630
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,940
 Are you leaving again? 

631
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,340
 Yes. 

632
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,940
 Press Director Soh wants me to go in. 

633
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,310
 It's the weekend. 

634
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:42,270
 It's 4 a.m. on the weekend. 

635
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,420
 I know. I'll be right back. 

636
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,190
 Hey, you're his golf caddy, right? 

637
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,030
 I'm not. 

638
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,950
 Stop lying! I sense the whole thing! 

639
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:59,170
 I told you. Press Director Soh is the meanest one in the newsroom! 

640
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,150
 He is promising you the 9 o'clock news and treating you like crap! 

641
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,040
 Eun Ho. 

642
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,410
 What? 

643
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,090
 Come here. 

644
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,230
 Why? 

645
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,130
 I'll be right back. 

646
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,280
 You're back. 

647
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,240
 Yes, I'm back. 

648
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,830
 You must be tired. 

649
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,230
 No, I'm not tired at all. 

650
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
 Hyun Oh. 

651
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,600
 Yes? 

652
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,600
 I wish you didn't have to be tired. 

653
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,360
 I wish you could get enough sleep. 

654
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Yes. I will. 

655
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,410
 Yes, Press Director. 

656
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,110
 Oh, yes. 

657
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,190
 Right now? 

658
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,030
 No, no. 

659
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,900
 I'm okay. 

660
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:09,580
 I'll be right there. 

661
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,940
 I got it. 

662
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,980
 Hey. Why do you even want to do that? 

663
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,070
 It's just a dream. 

664
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,780
 "A dream"? 

665
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,340
 Yes. 

666
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,060
 Just one single hope that I have. 

667
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:55,040
 So tell me. How did that become your hope? 

668
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,500
 Everyone watches the news. 

669
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,390
 Then my mom… 

670
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,720
 might be watching from somewhere. 

671
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,610
 I hope Ms. Jang Hye Jeong… 

672
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,810
 watches me on the news somewhere and thinks, 

673
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,180
 "I'm proud of my son." 

674
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,040
 "You really became someone I can see from anywhere." 

675
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,560
 Just that. 

676
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,590
 But, Hyun Oh. 

677
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,200
 Yes. 

678
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,630
 I'm still… 

679
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,130
 very proud of you. 

680
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,470
   

681
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,190
 The person you are calling is on another line. 

682
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,520
 After the beep, you'll be connected to voicemail. 

683
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,880
 Hey, Jung Hyun Oh! 

684
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,270
Hey, I heard you're getting married.

685
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,860
Oh, Sunbae…

686
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,780
 Will you… 

687
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,820
 stay with me like this, always? 

688
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:24,080
 Because… 

689
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,160
 I… 

690
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,220
 I love you. 

691
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:03,570
   

692
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:24,980


693
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:53,660
