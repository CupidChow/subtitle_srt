1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,740
   

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,240
   

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,640
   

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,040
   

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,240
   

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:29,970


7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,070
   

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,030
   

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,570
It's breast cancer.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,200
What? "Breast cancer"?

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,980
Unnie! "Breast cancer"?

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,220
"Cancer"?

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,500
I have a broken leg and cancer.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,950
Then how long did they say you have?

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,840
If I don't do chemotherapy and radiation,

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,860
I have less than a year.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,800
So what do you want to do?

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,710
I just want things to be as-is and live my life.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,790
No!

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,600
Crazy Girl, don't you want me to live my life?

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,480
No, I don't want you to die!

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm not dead yet!

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,690
I cannot live without you.

24
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,620
I can't go on if you die, Unnie.

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,740
What are you talking about? Who is dying?

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,540
Get hospitalized right away.

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,530
I don't want to.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,940
Unnie, it's cancer.

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,020
You must be hospitalized and get treatment.

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,510
I don't want to.

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,540
Why are you being so stubborn?

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,220
Grandma, I looked it up.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,800
If you change your diet and exercise, you'll get better soon.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,910
Yet you eat whatever you want.

35
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,730
You don't exercise. How will you get better?

36
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,660
Just get hospitalized.

37
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,500
I'll go with you when I get off work later.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,660
Hyun Oh, I like it here.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,270
Even if I die, I want to die here.

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,980
Grandma, you can't argue your way through this; you're sick.

41
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,070
Unnie, if you die...

42
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,030
I'll die with you.

43
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,160
Me, too! I'm going to die with you.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,100
Let's do that.

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's all die together.

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,340
If we smoke all these at once, we could die.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,970
What's wrong with you?

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,040
No, I'm going to die, too. If Grandma dies, I will, too!

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,340
Hey, if you die, what do I do?

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,910
Figure it out, Ugly.

51
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm not that ugly!

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,890
Ji On is good-looking.

53
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,000
Ages ago, I dated a guy briefly who looked a lot like Ji On.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,470
Stop being so silly!

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,240
Grandma, don't be so stubborn. Just go to the hospital.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,440
- You must get treated. 
 - I said I don't want to!

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Grandma, I'm so worried sick that it's not good for my health!

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,450
I won't stay at the hospital,

59
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,340
but I'll get treatment then.

60
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,650
Then go to the hospital with me later.

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,160
I want to hear what they say.

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,350
I have one wish.

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,640
What is it?

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,850
Tell me. I'll do anything. What is it?

65
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,490
Please get married, Hyun Oh.

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,260
What?

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,710
Please get married.

68
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,640
That's my wish, Hyun Oh.

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,200
What kind of wish is that? Give me something else.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,610
I want you to get married and have a happy family.

71
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,360
Unnie.

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,080
Hyun Oh will have a happy family on his own.

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,970
It doesn't have to be your wish.

74
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,450
Grandma, I don't have a woman to marry even if I wanted to get married.

75
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,150
Is that so? Why?

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,200
- So, Grandma, something else– 
 - Me.

77
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,390
I'll marry Sunbae.

78
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,640
Can I marry him?

79
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,700
What?

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,210
What's wrong with her?

81
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,200
Could you explain yourself, Eun Cho Rong?

82
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,820
That was quite an intense joke.

83
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,510
Sunbae, I wasn't joking.

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,970
I said it because I really want to marry you.

85
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,850
Marriage isn't that easy, Cho Rong.

86
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,370
I know it isn't. A wedding is the biggest event in a person's life.

87
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,000
Did you raise your hand knowing that?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,300
This isn't a class president election.

89
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,410
I raised my hand because it was a perfect chance for me.

90
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,710
How is it a perfect chance?

91
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,740
I've really wanted to marry you.

92
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,960
Why do you want to marry me?

93
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,240
Do you even like me?

94
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,710
No.

95
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,200
Then stop messing with me. Get back to work, Eun Cho Rong.

96
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,400
I... love your family, Sunbae.

97
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,050
What did you say?

98
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,910
I lived with only my sister all my life.

99
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,520
And when Grandma Hye Ja got sick...

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,310
That was...

101
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,270
Seven years ago.

102
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,170
You remembered? I'm moved.

103
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,340
Why does that move you?

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,110
Anyway, I came to live here seven years ago.

105
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,070
That's when I figured it out.

106
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,430
Figured out what?

107
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,910
That it makes me happy to live in a bustling family.

108
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,510
That I want to be a real part of this family.

109
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,680
Eun Cho Rong.

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,630
It still sounds like you think marriage is easy.

111
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,190
You've seen your sister take care of the grandmas until now.

112
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,160
It might look easy to you, but it isn't.

113
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,620
It becomes different if you marry and join the family.

114
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,650
What you mentioned might be a benefit, but you'll need to give as much in return.

115
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,280
The grandmas will get older and need more care.

116
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,110
They raised me so I think it's fine for me.

117
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,060
I think it's something I have to do.

118
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:15,190
But I think it's nonsense for my spouse to have to do it with me.

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,710
Just because you like a bustling family,

120
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,350
choosing such a hard path for that reason–

121
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,220
Sunbae.

122
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,040
I had a grandmother growing up.

123
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,480
We lived together for maybe ten years.

124
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,060
She had dementia.

125
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,120
While my sister was at work, I cared for her. I was nine.

126
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,110
I changed her diapers and everything.

127
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,230
Do you think I liked that or not?

128
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,960
Sunbae, I liked that

129
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,840
since I still had my grandma with me.

130
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,280
She was alive. That was enough for me.

131
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,380
That was your biological grandmother.

132
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,240
Are you with the grandmas as relatives then?

133
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,850
Sunbae, this is my dream.

134
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,770
I want to marry you and become your spouse.

135
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,160
I want to become a real part of this family.

136
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,750
I won't ask you to like me. I'll be fine on my own,

137
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,570
if I can live in this house as your spouse and join this family.

138
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,940
- Eun Cho Rong. 
 - Yes?

139
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,960
Regardless, I don't think this is right.

140
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,650
Sunbae, don't you want to do anything Grandma Mi Ja wants?

141
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,680
All you need to do is get married.

142
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,720
I say I can do that for you. I want it, too.

143
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,410
Sunbae, I don't think you have much choice in the matter.

144
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,480
We need to get this done, Sunbae.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
 Yes. 

146
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,800
Oh, he was good.

147
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,530
I'm fine.

148
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,300
Yes, Sunbae.

149
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,270
Let's grab dinner soon.

150
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,230
 The person you are calling is on another line. After the beep... 

151
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,190
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh!

152
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,210
Hey, I heard you're getting married.

153
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,100
Finally! What happened? Tell me!

154
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,170
Oh, Sunbae…

155
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,950
When is it? Is it this year?

156
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,160
 Marriage? No way, Eun Ho. 

157
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,880
 I won't do that. 

158
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,420
 I don't do such a thing, Eun Ho. 

159
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,510
Hey, what happened? Tell me the story.

160
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,180
Sunbae, I...

161
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,060
No.

162
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,790
It can't be.

163
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,540
No...

164
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,230
It doesn't make any sense, no.

165
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,700
It isn't possible. I must have heard wrong, yes...

166
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,520
It isn't possible. It isn't...

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,480
Hey, where are you going?

168
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,010
Right, I must have heard wrong. I must have...

169
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,820
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

170
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,480
- It isn't possible. 
 - Hey, Ju Eun Ho!

171
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,640
What are you mumbling about?

172
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,960
Hey! Aren't you supposed to be doing the news?

173
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,170
Hello, Viewers.

174
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,480
This is PPS Tuesday News at noon.

175
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,130
   

176
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,590
"Next, we report on restrictions of Brazil's steel importation."

177
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,160
"The Brazilian government recently announced additional tariffs on"

178
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,330
"importing our steel to protect their own industries."

179
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,630
"Let's see how this will affect the domestic steel industry."

180
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,180
"Reporter Jang Hee Yeon from Economics joins us. Welcome."

181
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,650
 Hello. 

182
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,500
 There's been a rise in protective trading overseas. 

183
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,270
 The Brazilian government, in particular,  is increasing tariffs by 25% on imported steel. 

184
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,840
 I heard you're getting married. 

185
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,540
 Finally! What happened? Tell me! 

186
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,760
It appears to be a measure to protect their steel industries.

187
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,890
No...

188
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,770
- Domestic industries will feel the impact... 
 - Not possible.

189
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,830
-  To restructure the export plans...  
 - What's wrong with her?

190
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,630
Audio Director, please lower Ju Eun Ho's mic all the way.

191
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,130
Don't get her on camera.

192
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,340
Sunbae Eun Ho.

193
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,460
- They will focus on improving the product quality. 
 -  Sunbae Eun Ho! 

194
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,230
It's all a lie.

195
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,800
I see. Technological innovation in the steel industry...

196
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,370
- Sunbaenim. Sunbaenim! 
 - and the market development will be crucial.

197
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,600
- Your mic is on. 
 - That's right.

198
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,380
- What? 
 - The steel industry–

199
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,070
 They responded that this will lead to bigger returns in the long run. 

200
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,600
 Yes. If so, how will this decision by the Brazilian government 

201
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,340
 impact the global steel market? 

202
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,450
Are you insane?

203
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,210
I asked, "Are you insane?"

204
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,130
Why was your mic on? Why?

205
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,140
And if your mic is on, you shouldn't even be breathing! Don't you know?

206
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,780
I thought you had been doing this for fourteen years!

207
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,520
Mumbling to yourself during a live broadcast? You must be crazy!

208
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,830
What kind of anchor can't focus when a reporter is in the studio?

209
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,650
The news is about trust,

210
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,130
the same news that you just trashed.

211
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,540
Do you know what a joke we are to the viewers now?

212
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,920
Do you know?

213
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,650
We are really sorry.

214
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,640
   

215
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,380
Do they want an incident report?

216
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,590
Hey, how did you mess up like that?

217
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,060
Seriously.

218
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,780
 But... 

219
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,320
 that jerk, Soh Chin Guk, is already out to get you. 

220
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,250
 Are you sure all he wants is an incident report? 

221
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,390
Aigoo, I guess he will let it go without firing you.

222
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,230
Anyway, get to it.

223
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,760
Be as polite as you can.

224
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,640
Soh Chin Guk is out to get you.

225
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,160
So just bow to him as much as you can.

226
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,810
Aigoo.

227
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,570
 Dear Viewers, hello. 

228
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,080
 I'm Ju Eun Ho, PPS Announcer, Group 28. 

229
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,260
 What? 
   

230
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,660
Wow, it already has more than 50,000 views.

231
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,890
This is so embarrassing.

232
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,840
Ju Eun Ho's a star now, though. Maybe that's a good thing?

233
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,920
That's what she wished for.

234
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,260
No, it can't be.

235
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,830
It isn't possible.

236
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,970
That scared me!

237
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,620
 I know that no one knows who I am. 

238
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,530
 But it has been fourteen years since I first appeared on television. 

239
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:31,300
 I'm sure none of you know who I am,  but I've done the best I can. 

240
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,350
 If I may explain this recent incident, I was a little disturbed. 

241
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,510
 Because I had a boyfriend, 
   

242
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,410
 and he always told me, 

243
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,650
 "Marriage? Eun Ho." 

244
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,250
"I won't do such a thing, Eun Ho."

245
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,910
That's what you said.

246
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,470
Am I wrong?

247
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,490
And now you're getting married? You scumbag!

248
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,980
It isn't like that, Ju Eun Ho.

249
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,550
Then why are people saying that?

250
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,790
Explain why people are saying that.

251
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,720
Okay.

252
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,400
I'll explain it to you slowly.

253
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,460
It's true that it was discussed–

254
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,560
"It's true that it was discussed"?

255
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,430
Hey.

256
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,350
Were you seeing someone else? And I didn't know?

257
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,910
There was never another woman!

258
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,640
But the reason it came up–

259
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,200
I mean...

260
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,330
whether you had another woman or not is none of my business since we broke up.

261
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,930
But why did we break up? You know better than I do.

262
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,510
You told me as soon as we started dating,

263
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,700
"I'm never getting married. If you bring it up, we are over." That's why...

264
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,420
I dated you for eight years and never brought it up.

265
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,930
But as soon as I brought it up,

266
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,390
you broke up with me like you waited for it.

267
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,110
That's how you were.

268
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,440
Yet whomever you're seeing talks of marriage.

269
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,830
The rumor is all over; you deny it?

270
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,690
Is it really nothing?

271
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,400
And there's a reason why it came up?

272
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,320
Hey! What kind of nonsense is this?

273
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,130
I'm trying to explain right now!

274
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,120
I don't care if you get married or not.

275
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,300
The word's already out. The importance is

276
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,810
the fact that it came up.

277
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,090
That in itself...

278
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,330
I couldn't understand.

279
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,650
But for that woman, the talk came up.

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,230
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh.

281
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,900
What was I...

282
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,980
to you?

283
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,680
 Dear Viewers, this is what I think now that it has come to this. 

284
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,240
 It isn't that he wouldn't marry me because he was against marriage. 

285
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,230
 He just didn't want to marry me. 

286
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,840
 Because when we broke up, everyone around me said... 

287
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,190
 Hey, Jung Hyun Oh is seeing someone else, right? 

288
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,970
 No. 

289
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,900
 No way. Breaking up suddenly? Sounds like he has another woman. 

290
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,000
 I said no! 

291
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,360
 Then why did you guys break up, Eun Ho? 

292
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,580
 Hyun Oh is such a good guy. 

293
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,340
 He is a little too good for you, Eun Ho. 

294
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,260
 I know. 

295
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,300
 Jung Hyun Oh is against marriage. 

296
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,110
 What? "Against marriage"? 

297
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,300
 Yes, never. Over his dead body, under no circumstances. 

298
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,590
 He won't get married, not even with a knife to his throat. 

299
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,210
 I might have heard that about him. 

300
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,520
 But I want to get married. 

301
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,030
 What should we do? We should break up. Don't you think? 

302
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,680
 Right, 

303
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,230
 realistically. 

304
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,350
 That's what I'm saying. 

305
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,040
 Dear Viewers, 

306
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,020
 that is how... 

307
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,070
 I became a fool. 

308
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,040
   

309
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,720
   

310
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,750
 She must have liked you, Kang Ju Yeon. 

311
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,720
 Who did? 

312
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,470
 You? 

313
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,590
 Or Hye Ri? 

314
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,390
 I really just... 

315
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,820
 want Hye Ri to come back. 

316
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,300
   

317
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,440
Sunbae.

318
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,690
Yes.

319
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,840
How did the tri-broadcast integration campaign go?

320
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,130
What was it like there? Was it fun?

321
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,210
I don't know.

322
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,600
You were there. How could you not know?

323
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,200
Was it fun? Did you have any fun?

324
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,020
Hey.

325
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,920
- Hye Yeon. 
 - Yes, Sunbae.

326
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,280
Remember...

327
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,500
the udon you mentioned?

328
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,050
I never tried it so I don't really know, but...

329
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,740
I want some.

330
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,830
Do you want to go get some?

331
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,840
What?

332
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,490
When should we go?

333
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,380
Today?

334
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,280
What?

335
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,550
Let's go get some.

336
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,900
- What did you say, Hye Yeon? 
 - Department Head.

337
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,550
I think Kang Ju Yeon...

338
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,670
- might have gone insane. 
 - No.

339
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,790
Ju Yeon is not insane. You're–

340
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,620
No, Department Head.

341
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,750
Think about it.

342
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:05,650
Kang Ju Yeon, suddenly wants to go get "Tight Tight Chewy Chewy" Udon.

343
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,620
Of course, he has been to that place with his girlfriend.

344
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,890
But I'm not his girlfriend.

345
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,930
But why does he want to go with me?

346
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,420
Isn't it...

347
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,780
strange?

348
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,980
Hye Yeon, Ju Yeon looks very normal to me.

349
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,910
The strange one is–

350
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,830
- What? 
 - What?

351
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,420
What?

352
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,560
What?

353
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,790
Oh, nothing. Well... nothing...

354
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,950
Ju Yeon must have something to say to you.

355
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,700
Like what?

356
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,120
Department Head, we are done.

357
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,440
I told you Kang Ju Yeon has a girlfriend.

358
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,530
I mean, then maybe he's having some kind of problem

359
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,730
and wants to get advice from you or not. Maybe, maybe not?

360
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,370
Sunbae. You have a problem, right?

361
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,970
What?

362
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,110
You have a problem you can't talk about, right?

363
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,580
Then there wouldn't be any reason for you to do this with me.

364
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,200
Doing this was my wish, you know.

365
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,940
I think I'll be okay.

366
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,640
What do you mean?

367
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,470
I thought I wouldn't be okay.

368
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,100
But the more I consider it, I feel I'll be okay.

369
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,140
If I keep waiting,

370
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,010
she will show up again.

371
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,070
Sunbae?

372
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,990
What are you talking about?

373
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,650
So is that your problem?

374
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,650
When she shows up,

375
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,490
I'll treat her really well.

376
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,570
That's how...

377
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,740
I'm going to win her over.

378
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,900
Because...

379
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,540
I have one heart.

380
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,350
My heart...

381
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,900
has space for only one.

382
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,650
Wow, why don't I get any of that?

383
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,140
No matter how bad the disease is,

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,300
I don't think my heart will change, Hye Yeon.

385
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,670
So, Sunbae.

386
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:55,850
Could you be more specific with your subject or object? Okay?

387
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,220
One more time.

388
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,280
Hey, Hye Yeon.

389
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,380
This udon is so good.

390
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,120
I mean it.

391
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,380
Thank you for recommending this udon shop. I mean it.

392
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,280
I think I might...

393
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,350
cry while eating this.

394
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 For those transferring to the Gyeongui-Jungang line or line 5, Digital City. 

395
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,420
 This is Digital City Station. 

396
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,060
 The doors are on your right. 

397
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,160
 The gap between the train and the platform is wide. 

398
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,210
 Please watch your step. 

399
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,350
 This stop is Digital City. 

400
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,320
   

401
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,000
Hey. Aren't you going home?

402
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,860
Hey! I said aren't you going home? Do you know what time it is?

403
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,470
I'm hungry!

404
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,150
Hey, are you aware that we first spoke only today?

405
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,370
You talked to me for the first time since we started working two months ago, asking me to go home together.

406
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,690
But I'm asking why we're not going home and still hanging around this field?

407
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,530
Well? Well?

408
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,240
 Hey! 

409
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,180
 This stop is Joongsan, Myunghui University Station. 

410
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,540
 The doors are on your right. 

411
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,880
 All I need to know is this. 

412
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Why are you looking around this field?

413
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,320
Did you lose something?

414
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,560
I lost a necklace.

415
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,240
"A necklace"?

416
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,390
Did your girlfriend get it for you?

417
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,060
I don't have a girlfriend!

418
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,590
Fine, no need to get angry.

419
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,530
I think I'm going home now.

420
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,360
Because it's been four hours since the competition ended.

421
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,540
That's one hour longer than the competition was.

422
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,210
Therefore, I'm leaving.

423
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,020
Also, let me give you one last piece of advice.

424
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,660
If you still haven't found it, you never will.

425
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,510
Bye.

426
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,820
 This stop is Eungwang. Transfer is available to Line 3. 

427
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,650
 Is he crying? 

428
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,890
Why are you crying?

429
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,500
Who pushed your crying button? Who, what, where, why?

430
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,070
Was the necklace pure gold, 24 karat or something like that?

431
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,390
The necklace was...

432
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,970
just like my mom.

433
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,010
By chance...

434
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,600
did your mom pass away?

435
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,410
Darn it!

436
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,050
Hey! Then go home and tell her!

437
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:34,220
"Mom, I lost the fated necklace that's like you during an athletic competition. Please get me another one!"

438
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,850
She left home.

439
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:47,130
She left home... and never came back, I see.

440
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,700
Then what should we do? Should I get one for you?

441
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,910
I'm sure we could find something similar. Can I get it for you?

442
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,490
Actually, I have one wish.

443
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,810
It's to leave this field.

444
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,510
I want to go away. Change locations. I'll get one for you.

445
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,400
Can we leave now?

446
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,650
Also, why are you crying?

447
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,650
We're not close. Why are you crying in front of me?

448
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,380
So let me get one for you. I still have some of my first paycheck.

449
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,060
Here.

450
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,590
Let's go get meat.

451
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,290
- What? 
 - Let's go get meat.

452
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,140
I spent all my energy on crying.

453
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,380
Don't you want to?

454
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,790
I mean...

455
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,710
you were just crying, and now you want meat.

456
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,230
- I'll pay. 
 - I like sirloin, chuck flap tail, and skirt steak.

457
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,690
I'm all about special cuts. Let's go.

458
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,050
Do you usually cry so easily?

459
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,840
No!

460
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,160
 So if I draw you a picture of that necklace, can you get me an identical one? 

461
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,910
 You really want me to get it? 

462
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,550
 Of course! You said you will! 

463
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,500
 Did you actually iron this? 

464
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,200
 Yes, I did. 

465
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,240
I feel it's wrinkly.

466
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,720
That's just a feeling.

467
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,540
You didn't iron it, did you?

468
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,250
I did.

469
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,900
With what?

470
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,840
The warm sunshine, cool breeze, fresh air, and...

471
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,350
You just washed it and hung it out to dry.

472
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,930
That's the same thing, Hyun Oh.

473
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,160
Oh, gosh! Where's the iron?

474
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,270
Are you ignoring the sun? Belittling the breeze? Underestimating the fresh air?

475
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,370
Geez, come on.

476
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,900
Where's the iron?

477
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,770
I knew it. I have one that's definitely ironed!

478
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,290
You did! You had one ironed!

479
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,400
You had one ironed. Eun Ho was just testing me.

480
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,860
- I'm so lovely, right? 
 - Yes.

481
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,660
How much?

482
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,370
Very much.

483
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,280
Very much? And that's it?

484
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,530
Very, very much.

485
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,370
Go change.

486
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,110
 This stop is Gusam. Gusam Station. 

487
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,780
 The doors are on your right. 

488
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,580
 The gap between the train and the platform is wide. Please watch your step. 

489
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,690
   

490
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,400
 This stop is Gusam. Gusam. 

491
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,620
 The doors are on your right. Please watch your step. 

492
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,910
   

493
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,090
 Dear Listeners, hello. 

494
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:45,310
 I've been with you for the last four years through "Every Morning with Ju Eun Ho." 

495
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,840
 I apologize for being late this morning. 

496
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,670
 I was distracted and missed several subway stops. 

497
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:59,460
 - But Listeners, want to know something?  
 - What is this?

498
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,830
Is that an incident report for radio?

499
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,090
Were you late or something?

500
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,840
 I've lived my life as best I could. 

501
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,820
-  I've worked hard.  
 - Why do you keep messing up?

502
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,880
 Why does this kind of thing keep happening to me? 

503
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,120
Hey, Eun Ho.

504
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,000
 I'm not talking about being late. 

505
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,860
- My gosh. 
  - My life is just... 

506
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,100
 like this. 

507
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,260
 It feels so mediocre, everyone. 

508
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,690
Yes, this is Kim Shin Joong.

509
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,560
Eun Ho?

510
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,430
Wh-What about Eun Ho?

511
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:44,350
Is the broadcast and the incident report all a joke to you?

512
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,570
On top of that, you were late to the radio this morning?

513
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,830
I've given you enough chances.

514
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:55,200
Step down from the 12 o'clock news immediately and quit radio.

515
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,730
I knew this would happen.

516
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,800
I knew you would be the idiot of idiots.

517
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,580
What does Jung Hyun Oh like about an idiot like you?

518
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,220
Why would he drop out of the 9 o'clock news, trying to defend you?

519
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,130
What does he see in you?

520
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,720
I don't think I can get married, Grandma.

521
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,450
Let's start treatment first. Then—

522
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,630
Whether I get treatment or not, my days are numbered.

523
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,050
And it's a wish that I meant to say at some point.

524
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,920
My marriage? That's all you wish for?

525
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,900
No matter what, I'll always be by your side.

526
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,510
My wish isn't about keeping you near me.

527
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,510
Then what is it?

528
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,030
Do you...

529
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,600
know why I brought you here?

530
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,640
I needed someone to take care of my final moments.

531
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,450
Because I was very lonely,

532
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,970
I thought taking you in would be enough.

533
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:41,860
But after living with you like this, I got greedy.

534
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,580
If I go, and the other grannies go, too,

535
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,950
I'm so worried about you being left alone.

536
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,080
That's why I'm telling you to get married.

537
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,000
That's how I would leave peacefully.

538
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,900
So at least, you won't be lonely.

539
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,810
Why?

540
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,620
Is it difficult?

541
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,380
   

542
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,270
Hey, what are you doing?

543
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,430
I'm working.

544
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:01,940
Sunbae, I thought about it really hard.

545
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,760
What did you think about, Hye Yeon?

546
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,330
Remember when we had "Tight Tight Chewy Chewy" Udon?

547
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,150
I've been thinking about what you said.

548
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,680
You said that your heart had room for only one.

549
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,070
Yes, I did.

550
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,730
But Sunbae, do you know?

551
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,120
A person could have two hearts.

552
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,870
Two of what?

553
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,800
Sunbae, he and I just sleep together.

554
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,580
Do you know FWB? "Friends with benefits"?

555
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,980
Hey!

556
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,810
But he's going out with Reporter Kim Yeon Ji of the newsroom these days.

557
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,370
Darn it.

558
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,560
- Can you not— 
 - What I'm trying to say, Sunbae,

559
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,610
is that both he and I have hearts.

560
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,740
But those hearts can feel two different things.

561
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,210
But there can be only one—

562
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,980
Your heart has room for only one. I get it.

563
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,470
But if you have two hearts, you could hold two people.

564
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,500
But Sunbae,

565
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,630
a heart can be copied and pasted two, three, or four times.

566
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,230
So don't worry about it too much.

567
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,170
Announcer Ju Eun Ho, have you been to many festivals?

568
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,590
Yes.

569
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,200
In May, universities around the country are busy preparing for college festivals.

570
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,770
Safety is paramount whenever large crowds are gathered.

571
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,250
   

572
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,920
-  Great work!  
 - Thank you!

573
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,440
Good job.

574
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,450
Excuse me, Announcer Ju Eun Ho?

575
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,400
Yes, tell me.

576
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,520
Let's talk for a second.

577
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,660
   

578
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,760
What is that?

579
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,320
Are you writing another incident report?

580
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,730
Team Leader, I got fired from "Issue-In," too.

581
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,330
What?

582
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,780
Gosh, why did nobody tell me?

583
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,580
Who did? Who fired you?

584
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,820
I heard it was Soh Chin Guk's orders.

585
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,370
He thinks I've lost my mind and should be fired from all programs.

586
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,630
I saw it coming.

587
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,480
That scoundrel...

588
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,360
Does he think he's the CEO or something?

589
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,980
Hey. Let me go talk to that swine.

590
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,610
I've wanted to confront him about taking you off the noon news anyway!

591
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,280
No, Team Leader. Please don't.

592
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,100
What?

593
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,560
It's...

594
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,800
over anyway, Sunbae.

595
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,110
Eun Ho.

596
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,730
What's really going on with you?

597
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,800
What's wrong with you?

598
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,660
Are you sick?

599
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,260
Are you okay?

600
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,760
Everything else is okay,

601
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,080
but being fired from the 12 o'clock news...

602
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,370
really makes me sad.

603
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,470
I understand. I know you loved it.

604
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,430
No, because Hyun Oh...

605
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,540
gave up the 9 o'clock news so I could have it.

606
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,230
He kicked his dreams to the curb so I could have it.

607
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,580
And I couldn't even...

608
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,220
hold onto it.

609
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,920
I'll say it again. It wasn't your fault.

610
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,770
It was my fault, Ji On.

611
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,900
It wasn't. The situation—

612
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,150
Hyun Oh breaking up with me... people whispering about me,

613
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,820
getting cut from every program,

614
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,520
other people suffering due to me,

615
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,210
it's all my fault.

616
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,100
When I think about it, that's it.

617
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,160
Don't beat yourself up.

618
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,610
I'm not beating myself up, just listing facts.

619
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,750
It's true, Ji On.

620
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,970
   

621
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,250
   

622
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,610
   

623
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,540
   

624
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:42,630
   

625
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,910
   

626
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,020
   

627
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,280
   

628
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,370
   

629
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,620
   

630
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,510
   

631
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,530
 It's so annoying. 

632
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,800
 I'm so happy. Kang Ju Yeon's home smells so good. 

633
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,550
   

634
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,750
   

635
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,480
   

636
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,730
   

637
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,520
   

638
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,480
 I'm happy. 

639
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,490
   

640
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:40,510
   

641
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,450
   

642
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,480
 I might be taken off all the programs. 

643
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,590
 I'm a failure. 

644
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,620
   

645
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,720
 I... 

646
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,480
 hate... 

647
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,590
 myself. 

648
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:13,970
   

649
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,970
Unnie, have some garlic and seaweed.

650
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,640
I heard they're good for breast cancer.

651
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,540
Unnie, the exercise where you reach both arms out is supposed to be good for you!

652
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,030
You should exercise.

653
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,330
What are you talking about? Garlic is the best.

654
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,310
Unnie, have a lot of garlic.

655
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,110
- She has to exercise! 
 - Unnie, garlic is the best!

656
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,840
Exercise is good for breast cancer! You should exercise!

657
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,760
You crazies, stop it!

658
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,450
♫  Only after the flowers wilted  ♫

659
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,920
♫  Only then  ♫

660
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,790
♫  I knew it was spring  ♫

661
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,000
♫  It's always been so obvious  ♫

662
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:53,350
♫  That you were by my side  ♫

663
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,480
♫  That's why  ♫

664
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,850
♫  Only after you were gone  ♫

665
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,790
♫  Only then  ♫

666
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,330
Hyun Oh, we need to move the books that are downstairs.

667
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:13,070
I'll do it tomorrow. I have to go somewhere.

668
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,400
Where? Where are you going?

669
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,500
♫  I've always been by your side  ♫

670
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,250
♫  That's why  ♫

671
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:28,380
♫  What if I had held onto you?  ♫

672
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,630
♫  If I had smiled more?  ♫

673
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:38,000
♫  Would it have been different for us?  ♫

674
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,900
♫  If I had hugged you then  ♫

675
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,300
♫  If I hadn't let go of your hand  ♫

676
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:55,000
♫  Could we go back to those happy times?  ♫

677
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,100
♫  Only after you were gone  ♫

678
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:08,800
♫  Only then I realized it was a goodbye  ♫

679
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:18,880
♫  Your empty space seemed endless  ♫

680
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,570
♫  That's why  ♫

681
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:26,640
♫  What if I had held onto you?  ♫

682
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,910
♫  If I had smiled more?  ♫

683
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:36,380
♫  Would it have been different for us?  ♫

684
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,240
♫  If I had hugged you then  ♫

685
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,580
♫  If I hadn't let go of your hand  ♫

686
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:51,730
♫  Could we go back to those happy times?  ♫

687
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:57,340
♫  No matter how much I hypothesize now  ♫

688
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:03,920
♫  I know nothing will change  ♫

689
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:11,290
♫  I just keep thinking of those days  ♫

690
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:18,350
♫  I'm regretting it again like this!  ♫

691
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,560
♫  If I had held onto you  ♫

692
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,800
♫  If I'd treated you better  ♫

693
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:31,110
♫  Would it have been different for us?  ♫

694
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:35,080
♫  If I could see you again  ♫

695
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,490
♫  If it's not too late  ♫

696
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:51,360
♫  Could we go back to when we were in love?  ♫

697
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,400
 Dear Hye Ri. 

698
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,420
Ju Eun Ho?

699
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,140
 Hye Ri. 

700
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,130
Is Ju Eun Ho here?

701
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,200
 I wanted to be happy. 

702
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,500
   

703
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,980
 I wanted to be enough 

704
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,280
 to feel fulfilled. 

705
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,360
 I really... 

706
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,590
 wish I was happy. 

707
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:33,040


708
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,650
   

709
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:47,310
   

710
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,870
   

711
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,240
   

712
00:57:54,490 --> 00:58:00,840
   

713
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,800
Hello.

714
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,650
I heard you came to see me.

715
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:09,380
Hello. I'm Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul.

716
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,910
 What brings you here? 

717
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,050
Announcer Ju Eun Ho...

718
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,090
where is she right now?

719
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,900
I'd like to know first

720
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:31,500
what your relationship is with Announcer Ju Eun Ho that you're asking me such a question.

721
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,680
Announcer Ju Eun Ho's other personality,

722
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,670
Ju Hye Ri, and I are in a relationship.
