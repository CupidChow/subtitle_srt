1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,780
   

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,310
   

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,630
   

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,930
   

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,250
   

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:28,560


7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,010
   

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,130
   

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,860
- Wow! 
 - Look, I have it, too!

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,290
 Hey, Children, let's take the photo! 

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,740
 Hye Ri, the photo! 

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,180
Good. I'm taking the photo now!

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,040
 One, two... 

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,590
Are you up?

15
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,890
How can a human sleep for more than 12 hours?

16
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,870
Wh-Why are you...

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,190
Get ready. We're going out.

18
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,600
Wh-Wh-Where?

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,330
Where... where... where?

20
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,230
Why? What?

21
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,750
It's just...

22
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,270
I slept so much that I'm not sure if I'm dreaming.

23
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,340
You can't tell if this is reality?

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,250
No.

25
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,930
Then start asking questions. I'll answer.

26
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,240
Well...

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,270
Hurry.

28
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,010
Panic...

29
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,160
Right. Panic disorder.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,850
That's real. Next.

31
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,140
At the end of the broadcast...

32
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,530
The closing statement? Also reality.

33
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,270
You did a good job, thanks to me.

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,260
At what point did your memory black out?

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,820
I...

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,650
I-In the elevator, we...

37
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,200
Kissed?

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,160
Yes, we did.

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,370
Eat your food.

40
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,160
You're going to put a hole in my head.

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,110
What else do you want to know?

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,030
Aren't you...

43
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,310
going to leave?

44
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,990
I will. Once you're asleep.

45
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,980
 Marriage? No way, Eun Ho. 

46
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,500
 I won't do that. 

47
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,680
 I don't do such a thing, Eun Ho. 

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,700
 I see. Is that so? 

49
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,050
 Yes. 

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,000
 - I had told you I wouldn't do it. 
 - That's right. 

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
 You said you wouldn't. 

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
 Yes, you did, several times. 

53
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,580
 I told you that at the start. 

54
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,000
 I won't be doing that kind of thing. 

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,120
 - Soâ€” 
 - I know! 

56
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,200
 But you see, I understood that for the first few years. 

57
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,960
 But, Jung Hyun Oh, we've been dating for eight years. 

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,500
 If you really didn't want to marry me, you didn't need to date me for eight years! 

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,140
 You should have ended it with me at a logical point, in a right place, 

60
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,860
 with some decent words. No? 

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,300
 Even if I started seeing a guy right now, I plan to get married after 40. 

62
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,480
 No. 

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,060
 I don't think it'll take that long. 

64
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,090
 What? 

65
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,450
 If you want to meet someone now, we should break up. 

66
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,460
 Hey, Jung Hyun Oh. 

67
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,440
 Goodbye, Ju Eun Ho. 

68
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,800
 Hey, are you serious? 

69
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,490
 You're actually breaking up with me like this? 

70
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,340
 Then how should I do it? 

71
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,370
 This isn't it, Hyun Oh. We've been together for eight years. 

72
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,880
 Exactly. 

73
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,630
 So how should we break up? 

74
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,640
 Don't you know what eight years mean? 

75
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,120
 It's the time it takes for a child to be born and go to elementary school. 

76
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,640
 We're breaking up like this after all that time? In one breath? 

77
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,920
 It's not like we were just messing around! 

78
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,950
 Whether we were together eight years or eight weeks, 

79
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,730
 breakups are the same. 

80
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,410
 Goodbye. So long. 

81
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,680
 That's the end of it, Eun Ho. 

82
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,910
   

83
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,930
   

84
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,930
You'll get bedsores if you sleep like that.

85
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,990
Why are you still...

86
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,950
Hurry and get ready.

87
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,240
The hospital closes at four o'clock.

88
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,200
I almost died trying to find a hospital open during the holidays.

89
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
"Hospital"? We're going to the hospital?

90
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,100
Yes. We need to.

91
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,870
Will you live with panic disorder forever?

92
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,200
Where did my wallet go?

93
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,810
Hey, have you seen my wallet?

94
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,670
Did I leave it in my car?

95
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,970
Since when do you just stare at people instead of asking questions?

96
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,030
Well, I...

97
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,390
What? Say it.

98
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,170
You've been staying... at my house...

99
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,730
That's my choice. What else?

100
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,910
Anything else you want to know?

101
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,280
Hyun Oh.

102
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,220
Yes? Tell me.

103
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,330
I already have a doctor whom I see.

104
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,570
You should have told me!

105
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,370
I looked up other hospitals for nothing.

106
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,320
Give me the address.

107
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,050
Well...

108
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,500
 Hey, Sunbae. 

109
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,250
Really?

110
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,570
I have already met and spoken with Press Director Soh.

111
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,210
 Hello. 

112
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,600
 You don't have an appointment today. 

113
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,990
 I know, but I need a consultation with the doctor today. 
   

114
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,180
Okay. One moment, Hye Ri.

115
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,970
 Is something the matter, Hye Ri? 

116
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,850
Doctor,

117
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm Eun Ho. Ju Eun Ho.

118
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,830
Doctor, have I been coming here saying that I'm Hye Ri?

119
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,750
Yes.

120
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,040
- The thing is... 
 - Since when?

121
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,210
Since when have I been doing that?

122
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,260
What state was I in? Was I not like how I am now?

123
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,440
Doctor, I don't recall any of it.

124
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,210
I keep falling asleep in strange places.

125
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,510
I meet strangers. My phone suddenly disappeared.

126
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,630
And sometimes...

127
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,150
Occasionally...

128
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,300
I remember things I don't recognize.

129
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,330
I don't know what they are, and I don't seem myself inside those memories.

130
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,550
I read a letter I wrote to myself when I was living as Hye Ri.

131
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,880
It wasn't a letter I would write.

132
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,500
I can't believe it. I don't recall writing that letter.

133
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,060
Really...

134
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,900
I can't ponder it because I hate thinking of it.

135
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,170
Eun Ho,

136
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,800
it must have been so confusing for you.

137
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,830
That's natural.

138
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,350
Then could you tell me...

139
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,900
what Hye Ri is like? The one who wrote you a letter.

140
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,300
If you could tell me what kind of person she is...

141
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,330
Hye Ri is...

142
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,860
I mean, Hye Ri...

143
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,410
Yes.

144
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,830
is my younger sister...

145
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,320
who went missing.

146
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,100
 Hye Ri, listen carefully. 

147
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,900
 From now on, we can't see Mom and Dad again. 

148
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,570
 - Why not? Because of the accident? 
 - Yes. 

149
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,270
 It was a big accident. 

150
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,580
 So... 

151
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,970
 Oppa, you have the most money! 

152
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,760
 You should take them! 

153
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,240
 Why are you bringing that up right now? 

154
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,360
 We don't even have a house. 

155
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,390
 Our place is collateral right now. 

156
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,060
 We're about to be homeless. 

157
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,460
 We can't take care of them! 

158
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,450
 You used to borrow money so often. Now you're scared to take them? 

159
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,090
 I'm busy trying to put food in my mouth. 

160
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,050
 How are we supposed to take care of them? 

161
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,020
 You take care of them. You have the most money! 

162
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,400
 Frankly, you took all of our dad's assets. 

163
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,000
 - We live like beggars while you flaunt your wealth. 
 - Hey! 

164
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,570
 Are you serious right now? 

165
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,950
 Oppa, you never did anything for Dad. 

166
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,410
 During Dad's later years, you looked the other way! 

167
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,780
 - It's okay, Hye Ri. 
 - And you had the nerve 

168
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,240
 - You have me. 
 - to take all of his assets? 

169
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,650
 All you need to do is send them to an orphanage. 

170
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,000
 - That's dirty. 
 - Why talk to me so rudely due to them? 

171
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,200
 - Don't do that. It's dirty. 
 - Just send them to an orphanage! 

172
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,900
 You don't have parents anymore. You need to care for yourselves. 

173
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,870
 Here. 

174
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,810
 Hey. 

175
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,870
 Blow your nose. Blow. 

176
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,830
 Good. One more time. 

177
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,060
 Good. 

178
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,450
 Who are you? 

179
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,070
 Grandma? 

180
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,760
 That's right! 

181
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,820
 You've always been smart. You remember me! 

182
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,010
 You're Eun Ho, right? 

183
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,470
 Then are you Hye Ri? 

184
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,180
 Yes, I'm Hye Ri. 

185
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,050
 Hye Ri, 

186
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,780
 do you want to come with Grandma? 

187
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,870
 Want to come live with Grandma? 

188
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,670
 Unnie, you know what? I received an academic warning. 

189
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,530
 Hey, you need to study. 

190
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,310
 You can't do that while studying with a stranger's money. 

191
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,400
 I'm sorry. 

192
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,700
 But, Unnie, why is Grandma a stranger? 

193
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,840
 She is. 

194
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,100
 Do you know how distantly related we are in the family tree? 

195
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,400
 She raised us anyway so we basically owe her. 

196
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,800
 Plus, we will move out. I signed the lease on a place. 

197
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,120
 You'll live downstairs, and I'll live upstairs. 

198
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,200
 What are you talking about? Why would we leave? 

199
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,500
 Hye Ri, if we don't leave, will you live here forever? 

200
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,740
 Yes. Of course. 

201
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,680
 Grandma will be bored without us. 

202
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,570
 Listen to me, Ju Hye Ri. 

203
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,600
 No one in this world is generous without wanting something in return. 

204
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 That's not true. Grandma is kind for nothing in return. 

205
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,430
 And it's not because she's generous. 

206
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,260
 She just loves us. 

207
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
 "Love"? It's just debt. 

208
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,350
 Unnie, you're so weird. 

209
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,430
 I don't understand anything you're saying. 

210
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,260
 A graduation trip? 

211
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,100
 You have to go. You should definitely go. 

212
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,880
 Go on the graduation trip. 

213
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,160
 You have no friends because you don't go to things like that. 

214
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,380
 I don't want to go. 

215
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,340
 I really don't. 

216
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,050
 Why don't you want to go? 

217
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,860
 I like being home better. 

218
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,460
 I don't have any friends there. 

219
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,990
 You can make friends there. 

220
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,500
 How can you have no friends even as you're graduating college? 

221
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,950
 Go make some. 

222
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,990
 That's how you can be helpful when you step into society. 

223
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,700
 I told you that you need to be independent now. 

224
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,200
 I found a place you can live in, Ju Hye Ri. 

225
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,290
 But I reallyâ€” 

226
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,120
 Go. 

227
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,750
 I'll assume you're going. 

228
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,780
 I can send the money to this account, right? 

229
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,210
 But I really don't want to go, Unnie. 

230
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,780
 I don't need friends. 

231
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,400
 I'm not going. 

232
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,580
 All I need is you, Unnie. 

233
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,270
 Ju Hye Ri! 

234
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,240
 How long are you going to be like this? 

235
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,330
 You need to be independent! 

236
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,860
 Work hard at something! Make connections! 

237
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,800
 You need to get ready to be a part of society! 

238
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,730
 Stop complaining and go. 

239
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,180
 Go make friends! 

240
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,430
 Yes, hello? 

241
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,680
 I'm sorry. 

242
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,060
 Could you say that again? 

243
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,460
 Ju Hye Ri is missing. 

244
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,900
 Hey, Eun Ho. 

245
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,230
 Hye Ri hasn't been answering her phone since yesterday. 

246
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,360
 Did something happen? 

247
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,280
 Hye... Hye Ri... 

248
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,130
 "A", a college student who went on a graduation trip, was reported missing last night. 

249
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,480
   

250
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,600
 Grandma. 

251
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,680
 Grandma, are you there? 

252
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,600
 Grandma, you know... 

253
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,200
 let's wait for Hye Ri a little longer, as you said. 

254
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,810
 Grandma. 

255
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,010
 Grandma? 

256
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,510
 Grandma... 

257
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,760
 Grandma! 

258
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,950
 Grandma! 

259
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,270
 Grandma! 

260
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,830
   

261
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,730
 Working here is not possible. 

262
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,480
 We don't need more workers. 

263
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,900
 One person is enough. 

264
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,540
 I'm also not allowed to get paid elsewhere. 

265
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,410
 I already belong to a company. 

266
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,030
 Then why do you want to do this? 

267
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,240
 Can you just let me sit there? 

268
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,960
 Well... 

269
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,000
 - that'd be difficult. 
 - My sister really wanted to do this, 

270
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,120
 though I don't know why. 

271
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,120
 Sunbae, what is it? 

272
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,250
 I want to do the morning radio. 

273
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,590
 I know there's an opening. Plug (place) me there. 

274
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,900
 I can't work at night. 

275
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,750
 Hye Ri! 

276
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,160
 I'm busy. Don't call me at this hour from now on. 

277
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,400
 Don't ever ask why. 

278
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,750
 - The administrative office. 
 - Yes. 

279
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,790
 I wanted to live that life, 

280
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,660
 doing the work she might have done here. 

281
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,680
 If I lived like her, who was truly happy, 

282
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,920
 could I be happy as well? 

283
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,950
 So did you become as happy as Hye Ri, Eun Ho? 

284
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,620
No.

285
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,560
I lived as her for three years,

286
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,600
but not at all.

287
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,570
Actually, Eun Ho...

288
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,310
you came to see me many times as Hye Ri.

289
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,970
But the fact that you don't remember suggests you have

290
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,200
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

291
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,540
Doctor, are you saying...

292
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,780
I'm no longer pretending to be Hye Ri,

293
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,010
but that I've truly become her?

294
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,880
Is that why I wrote that letter to myself when I was Hye Ri?

295
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,020
Could I read the letter?

296
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,730
   

297
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,820
   

298
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,320
 I'm writing because I want to tell you something. 

299
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,080
 I found happiness, and I don't want to let it go. 

300
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,570
 Because... 

301
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,680
   

302
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,900
   

303
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,220
 So I'd like to make a request. 

304
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,380
 Even if you're the owner of this body, 

305
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,250
 please give it to me because I'm happy. 

306
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,660
   

307
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,670
 Because... 

308
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:04,220
 I'm much happier than you are. 

309
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,800
Look. You can see here

310
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,050
how you were as Hye Ri.

311
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,770
When you first came to me, I recorded you with your consent.

312
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,580
Let me see it, please.

313
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,100
Are you sure?

314
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes. I want to see it.

315
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,940
 Then what happens to me, Ju Hye Ri? 

316
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,540
 Do I disappear? 

317
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,780
 Do I go away? 

318
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,890
 Eun Ho has existed only in my dreams. 

319
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,800
 Doctor, I'm happy now. 

320
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,110
 I don't want to abandon Hye Ri. 

321
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:57,530
 At least, in the present, I am much happier than Eun Ho from my dreams. 

322
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,020
Doctor.

323
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,660
Yes, Eun Ho. Go ahead.

324
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,190
Did Ju Hye Ri seem...

325
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,920
happy to you, too?

326
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,220
What did the doctor say?

327
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
What? Is it serious?

328
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,960
No.

329
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,740
Wasn't that Sunbae Shin Joong on the phone?

330
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,140
- Yes. 
 - What did he say?

331
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,100
Today is Department Head Oh's last day.

332
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,260
Really? I thought he was retiring at the end of the year.

333
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,290
Yes, but it must have been decided last month.

334
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,910
So after the holidays, you'll take over the nine o'clock news.

335
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,840
I'm not sure.

336
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,090
What do you mean you're not sure?

337
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,190
I think it's leaking.

338
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,750
This? I found it on the street.

339
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,270
Wait, for real?

340
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,930
Would it be fake?

341
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,020
Why did you have to pick up a broken one?

342
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,190
That's probably why it got thrown out. Then I found it.

343
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,240
It wouldn't have been thrown out otherwise.

344
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,660
That seems logical.

345
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,100
Excuse me. Did Ju Hye Ri not come to work again?

346
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,330
No. She didn't.

347
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,510
She usually does.

348
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,490
Did she not work yesterday either?

349
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,880
No.

350
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,460
You can't reach her, either?

351
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,550
No, I mean...

352
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,650
Ju Hye Ri doesn't have a phone.

353
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,560
I thought so, too, but remember when she passed out in the restroom?

354
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,880
At that time... Hold on a second.

355
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,470
 This was on the floor next to her. 

356
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,100
- It's a phone. 
 - Yes.

357
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,710
But it won't turn on, even after I charged it.

358
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,990
I don't know whose this is.

359
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,490
But I can't ask unless she's here.

360
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,600
Hye Ri doesn't have a phone, and I don't have her address.

361
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,700
Can I take that to her?

362
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,070
I do know her address.

363
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,810
Oh.

364
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,080
Sure. Of course.

365
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,030
Thank you.

366
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,030
 Excuse me! 

367
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,640
If you see Hye Ri, could you tell her something for me?

368
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,330
Tell her what?

369
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,920
That she's dead meat.

370
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,930
Okay.

371
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,130
If you're hungry, should I make you something?

372
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,180
Are you hungry? Want me to make you something?

373
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,710
Yes.

374
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,950
I want something delicious.

375
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,110
Got it. I'll make you something delicious.

376
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,350
Something high in calories.

377
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,120
Not that.

378
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,790
Do you know how puffy your face looks onscreen these days?

379
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,370
Like you eat late every night.

380
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,170
What's this?

381
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,500
It's nothing important.

382
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,260
Are you knitting these days?

383
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,410
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

384
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,130
What? No.

385
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,870
So what will you make me?

386
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,280
Tomato and egg stir fry?

387
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,930
Wow. Sounds good.

388
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,750
   

389
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,990
Special live broadcast of "The Country Right Now and Us" for the Golden Holidays.

390
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,870
Hello, we are at the "Square Meeting" rest stop.

391
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,240
People traveling this weekend can stop and rest a while. 
    

392
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,910
Yes. Rain that started at the beginning of the holiday weekend

393
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,390
has subsided, excluding a few areas in the Seoul region.

394
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,590
Forecasts predict that rain will resume tomorrow morning,

395
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,360
but right now, it's busy here with people enjoying the long weekend.

396
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,670
Should we chat with one of those people?

397
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,450
Please call Yoo Ra.

398
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,500
The main writer, Yoo Ra.

399
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,220
Call her.

400
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,280
She's not picking up my calls.

401
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,570
Oh, well, that's...

402
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,150
Unnie did arrive here...

403
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:27,160
I mean, she's not here. No, she wasn't able to...

404
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,760
Then...

405
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,170
could you deliver

406
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:36,500
to Yoo Ra what I have to say?

407
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,370
Yes. If you tell me, I'll deliver the message.

408
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,050
I was...

409
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,770
told I'd be the main emcee.

410
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,290
But I didn't even get the first greeting.

411
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:54,560
I kept being asked to do people's interviews or to laugh at dumb jokes.

412
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,370
That's...

413
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,710
not how it should be.

414
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,290
And her...

415
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,380
That Baek Hye Yeon.

416
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,120
I've been doing this for 15 years, longer than she has,

417
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,410
but my role is smaller than hers.

418
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,980
What do you think will happen if you keep doing this?

419
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,290
 Do you have a phone? 

420
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,800
 Unfortunately, I get no joy out of the selfishness of civilization. 

421
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,500
Sunbae, I'm scared.

422
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,300
That sunbaeâ€¦

423
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,510
How should I say this? I think she might kill me.

424
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,800
She wouldn't kill me, would she?

425
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,490
Or, Sunbae, I think that sunbae might beat me up.

426
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,150
Sunbae, I've been bullied a lot, but I've never been beaten.

427
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,850
Will I get beaten?

428
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,830
It would be my first time. I'm scared.

429
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,980
Sunbae, is she always that scary?

430
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,570
You knowâ€¦ my heart is pounding.

431
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,700
Butâ€¦

432
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,730
how do you contact someone with a broken phone

433
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,130
or no phone at all?

434
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,700
How would I know that?

435
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,920
Hello.

436
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,930
I'm looking for a parking booth employee's contact information.

437
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,450
Yes. Sure.

438
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,820
I'm aware.

439
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,960
Are you crazy?

440
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,530
I'm asking you. Are you crazy?

441
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,210
- Wellâ€¦ 
 - What did you say when you called me a month ago?

442
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,820
"Unnie, we're doing a special holiday live broadcast."

443
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,130
"We will tour rest stops in the country, end up in Busan, and raise money."

444
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,800
"It's a highly well-intended program."

445
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,920
"Unnie, I want you to be the main emcee on this event."

446
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,680
"What do you think, Unnie?"

447
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,840
Does standing in line make me the main emcee?

448
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,100
- It's not like thatâ€¦ 
 - Answer me, Yoo Ra.

449
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,760
Is that what you call a main emcee?

450
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,790
Well, I don't think so.

451
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,650
How do I say this?

452
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,470
Although we are both the lead emcees, Baek Hye Yeon is the host.

453
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,610
But what about me?

454
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,500
I feel like an extra next to her.

455
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,930
 Excuse me. 

456
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,380
- Me? 
 - Yes.

457
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,730
Mi Rae says she won't do it.

458
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,400
- Do what? 
 - She says she won't host anymore.

459
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,490
She is so angry at you that she won't do it,

460
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,950
but as you know, we are totally ruined without her.

461
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,170
She says she's skipping all the rest stop shots from now on.

462
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,330
Well, fine. I can deal with that.

463
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,790
But if she misses filming tomorrow, we're completely doomed.

464
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,030
So I'm asking you.

465
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,770
Please convince Mi Rae.

466
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,000
I begged, but it didn't work.

467
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,600
Please help me out.

468
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,800
This is a special holiday live broadcast of "The Country Right Now and Us."

469
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,350
We are at Mangjoong Rest Stop.

470
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,660
We're much closer to the beaches of Busan.

471
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,780
What's the weather like in Busan right now?

472
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,220
It's very clear in Busan.

473
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,160
Could you introduce yourself first?

474
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh, yes. Me? Iâ€¦

475
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,450
We've met before.

476
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,950
I've seen you before. For sure.

477
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,700
Yes.

478
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,170
 Hello. There's no need to go in person to experience Busan's weather. 

479
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,500
 - Since the age we are living inâ€¦  
 - Darn it.

480
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,610
 - has highly developed technology.  
 - Is he on Media N Seoul right now?

481
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,980
 AI is changing our worldâ€¦ 

482
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,250
Did he get permission?

483
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,730
 Even so, we are still living in an analog reality. 

484
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,340
Should I have had my makeup done?

485
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,820
Excuse me.

486
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,310
Me?

487
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,850
Excuse me.

488
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,930
You said you knew me earlier.

489
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,880
Of course, I do. I've seen you talking to Ju Eun Ho's sister.

490
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,500
Wellâ€¦

491
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,330
who's Ju Eun Ho?

492
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,910
Tomorrow we will gather in the lobby at 10 a.m. and go to the studio together.

493
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,480
 Got it! 
   

494
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,700
 Great work! Thank you! 
   

495
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,200
 Do you live with your family? 

496
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,260
 No, I live alone. 

497
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,420
 I guess you can say I'm an only child. 

498
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,730
Hey.

499
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,440
You knowâ€¦

500
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,600
I've done the seven, eight, and nine o'clock news.

501
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,410
That means I have as much,

502
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,780
noâ€¦ more recognition than you.

503
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:01,100
Do you know what that Press Director scumbag called me and said?

504
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:06,610
That I should be thankful to be on TV.

505
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,920
Why?

506
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,140
Because I'm old.

507
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,450
But everyone gets old,

508
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,110
including you.

509
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm sayingâ€¦ you'll meet a hoobae like you in a few years,

510
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,400
and you'll be fuming, just like me.

511
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm sorry,

512
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,200
but I have no intention of sharing a room with you.

513
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,860
Excuse me, Sunbaenim.

514
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,890
Why? What?

515
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,320
I won't share a room with you. I won't complain.

516
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,140
Could you please do the broadcast tomorrow?

517
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,030
I'll ask the Press Director if we can split the lines.

518
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,580
I beg you, Sunbaenim.

519
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,410
Hey, it's me.

520
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,380
Where are you?

521
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,830
Can you maybeâ€¦

522
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,630
come here right now?

523
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,540
Do you have trouble waking?

524
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,440
How can you sleep for 12 hours at a time?

525
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,270
Maybe you have a sleep disorder, not a panic disorder.

526
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,190
Is it morning or not?

527
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,200
"Morning"? It's evening.

528
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,580
Well, Iâ€¦

529
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,810
What? What?

530
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,600
Did I wake up at some point?

531
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,780
- Did Iâ€¦ 
 - What are you saying?

532
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,950
I thought you were dead. I kept checking to see if you were breathing.

533
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,640
Where did you find those clothes?

534
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,020
I don't know. My clothes were damp; I found these in your closet.

535
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,600
Oh, I meant to get rid of your clothes, but Iâ€¦

536
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,240
It's fine. Get out. It's dirty.

537
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,270
- Where to? Hey! 
 - Just get out.

538
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,480
I just woke up. Whereâ€”

539
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,830
It's dirty. Get out!

540
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,170
- Go, go, go. 
 - I'm cold.

541
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,000
Hey, do you have a scrubber?

542
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,230
- There isn't one in the kitchen? 
 - No. Not there.

543
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,110
Then I don't have one.

544
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,450
Geez, for real?

545
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,380
Let's go.

546
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,000
- Where to? 
 - To get a scrubber.

547
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,520
Did you finish cleaning?

548
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,690
Your place is so dirty, so, so very dirty.

549
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,740
How can you be like that? Do you only wash your face in that house?

550
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,170
How could you not have a scrubber?

551
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,710
Hyun Oh, I'm hungry.

552
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,350
Of course, you are. But I'm not hungry at all.

553
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,320
Why? I ate plenty of dust.

554
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,150
Make me something delicious.

555
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,600
No.

556
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,870
You absolutely cannot eat anything at this hour.

557
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,680
Young Man, try this.

558
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,300
Not you, Young Lady.

559
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,440
Young Man, try it.

560
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,330
You had two already, Young Lady.

561
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,080
I'll take it.

562
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,300
How is it? It's good, right?

563
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,000
- Do you want one? 
 - I'll take one.

564
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,390
Thank you.

565
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,620
You're so good-looking, Young Man.

566
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,870
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

567
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,990
Live "Issue-In" or something? Right?

568
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,520
I'm on it, too. Can I have that pork cutlet?

569
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,640
Give me some! I want some, too!

570
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,760
Let's go over there. You like ice cream, right?

571
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,940
I want the pork cutlet more!

572
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,630
Let's go. Let's go.

573
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,430
 Try some pork cutlets! 

574
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,660
   

575
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,200
Aigoo, thank you. 
    

576
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,190
Thank you.

577
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,500
We have so much food. I feel so rich.

578
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,260
You have to eat everything.

579
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,940
You once told me all I needed was fresh vitamins.

580
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,820
I mean, just eat it all. Don't waste it.

581
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,490
Really?

582
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,070
Stop that.

583
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,380
I don't want to.

584
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,810
- I fell! 
 - Are you okay?

585
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:41,950
- Hey! 
 - It's karma.

586
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,280
Really?

587
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,540
- It's pure karma. 
 - Make me something delicious.

588
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,750
- Okay. 
 - What are you going to make?

589
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,720
- Something as satisfying as your fall. 
 - Can you make pork cutlets?

590
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,490
Careful.

591
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:56,140
One, twoâ€¦ one, twoâ€¦

592
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,640
- Is it good? 
 - Yes, very good.

593
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,980
You eat well, Ju Eun Ho.

594
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,590
When will you start taking care of yourself? After you're dead?

595
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,360
No, I'll do it right now.

596
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,830
I'm going to start glowing right now. I'll totally beâ€¦

597
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,110
Why are you laughing?

598
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,520
Am I already prettier?

599
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,510
Yes, right.

600
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,740
You should go on a diet, though.

601
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,100
What diet?

602
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,830
 Ahead of the first weekend of May, called the "Golden Holiday," 

603
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,430
 - flight and train reservations are on the uphill.  
 - It's Shim Eun Young.

604
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,580
 The whole country is expected to be busy with tourists and travelers. 

605
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:50,440
- That's right. 
  - With cars leaving early for the road, 

606
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,200
 - the highways are crowdedâ€¦  
 - She must be back.

607
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,540
 - The extreme trafficâ€¦  
 - How old is Shim Eun Young?

608
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,130
Fifty-three.

609
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,360
I'm so jealous. A main news anchor at that age?

610
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,200
 It has subsided briefly, and early morningâ€¦ 

611
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,200
- You are also going to do that someday. 
  - it is projected to increase again. 

612
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,090
Yes. You, too.

613
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,650
 - Southbound direction, tomorrow morningâ€¦  
 - What?

614
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:16,190
When you go on the nine o'clock news soonâ€¦ do it forever like her.

615
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,760
 To prevent large-scale traffic accidents, policeâ€¦ 

616
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,100
And wait.

617
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,500
- Untilâ€¦ 
  - Please be careful, especially during long drives. 

618
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,120
I take the seat next to yours.

619
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,190
 I'm Shim Eun Young. Thank you. 

620
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,930
If you keep eating that much, you won't get to sit anywhere.

621
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,990
Hey!

622
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:53,060
   

623
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,720
You got here faster than I expected.

624
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,730
I was in Daegu for a broadcast.

625
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,280
Come in.

626
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,770
Wow! Nice room. Your special one must have money.

627
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,140
I paid for it.

628
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,920
I got kicked out.

629
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,850
 By whom? 

630
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,450
 Why? 

631
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,420
 Just because. It just happened. 

632
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,810
 Why? D-Did something happen? 

633
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,090
 No. Nothing. 

634
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,700
 Then why did you call me? 

635
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,490
 Just because. 

636
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,890
 I want you to hug me. 

637
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,880
 I mean, sure. 

638
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,890
Where did Kang Ju Yeon go?

639
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,920
Are you sure you told him the right call time?

640
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,360
Yes.

641
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,980
 I'm sorry. 

642
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,350
 I'm sorry. 

643
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,680
- Ju Yeon! 
 - I'm sorry.

644
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,180
We were worried!

645
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,020
Get in! Just get in. Let's go.

646
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,840
-  Where were you?  
 - To Seoul.

647
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,660
- What, Seoul? 
 - What?

648
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,370
"Seoul"?

649
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,580
   

650
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,720
 The holiday weekend special live broadcast of "The Country Right Now and Us." 

651
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,670
Hello, I'm Announcer Kang Ju Yeon.

652
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:50,040
We are here today at a special stage built on the beach.

653
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,820
Many people are here at the beach to enjoy the holiday.

654
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,050
The holidays might be full of excitement and anticipation,

655
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:02,930
but some of our neighbors are facing hardship and spending the holidays alone.

656
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,800
What did he say?

657
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,500
"Someone like you in that spot at your age."

658
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,450
He said I should be relieved.

659
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,870
I should have been kicked out long ago,

660
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:24,740
but I'm only here because I managed to hang on.

661
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,320
He's a Press Director for the Announcer Department.

662
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,780
Does he know how the world is changing as he speaks?

663
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,610
If you say that stuff these days, you'll be thrown behind bars!

664
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:37,460
Sunbaenim, just let it go.

665
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,600
Press Director can be harsh. He has a temper.

666
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,600
I have a temper, too. I do, too!

667
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,470
Hey.

668
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:58,710
I got kicked off Nights at 7 due to her.

669
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:03,760
Because the news "needed some fresh air" or whatever.

670
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,800
I want to know what your background is.

671
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,250
No.

672
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:14,370
I want to know so badly how you manage to get programs.

673
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:18,400
How did you manage to climb up so high at your age?

674
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,050
Unnie, you're drunk. Stop drinking.

675
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,000
Tell me.

676
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,960
Is it really your talent?

677
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,710
Orâ€¦

678
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:34,020
is the rumor really true?

679
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,950
You know what the rumor is, right?

680
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,580
The rumor about you.

681
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,200
Unnie, stop drinking. Let's go. Let's go now.

682
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,430
Let's just go.

683
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,680
Yes, Sunbaenim.

684
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,470
It's true. Why? Are you jealous?

685
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:00,260
- What? 
 - At least, there are rumors about me. Are you jealous?

686
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,850
Is sheâ€¦

687
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,810
crazy?

688
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,640
But Sunbaenimâ€¦

689
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,400
even if that rumor is true,

690
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,430
I've never done anything against my conscience.

691
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,260
Never.

692
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,980
Hey!

693
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,230
Who would know that?

694
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,460
I know.

695
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,300
It's my body.

696
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,300
Sunbae, aren't you getting off?

697
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,200
Also, Sunbae.

698
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,740
I haven't been okay this entire broadcast.

699
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,950
You probably didn't even realize it,

700
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,900
which is why you didn't make any effort to comfort me.

701
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,770
But you knowâ€¦

702
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,170
Hye Yeon.

703
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,100
- Iâ€¦ 
 - What?

704
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,960
Sunbae, what's wrong?

705
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,460
Soâ€¦

706
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,300
Hyun Oh.

707
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,000
What should we have for breakfast?

708
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,610
Hyun Oh?

709
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,670
Hyun Oh?

710
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,570
When did you get up?

711
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,210
Wh-Where did you go?

712
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,390
I went to get groceries.

713
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,990
Wow! I still need things, no matter how much stuff I buy for your place.

714
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:01,480
Your place is so cluttered, but there's nothing useful.

715
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,050
What did you get?

716
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,750
Just some stuff.

717
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:15,070
You should have gotten this. The fried mushroom stuffed with shrimp.

718
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,160
It's so good.

719
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,570
I went to every store in the area looking for it,

720
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:25,400
but I couldn't find it. Where can I get it? It goes so well with pork belly.

721
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,620
Is that right?

722
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,360
You always want something with pork belly.

723
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,280
You love pork belly.

724
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,710
Should we just go get pork belly?

725
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,020
What?

726
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,140
All right. Let's just go get pork belly right now.

727
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,630
You really mean it, don't you?

728
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:52,080
I'll go change right now. You mean it, right? Hooray!

729
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,710
Hello?

730
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,810
 Oppaâ€¦ 

731
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,850
What's wrong, Moon Su Jeong?

732
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:07,850
 Oppa, what do I do? 

733
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,170
Moon Su Jeong, calm down.

734
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:14,380
 Soâ€¦ wellâ€¦ 

735
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,870
 Hyun Oh, we're at the hospital. 

736
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,040
 Grandma Mi Ja got hurt. 

737
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,920
 It's nothing serious. 

738
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,350
 Hello? 

739
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,090
 Where should we go? 

740
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,630
 That stone-grilled pork belly place we went to before? 

741
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,780
 I don't know if it's still there. 

742
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,800
 It has been four years. It might be gone. 

743
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,700
- Is that right, Hyun Oh? 
 - I have to go.

744
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,170
 Goodbye. 

745
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,400
 So long. 

746
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,800
 That's the end of it, Eun Ho. 

747
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:39,170
 Hyun Ohâ€¦ 

748
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,490
 Hyun Oh, don't go. Don't go. 

749
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,910
 Don't go. Please? 

750
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,270
 I'm not getting married, Ju Eun Ho, 

751
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:48,050
 but you want to. 

752
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:52,350
 No, I don't. I'll never bring up marriage again. 

753
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,280
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hyun Oh. 

754
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,130
 No. 

755
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,960
 No, Eun Ho. 

756
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,650
 You are going to bring it up again. 

757
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,570
 Then more time will have gone by. 

758
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,340
 Soâ€¦ 

759
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,130
 let's stop here, Ju Eun Ho. 

760
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,090
 Eun Ho! 

761
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,790
 Ju Eun Ho! 

762
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,290
Eun Ho.

763
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,460
Get sick.

764
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,780
Just like thisâ€¦

765
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,130
Get sick sometimes, Eun Ho.

766
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:50,790
   

767
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,400
Please, Eun Ho.

768
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,890
Will you, Eun Ho?

769
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,910
No.

770
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:27,170
   

771
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,700
I'll neverâ€¦

772
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,880
be sick again.

773
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,780
â™«  All the seasons we spent together  â™«

774
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,240
 I'll continue to be healthy no matter what happens. 

775
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,330
â™«  In calm anticipation  â™«

776
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:50,900
You'll seeâ€¦

777
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,810
â™«  Time passes  â™«

778
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,720
how well I'm doing.

779
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,810
â™«  The moment I thought would never come  â™«

780
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:09,710
â™«  Came to us silently  â™«

781
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,560
Goodbye.

782
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,960
That's how we say goodbye, right?

783
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:21,290
â™«  Inside my quiet heart  â™«

784
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:26,600
    
 â™«  Waves rise slowly  â™«

785
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:37,850
â™«  In the gentle sunlight season, we stood on that road  â™«

786
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:42,630
    
 â™«  Holding on to words we couldn't say  â™«

787
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:49,830
â™«  Our today, soaked in sunlight  â™«

788
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,900
 Why are you crying? 

789
01:03:51,900 --> 01:04:00,580
â™«  Deep inside me, every moment, I long for "us"  â™«

790
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,500
 You're supposed to say goodbyes with a smile. 

791
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,900
â™«  I thought it would be only natural  â™«

792
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:17,650
â™«  Like falling leaves, I turned away  â™«

793
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:23,870
â™«  With an unfamiliar expression and tone  â™«

794
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:28,880
â™«  I spoke words I didn't mean  â™«

795
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,700
â™«  The moment I let you go  â™«

796
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:43,930
â™«  In the gentle sunlight season, I stayed there for an eternity  â™«

797
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:48,620
â™«  Holding on to words I couldn't say  â™«

798
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:54,700
â™«  Our today, soaked in sunlight  â™«

799
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:00,920
â™«  Will remain for a long time, deep inside me  â™«

800
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,100
â™«  Every moment, I long for "us"  â™«

801
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,930
So long, Jung Hyun Oh.

802
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:10,900
â™«  How can I say it all?  â™«

803
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:18,860
â™«  You turned on the lights during dark nights  â™«

804
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:24,920
â™«  You held my hand tightly  â™«

805
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:32,280
â™«  To that day when gentle sunlight shone  â™«

806
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,240
â™«  I want to go back and tell you  â™«

807
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,990
â™«  You're the reason I breathe  â™«

808
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:46,900
â™«  I hope my story, the only one of its kind  â™«

809
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:53,250
â™«  Can be completed with you  â™«

810
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,990
â™«  In all of time  â™«

811
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,500
â™«  It's "us"  â™«

812
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:15,000


813
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:22,010
   

814
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,020
   

815
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:34,970
   

816
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,710
 What kind of woman would marry me? 

817
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:47,250
 Taking care of grandmothers should be my job. 

818
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:54,880
 It's bearable for me here, but it's torture to others. 

819
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,250
 Do youâ€¦ 

820
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,950
 even want to get married? 

821
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,470
 You do want it, don't you? 

822
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,000
 But that womanâ€¦ 

823
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,910
 isn't someone who would fit in here?
