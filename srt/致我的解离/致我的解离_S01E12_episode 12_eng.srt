1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,770
   

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,310
   

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,660
   

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,920
   

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,160
   

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:30,580


7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,020
   

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,060
   

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,090
 You can tell me now, Hyun Oh. 

10
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,040
 I really want to know your story. 

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,280
 My father... 

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,100
 was a gambling addict. 

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,700
 Okay. 

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,530
 My mom couldn't tolerate it... 

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,480
 and left home. 

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,120
 And then? 

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,220
 Next door... 

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,210
 Ji On and Su Jeong lived with their father, 

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,580
 who was exactly like mine. 

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,480
 Have you ever heard of "Birds of a Feather"? 

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,320
 What's that? 

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,980
 "Birds of a feather flock together." 

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,820
 I... 

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,400
 Yes, you? 

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,250
 I had to save everyone... 

26
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,760
 from the adults who neglected us. 

27
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,240
 It must have been heavy for you, my Hyun Oh. 

28
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,510
 It was, but... 

29
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,450
 I still felt happy. 

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,530
 You're such a good child. 

31
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,830
 I... 

32
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,880
 had people who loved me. 

33
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,720
 That's true. They say that breeds happiness. 

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,790
 So I... 

35
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,240
 wanted to make those people happy. 

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,430
 Even if... 

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
 I sacrificed myself. 

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,510
 Is that why you didn't want to get married? 

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,590
 Yes. 

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
 You were also 

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,920
 one of the people I wanted to make happy. 

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,810
 I wanted to carry... 

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,430
 the cost of my unhappiness alone. 

44
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,470
 You know, the cost of unhappiness 

45
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,280
 is more of a gem than you may think. 

46
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,100
 If you can endure, you get something tremendous. 

47
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,460
 - "Tremendous"? 
 - Yes. 

48
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,650
 For example, the load that weighed you down a long time could disappear. 

49
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,810
 Or it might even... 

50
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,240
 make you stronger. 

51
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,620
 What? Do you not believe me? 

52
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,780
   

53
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,970
Yes.

54
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,660
Hyun Oh!

55
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,330
Darn it. You...

56
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,330
I came here to kill you.

57
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,820
What? And you're really dead.

58
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,940
Sunbae.

59
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,950
Sunbae!

60
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,800
Jae Yong!

61
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,470
Jae Yong!

62
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,470
   

63
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,740
 Jung Hyun Oh, why aren't you saying anything? 

64
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,830
 Hyun Oh. 

65
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,630
 Hello? 

66
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,850
 Hello? Hyun Oh. 
   

67
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,100
Hello?

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,920
Yes. Please send someone right away.

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
I don't know...

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,900
There's so much blood coming from his head.

71
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,960
Hurry up!

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,920
   

73
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,110
   

74
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,680
Hyun Oh. Jung Hyun Oh.

75
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,690
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

76
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,040
Hey, this isn't good. Let's go to the Emergency Room.

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,440
You need to get examined.

78
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,270
Sunbae.

79
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,060
Hey, you...

80
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,160
My goodness, you...

81
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,590
Hey.

82
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,970
Jae Yong will be okay. It's all right.

83
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,990
He will be fine. I mean it.

84
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,920
So Jeon Jae Yong can't do the news today?

85
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,520
That's right, Press Director.

86
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,400
How hurt is he? How did he get hurt?

87
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,560
He bled a lot, but thankfully, his head injury is external–

88
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,760
Then he will get better soon. Tell him to put some bandages on and do the news.

89
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,570
No. His ribs broke with internal damage there.

90
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,860
He's in the ICU now.

91
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,160
"The ICU"? Then when is he returning?

92
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,490
I don't really...

93
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,020
   

94
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,710
We handled it yesterday, but what will we do today?

95
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,430
The 7 o'clock news anchor is currently a substitute. Now the 9 o'clock too?

96
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,510
Put Son Joo Hyun in. And bring in Jung Hyun Oh.

97
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,030
 You heard, right? 
   

98
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,620
Well...

99
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,680
you could do it yourself. That's one way.

100
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,050
No, I can't.

101
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm not ready like you.

102
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,410
No. I can't, either.

103
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,800
I won't.

104
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm sorry, Press Director.

105
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,050
Please!

106
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,950
Help me, Hyun Oh.

107
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm so sorry

108
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,300
about what happened.

109
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,870
I used you as much as I could, then switched to Jeon Jae Yong.

110
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,110
I'm very sorry.

111
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,020
I apologize.

112
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,780
So please help us.

113
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,780
We are really desperate!

114
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,490
Even if Jae Yong comes back, you continue.

115
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,870
You can keep doing the 9 o'clock news.

116
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,650
Is that good for you?

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,260
No.

118
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,060
In that case, I really can't, Press Director.

119
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,420
Why not? You wanted the 9 o'clock news so–

120
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,090
Press Director.

121
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,080
How can I take that job in a situation like this?

122
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,460
Jeon Jae Yong got hurt right in front of me

123
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,530
while trying to save me.

124
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,440
The blood from his head...

125
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,040
- The blood... 
 - Hyun Oh, this is a broadcast station.

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,960
Were we ever sad because someone died or got hurt?

127
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,010
Everyone is thinking how to fill that spot. Why?

128
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,260
The broadcast has to go on 24/7, no matter what.

129
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,530
The viewers will watch the news whether Jeon Jae Yong is hurt or not!

130
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,940
What viewer will be considerate of the news not airing because the anchor got hurt?

131
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,790
Hey.

132
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,430
When I was your age, I got sad and worried when someone got hurt.

133
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,480
But not anymore. I'm responsible for this place.

134
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,830
And I need you there.

135
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,570
Do you understand?

136
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,020
Yes, I understand.

137
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,370
Of course, those things are important to you.

138
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,450
- So– 
 - But not me.

139
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,590
I didn't hear this secondhand.

140
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,580
I saw it in person.

141
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,430
Jeon Jae Yong...

142
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,880
got hurt for me.

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,150
So how can I...

144
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,780
sit in his 9 o'clock seat and report news?

145
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,880
 I'm sorry. I'm not as cold as you, Press Director. 

146
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,030
 But... 

147
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,600
 This is the right thing for me to do. 

148
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,150
Are you okay, Jung Hyun Oh?

149
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,390
You must be in shock.

150
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,780
Want to sleep over at my place tonight? I can–

151
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,460
No.

152
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,270
Then what can I–

153
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,150
I just...

154
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,460
I just need to be alone a bit, Eun Ho.

155
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,210
Okay, Jung Hyun Oh.

156
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,970
If you need to be alone, do that.

157
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,120
I get it. It's because

158
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,220
that's the better way. That's why you want that.

159
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,870
Right?

160
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,150
But when you need me, call me.

161
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,640
And when it's hard to climb out of it alone,

162
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,540
I'll notice it and run to you. Is that okay?

163
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,730
Yes.

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,210
Please do that for me.

165
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,180
All good. You can go now.

166
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:56,160
   

167
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,700
   

168
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,610
The man who rammed a reporter due to his resentment over

169
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,840
erroneous reporting was arrested at the scene.

170
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,250
The perpetrator, Lee, is the son of the victim

171
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,590
of a 2019 news report known as the "Area 1 Carcinogenic Donut Incident."

172
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:27,470
The police reported that Lee, a gambling addict, committed the crime

173
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,240
 because he lost his income after the shop closed due to the erroneous news. 

174
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,720
 The victim was an anchor at the 'P' broadcast station 

175
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,870
 and is being treated in ICU. 
   

176
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,010
What?

177
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,880
Nothing.

178
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,740
This is Baek Hye Yeon from Media N Seoul.

179
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,570
Is this like a trade?

180
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,820
We don't do that here.

181
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,330
I switched companies.

182
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,940
I look forward to working with you!

183
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,430
People usually say, "I changed jobs."

184
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,030
What an odd creature.

185
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,520
Get to work.

186
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,140
Thank you.

187
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,020
Thank you. Hello.

188
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,240
It's too long a story to explain.

189
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,790
But you're definitely Hye Ri.

190
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,100
   

191
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,800
Wow.

192
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,630
Wow.

193
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:55,770
Anyway, you know, I'm your sunbae

194
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,730
by a lot of years.

195
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,720
Also...

196
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,590
it's top secret that I worked in the parking lot.

197
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:13,590
Totally top... top secret.

198
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,300
Okay?

199
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,600
Okay.

200
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,960
I look forward to working with you.

201
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,780
Welcome to PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow.

202
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,770
I'm Baek Hye Yeon from Media N Seoul, a future created by the media.

203
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,170
Thanks for having me, Sunbaenim.

204
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,880
How can she say goodbye like this?

205
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,940
How can she just change companies without a word?

206
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,970
Hey, she's not picking up my calls at all.

207
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,940
She texted me saying, "Oppa, I'm going to PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow."

208
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,580
"Thank you so much for everything."

209
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,830
At least she texted you. She didn't reply to me at all.

210
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,700
Ju Yeon, did she say anything to you?

211
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,880
She did, right?

212
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,900
What?

213
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,120
From Hye Yeon.

214
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,260
What did she say to you?

215
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,910
- I– 
 - What did she say?

216
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,370
I...

217
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,220
feel weird.

218
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,790
What are you talking about?

219
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,870
We asked you if you've heard from Baek Hye Yeon.

220
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,050
Why are you explaining your feelings?

221
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,840
Ju Yeon, you're not sad, are you?

222
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,480
No, I'm not sad...

223
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,170
It just...

224
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,670
doesn't matter to me if Hye Yeon is here or not.

225
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,750
I can reach out and see her anytime.

226
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,630
I'll just call...

227
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,520
   

228
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,870
- Hello... 
 -  The person you are calling is not available. 

229
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,700
 Please leave a message after the beep. 

230
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,290
Maybe she's on-air.

231
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,230
She started today. Do you think she's on-air?

232
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,390
It went to voicemail in three seconds–

233
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,340
Ju Yeon, going to voicemail in three seconds

234
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,340
is called being blocked in our industry.

235
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,110
- "Blocked"? 
 - Blocked.

236
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,460
I know that much.

237
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,420
Unnie, what is going on? 
    

238
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,750
Can't you tell?

239
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,640
Are they convincing Deputy Jung to do the news?

240
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,780
Probably.

241
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,170
But why does it look to me like they're bullying him?

242
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,830
 Because it is bullying. 

243
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,310
 What? 

244
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,960
Geez, he won't take it when it's given to him?

245
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,930
He's acting like someone died due to him.

246
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,950
Geez.

247
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,850
Oppa.

248
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,370
Jeon Jae Yong is doing better.

249
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
He woke up and moved his eyes. It's true.

250
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,430
Okay.

251
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,740
It wasn't your fault.

252
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,150
No.

253
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,420
It feels like it was all my fault.

254
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,890
No, it really wasn't.

255
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,060
Also, this is a broadcast station.

256
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,690
Things must continue whether someone dies or not.

257
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,890
I know it's brutal, but you're the only one who can do it.

258
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,490
Because you're trained. So–

259
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,050
I know.

260
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,980
I'm the only person who can do the news right now.

261
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,630
I know that I need to do it.

262
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,280
Fine. I know that's how a broadcast station is, Su Jeong. But...

263
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,190
I can't do it.

264
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,720
I really can't do it.

265
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,870
I don't know why I feel this way.

266
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,360
I understand everything with my head.

267
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,120
I get it, but why can't I do it?

268
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,780
Why can't I, Su Jeong?

269
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,490
 Apparently, Hyung went inside to hide and shut the door. 

270
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,070
Go after him.

271
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,000
No one's able to convince him.

272
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Also, we will have an empty desk starting today.

273
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,640
- If you– 
 - What's the point? He wants to be alone.

274
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,460
- What do you mean? 
 - Also...

275
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,520
I'm a girlfriend who respects his need for time.

276
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,420
Respect or whatever. For him...

277
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,830
He needs you, Sunbae.

278
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,720
He locked the door. No one can go in. Who else could go in?

279
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,830
Why are you trying to drag out someone who's locked himself in?

280
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,610
They want photocopies.

281
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,690
Right now.

282
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,460
Who?

283
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,980
Sunbaenims.

284
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,240
What? That's not right.

285
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,580
I heard them asking you.

286
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,240
I need to... prepare for the news, and you're free.

287
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,800
You're not doing anything.

288
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,590
People who have nothing to do should take on these things, right?

289
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,710
Look, I'm subbing for the 7 o'clock news.

290
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,420
You're just a sub.

291
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm the regular.

292
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,800
Whom do you think is busier?

293
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,820
I think the sub is busier.

294
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,890
I was so busy when I subbed. Right, Sunbaenim?

295
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,860
Excuse me. Who are you?

296
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,920
I'm Baek Hye Yeon, who newly joined

297
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,230
PPS of joy to create a new tomorrow from Media N Seoul, the media of the future.

298
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,440
Nice to meet you.

299
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,810
- I'm– 
 - I know you.

300
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,190
Shim Jin Hwa, right?

301
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,610
You know me?

302
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,830
Of course.

303
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,920
You were so famous at our company. No, my ex-company.

304
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,190
Me?

305
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,360
Why?

306
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,620
For being terrible.

307
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,210
For being so terrible.

308
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,530
Hey, how dare you say I'm awful?

309
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,950
Who do you think you are?

310
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,350
Are you classless, too?

311
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,230
Darn it. Announcers have no class these days.

312
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,340
Just so you know,

313
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:49,180
I may lack class, but I enunciate better than you.

314
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,580
Announcers must pronounce well.

315
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,070
How come they keep calling?

316
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,910
She's right.

317
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,030
So will you apologize?

318
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,680
For trampling on my dream and her dreams with your pronunciation.

319
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,240
Will you apologize... for everyone's dream here?

320
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,360
Will you apologize?

321
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,000
 Why, why, why did you call me? 

322
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,540
Hey, how come you don't pick up?

323
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,590
Get to the point.

324
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,410
 Do you want to meet today? 

325
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,000
 I broke up with Kim Yeon Ji. 

326
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,060
Really?

327
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,190
Yes, let's meet.

328
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,630
I'll show you a fun time.

329
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,720
But Choi Soo Hyeon.

330
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,710
I really didn't have that much fun when we met up.

331
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,020
Come to your senses, Choi Soo Hyeon.

332
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,160
Why is that? You've been hanging out with me this whole time.

333
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,960
In that case, screw you!

334
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,390
   

335
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,810
Hello, Sunbaenim.

336
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,670
Oh, hi.

337
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,350
Where are you headed?

338
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,810
Are you still here doing this?

339
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,330
Who is this?

340
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:34,050
Our team couldn't even have a meeting today because you were all swarming here.

341
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,140
We had a lot to discuss with our deputy today.

342
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,900
Our youngest must have lost it after too much work.

343
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,510
Have you been day drinking?

344
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,810
No, I'm not drunk.

345
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,720
PD, you get drunk and cause trouble.

346
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,400
- Hey, let's go. 
 - PD!

347
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,970
I haven't been able to ask the deputy anything.

348
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,670
Hello, Press Director. Hello, Team Leader.

349
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,830
The Director of the Culture and Education Department is here.

350
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,630
I wonder why.

351
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,390
I'm here because I heard Jung Hyun Oh is refusing to do the news

352
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,050
with only an hour left till the 9 p.m. news.

353
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,780
No.

354
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,070
I should say I'm doing a favor by being here.

355
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,320
Hey, what can you possibly do?

356
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,150
I can...

357
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,110
open the door, like this.

358
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,040
But Press Director and Team Leader,

359
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,300
if I convince Jung Hyun Oh, what will you do for me?

360
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,920
You...

361
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,690
How dare you fight for crumbs right now?

362
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,780
Of course, everyone works to survive.

363
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,800
Team Leader, I'd like to return to "Issue-In."

364
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,660
Press Director...

365
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:03,370
you'd better not forget my contribution to this.

366
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,350
Do you understand?

367
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,000
What? She went in? Ju Eun Ho went in?

368
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,580
Yes, she went in.

369
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,400
What? Are they back together?

370
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,010
- I know, right? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

371
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,950
Well...

372
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,910
I'm not trying to interrupt your alone time.

373
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,600
I told you. If you don't come out when you should, I'll come get you.

374
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,370
So just in case...

375
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,170
Jung Hyun Oh.

376
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,770
You're scared.

377
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,600
I was so scared.

378
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,800
You were very scared, weren't you?

379
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,300
Yes.

380
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,620
I thought someone might have died due to me.

381
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,060
No, it wasn't because of you, Hyun Oh.

382
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,730
They say...

383
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,990
Yes?

384
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,690
If a misfortune can turn into a gem...

385
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,760
Yes.

386
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,690
how would this ever become a gem?

387
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,450
Because...

388
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,700
you'll be doing the 9 o'clock news.

389
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,420
No.

390
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,890
I don't think I can do it.

391
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,830
I really don't think I can do it.

392
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,210
Sitting in the place of a person who got hurt for me and delivering the news...

393
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,840
If you do a good job, Jeon Jae Yong can return and take the baton.

394
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,860
You keep it going.

395
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,570
"Keep it going"?

396
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,630
Yes.

397
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,290
Just like how Jeon Jae Yong rescued you,

398
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,190
you save Jeon Jae Yong now.

399
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,460
Will you do that?

400
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,700
What's going on? What did he say?

401
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,890
Will he do it?

402
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,580
What did he say? Is he doing it?

403
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,230
Eun Ho.

404
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,360
Will he do it or not?

405
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,130
He will do it.

406
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,510
He will do it. First, the headline...

407
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,320
But why are you crying?

408
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,490
I was scared.

409
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,660
I was really scared, too.

410
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,350
 What about his wardrobe? I can bring some from our end. 

411
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,950
 Geez! Please! Shut it. 

412
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,210
 Excuse me. 

413
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,680
Thank you.

414
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,820
Hello, Viewers.

415
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,740
This is PPS 9 o'clock news, Tuesday, July 2.

416
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,400
Cho Jung Hyuk, of the Special Counsel Team,

417
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,380
is considering an arrest warrant after completing two rounds

418
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,350
of questioning Governor Kim Jin Ho regarding the allegations.

419
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:33,070
 They plan to summon Park Min Su, Director of Economic Development, who provided 

420
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,580
 crucial information to Governor Kim, 

421
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,000
 - in a report by Kim Yu Jin.  
 - I knew he'd be good.

422
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,300
   

423
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,200
 Great job, Sunbaenim. 

424
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,910
 Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

425
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,860
Don't mention it.

426
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,870
- Good job. 
 - Good job.

427
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,640
Great work.

428
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,570
You know, Eun Ho cried a lot earlier.

429
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,910
She said she was scared, too.

430
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,000
How is Jeon Jae Yong?

431
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,570
Jae Yong's awake. He has been talking a lot.

432
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,300
Don't worry about him.

433
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,020
Oh, they want us to have a company dinner.

434
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,010
But you'd better go see Eun Ho first, okay?

435
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,140
Yes, I will.

436
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,160
All right.

437
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,210
Hey, so are you guys back together?

438
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,060
Yes. That's where we're at, Sunbae.

439
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,100
Wow, legendary.

440
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,050
You dated, broke up, flipped out, and got back together again.

441
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,970
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh.

442
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,700
Man...

443
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,320
You did well today.

444
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,120
That's how I roll.

445
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,270
I've always been good.

446
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,960
Give me a freaking break.

447
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,140
Why did you cry?

448
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,970
I was scared, too.

449
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,580
Gosh.

450
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
What are you scared of?

451
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,340
That you might be hurting.

452
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,980
That you might be hurting way more than I thought.

453
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,660
Do that again.

454
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,930
Again!

455
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,260
Enough!

456
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,050
Again, again!

457
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,070
Hyun Oh, you were so cool.

458
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,330
Was I ever not cool?

459
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,900
Yes.

460
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,510
What?

461
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,950
Want me to put this on you?

462
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,440
But this is your mom's.

463
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,010
Yes.

464
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,370
I had found an identical one so I bought it.

465
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,920
What?

466
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,830
Actually, before you bought me one, I had found an identical one.

467
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,020
So I bought it.

468
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,140
What did you say?

469
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,390
But you said you bought it in Japan.

470
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,990
You bought it in Japan, too?

471
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,320
No, from Namdaemun Market.

472
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,770
What?

473
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,860
Hey! I...

474
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,580
It was really...

475
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,580
It was really expensive!

476
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,990
That's not important.

477
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,730
I'm not the type to obsess over money, but...

478
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,050
Where did you keep this?

479
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,700
It's been stashed somewhere.

480
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,550
Why?

481
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,260
Your mom's was from Namdaemun, too.

482
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,770
Then... this is closer to your mom's?

483
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,090
No, Eun Ho.

484
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,380
The one you got is way closer. Yes, definitely.

485
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,830
Turn around.

486
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,020
Let me put it on you. You wear it.

487
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,180
Here.

488
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,870
Hey, Hyun Oh.

489
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,980
Yes?

490
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,670
I've never shared a matching couple's necklace

491
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:00,960
with my boyfriend and my boyfriend's mom.

492
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,350
Me, too. It's my first time, too.

493
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,980
It's quite interesting.

494
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,760
I think it's quite interesting, too, Ju Eun Ho.

495
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:19,170
♫  When you're struggling, I won't let you be lonely  ♫

496
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:27,050
♫  Like the skies, I'll widely embrace you  ♫

497
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:32,720
♫  When you're tired, and you want my heart  ♫

498
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,380
♫  Like the bright sunshine, I'll warmly shine on you  ♫

499
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,510
 Ju Yeon, do you know? 

500
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,120
 Being alive is a good thing. 

501
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,470
 It's a really, really good thing. 

502
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,110
 So be thankful 

503
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,440
 that Ju Yeon, you're alive.

♫  We will be happy  ♫

513
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,430
Se Yeon, you're here.

514
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,970
Mom.

515
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,560
I'm Ju Yeon.

516
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,560
Ju Yeon, you're here.

517
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,050
 Did you have a tough day? 

518
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,030
Where's your girlfriend who looks like a bunny rabbit?

519
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,250
Isn't she cuter than a bunny?

520
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,420
She was so pretty.

521
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,510
Mom.

522
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,400
To be alive...

523
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,430
is a good thing.

524
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,720
So...

525
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,150
don't be sick.

526
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,880
I'm sorry...

527
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,810
I invited Hyung to my commission ceremony.

528
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,780
I promise not to do that in the next life.

529
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,270
Mom, please don't be sick.

530
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:26,740
♫  Today and tomorrow, I'll be in your background  ♫

♫  Don't worry about a thing  ♫

539
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,150
♫  I'll be by your side  ♫

540
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,310
   

541
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,510
I think I'm a little happy.

542
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,800
Will you give me choco? Choco choco? Choco?

543
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,100
Choco choco! Choco choco!

544
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,370
Geez!

545
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,370
Hurry and give it to me. Hurry.

546
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,700
Geez.

547
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,550
Straw too. Straw.

548
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,680
Straw too. Here, here.

549
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,150
Stick it in. Stick it in.

550
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,820
Yummy. Yum yum.

551
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,380
Do you have any banana milk?

552
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,930
Choco is best mixed with banana.

553
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,150
Banana, banana. I think I'll feel unhappy without banana milk.

554
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,120
Got it. Let me go get it. All good?

555
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,570
Okay.

556
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,870
I got banana milk so stop torturing her.

557
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,080
Banana? Banana, banana.

558
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,580
I love bananas.

559
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,530
Banana, for me, banana.

560
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,700
Tasty, tasty.

561
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,900
So Hyun Oh, I heard you did a great job on the news.

562
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,320
Of course.

563
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,390
That's not a seat for those who don't do a good job.

564
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,970
That must mean that's your seat now.

565
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:03,000
Press Director Soh? Transitioning is his talent.

566
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,670
No.

567
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,590
Dining and dashing is his talent.

568
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:11,180
I told him no way in heck so don't worry.

569
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,680
All good?

570
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,240
"No, Hyun Oh, you're a better fit for that role."

571
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,570
I wish I could say that to be a bigger person, but no.

572
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,950
You be the bigger person. I'm not interested in that.

573
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,800
I love being the face of the company. Therefore, I will keep that seat.

574
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,270
- Hey, Jae Yong. 
 - What?

575
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,800
As Team Leader of the Announcer Department, do you think he should stay?

576
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,270
- Is that what you want to say? 
 - No.

577
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,740
I was going to ask you if I can go home now.

578
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,930
That's what I wanted to say.

579
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,750
No. No way. You need to stay with me.

580
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,690
Seriously!

581
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,790
I've been by your side since yesterday!

582
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,630
Sure.

583
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,570
In that case, you stay, Ju Eun Ho.

584
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,480
No, I have the 7 o'clock news. I can't.

585
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,190
Oh, yes? Then Jung Hyun Oh, you stay.

586
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,100
No. I need to do the 9 o'clock news until you return.

587
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,640
Oh, is that right? Then...

588
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,240
Isn't today the weekend?

589
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,860
Darn it.

590
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,810
Darn it!

591
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:44,980
 What did you say, Ju Yeon? 

592
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,790
I'd like to prepare to audition for the 8 p.m. news.

593
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,270
- Why? 
 - Well...

594
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,300
I've gotten a couple of offers to audition.

595
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,780
Yes, but you said no each time, didn't you?

596
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,670
But I want to do it now.

597
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,830
Thank you, Ju Yeon. Thank you so much.

598
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,640
Are you that happy, Sir?

599
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,680
Of course! This is great!

600
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,390
This is the best news I've heard in a long time.

601
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,360
Now that Baek Hye Yeon is gone...

602
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,310
After Hye Yeon left...

603
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,470
I had been down a bit.

604
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,490
Gosh, that girl.

605
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,190
So cold, she's so cold.

606
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,560
How could she just throw her resignation and walk away?

607
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,750
She doesn't even keep in touch.

608
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:47,660
Did Hye Yeon block your call, too, Sir?

609
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,440
"Block"?

610
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,760
No, I talked to her yesterday.

611
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,490
You just said you don't stay in touch.

612
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,540
I was talking about today. There's no word today.

613
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,540
   

614
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,590
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

615
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,770
Oh, PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow, gives out the newest-model laptops.

616
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:49,610
Media N Seoul, a future created by media, used shoddy desktops.

617
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,390
I'm glad I moved over.

618
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,740
Good job, Past Self.

619
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,620
I compliment you. Impressive.

620
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,410
Hey, there.

621
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,690
Yes, Hye... Sunbaenim?

622
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,510
Phone, please.

623
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,160
 Baek Hye Yeon, did you block my number? 

624
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,790
Yes, Sunbae. Why?

625
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,660
- Why did you? 
 -  Sunbae, I'm allowed to block you. 

626
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,500
 It's quite common. 

627
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,010
Cutting off and blocking are necessary skills in our busy modern world, Sunbae.

628
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,010
Why was I the only one you blocked then?

629
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,040
 To forget you. 

630
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,200
 Listen, you said it doesn't make a difference if I'm there or not. 

631
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,570
 You said the world isn't ending so you don't care. 

632
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,140
So shouldn't I start forgetting you now?

633
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:49,210
I thought, shouldn't I give up on you now?

634
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,580
 That's why I blocked you. 

635
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,040
 Why? 

636
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,990
 Does it sting more than you imagined? 

637
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,190
Yes.

638
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,790
It stings a lot, Hye Yeon.

639
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,830
 Endure, Sunbae. 

640
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,770
That's my only option. What can you do?

641
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,760
It's not like you'll date me now.

642
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,200
That's true, but...

643
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,130
 Sunbae, you know what? I hope you're happy. 

644
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,030
Well, let's eat together sometime.

645
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,310
But if I get a boyfriend, I can't.

646
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,070
Because I know now.

647
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:31,360
A person has only one heart.

648
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,600
 Anyway, that's all, Sunbae. 

649
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,660
 Please be happy. 

650
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,960
 I hope we will meet again. 

651
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,530
 But if I get a boyfriend, I can't see you. 

652
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,120
 Because I'm a woman of integrity. 

653
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,470
 I have newfound integrity. 

654
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,430
 It just worked out that way. 

655
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:58,670
 I think I'm quite popular here so I'll look around here. 

656
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:03,160
 Well, if you're interested, I could consider it 

657
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,520
 but not much room for rethinking. It's not too bad here. 

658
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:13,660
So you never had another personality again?

659
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,010
No. Hye Ri didn't come back.

660
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,330
Then the emotional issues you had, Eun Ho…

661
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:26,970
The emotional issues that caused your Dissociative Identity Disorder

662
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,590
have been resolved.

663
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:33,520
But Eun Ho,

664
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,340
if you face those emotional issues again,

665
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:43,420
there is a chance you will meet Hye Ri again.

666
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,080
But there's nothing to worry about,

667
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,040
and you can just get treated again.

668
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,810
But Doctor,

669
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,860
if I met Hye Ri again,

670
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,250
I think I would be happy to see her.

671
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,500
Is that right?

672
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:13,610
But for the sake of my future, we'd better not meet again.

673
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,530
Yes.

674
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,880
We will keep going, Eun Ho.

675
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,820
But Doctor...

676
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,610
I'd like to say bye to Hye Ri.

677
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,400
- Say bye? 
 - Yes.

678
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,700
You told me about good breakups.

679
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:38,700
If so, I would like to say a good farewell to Hye Ri.

680
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,460
That's a good idea.

681
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,210
Really?

682
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,740
Yes.

683
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,980
Eun Ho, your anxiety, worries,

684
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:54,770
guilt and unspoken gratitude,

685
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:59,880
I think it's a good idea to say bye to Hye Ri

686
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,480
to get closure.

687
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Then I'll say goodbye to Hye Ri by meeting people who knew her.

688
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,970
Hye Ri.

689
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:18,010
You were my first patient when I opened my clinic.

690
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,770
I may have been clumsy,

691
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:26,850
but I was happy that you were healed, Hye Ri.

692
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,680
Thank you.

693
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,260
Goodbye, Hye Ri.

694
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,860
Wow, what a mess.

695
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:56,260
I haven't seen such a group in a long time.

696
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,470
All right.

697
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,070
You all know Hye Ri.

698
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,870
I don't really know her.

699
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:12,780
I've arranged a meeting to say goodbye to Hye Ri today.

700
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,090
What's this nonsense?

701
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:20,600
So I invited everyone who knew Hye Ri

702
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,250
to say "goodbye" and "farewell."

703
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,870
It's time for us to say goodbye.

704
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,840
Yes, speak, Min Yeong.

705
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,440
When will you serve food?

706
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,610
If you can each share a word with me since you know Hye Ri,

707
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,870
that would be amazing.

708
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,720
Because this moment...

709
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,450
Unnies, I don't think she's quite right in the head.

710
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:51,500
- What is she saying? Personality? Goodbye? 
 - Don't you miss Hye Ri?

711
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,830
I'm a little stuck here.

712
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,080
- Why are we doing this in our house? 
 - Through all of you...

713
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,640
- It is a little weird to do this here. 
 - What are your thoughts?

714
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,800
- No. 
 - What do you think?

715
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,900
- What do you think about how I feel? 
 - I think that is cute.

716
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,930
What did you say?

717
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,890
"That"?

718
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:22,990
Who said it? "That"? "That"? Who was that?

719
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,540
- Who— 
 - Look at me, look at me.

720
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,230
Come to. Stop. Breathe.

721
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,930
Breathe.

722
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,080
Calm down.

723
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,810
- Dip one for me. 
 - Honey.

724
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,850
Sweet and sour pork?

725
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,480
So? What do you want to say to Hye Ri?

726
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,360
Are you talking to me?

727
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,850
I've never met her. I swear.

728
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:52,340
Crap. Just do it, Man.

729
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,280
Goodbye.

730
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,110
Next, you.

731
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,720
You think I met her?

732
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,320
Okay.

733
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,120
And you?

734
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,480
Hye Ri.

735
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,450
Thank you for breaking up with Ju Yeon.

736
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,890
Well, it's not like he and I will be together,

737
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:25,370
but how should I say, you opened the door slightly to our future.

738
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,400
Sunbaenim, let's play dodgeball when you're free some time.

739
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,110
I'm really good at dodgeball.

740
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,760
Next.

741
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,960
Kang Ju Yeon.

742
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,520
Hey, don't smile.

743
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,130
Why are you smiling at only him?

744
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,450
Kang Ju Yeon, how about you?

745
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,040
What to say to Hye Ri...

746
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,250
It's ₩312,000 for the mirror.

747
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,360
That's my money.

748
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,730
Did she owe you money?

749
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:11,600
No, I'm joking.

750
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,770
I will be happy, Hye Ri.

751
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:26,720
Yes. Please be happy, Kang Ju Yeon.

752
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,970
And...

753
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:34,900
I had some great times with Hye Ri,

754
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,970
full of first-time experiences.

755
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:44,950
Thank you for being my first for everything.

756
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:52,930
Also, you demonstrated being alive is a good thing.

757
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:59,430
For making me and my mom recognize that,

758
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,720
I thank you, Hye Ri.

759
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,470
- Later... 
 - No!

760
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,010
There's no later, Ju Yeon.

761
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,130
We should go, Eun Ho.

762
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:20,450
The one you like the most... No, the one you like more than Ju Yeon...

763
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,900
The next person.

764
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,560
Okay.

765
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,430
Kim Min Yeong, talk to me.

766
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,700
This is so delicious.

767
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,890
Not to your food, talk to me.

768
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,680
Did you make this or order this?

769
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,370
I ordered it.

770
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:55,030
So can you please talk to Hye Ri?

771
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,270
So like a final goodbye?

772
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:01,160
Would you?

773
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,980
Next time, also order dumplings, Hye Ri.

774
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,330
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

775
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,600
Boiled dumplings, not fried dumplings.

776
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,030
Hey, didn't you eat today? Is this your first meal?

777
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,530
You know what?

778
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,760
I don't want to say goodbye to Ju Hye Ri.

779
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,220
I've never parted ways with Ju Hye Ri, and I don't need to.

780
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,930
Parting between friends is cutting them off.

781
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,260
But I didn't cut Ju Hye Ri off.

782
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,670
So I can't say goodbye, Hye Ri.

783
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,400
Hey.

784
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,130
What? Will you order me boiled dumplings now?

785
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:05,720
No.

786
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,900
You're so cool.

787
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,920
You just found that out?

788
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:17,780
I'm Ju Eun Ho. Want to be friends?

789
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,330
You told me to call you Unnie last time.

790
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,240
You're an exception.

791
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,630
Do you have my number?

792
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,380
Not yet.

793
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,330
Tell me.

794
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,790
Eun Ho.

795
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:55,720
Marry me.

796
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,750
Get married, Hyun Oh? I don't believe...

797
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,320
What did you say?

798
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:22,710
Marry me. I think I will marry you, Ju Eun Ho.

799
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,780
I'll do it. Totally! I'll do it, yes!

800
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,090
That...

801
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,430
He's marrying that weird girl?

802
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,250
U-Unnie!

803
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:04,910
This is so cringe. I can't stand it. Goosebumps...

804
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,980
It's not like I'm having a good time.

805
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,030
Unnie's wish came true!

806
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,410
It is good news, but...

807
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:22,310
   

808
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,860
 - Hyun Oh. 
 - Yes. 

809
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:29,260
 Why do you think we love someone? 

810
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,880
 Looking at it in a row like this, it's really scary. 

811
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:41,560
 I'll smoke a bunch when I get to Hell. 

812
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,920
 But Unnies, you know what? 

813
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,420
 I'll follow you to Hell if you end up there. 

814
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,580
 Why do you think you'd end up in Heaven? 

815
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,330
Because I'm the prettiest.

816
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,660
Crazy witch.

817
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,460
 To share the final moments of our lives together. 

818
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,490
Unnie.

819
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,280
What?

820
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,020
The girl Hyun Oh brought home, do you like her?

821
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,120
I like her.

822
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,630
I like her a lot.

823
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,790
Why do you like her?

824
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:46,310
Because my Hyun Oh likes her.

825
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,600
Unnie.

826
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,350
What?

827
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:01,630
I like her even more since you say you like her.

828
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,260
I lived a full life.

829
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,820
I lived a full life, and I was never lonely.

830
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,570
I surely did.

831
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,180
 At that final moment... 

832
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,510
 so we're not lonely. 

833
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,120
 Hye Jeong, isn't this yours? 

834
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,880
 It was on the ground over there. You almost lost it. 

835
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,850
 Thank you. 

836
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,140
 The court submitted the requested materials to the prosecution 

837
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,300
 within a week of the trial. 

838
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:59,700
 However, the key evidence, former Chief Justice Cho's phone, was excluded. 

839
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,500
 - The court said the data on the phone was erased...  
 - Hye Jeong, clear off Table 3.

840
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,500
 - saying it was irrecoverable.  
 - Yes, yes.

841
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,310
 The opposition party questioned the court's explanation and possible evidence tampering... 

842
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,900
 To this, the ruling party has expressed a solemn stance. 

843
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:18,040
 The legal professionals expressed concerns that this incident 

844
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,400
 might damage the people's trust in the law. 

845
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,600
 To have one person on my team by my side until that moment. 

846
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:42,060
Hey, I will go see Mom next week. You want to go with me?

847
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:47,960
Why bother seeing the lady who abandoned us?

848
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,660
Sure, I'll go alone then.

849
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:57,440
Let's go together, Oppa.

850
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,780
Honestly,

851
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:10,120
I miss her, too.

852
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,780
What did you say?

853
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,970
Team Leader.

854
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,140
We live in an era of girl love.

855
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,680
Wow.

856
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,720
Girl love follows boy love.

857
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:46,910
Rather than a show like that, I prefer a more bouncy, energetic one.

858
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:51,250
Catch all kinds of fish and do stuff like that.

859
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,270
That's why I came here,

860
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,150
to PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow.

861
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,620
That one already has a female MC.

862
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:04,190
That's why I said we live in an era of girl love.

863
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,640
Will you please leave?

864
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,650
Sure, Team Leader. I'll leave.

865
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,670
Wait a second.

866
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:21,900
Yes, Team Leader?

867
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:27,600
You know, I used to think Eun Ho was crap until recently.

868
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:31,520
Why are you bringing up Ju Eun Ho right now?

869
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,210
But she's not.

870
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,510
She was just crap-colored curry.

871
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:40,680
The real dung is you.

872
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,500
You're curry-colored crap!

873
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,570
I'm serious.

874
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:49,400
- Character assassination, first offence. 
 - "First character assassination"?

875
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,370
You attacked me first!

876
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,940
How did I attack you?

877
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,710
Girl love! Girl love!

878
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,300
Girl!

879
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,000
Love!

880
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,620
 That's why we fight fiercely, get angry, 

881
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:13,500
 and hate on each other, but we endure it. 

882
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,300
"Minister Jo Joon Yeong of Science and Communication"

883
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,800
"announced an innovation strategy for future industry development."

884
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:27,660
"The core strategy includes leveraging AI for the medical and construction fields."

885
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:47,230
   

886
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,920
Hello—

887
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:10,910
 Because we think to ourselves, this may turn into love someday. 

888
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,990
 But 

889
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:23,630
 in that process, 

890
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,470
 it really turns into love. 

891
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,630
 Really? 

892
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,100
 Yes, really. 

893
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,630
Hyun Oh.

894
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,900
Yes? What?

895
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:00,850
Shall we kiss?

896
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,390
I don't want to.

897
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,580
You...

898
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:13,310
You're supposed to kiss at a place like this.

899
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
I really don't want to.

900
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,030
Just do it.

901
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:29,320
Can't you close your eyes?

902
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:35,060
I don't want to. I really love your face as you come closer to me.

903
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:12,000
 In the end, to enjoy the same things and become happy together... 

904
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,960
 That's why we love. 

905
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,290
 We give our all. 

906
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,080
 We do.

 Yes, of course.
