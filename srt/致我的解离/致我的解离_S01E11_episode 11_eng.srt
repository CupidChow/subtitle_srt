1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,850
   

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,240
   

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,700
   

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,930
   

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,190
   

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:30,600


7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,970
   

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,100
   

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,210
So? What do I smell like?

10
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,150
One-sixth of your fabric softener, one-sixth of your shampoo.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,830
And?

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,960
One-sixth of where you were yesterday, one-sixth of the hand cream you use.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,310
I don't use hand cream.

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:10,260
One-sixth of the drink you just had, one-sixth of the incense you use at home.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,250
I don't burn incense either.

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,990
That's what you smell like.

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,570
You know, I love that smell, Hyun Oh.

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,860
 Your smell. 

19
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,560
 I missed it so much. 

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,640
 You have no idea. 

21
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,220
 Honestly, I missed everything. 

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,640
 Your face... 

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,050
 your voice... 

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,230
 How long has it been since you did laundry? 

25
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,400
 I'm only two days behind. 

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,070
 The weird thing is you're so messy, but you change your clothes every day. 

27
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,850
 Am I supposed to change every other day then? 

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,850
 Your fingers, your hair... 

29
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,310
 Why? What? 

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,650
 N-Nothing. Anyway, so... so... 

31
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,080
 Do some people not change clothes daily? 

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,250
 Yes. Plenty. 

33
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,280
 Every other day, once every three days... 

34
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,410
 Your fingernails, 

35
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,730
 your toenails... 

36
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,330
 Oh, is that so? 

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,040
 Anyway, wash clothes after wearing them 3-4 times. 

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,020
 Even if you wash them daily, they won't look any cleaner. 

39
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,210
 So everything about you... 

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,850
 I don't know how I managed to live without it. 

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,940
 I missed it. 

42
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,820
 Hyun Oh. 

43
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,500
I missed you.

44
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,340
Even though you saw me every day?

45
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,850
Yes.

46
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,440
Although I've seen you at work daily.

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,670
Me, too.

48
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,780
I did miss you every day.

49
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,830
 I missed you. 

50
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,310
 I really, really missed you. 

51
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,340
 Hi, Ju Eun Ho. 

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,140
 I'm here to listen to your story. 

53
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,980
 What story? 

54
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,590
 Just everything about you. 

55
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,420
 Could you... 

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,920
 tell me everything? 

57
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,380
 I have a younger sister. 

58
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,350
 She left because of me. 

59
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,140
 And? 

60
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,730
 Because of the guilt, 

61
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,520
 I was in a lot of pain. 

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,320
 I see. 

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,900
 Yes. 

64
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,090
 Then... 

65
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,550
 why did you work in the parking lot? 

66
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,620
 Because... 

67
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,480
 it was Hye Ri's dream. 

68
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,810
 I was envious of her because she seemed happy 

69
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,660
 so I wanted to try living her life. 

70
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,820
 I wanted to understand her life. 

71
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,350
 Why she... 

72
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,060
 seemed happy. 

73
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,190
 And? Did you find out? 

74
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,150
 Did you find out... 

75
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,020
 how you become happy? 

76
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,750
 Then... 

77
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,000
 can you tell me? 

78
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,260
 What does it mean to be happy? 

79
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,120
 Hye Ri, 

80
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,480
 I found out why you were happy. 

81
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,740
 So... 

82
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,670
 to be happy means.... 

83
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,360
 To be happy means... 

84
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,020
What's wrong?

85
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,670
Did you have a dream?

86
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,420
It's okay.

87
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,280
I'm here.

88
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,510
 It was nothing much. 

89
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,450
 My happiness is being myself with... 

90
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,370
 the person I love. 

91
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,700
   

92
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,840
   

93
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,150
Oppa,

94
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,800
do you know that Kang Ju Yeon has been acting weird?

95
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,040
I do.

96
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,470
He's acting so weird.

97
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,610
You really do notice?

98
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,180
I mean, in the cafeteria yesterday...

99
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,520
he cried while eating.

100
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,510
What?

101
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,030
Why?

102
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,450
 Because the pepper was spicy. 

103
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,620
 You know, I ran into him in the emergency stairwell earlier, and he was crying. 

104
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,560
"The stairwell"?

105
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,720
   

106
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,740
 Because he didn't want to be out of breath, but he was? 

107
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,520
It's so weird.

108
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,280
- Yes, weird. 
 - What is he so sad about?

109
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Hey. He's not sad. He's just crazy.

110
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,620
 No, that's not it! 

111
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,840
Aigoo, Guys. Please get back to work.

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,120
This is not a playground.

113
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,630
He's crying again.

114
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,270
What is he so sad about this time?

115
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,320
Oppa.

116
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,060
Online articles these days...

117
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,600
can be really sad.

118
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,230
Right.

119
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,970
It's a dangerous world out there.

120
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,390
Geez, how come you two look more dangerous to me?

121
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,870
 Then... 

122
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,770
 It means... 

123
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,990
 And... 

124
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,700
Kang Ju Yeon, Ju Hye Ri is not here today again.

125
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,410
Oh?

126
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,410
What?

127
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,230
You know, I have certainty now.

128
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,380
 Certainty in what? 

129
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,110
 You are certainly crazy. 

130
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,200
 I'm not "you." I'm your "unnie." 

131
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm 37 years old.

132
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,900
Dissociative Identity... what?

133
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,590
Yes. I was sick, not crazy.

134
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,570
So... you... had two personalities?

135
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,420
That's right. I was sick.

136
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,810
You didn't lose your memory. It was a different identity.

137
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,950
That's right. This unnie went through a lot.

138
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,150
 There's only one thing I truly understand. 

139
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,920
 What is it? 

140
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,050
That you're 37.

141
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,070
That's right. You really didn't look 28.

142
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,100
I'm quite insightful about those things.

143
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,230
And no matter how I lookâ€”

144
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,190
Min Yeong, people tell me that I look young.

145
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,030
 Okay, 31. 

146
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,350
 I've heard 25, Min Yeong. 

147
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,060
 So... 

148
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,120
 So what? 

149
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,660
Could you call me "Unnie"?

150
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,140
No.

151
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,180
 When you started, 

152
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,750
 I told you I was older than you, but you spoke informally to me. 

153
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,710
 That's right. 

154
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,640
 Do you remember that? 

155
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,870
 Well, roughly, but... 

156
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,340
Are you going to stop coming here now?

157
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Yes, I can't anymore.

158
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,510
But you were a little bored without me, weren't you?

159
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,830
Not a little, a lot.

160
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,270
I thought of you more than Kang Ju Yeon.

161
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,080
Liar.

162
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,010
If I had thought of Kang Ju Yeon, I wouldn't have come to you first.

163
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,890
Liar.

164
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,620
During the time I spent with you,

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,680
I was very happy.

166
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,860
Actually, I don't have any friends.

167
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,050
Hey, why wouldn't a famous announcer have any friends?

168
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,830
You must have many more cooler friends than I am.

169
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,080
You don't pick friends because they're cool.

170
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,730
You just pick them, unconditionally.

171
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,180
You blend with the people you connect with.

172
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,240
Hey.

173
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,590
You surely sound like you're 37.

174
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,180
That's why, please call me "Unnie" from now on.

175
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,460
You're more old-fashioned than I thought.

176
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,090
How did you know? My hoobaes call me an oldie all the time.

177
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,440
Among the oldies I know,

178
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,140
you're my favorite.

179
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,890
 When is your teacher certification exam? 

180
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,760
 Why do you ask? 

181
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,910
 So I can cheer you on. 

182
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,060
 Why not? I'm good at cheering. 

183
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,870
Hye Ri.

184
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,190
Are you coming to work again?

185
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,970
No. I just came to say hi to Min Yeong.

186
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,510
I see.

187
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,820
Now I need to live as Eun Ho from now on, not Hye Ri.

188
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,040
Right.

189
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,900
Yes, you're right.

190
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,040
Kang Ju Yeon.

191
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,600
Yes?

192
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,560
Do you know what a "good breakup" is?

193
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,570
What's good about a breakup?

194
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,570
I learned about it in therapy.

195
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,210
We all need good breakups.

196
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,500
Okay, but what's good about breakups?

197
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,820
There's no such thing, Hye Ri.

198
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,020
Yes, there is.

199
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,820
You spent plenty of time with that person so when you break up,

200
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,070
you take your time being sad.

201
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,330
You genuinely support each other

202
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,270
to bravely confront the breakup without avoiding it, then you say goodbye.

203
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,510
That's a "good" breakup.

204
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,010
Why are you telling me that?

205
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,770
Do you want to have a good breakup?

206
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,530
That's how I want to break up with you, Kang Ju Yeon.

207
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,670
Because Hye Ri...

208
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,830
must have really liked you, Kang Ju Yeon.

209
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,620
What do you think?

210
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,500
Keep going.

211
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,590
Team Leader, I am officially coming back to work starting today.

212
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,200
Hooray!

213
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,950
Hooray.

214
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,850
Is this company your living room?

215
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,100
You just come and go freely?

216
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,200
Geez, I used the vacation days I had saved.

217
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,920
Right. You did.

218
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,620
Hey!

219
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,460
If you had come back just a week later, I might never have seen you again!

220
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,310
But I came back!

221
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,570
Hooray!

222
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,710
 Hyungnim! 

223
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,750
Hyungnim! Open the door!

224
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,800
I saw something really fascinating!

225
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
Hyungnim, I saw something totally, totally amazing this morning!

226
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,920
Hey, don't open the door!

227
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,160
What did you see? What was it?

228
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,750
Did you see me?

229
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,520
Are you shocked that I'm back? Is that it?

230
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
No, seeing you wasn't the shocking thing.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,400
I was shocked to see you and Jung Hyun Oh holding handsâ€”

232
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
 E-Eun Ho? 

233
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,270
Sunbae, where do I go now?

234
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,260
It can be morning or evening shifts now. I'll do whatever you give me.

235
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,530
What should I do?

236
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,750
You can leave.

237
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,280
I can do the news.

238
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,870
Early morning is good too. If you want me here at 4 a.m., I can be here at 2 a.m.

239
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,540
Is there an opening? Did anyone quit?

240
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,200
I said to go.

241
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,190
- I will, but... 
 - I said, "Leave"!

242
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,450
Yes, Team Leader. I'll go right now.

243
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,190
Yes, Sir.

244
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,540
Hey!

245
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,300
Yes. Please speak, Team Leader.

246
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,550
You know...

247
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,070
as for Hyun Oh... he can start on Current News at Ten only next week.

248
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,300
What about it?

249
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm saying his seat will be next to yours for now.

250
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,040
Once he starts Current News at Ten, he switches his spot.

251
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,290
Until then, even if you're uncomfortable, justâ€”

252
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,200
Sunbae, what do you take me for?

253
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,790
I'm a laid-back person.

254
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,680
Aigoo! You're so laid-back that you disappeared for a month

255
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,390
because you heard your ex was getting married?

256
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,870
Aigoo. Good for you!

257
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,300
A good breakup?

258
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,660
Yes, a good breakup.

259
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,470
So you want to meet with Kang Ju Yeon?

260
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,460
Yes, for a good breakup.

261
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,220
Isn't that just a date?

262
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,870
No.

263
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,280
Why? I can't?

264
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,210
Should I not go?

265
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,170
No, you should go.

266
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,380
Oh, really?

267
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,910
Of course.

268
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,280
You know that I'm a good boyfriend, right?

269
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,430
You're okay before dating,

270
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,790
but once we're dating, you turn into a giant poop.

271
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,260
What are you two talking about?

272
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,180
Poop. Why?

273
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,280
"Poop"?

274
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,970
Maybe since I didn't use it a month.

275
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,060
Do you know the repair department's extension number?

276
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,090
Yes, I do.

277
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,190
Hey, do you know the extension number for the repair department?

278
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,400
It's 5574.

279
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,920
 The number you're calling does not exist... 

280
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,620
It says the number doesn't exist.

281
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,480
Then I don't know.

282
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,970
Darn.

283
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,660
I'm a little confused. Are you on good or bad terms?

284
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,420
Darn it.

285
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,080
H-Hello?

286
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,170
This isn't working.

287
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,710
I know the number. Do you want it?

288
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,160
It's 5573.

289
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,360
I knew you would know.

290
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,350
What? Are you back for real?

291
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,650
Would I be back for fake?

292
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,990
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

293
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,790
I'm okay.

294
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,580
Don't worry, Moon Ji On.

295
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,170
What about Hyung?

296
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,440
What about him?

297
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,870
How did it go with him?

298
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,970
It went well.

299
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,460
Gosh, I knew it would end up that way eventually.

300
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,720
- Speaking of, Ji On. 
 - What?

301
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,300
Call me "Noona" or "Sunbae."

302
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,620
Fine!

303
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,260
Eun Ho...

304
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,680
Noona.

305
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,140
Sunbae Eun Ho.

306
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,580
What is wrong with you?

307
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,870
 It's grossing me out since it's been a while, but I can get used to it. 

308
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,970
 I'll work on it. 

309
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,910
Hello, this is the Announcer Department.

310
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,680
My computer is broken.

311
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,580
I was on vacation and didn't turn it on for a month.

312
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,370
Yes.

313
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,720
   

314
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,930
Oh?

315
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,750
It's already fixed.

316
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,410
Thank you.

317
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,510
What?

318
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,300
Did your laptop magically get fixed while you were gone?

319
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,330
I take back calling you poop. My boyfriend is gold.

320
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,670
This oppa took your laptop,

321
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,890
fixed it and brought it back.

322
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,430
Oppa, when do you get off work?

323
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,490
I want to leave right now,

324
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,390
but I have so much work to do.

325
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,760
What?

326
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,900
What?

327
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,660
Why are you so pretty?

328
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
Me? Right now?

329
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,930
You're so pretty right now.

330
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,630
So let's run away together.

331
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,120
I can't. I have a meeting.

332
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,010
I can. I don't have a meeting. So let's run away.

333
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,930
Eun Ho.

334
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,960
If you're getting paid, you should put in the work.

335
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,570
Do you know how tough it is to run a company?

336
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,300
At times like this, you and I should beâ€”

337
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,480
Darn it.

338
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,630
What is this? Are we in high school or something?

339
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,340
Wow, did you do this in high school?

340
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,280
I studied so hard that I didn't dream of doing this.

341
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,370
And now you're making your 37-year-old boyfriend do this?

342
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,750
Isn't it fun?

343
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,890
But...

344
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,710
But what were you wearing when you snuck out?

345
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,700
What do you mean? I was wearing my clothes.

346
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,860
You're wearing a skirt though.

347
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,820
- And? 
 - Hey.

348
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,870
What if someone saw you climbing over this wearing that?

349
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,100
No one saw me. What the heck?

350
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,850
Geez, seriously.

351
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,130
And we shouldn't walk. We should run.

352
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,040
Why? Why do we have to run?

353
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,270
To feel like we're playing hooky.

354
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,270
Oh, so exciting!

355
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,650
You run fast!

356
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,270
 Pasta with shrimp meat and mushrooms? 

357
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,740
It was so good!

358
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,430
It was good, right?

359
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
What should I wear? What would be nice?

360
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,300
Are you changing clothes?

361
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,930
 Of course! I'm meeting up with Kang Ju Yeon. 

362
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,360
 Wouldn't it be better to wear clean clothes? 

363
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,030
 Maybe a dress? I'll look younger. 

364
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,560
 Kang Ju Yeon is a lot younger than me. I was so surprised. 

365
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,070
Hyun Oh, what do you think of this?

366
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,090
It's okay with me.

367
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,200
What is? Meeting Kang Ju Yeon?

368
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,310
Yes. I'm really fine, Eun Ho.

369
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,960
I know. You said you were.

370
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,210
Ever since I said I was going to see him, you've said you're fine a hundred times.

371
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,040
But it's a little...

372
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,770
late in the evening, you know.

373
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,330
It's 11 p.m.

374
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,350
And that dress is not it, don't you think?

375
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,100
We're meeting at 11 p.m. because that's when he finishes work.

376
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,440
And I want to wear this dress to look young.

377
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,570
Yes, you do look young. You're so pretty, my Eun Ho.

378
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,420
The best.

379
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,900
What are you doing?

380
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,980
It's really late. I'll drive you.

381
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,120
Kang Ju Yeon is picking me up.

382
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,850
He is?

383
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,800
Did you wait long?

384
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,310
No, I didn't wait at all.

385
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,090
Where should we go? Is anything open at this hour?

386
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,250
Yes. I looked it up.

387
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,650
Is the sushi not good?

388
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,360
No, well...

389
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,550
How should I say this? The rice is just so good

390
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,640
that I don't want the sashimi's taste to conceal the taste of the rice.

391
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Because if I really want to enjoy the taste of the rice,

392
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,670
the sashimi shouldn't be there.

393
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,740
Do you know this?

394
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:34,680
The meaning of "sushi" is sour rice seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt.

395
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,640
It would've been nice if you just said you wanted pork belly from the start.

396
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,170
But the list you brought didn't have a pork belly place.

397
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,180
Also, it's our last date today.

398
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,900
I thought pork belly was not right.

399
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,870
I see. Today is the end for us.

400
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,180
I'm so envious of Sunbaenim Jung Hyun Oh.

401
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,780
He must be so happy.

402
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,970
But right now, I'm thinking about only you, Kang Ju Yeon.

403
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,370
Hye Ri called me Ju Yeon, not Kang Ju Yeon.

404
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,660
Okay. Then right now, I'm thinking about only you, Ju Yeon.

405
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,700
   

406
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,350
I should drive you home. I'm sorry.

407
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,480
It's okay. You said you needed to go back to work.

408
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,800
They need it before tomorrow morning; it has to be done right away.

409
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,840
We're in the same field. You don't think I understand?

410
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,280
Right.

411
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,720
Are you sad?

412
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,400
"I liked you a lot, Kang Ju Yeon."

413
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,680
"I was very happy..."

414
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,690
"while liking you."

415
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,710
Hye Ri said that...

416
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,890
to me right here.

417
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,710
Did I?

418
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,310
You're the first person I really liked.

419
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,980
I really,

420
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,110
really liked you a lot.

421
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,880
While liking you,

422
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,930
I felt blissful,

423
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,220
Hye Ri.

424
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,300
Thank you so much.

425
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm...

426
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,490
so sorry that I'm not the person...

427
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,560
you loved.

428
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,190
I'm...

429
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,040
so sorry that I can't be the person...

430
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,910
you love, Ju Yeon.

431
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,690
Thank you for everything, Ju Yeon.

432
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,630
Ju Yeon,

433
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,230
aren't you going to say goodbye to me?

434
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
No,

435
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,450
I will.

436
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,590
Then can we shake hands?

437
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,260
(TN: A silent goodbye)

438
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,950
Yes.

439
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,520
You have been through a lot.

440
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,050
Now you can get back to work. They're waiting for you.

441
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,050
Hey, you know what? It's after 2 a.m.

442
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,620
I know. That's why you came to pick me up.

443
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,000
Hey, I left after 11 p.m. We haven't even been out for three hours.

444
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,270
I know. I do, but it's so late.

445
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,770
Is that right, Kang Ju Yeon? Isn't it almost dawn?

446
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,820
It's not time to go on a date.

447
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,640
It's time to get back to the office and work.

448
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,770
I don't think of 2 a.m. as working hours.

449
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,510
Hey, you said you understood this. You don't act like you do.

450
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,150
No, I get it!

451
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,340
What are you saying? "Good breakup."

452
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,130
I totally get it.

453
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,040
Thus, Kang Ju Yeon, get back to work.

454
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,800
Hey, you're not cool about this at all.

455
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,690
What are you saying? I'm such a cool guy.

456
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,870
Who's cooler than I in this world? Ta-da-da.

457
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,220
"Ta-da-da"? Stop it. Your face is cool.

458
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,180
You're right. My face is so cool. Look.

459
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,760
No, it's not.

460
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,170
You look likeâ€¦

461
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,750
 You look shocked. 

462
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,170
 Unnieâ€¦ 

463
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:19,500
You said you were getting better. Why are you having your funeral portrait taken?

464
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,230
Well, I'm just preparing in advance.

465
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,360
Don't worry. You'll all get a photo.

466
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,590
Why? Am I dying, too?

467
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,080
You said that if I die, you'll die with me.

468
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,200
We still have a bottle of alcohol that Hyun Oh bought on his business trip.

469
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,550
I have to drink that before I die.

470
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,560
Hey, Grandma! You also have a bottle I bought on a business trip.

471
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,060
That's right. I'll drink this too before I die.

472
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,800
Wow, such amazing goals, everyone.

473
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,290
But where is Hyun Oh?

474
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,370
He should be here by now.

475
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,660
I know. Why isn't he here?

476
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,880
   

477
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,620
   

478
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,650
Will you pass this around?

479
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,320
Yes. Newsroom, Current Affairs, Entertainment, Radio. Am I missing anything?

480
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,920
Also, Culture and Education. What do you think?

481
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,410
- But why? 
 - Shin Joong isn't getting me anything.

482
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,350
So what should I do? The thirsty one should dig a well (plan ahead).

483
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,520
I will dig a big, deep one.

484
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,290
Fine, dig

485
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,980
a deep one.

486
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,930
What if Shin Joong finds out you're passing this aroundâ€”

487
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,180
He will regret it. "I should have paid more attention to Eun Ho."

488
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:41,350
Or "If I leave Eun Ho unattended for a moment, she takes a poop."

489
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,230
What? Are you embarrassed of me?

490
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,640
No.

491
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,000
You're so cute.

492
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,700
Darn it!

493
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,450
What are you saying?

494
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,180
You're crazy.

495
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,930
What do you mean? I'm just telling the truth.

496
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,510
Hey, what's up?

497
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,630
Oh, right.

498
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,500
I got it. I'll be right there.

499
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,590
I have to go.

500
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,340
What is it? Where are you going?

501
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,490
We're supposed to get meat in Majangdong today. Where will you go?

502
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,610
They brought in new pork belly today, and we planned to get it. Where do you go?

503
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,670
Yes. That was the plan, but Iâ€”

504
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,040
What? Why?

505
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,350
Hey.

506
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,970
Would you like to go somewhere with me?

507
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:53,460
Here we go! One, two, three!

508
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,280
It looks good. Let's reset and take a few more.

509
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,590
I'm just so confused.

510
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,800
Who's that vixen standing next to Hyun Oh?

511
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,920
I told you. Ju Eun Ho.

512
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,790
Unnie, how do I look?

513
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,100
Don't my eyes look moist and nice?

514
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,380
So who is Ju Eun Ho?

515
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,870
I told you. It's Hyung's girlfriend.

516
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,100
No.

517
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,080
Well, this just bothers me.

518
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,210
She's not Hyun Oh's wife. Why is his girlfriend taking a group photo with us?

519
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:39,620
Unnie, stop being so old-fashioned.

520
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,930
I like it.

521
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,150
I don't care.

522
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,820
I just want this to be over so I can smoke.

523
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,120
Last one. Look to the front.

524
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,470
Grandma, your hands are shaking too much.

525
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,210
Good, good, hold her like that.

526
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,260
Here we go!

527
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,470
One, two, three!

528
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,760
Heyâ€¦

529
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,580
what is your name?

530
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,860
Oh, yes! I'm Ju Eun Ho.

531
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,780
Soâ€¦

532
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,220
I heard you don't have parents.

533
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,060
No, I don't. Just like Hyun Oh.

534
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,020
Then do youâ€¦ do you have a house?

535
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,410
No, I don't. Just like Hyun Oh.

536
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,170
Are you good at housework?

537
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,230
I'm terrible at it. So Hyun Oh always came over to cook,

538
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,420
do laundry, cleanâ€¦

539
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,900
Is this an interview or something?

540
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,050
I know. It's so tough.

541
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,200
I don't even have to disagree.

542
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,930
That's right, Grandmas. Who asks those questions these days?

543
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,310
Not even in elementary schools.

544
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,010
Really? Have times changed that fast?

545
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,210
That's right. And Grandma, I came here,

546
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,610
because Hyun Oh said he has four grandmothers. That's why I came.

547
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,560
I lived with my grandma as a child.

548
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,030
Quite good. She seems fairly decent.

549
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,160
Is that right? I'm really decent.

550
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,970
I'm an eligible catch.

551
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,480
Was she always that shameless?

552
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,070
I told you she's different.

553
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,410
She's shameless in a different way.

554
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,530
But Grandmas, as I see itâ€¦

555
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,500
you drink. You smoke.

556
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,410
You spitâ€¦ Wowâ€¦

557
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,880
Are you all healthy, Ladies?

558
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,350
If this is the case, your future could be very gloomy.

559
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,710
It's just a gentle suggestionâ€¦

560
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,390
That's enough for today. Let's wrap it up for today.

561
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,270
Hey, hey. I didn't get to ask her anything yet!

562
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:25,170
I know, but that's enough for today. Can I take her upstairs now?

563
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,250
Oh my. Take her upstairs and do what?

564
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,440
To do what?

565
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,320
You're so silly!

566
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,680
Wait, why does that Unnie keep laughing?

567
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,790
Because she's happy. She likes you a lot.

568
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,250
Do you like her?

569
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,020
Reallyâ€¦

570
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,960
Oh my.

571
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,940
What are these, Jung Hyun Oh?

572
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,870
It's the grandmasâ€¦

573
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:13,090
Each time a neighborhood shop was closing, they went shopping.

574
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:18,650
Why do they display them in your room?

575
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,910
Like how a cat brings mice to its favorite person?

576
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:27,470
- Because they like you? 
 - Yes.

577
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,540
You know, Hyun Ohâ€¦

578
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,410
I thought you would have a pianist mom, a violinist sister,

579
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,190
and a dad with a corporate job.

580
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,370
Everyone thinks that,

581
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,040
but it's not true.

582
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:55,300
So when did you plan on telling me the truth?

583
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,340
Right now.

584
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,440
You know, Jae Yongâ€¦

585
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,530
If I understood half of what you said,

586
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,580
or if I empathized,

587
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,900
accepted, was convinced, orâ€”

588
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,990
Hyungnim, my phone just keeps ringing...

589
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,570
The CEO of the donut shop keeps calling me.

590
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,800
So you are talking aboutâ€¦

591
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,920
the donut shop owner you shut down with your false reporting five years ago, right?

592
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,220
Yes, Hyungnim.

593
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,270
My false reporting shut down that donut shop.

594
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:03,600
I was given wrong information and spewed nonsense about how their donuts were carcinogenic.

595
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,200
That's why they shut down.

596
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,110
And what happened to me?

597
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,810
My pay was cut, and I was demotedâ€¦

598
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,720
Hey, Man.

599
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,640
That's what happened to you.

600
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,540
What about him? He had lost everything!

601
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,080
That's right, Hyungnim.

602
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,040
So I went over there and got down on my knees to apologize.

603
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,260
It didn't change anything, butâ€¦

604
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,550
I also emptied my savings to give it to him.

605
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,520
I know money isn't everything, butâ€¦ I issued a correction, onlyâ€¦

606
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,750
Of course, people didn't care about the correction,

607
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,710
but Hyungnim, he keeps calling me!

608
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,000
What do I do?

609
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,810
- Get out, Idiot. 
 - I will! Okay, okay.

610
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,510
Get out!

611
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,640
- But Hyungnim, what if he keeps callingâ€” 
 - Go!

612
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,590
 Hyungnim! Open the door! 

613
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,390
 He keeps calling! 

614
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,150
Yes, Kim Shin Joong speaking.

615
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,780
Press Director?

616
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,940
What's going on?

617
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,730
What did you say, Team Leader?

618
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,250
You have a news offer.

619
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,600
Nonsense.

620
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,590
Up until yesterday, you said you didn't have anything for me.

621
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,310
- So I was about to send my resume to all departmentsâ€” 
 - It's a 2-week replacement.

622
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,390
Still, that makes no sense. Soh Chin Guk hates me.

623
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,690
It's the 7 o'clock news.

624
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,990
This gets stranger by the minute.

625
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,700
Fine. Who is it with?

626
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,490
On your own.

627
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,980
What?

628
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,590
Don't you want it?

629
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,660
How?

630
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,220
How, how, how?

631
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,310
You'll be a substitute for two weeks.

632
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,220
You don't have to get too excited.

633
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,100
How can it be me when there is Shim Jin Hwa?

634
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,400
How can it be me?

635
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,780
First of all, Jin Hwa is terrible

636
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,640
so Soh Chin Guk was criticized for this.

637
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,920
My guess is he will try you out for the 7 o'clock and see the feedback.

638
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,310
What is this stupid dance?

639
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,820
Hey. Get out.

640
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,000
Stop dancing and go!

641
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,630
Close the door!

642
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:04,040
 Why is it my fault that Shim Jin Hwa is terrible? 

643
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,890
 You put her in there. 

644
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,000
 I know. I know that. 

645
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,110
 I got it then. 

646
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,010
 I heard Ju Eun Ho is back. 

647
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,020
 So? 

648
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,460
 You know, Choi Jin Mi is on sick leave from 7 o'clock news, right? 

649
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,140
 And? 

650
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,160
 It's for two weeks. 

651
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:33,510
 Do you think Ju Eun Ho would do it if we asked? 

652
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,770
 Do you want Eun Ho? Why? 

653
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,930
 She will just be a substitute. 

654
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,840
 She's done news before. It's good to have experience. 

655
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,940
 And I don't really have anyone else around. 

656
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,500
 What do you mean? 

657
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,820
 There is a guy who has been cut from the 9 o'clock, 

658
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,960
 an ideal newsman, who's now watering office plants, Jung Hyun Oh. 

659
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,670
 Choi Jin Mi is a female. It should be a woman. 

660
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,090
 Do you think Ju Eun Ho would do it? 

661
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,030
 Would she do it for us? 

662
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,990
 I don't know. 

663
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:17,300
 I think she will answer if you ask her to do it. 

664
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,310
 Really? Then can you ask her, Team Leader Kim? 

665
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,370
 Even so, Press Directorâ€¦ 

666
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,450
 Yes, what? Tell me. 

667
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,450
 We will do our best, butâ€¦ 

668
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,180
 Of course, you will. I trust you. What? 

669
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,760
 We will do our very best. 

670
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,300
 I know. What's wrong with you? 

671
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,850
 We will do our very best soâ€¦ 

672
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,490
 Press Director, 

673
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,440
 please don't mess around with my people again. 

674
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:00,140
 - What? 
 - Get them to be your golf caddies, to work at your family events, 

675
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,700
 to beg for information, tell Eun Ho she's old and incompetent, 

676
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,000
 to insist we were wrong when we were right, to fire someone for an error. 

677
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,450
 I've beenâ€¦ 

678
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,540
 watching from the sidelines. I'm powerless and incompetent. 

679
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,990
 Why? 

680
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,790
 Do you have any power now? 

681
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,550
 No. 

682
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,660
 I have courage, 

683
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,040
 the courage to say what I want. 

684
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:36,020
 Press Director, please don't trifle with my people's dreams again. 

685
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:41,720
 An adult should have better things to do than to play with young people's dreams. 

686
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,710
 Thank you, Press Director. 

687
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,650
 So? 

688
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:21,580
 The 7 o'clock news. I'm doing the 7 o'clock news! Daebak! 

689
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,260
 Yes. 

690
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,620
What?

691
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,180
Wow!

692
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,900
You are right, Hyun Oh. You can't just shout once. How many times?

693
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,430
Three times. Wow!

694
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,900
That's right.

695
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,130
So we're going there now, aren't we?

696
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,150
There? Going where?

697
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,260
Where we had our first date, the Hill of Pinwheels.

698
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,460
We said we would go there together when I got the 7 o'clock news.

699
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,470
Don't you remember?

700
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,650
I remember. I do, but I don't want to go there.

701
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,730
Why not? You said it looked like a painting!

702
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,710
Eun Ho, it was featured in a drama.

703
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,720
Now, it's crowded. I'm not going.

704
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,460
Hey, we missed the sunset while eating garitguk.

705
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,950
Do you know how pretty the sunset is there? Like a kimchi pancake in the sky.

706
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,430
It's amazing, and I didn't get to see it!

707
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,760
Eun Ho, it's so pretty thatâ€¦

708
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,040
Yes?

709
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,300
it was featured in a drama.

710
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,130
- Yes. 
 - I'm a star.

711
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,150
People will recognize me there, andâ€¦

712
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,390
Hey. That faded away when you stopped being in the news.

713
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,350
- Can't you just come with me? 
 - What do you mean?

714
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,910
- I still have it. 
 - I really want to go back there.

715
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:41,510
I didn't get to see the sunset there.

716
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:45,970
Shall I go with you, Eun Ho?

717
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,710
Darn it, no!

718
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,870
Hyun Oh, do you want me to go with you?

719
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,620
No, I would hate that. Not today.

720
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,220
 Eun Ho, I'll go with youâ€” 

721
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,190
 Hey, answer your phone. It's so loud. 

722
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:06,360
 No! I can't answer this call! Not ever! 

723
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:17,510
I want to go to the Hill of Pinwheels with you!

724
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:21,000
   

725
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,240
Participant Yoo Hee Jeong, please choose.

726
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,560
Tree or flower?

727
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,270
I choose flower.

728
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,160
You chose quickly.

729
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,580
I'm not the indecisive type.

730
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,100
Will you not regret this?

731
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,820
No. I do my best not to regret any decision.

732
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,680
Then I hope you don't regret this one, either.

733
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:52,900
Participant Yoo Hee Jeong has chosen "flower."

734
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,260
Sunbae.

735
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,970
Can we talk for a second?

736
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,850
I don't know. I'm a little tired today.

737
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,810
Still, I'd like toâ€¦

738
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,170
What do you want to say?

739
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:32,980
Your wish was for something to happen, right?

740
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,450
Is that what you wanted to say?

741
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,180
What was it?

742
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,700
Paper cup? Something like that.

743
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,740
Yes.

744
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,400
Paper cups hanging from the office ceiling.

745
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,070
Right.

746
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,820
And the world ending.

747
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,050
Yes.

748
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:03,390
For the world to just end.

749
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,920
And?

750
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,560
What ifâ€¦

751
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,740
I disappeared? What would it be like for you?

752
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,830
If you disappeared?

753
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,930
What would it be like for me?

754
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,380
I'm not sure.

755
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:43,990
So it doesn't really matter to you, Sunbae,

756
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,160
whether I'm here or not?

757
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,260
Yes.

758
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,530
I don't think

759
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,500
it would be that much different.

760
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,880
I understand.

761
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,620
Why do you ask?

762
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,810
No reason, Sunbae.

763
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,860
I'm leaving.

764
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,840
Thanks for your time.

765
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,450
Bye.

766
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,120
Hello, hello.

767
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,610
Hello, hello.

768
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,330
Sunbae.

769
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,570
You appear to be in a good mood.

770
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,800
Of course, Sunbae. I've been waiting for today.

771
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,120
Hello. I'm Producer, Yoo Seong Ha.

772
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,950
Hello, I'm Ju Eun Ho. Looking forward to working with you.

773
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,950
Why don't you have a seat?

774
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,640
Shall I?

775
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,380
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

776
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,400
Nothing.

777
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,910
Get ready.

778
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,400
Okay.

779
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,270
 Hey, Ju Eun Ho. 

780
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,550
 What, Sunbae? 

781
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,970
 You'd better be successful. 

782
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:19,160
 I'm going to. I will, for sure. I'm confident. 

783
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,460
 All right. It's good then. 

784
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,170
 But Sunbae, 

785
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,490
 why are you bringing that up? 

786
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,960
 If you're successful, 

787
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,140
 it will make me happy. 

788
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,990
 Are you satisfied? 

789
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,410
A drug cartel, smuggling methamphetamine from overseas,

790
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,270
was caught by the police.

791
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,810
The Seoul Police Narcotics Unitâ€¦

792
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,000
Things are looking quite good.

793
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,330
Aigoo, hello.

794
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,620
One minute to go.

795
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:23,330
 Hello, Viewers. This is the Monday 7 o'clock news. 

796
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:27,010
 A drug cartel, smuggling methamphetamine from overseas, 

797
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,130
 was caught by the police. 

798
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:33,140
 The Seoul Police Narcotics Unit has arrested 25 people 

799
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,550
 for dealing and using drugsâ€¦ 

800
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,890
That's it for today. Thank you for watching.

801
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,510
 Thank you! 

802
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,830
Nice job.

803
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,450
Nice job.

804
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,390
Nice job.

805
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,680
Hey, Ju Eun Ho. Good job.

806
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,790
I have good news and bad news.

807
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,720
Which do you want to hear first?

808
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,330
Either one. Everything is good news for me right now.

809
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,660
What is it?

810
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,170
Fine then, the good news first.

811
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,740
Press Director Soh wants to go out for dinner.

812
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,250
Darn it, dinner? Out of nowhere?

813
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,070
No, I can't. I have plans.

814
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,880
Next.

815
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,870
The bad newsâ€¦

816
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,860
He wants you to prepare to audition

817
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,180
for the new 7 o'clock show.

818
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,550
   

819
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,140
Jung Hyun Oh, it's now, right now.

820
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,910
What is?

821
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,670
Press Director Soh wants me to prepare for an audition for the 7 o'clock show.

822
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:24,790
Why is that now?

823
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:29,060
That's why we must leave for the Hill of Pinwheels right now.

824
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,190
Darn it. Don't you want to go?

825
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,680
Are you guys going by yourselves?

826
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,350
Can I go with you guys?

827
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:46,510
Darn it. Why are you under my desk?

828
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:55,610
I threw away my phone, but it's still ringing.

829
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,370
Guys, isn't that scary?

830
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,940
How can a phone keep ringing?

831
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,270
I threw it out. 
    

832
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,780
I put it thereâ€”

833
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,700
Hello? Go ahead.

834
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,650
What is this about?

835
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,890
No, I'm listening.

836
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,760
Right now?

837
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,600
I got it.

838
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,590
What the heck!

839
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,640
It's the donut shop owner's son. He wants to see you.

840
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,170
At B2, in front of area A11. Go and meet him.

841
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,270
No, I can't. I-I-I-can't go.

842
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,990
You should go. Hyun Oh, we should leave, too.

843
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:47,930
Let's hurry so we can catch the sunset.

844
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:52,220
You will join me, won't you?

845
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,440
Jung Hyun Oh, can you please save me?

846
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,610
Can you help me, Hyun Oh? I can't go.

847
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,870
I think he will do something to me.

848
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:07,210
Hyun Oh, you're a star. If he sees you, he might forgive me.

849
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,240
I don't know. Would he really?

850
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,220
I may be a star, but I am not the face of PPS.

851
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,340
No, no, you're the face.

852
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,300
Instead of the logo on the top of our building,

853
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:28,950
I think you should be on it. You're the face of PPS.

854
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,980
So I was wondering if you could go in my place, the face of PPS, Hyun Oh?

855
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,910
You never know. If you go, he might forgive me.

856
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:41,050
Hey, I had him first. Get in line!

857
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,650
Hyun Oh, I'm so scared.

858
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:48,100
- Hey! Get in line, I said! 
 - I don't want to.

859
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,940
One second.

860
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,790
One second.

861
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:58,010
So I just have to go and listen to him, right?

862
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,610
Yes! That's right!

863
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,420
Daebak.

864
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,780
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh. Did you just choose Jeon Jae Yong over me?

865
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:13,420
No. Eun Ho, I choose you.

866
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,340
Go straight to the Hill of Pinwheels. I'll be right behind you.

867
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,460
Oh, yay! I'll go change.

868
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,150
Eun Ho!

869
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:32,670
Hyun Oh, thank you so much. I think I'm in love with you.

870
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,940
Stop! It's okay. No, thanks.

871
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,990
I'm not interested in boys' love.

872
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:39,090
This is just not me. Please let me go.

873
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,780
No, I don't want to. Also, "boys' love"?

874
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,120
Would you like to do that with me?

875
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,560
How dazzling.

876
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,760
Hey, Eun Ho.

877
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,720
Hyun Oh, the sunset is so pretty.

878
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,480
Is the sunset alreadyâ€”

879
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,100
No, I'll be right there.

880
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,220
I'll be right there. Of course.

881
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,810
Yes.

882
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,370
I meanâ€”

883
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,910
 Hello? 

884
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,330
Hello?

885
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,120
 Jung Hyun Oh, why aren't you saying anything? 

886
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,530
 Hyun Oh. 

887
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,860
 Hello? 

888
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,680
 Hyun Oh! 

889
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,630
   

890
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:35,360
Darn it. Youâ€¦

891
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:40,210
I came here to kill you.

892
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:43,400
 And you're really dead. 

893
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,790
Hyunâ€”

894
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:04,760


895
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:12,930
   

896
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:17,390
 So you never had another personality again? 

897
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,170
 No. Hye Ri didn't come back. 

898
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:24,510
 Then the emotional issues you had, Eun Hoâ€¦ 

899
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:29,170
 The emotional issues that caused your Dissociative Identity Disorder 

900
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:32,240
 have been resolved. 

901
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,370
 But Eun Ho, 

902
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:39,120
 if you face those emotional issues again, 

903
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:44,180
 there is a chance you will meet Hye Ri again. 

904
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,370
 But Doctor, 

905
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,490
 if I met Hye Ri again, 

906
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,710
 I think I would be happy to see her.
