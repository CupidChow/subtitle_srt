1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,790
   

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,230
   

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,570
   

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,010
   

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,200
   

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:29,940


7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,090
   

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,000
   

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,080
It's so pretty here, right?

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,570
Yes, it's nice.

11
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,250
Aren't the pinwheels pretty? Don't they look like spinning rainbows?

12
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,270
Right. How pretty.

13
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,090
Everything here looks like a painting, right?

14
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,760
Exactly.

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,040
But...

16
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,160
are you a Twizzler (candy)?

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,210
Why do you keep twisting yourself?

18
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,080
Oh, so...

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,470
You keep inviting me to such places

20
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,100
and you phone me every night.

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,400
So I asked people; everyone said...

22
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,430
you must be interested in me.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,930
What did you say?

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,590
By any chance, are you

25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,450
interested in me?

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,650
- I meanâ€“ 
 - Don't answer that.

27
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,190
There's no way you're interested in me. You have it all.

28
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,540
Right. Darn it. So funny.

29
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,560
What's so funny?

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,430
I mean, there's no way you'd be interested in me.

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,500
Hey, I'm hungry. What should we eat after our walk?

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,620
Pork belly? Intestines? Oxtail stew? Seonji (ox blood) hotpot?

33
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,500
Hey, do you know garitguk (Beef bone soup)?

34
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,610
I'm very interested in you.

35
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,730
Wh-What?

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,600
Isn't it obvious?

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,760
Why would I call or ask you to meet if I wasn't interested?

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,210
I think it's weirder that you didn't know.

39
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,240
I know garitguk. It's really good.

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,100
Let's go eat it later.

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,140
It's really nice here.

42
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,800
Wh-What? Wh-What did you say?

43
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,200
   

44
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,040
 - Hey, Ju Eun Ho. 
 - What? 

45
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,850
 I don't like you anymore. 

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,240
 - What? 
 - I mean... 

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,280
 I said I was interested in you weeks ago, yet you never gave me an answer. 

48
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,420
 A month passed. 

49
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,580
 You haven't responded. 

50
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,530
 Are you meaning me? 

51
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,380
 Whom else would I mean? 

52
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,480
 So... 

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,180
 Wait, that was... 

54
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,620
 It's fine. I'm leaving. Don't follow me. 

55
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,730
 Hey! 
   

56
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,340
 Wow! 

57
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,760
 Wow, wh-what was that? 

58
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,340
 D-Did he just... 

59
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,480
 He said he was interested. He didn't ask me to be his girlfriend. 

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,020
 Did he say we should date? 

61
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,050
 He didn't say anything! 

62
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,210
 How can I answer if he doesn't ask? 

63
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,760
 "I'm very interested in you." So what did he want me to do? 

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,520
 Did he want me to say, "Hey, Jung Hyun Oh, who is very interested," 

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,510
 "I'm also very interested in you. Should we start dating?" 

66
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,930
 Wow! Darn! What a passive jerk! 

67
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,010
 Hey. Where are you going? 

68
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,920
 Can I go with you? 

69
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,680
 Who are you? 

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,510
 I'm Jung Hyun Oh. 

71
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,100
 What are you saying? 

72
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
 What? 

73
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,040
 You just do whatever you want, don't you? 

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,860
 One day, you're very interested in me. 

75
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,540
 A month later, you don't like me and say to avoid you. 

76
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,090
 Excuse me, it was over six months since we've spoken. 

77
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,580
 Then you just show up and say, 

78
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,640
 "Where are you going? Can I go with you?" 

79
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,740
 Hey, am I a joke to you? 

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,470
 Eun Ho. 

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,120
 Can you stop using my name? We aren't friends. 

82
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,820
 So you thought of me a lot, right? 

83
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,730
 So annoying. 

84
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,830
 Can you please not talk to me? 

85
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,910
 Do you want to go to Namsan Tower like this? 

86
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,900
 I... 

87
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,230
 like cable cars. 

88
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,030
 Really? Let's go ride one. 

89
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,570
 Don't do that from now on. 

90
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,030
 Do what? 

91
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,180
 Not talk to me. 

92
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,020
 Ignore me for six months. 

93
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,780
 I'm not sure. 

94
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,930
 What did you say? 

95
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,230
 You never know with people. 

96
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,520
 Just joking. 

97
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,660
 Jung Hyun Oh. 

98
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,990
 What should I do? 

99
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I like you so much. 

100
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,350
 From the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. 

101
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,580
 Fold your laundry. 

102
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,070
 Why? 

103
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,240
 Are you the lazy grasshopper? 

104
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,210
 Hyun Oh, you fold laundry so well! 

105
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,630
   

106
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,220
   

107
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,060
   

108
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,360
 Attention! 

109
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,700
 Welcome to the... what group are you? 

110
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,060
 Yes! 

111
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,170
 I'm in Group 34. 

112
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,490
 It's an honor to join PPS. I anticipate working with you! 

113
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,560
 All right, everyone. 

114
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,230
 Congratulations on landing a hard-to-get job at PPS through nepotism. 

115
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,710
 Should we do some introductions? 

116
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,870
 Who here is in the oldest group? 

117
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,800
 Group 28, right? Stand up. Say hello. 

118
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,290
 Sit, sit. I'll be the representative. 

119
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,270
 Hello, I'm Announcer Ju Eun Ho. I will work with you. 

120
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,940
 Applause! 

121
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,780
 Sit. Let's fill our glasses for a toast. 

122
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,240
 Here. Fill it up. 

123
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,650
 Welcome. 

124
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,680
 Welcome! 

125
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,810
 Hey, Moon Ji On. How can you not know how to do this? 

126
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,640
 I know. Why am I so bad at it? 

127
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,440
 Hey, is it because you majored in Physical Education? 

128
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,700
 Yes, I'm a PE major, right? 

129
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,710
 Maybe that's why. 

130
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,740
 Whoa, you don't even have pride. 

131
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,560
 Geez... 

132
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,110
 Hey. Do you know what? 

133
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,430
 - He majored in Economics... 
 - Pardon? 

134
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,720
 with Applied Statistics. 

135
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,830
 So if Kwon Gyeong Jin messes up numbers, say this. 

136
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,730
 "Sunbae, you majored in Economics. Why don't you know that?" 

137
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,850
 Sunbaenim, I'm not upset at all. 

138
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,440
 Really. 

139
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,450
 You don't look upset. 

140
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,850
 But you seem to be struggling. 

141
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,800
 Do you want some coffee? 

142
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,000
 You scared me. 

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,020
 What? How did you know I was here? 

144
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,760
 I heard you and Hyung broke up. 

145
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,460
 It was two days. How did you find out? 

146
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,360
 Ju Eun Ho. 

147
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,520
 Why are you using my name? 

148
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,910
 I thought I was your sunbae. 

149
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,870
 Are you okay? 

150
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,000
   

151
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,470
Hello.

152
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,860
Aigoo, how can we help you?

153
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,690
I have a question.

154
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,220
I heard there was an accident nearby.

155
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,370
In front of Ttaenggang Supermarket. A woman got hurt...

156
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,540
Oh, that young lady?

157
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,400
Yes, yes. I heard she ran off.

158
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,620
If so...

159
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,470
Are you okay?

160
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,540
Aren't you hungry?

161
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,270
Are you hurt?

162
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,840
Should we go to the hospital?

163
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,980
Eun Ho.

164
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,730
Do you want to change?

165
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,440
I'll bring you some clothes to change into.

166
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,610
Don't go anywhere. Stay here.

167
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,190
 All my passwords are your birthday. 

168
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,360
   

169
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,190
   

170
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,810
   

171
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,750
   

172
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,170
   

173
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,500
   

174
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,250
I'm just curious.

175
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,850
What should I call you?

176
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,380
Anyway,

177
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,820
you aren't Eun Ho, are you?

178
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,610
Should I call you Hye Ri?

179
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,280
Okay.

180
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,230
Change your clothes first, please, Hye Ri.

181
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,150
Come out after. I'll make you something delicious.

182
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,890
Sunbae, you know what?

183
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,910
I can drink.

184
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,030
So I will drink for you.

185
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,500
Do you know what else? I've been acting like I don't know,

186
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,720
but I think I already know.

187
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,730
I guess you and Hye Ri broke up.

188
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,500
Right? 
   Â­ 

189
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,140
You know... how can I not know?

190
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,480
Because all I do is stare at your face.

191
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,180
As for the exact timing, I'm not sure.

192
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,630
Maybe a month ago?

193
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,670
Your face was gloomy since then.

194
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:40,030
Considering all you've said so far,

195
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,650
I think Hye Ri broke up with you.

196
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,880
Because she was two-timing you.

197
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,860
Right? One heart, two loves...

198
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,540
You were blindsided by her two-timing and learned of your breakup.

199
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,900
I'm right, aren't I?

200
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,800
Hye Yeon.

201
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,400
What, Sunbae?

202
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,140
Each person...

203
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,190
has one heart only.

204
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,770
It's true.

205
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,950
Each person...

206
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,060
truly has only one heart.

207
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,550
By any chance...

208
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,520
do you recognize me?

209
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,940
We've met before.

210
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,770
 I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho... 

211
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,850
 Oh, really? Then who are you? 

212
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,630
Of course. You might not remember.

213
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,190
Eat slowly. I'll go upstairs for a second.

214
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,350
Jung Hyun Oh.

215
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,900
   

216
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,890
 Hello? 

217
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,890
 Kang Ju Yeon. 

218
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,260
This is Hye Ri's...

219
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,520
I mean, this is Announcer Ju Eun Ho's...

220
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,860
- No, Hye Riâ€“ 
  - I'm Jung Hyun Oh. 

221
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,420
Sunbaenim, why are you picking up her phone?

222
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,720
Because Eun Ho

223
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,900
is back.

224
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,650
Where is she right now?

225
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,930
 Is Hye Ri okay? Where was she? 

226
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,410
What is she doing right now? Can I talk to her?

227
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,660
S-Sunbaenim.

228
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,590
 Hey, Sunbaenim! 

229
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
She is healthy and safe.

230
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,240
Bye.

231
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,370
   

232
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,770
 Thank you. 

233
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,130
She's asleep.

234
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,470
- Thenâ€“ 
 -  I see... 

235
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,610
She's asleep?

236
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,200
Who's asleep?

237
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,260
 I want to know. 

238
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,000
 Is Hye Ri... 

239
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,000
 Hye Ri right now... 

240
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,160
or Announcer Ju Eun Ho?

241
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,550
He doesn't know. Hyung, you don't know, right?

242
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,660
But...

243
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,770
who are you?

244
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm Moon Ji On. Who are you?

245
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,540
I'm Kang Ju Yeon.

246
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,430
I'm an announcer with Media N Seoul.

247
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,640
I didn't get in there.

248
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,430
Which cohort? I'm in Group 34 at PPS.

249
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,740
"Group 34"?

250
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,150
When did you start?

251
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,340
March 2019?

252
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,240
Then we started the same year.

253
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,510
I started in 2019, too.

254
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,600
But I'm 35.

255
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,180
I see.

256
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,900
I'm 32.

257
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,840
You look young.

258
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,430
Since we started the same year, I can talk informally, right?

259
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,510
No, you can't.

260
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,410
So, Hyung.

261
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,290
Can I ask what's going on?

262
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,170
I already explained it to you earlier.

263
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,840
Yes, I understand that much.

264
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,450
Ju Eun Ho has Dissociative Identity Disorder

265
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,040
and worked in the Media N Seoul parking lot under the name "Ju Hye Ri."

266
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,810
That's where she met me.

267
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,600
She was seeing me.

268
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
- For how long? 
 - A month.

269
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,410
"A month"? Wow.

270
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,200
A month.

271
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,520
You might as well not have been together.

272
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,150
What do you mean by "you might as well not have been together"?

273
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:28,070
A totally blank white canvas is better than

274
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,100
one drop of paint on it.

275
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,650
So?

276
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,940
Is Hye Ri okay?

277
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,010
As I've said, she's healthy and safeâ€“

278
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,930
No.

279
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,410
Which personality is she right now?

280
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:55,990
If it's Hye Ri, I think I should be her guardian.

281
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,140
No, no, no.

282
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,830
How can you trust someone she dated for only a month?

283
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,780
I never dated Eun Ho, but I've known her for five years.

284
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,310
I think I should be her guardian.

285
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,110
Even if we dated only a month,

286
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,180
I have the right to be her guardian since we loved each other.

287
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,200
Excuse me!

288
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,080
A guardian shouldn't have personal feelings but just be a guardian.

289
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,600
- So Iâ€“ 
 - No way.

290
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,560
I think a guardian should have personal feelings.

291
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,220
So do you hire caretakers based on love?

292
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,750
Yes, I hired my mother's caretaker based on love.

293
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,300
Don't talk of your mom. That's cheating. Should I talk about my mom?

294
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,700
- My mom leftâ€“ 
 - Do we need to mention this?

295
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,510
Why must we pick a guardian?

296
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,000
Ju Eun Ho is an adult.

297
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,600
- But you said she isn't wellâ€“ 
 - Yes, you said she's sick.

298
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,150
Yes. In that case, I dated her for eight years. I loved her.

299
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,800
 And now I have no personal feelings so I should be her guardian. 

300
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,870
 Right? Right? 

301
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,110
 So... you can go. 

302
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,450
 Go, please. 

303
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,740
 I'm 37 years old. I'll guard her. 

304
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,800
By the way, where did Hyun Oh go?

305
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,470
He didn't come home last night.

306
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,570
What? What's wrong?

307
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,850
Give him a call.

308
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,340
I already called him to take you to the hospital, but he didn't pick up.

309
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,350
What are you saying?

310
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,860
I think Jung Hyun Oh's gone crazy.

311
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,160
What's wrong, Producer?

312
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,090
He just called me...

313
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,880
to say he won't be at meetings for a while.

314
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,480
What? Is that really that strange, Producer?

315
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,740
It is. For the Deputy, it's strange.

316
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,180
Wow! This has never happened to me before.

317
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,260
What is this? Writer.

318
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,720
Why is he doing this?

319
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,890
Why are you asking me?

320
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,250
I thought you were like family. You must know what's going on,

321
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,180
why he's acting like this suddenly.

322
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,250
Don't you know family members always keep things from each other?

323
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,350
Oh, is that so?

324
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,010
Shall we go?

325
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,610
Wait here for a second.

326
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,720
Let me go talk to him.

327
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,550
- I said I'll call youâ€” 
 - Hye Ri.

328
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,300
Wait.

329
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,890
Talk to me first.

330
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,020
Is that Hye Ri or Eun Ho?

331
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,870
We're headed to the doctor. I'll tell you when we're back.

332
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,630
But actually...

333
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,370
it doesn't matter to me.

334
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,530
It really doesn't matter to me,

335
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,960
no matter who Hye Ri is.

336
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,150
It doesn't matter to me, Hye Ri!

337
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,270
Because...

338
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,740
all I need is for you to be fine.

339
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,300
- Excuse me, Kang Ju Yeonâ€” 
 - Even if it's not by my side,

340
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,820
if you're alive and well, it's enough for me.

341
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,740
You don't have to love me.

342
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,990
Even if you return to the woods, I'm okay with your choice.

343
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,280
If you want, I will come with you.

344
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,070
I can leave everything behind and come with you.

345
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,900
I'm not afraid to do that, Hye Ri.

346
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,420
Hey, Ju Yeon.

347
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,560
Hye Ri can't have this conversation right nowâ€”

348
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,100
Because, Hye Ri,

349
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,770
I didn't fall for you because you were somebody.

350
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,490
Just because...

351
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,630
you came to me as I am.

352
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,710
That's why, Hye Ri.

353
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,150
I like you for you.

354
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,830
So...

355
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,110
â™«  My heart changes according to your gaze  â™«

356
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:34,960
â™«  If I could feel every moment  â™«

357
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,660
â™«  That's enough  â™«

358
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,840
â™«  I'll be with you, always there but barely noticeable  â™«

359
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,000
â™«  I'll be in your background  â™«

360
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,990
â™«  I'll protect you forever  â™«

361
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,930
â™«  I'll be the affection for another side of you  â™«

362
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:06,620
â™«  So you won't get hurt in this harsh world  â™«

363
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,180
I missed you, Hye Ri.

364
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,490
â™«  I'll be in your background  â™«

365
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:19,420
â™«  I'll protect you forever  â™«

366
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,290
â™«  I will be for only you  â™«

367
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,870
â™«  I'll be by your side  â™«

368
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:34,990
â™«  We will be happy  â™«

369
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,550
This is the item I brought up last time.

370
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,660
We shelved it because it was too heavy for "Issue-In."

371
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,980
To celebrate your comeback, why don't we...

372
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,560
put it out there. Yes.

373
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,360
It seems a good idea.

374
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,870
Sunbae?

375
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,210
Excuse me, Sunbaenim?

376
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,580
 One second. 

377
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,720
 Jung Hyun Oh. 

378
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,170
 I want to speak with Kang Ju Yeon. 

379
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,880
Excuse me, Sunbaenim!

380
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,300
Oppa!

381
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,530
What? What is it? What's up?

382
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,560
Get it together. What's wrong with you?

383
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,300
Right.

384
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,800
How have you been?

385
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,720
Just... so-so.

386
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,730
Are you hurt?

387
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,960
Are you feeling okay?

388
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,550
Yes, I'm okay.

389
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,070
So right now...

390
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,080
are you Hye Ri?

391
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,250
Or Eun Ho?

392
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,080
I'm...

393
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,280
What? Hey, Jung Hyun Oh.

394
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,820
I thought you were taking today off.

395
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,900
I'll make it a half-day.

396
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,430
Geez, I guess everyone's just doing whatever they want to do.

397
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,640
Why are you showing up on a day off, saying it's a half-day?

398
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,580
What's wrong with you? What?

399
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,330
Did you eat something bad?

400
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,270
Hey, hey! Stop!

401
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,800
It wasn't even two months!

402
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,070
Are you crazy?

403
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,260
Hyung.

404
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,250
Hyung!

405
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,860
Can we talk?

406
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,390
Say it.

407
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,220
I went to Giyidong, too.

408
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,000
What did you say?

409
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,640
Shim Jin Hwa said she saw Ju Eun Ho there while filming.

410
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,920
So?

411
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,530
What do you mean "So"?

412
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,330
You had already taken Eun Ho home when I got there.

413
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,050
Then?

414
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,040
Then... I went to the forest.

415
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,280
"The forest"?

416
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,550
That forest where Ju Eun Ho was apparently living.

417
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:12,570
 Do you know why Ju Eun Ho went into that forest? 

418
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,400
No.

419
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,710
She wanted to get rid of herself.

420
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,690
She even hurt her own arm, and she wanted to...

421
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,520
get rid of herself.

422
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,760
If it were me, I would have hated being here.

423
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,900
I would have especially hated my name, "Ju Eun Ho."

424
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,750
I think that's why she hurt her arm to look like Ju Hye Ri

425
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,710
and was staying there.

426
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,770
You know, Ju Hye Ri was like that.

427
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,630
She didn't care about anything else except being loved by Kang Ju Yeon,

428
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:10,180
rather than where nothing worked out for her, no matter how hard she tried.

429
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,230
Here she was always heartbroken due to you.

430
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,590
The other side is much better.

431
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,240
I think Eun Ho...

432
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,970
wanted to be fully Hye Ri.

433
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,940
That's why she left everything behind and ran away.

434
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,830
But Hyung,

435
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,160
do you know...

436
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,290
what I found...

437
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,840
in that cabin?

438
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,830
She wanted to leave everything behind,

439
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,120
but she took that with her.

440
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,150
Hyung.

441
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:43,180
I'm... so jealous of you,

442
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,870
but I also don't like you.

443
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,130
I've always thought you don't deserve her

444
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,610
and that I'd get a chance at some point.

445
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,850
Someday, if I kept waiting,

446
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:03,440
but Ju Eun Ho couldn't leave you behind even if she left all else.

447
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,130
Even when she gave it all up,

448
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,730
she couldn't give you up.

449
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,600
You don't deserve her, but Ju Eun Ho...

450
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,100
Eun Ho...

451
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,440
For her, it's only you.

452
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,390
Hyung...

453
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,310
It must be so nice, really...

454
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,040
to be loved like that.

455
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,250
 Here. 

456
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,350
 Geez. 

457
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,010
 You must get it for me, okay? 

458
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,930
 Are you crazy? 

459
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,760
 I'm not crazy! 

460
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,060
 I drew it since you said you'd buy it for me. 

461
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,520
 You should keep your promise. 

462
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,000
 Fine, fine. 

463
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,220
 I'll get it! I'm going to. 

464
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,060
I'm...

465
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,190
I am Eun Ho, Kang Ju Yeon.

466
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,700
However,

467
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,730
I wanted very much to be Hye Ri.

468
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,600
So...

469
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,620
have you been trying to be Hye Ri?

470
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,150
Yes.

471
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,160
I wanted to know why she was happy.

472
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:49,100
   

473
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:14,010
   

474
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,890
 I've always... 

475
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,440
 wanted to ask Hye Ri. 

476
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,370
 Ju Hye Ri. 

477
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,830
 Are you happy? 

478
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,710
 If you're happy, 

479
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,780
 I will try 

480
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,860
 living as you. 

481
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,510
 If I try, 

482
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,410
 it could happen, right? 

483
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,380
 I've always tried to be her. 

484
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,580
 But Ju Hye Ri, 

485
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,050
 I really want to know. 

486
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,080
 You have nothing. 

487
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,810
 But why... 

488
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,670
 Why... 

489
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,560
 are you happy? 

490
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,630
 Hey! What's wrong? 

491
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,350
 What's going on? 

492
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,110
 But... 

493
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:57,500
in the end, I returned unable to become Hye Ri.

494
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,950
Hye Ri.

495
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,050
I...

496
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,850
 Eun Ho, I'll be back. 

497
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,930
 Okay. Make sure you take an umbrella. 

498
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:19,780
 I've never been happy. 

499
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,660
 Eun Ho. 

500
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,430
Not one second.

501
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:38,560
 I love that. Can you do it again? 

502
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,960
 Eun Ho, you don't know how to say no. 

503
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,980
 Do it again. Do it again. 

504
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,240
 Should I leave a little later? 

505
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,440
 Yes. Just one second. 

506
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,910
 Okay. Move over. 

507
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,110
 Just a little longer. 

508
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,210
 Okay. 

509
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,820
 Hyun Oh, today... 

510
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,000
 is special. 

511
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,500
 What? What's special about it? 

512
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,520
 So today... 

513
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:19,530
   

514
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,280
Today...

515
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,140
I really didn't want to be alone.

516
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,880
   
   

517
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,270
 I... 

518
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,130
 don't think... 

519
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:09,720
I could become Hye Ri, Ju Yeon.

520
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,020
It really doesn't matter to me.

521
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,010
Whoever Hye Ri really isâ€”

522
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,350
Maybe today...

523
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,180
is the end for us.

524
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,940
No.

525
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,960
- Noâ€” 
 - I wanted to say thank you.

526
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:46,030
I needed love more than anyone,

527
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,690
and you liked me.

528
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,810
Thank you for taking care of me.

529
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:01,630
What you said to me earlier

530
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,420
is what I wanted to say to you.

531
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,610
You're right.

532
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:16,780
I didn't fall for you because you were somebody.

533
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,950
But you came to me

534
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,480
as I am. Thank you, Ju Yeon.

535
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,010
 I hope you never leave. 

536
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,850
 Who? 

537
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,490
 Me? 

538
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,070
 Yes. 

539
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,050
 I want... 

540
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:20,220
 you to always be by my side. 

541
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:24,910
 Can you do that, Hyun Oh? 

542
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,430
 Yes. 

543
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,080
 Of course. 

544
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,330
 How long will you love me? 

545
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,910
 I'll date you my whole life. 

546
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,930
 No, not dating. 

547
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,350
 Loving me. 

548
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:49,460
 How long will you do that for? 

549
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:55,910
 Forever. 

550
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,560
Hey. So the potted plant next to that,

551
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,220
trim it once a month or two? How could itâ€”

552
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:19,190
â™«  I love you, I love you  â™«

553
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:25,430
â™«  I always want to be by your side  â™«

554
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:32,030
â™«  I love you, I love you  â™«

555
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:38,160
â™«  I love you so much, every moment  â™«

556
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:44,600
â™«  The sad air, your cold tone  â™«

557
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,700
â™«  I miss you and your smile  â™«

558
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,800
I'm going to get out here, Sir.

559
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,730
â™«  Our times are not over  â™«

560
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:04,100
â™«  I promise I'll be by your side always  â™«

561
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:10,730
â™«  I love you, I love you  â™«

562
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:16,900
â™«  I always want to be by your side  â™«

563
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:23,460
â™«  I love you, I love you  â™«

564
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:30,850
â™«  I love you so much, every moment  â™«

565
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:56,730
â™«  I love you  â™«

566
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,410
 I thought... 

567
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:07,890
 I've never been happy, not even for a second. 

568
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,420
 But? 

569
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,300
 But no. 

570
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:20,280
 I was so happy today. 

571
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,590
 Oh... 

572
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,530
 Because I'm by your side? 

573
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,180
 What? 

574
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,070
 Why are you smiling? 

575
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,240
 Because I... 

576
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,290
 Because you like me so much? 

577
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:38,590
 If he comes back to me, 

578
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,070
 I'll tell him. 

579
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:49,680
 I'll have to tell him. 

580
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:35,050


581
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,630
â™«  All the seasons we spent together  â™«

582
01:09:54,300 --> 01:10:02,600
â™«  In calm anticipation, time passes  â™«

583
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:08,750
â™«  The moment I thought would never come  â™«

584
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:19,000
â™«  Came to us silently  â™«

585
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:30,120
â™«  Every second of the day, inside my quiet heart  â™«

586
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,600
â™«  Waves rise slowly  â™«

587
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:41,200
â™«  In the gentle sunlight season  â™«

588
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:45,820
â™«  We stood on that road  â™«

589
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:50,570
â™«  Holding on to words we couldn't say  â™«

590
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:56,660
â™«  Our today, soaked in sunlight  â™«

591
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:02,900
â™«  Will remain for a long time, deep inside me  â™«

592
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:09,700
â™«  Every moment, I long for "us"  â™«

593
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:14,700
â™«  I thought it would be only natural  â™«

594
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:25,700
â™«  Like falling leaves, I turned away  â™«

595
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:30,800
â™«  With an unfamiliar expression and tone  â™«

596
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:40,700
â™«  I spoke words I didn't mean the moment I let you go  â™«

597
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:47,300
â™«  In the gentle sunlight season  â™«

598
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,900
â™«  I stayed there for an eternity  â™«

599
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,620
â™«  Holding on to words I couldn't say  â™«

600
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:02,670
â™«  Our today, soaked in sunlight  â™«

601
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:08,870
â™«  Will remain for a long time, deep inside me  â™«

602
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:14,800
â™«  Every moment, I long for "us"  â™«

603
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,100
â™«  How can I say it all?  â™«

604
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,810
â™«  You turned on the lights during dark nights  â™«

605
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:32,950
â™«  You held my hand tightly  â™«

606
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:38,260
â™«  To that day when gentle sunlight shone  â™«

607
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,320
 I will tell him. 

608
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,960
â™«  I want to go back and tell you  â™«

609
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,830
 Thank you, my love. 

610
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,640
 Thank you for coming to me 

611
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,640
 as I am. 

612
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,300
â™«  Can be completed with you  â™«

613
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,800
â™«  In all of time  â™«

614
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,700
â™«  It's "us"  â™«

615
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:19,370
   

616
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,130
 I missed you. 

617
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,030
 Even though you saw me every day? 

618
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,490
 Yes. 

619
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,090
 Although I've seen you at work daily. 

620
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,790
 Me, too. 

621
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,480
 I did miss you every day.
